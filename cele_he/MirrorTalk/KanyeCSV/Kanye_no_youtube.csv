Interviewer,Do you have a favorite Cohen album?
Kanye,New Skin for the Old Ceremony is probably the easiest to listen to the whole way through because it was produced very well. But I think that he's pretty much a track by track guy. You can pull stuff off of any of his albums that's going to be great.
Interviewer,"You also covered David Bowie's ""Five Years"" at the end of your L.A. show. Is he an influence?"
Kanye,Bowie less so just because I've really only gotten into him in the past year. I was just sort of starting to check him out when he died and then I've been getting in deeper ever since.
Interviewer,"If you talk to pop songwriters right now, they'll say that, thanks in large part to streaming, this is a business of singles. But Car Seat Headrest is not a singles band."
Kanye,"We're not really a singles band where we have strong tracks and then weaker tracks. Something that I always strive for in my albums is to have very little lightweight material on the album. There are definitely nights where it'll feel like some songs will get a better reaction, or people will only really be interested in ""Drunk Drivers."" And those are not ideal nights for me. I'd just as soon preserve our legacy as not having a clear hit but rather, a steady stream of music that people are engaged with."
Interviewer,"Despite not wanting to be a singles artist, you're very matter-of-fact about your desire for commercial success."
Kanye,"I think it's a silly put-on in a lot of cases. And in other cases, I think it reflects situation where the personality  takes precedence over the art itself. I didn't grow up listening to obscure bands and deep cuts. I grew up listening to pop music and so that's what I aspire to as a musician. The indie circuit in particular attracts a certain type of artist that has talent but, also, attitude problems. It's a circuit where artists can basically choose exactly how popular they want to be, and, sometimes, they'll choose to alienate people rather than try to make it work on a larger level."
Interviewer,Do you have anyone in mind?
Kanye,"I don't want to criticize artists, but I think like maybe someone like Dan Bejar. I really like a lot of his material, but I remember reading  where he was saying that the first New Pornographers record was shaping up to be a really big deal, so he knew that he didn't want to be involved in that and started his own thing. It's like come on, why can't it be about the music. If it's good music you shouldn't throw it away just for the sake of your own reputation. Growing up I saw the romantic figure of the maverick musician who isn't down to play industry games and will get successful by accident, then spend their careers messing with the heads of the industry and the audience. There was certainly an appeal to that, and then I grew up and started personally encountering artists who had this attitude. And they're shitty people."
Interviewer,"You have expressed admiration for Kanye West and The Life of Pablo. Right before he canceled the rest of his tour, he said some pretty inflammatory stuff about Jay Z, Beyonce and how he had not voted but would have voted for Trump. What do you think of someone like Kanye who is clearly super-talented but can't help but shoot himself in the knee?"
Kanye,"That's a hard case because he's definitely one of those figures. But I also think that talent ultimately can excuse a lot, and he has not yet started sabotaging his own art in service of his personality. He has always used his public actions to feed his art rather than the other way around. And, you know, The Life of Pablo was one of my favorite albums this year. I'm actually finishing up a review of it right now for The Talkhouse. I would not want to be producing an album for him, but I can definitely appreciate the work that he puts into his art."
Interviewer,What's your take on the election of Donald Trump?
Kanye,"I think it was just bad communication the whole way through. People were not listening enough to the other side, and this is what we ended up with. I'm frustrated in general, but the whole Kanye thing now is sort of the latest example of that. I think a lot of people are just looking at the headlines and saying, well, I'm not listening to him anymore. But if you actually look at the transcripts of what  said, there are a lot of very smart things in there. He's not necessarily communicating his ideas in the most effective manner, but sometimes something bad has to happen in order for you to see what you're doing wrong and how to do it right I'm paraphrasing, but that was one of the thoughts he expressed, and that's something that I absolutely agree with."
Interviewer,"When you played The Bowery Ballroom in October, I was impressed by your stagecraft, especially given your age. I've found that a lot of contemporary bands no matter how good the music is are dull in concert."
Kanye,"I also feel like a lot of bands these days don't have a particularly compelling live act. I grew up without that particular notion that a live show was essential to making music. I felt if I couldn't do it well then there was really no point in doing it at all. So for the first four years of Car Seat Headrest there weren't any live shows other than a couple of local college performances. But a couple of things gradually became apparent one is, playing live is necessary if you're going to make a living off making music these days. Also, I started checking out artists who where doing really special things with their live shows. I saw a Swans concert, which kind of blew my mind at the time. It was very polished but also a very heavy thing that transformed the music far beyond what you heard on the album. I was also watching and listening to James Brown, and saw that he was doing stuff on stage that you couldn't do on an album."
Interviewer,That's a good model for a live show.
Kanye,"He was stretching out his songs and improvising in an exciting way. It made me realize that you can do interesting things on stage and make it worthwhile and different from the album. So, after college, I spent the next year forming a band and crafting a performance to an extent. We're still in a fairly basic stage of live performance there's not a lot of flash to it but it's about working as a unit. We've gotten very tight as a unit at this point. It's exciting to be on stage and playing with these guys. We're always changing up the set list and how we play the songs to keep ourselves interested."
Interviewer,Do you call any audibles?
Kanye,"Sometimes. Set lists are something that definitely change night to night. I'll wait until I get to the venue before I make one just because certain types of venues are better for certain sorts of songs. Pulling out a long epic piece like ""The Ballad of the Costa Concordia"" doesn't necessarily work at smaller venues. You want a more theatrical stage for that. So, I figure out what we're going to play at sound check. But even then, the audience can change things. Usually, for an encore, we'll wing it and do what we want to do. But this tour in particular we've gotten things down to a more exact science. We're not switching up stuff quite so much just because we've got a good sequence of songs going. Sometimes, it's good to be doing the same thing long enough that you can explore within the song."
Interviewer,There are no real lulls in the show. You tend to play one song into another.
Kanye,I feel like our weak point is audience interaction. I still haven't gotten over a certain elemental shyness. And it's definitely hard to come up with things to say on stage. So I think it's kind of an easy way to cheat and when I can see that one song can lead into another.
Interviewer,"Reddit and 4Chan played roles in your success, and yet, as you've connected with a larger audience, they've also been the source of some very poisonous posts about you."
Kanye,Oh yeah.
Interviewer,Do you read that stuff? Does it affect you?
Kanye,"I kind of had to read it back when it was the only thing that was talking about me. I can't argue that 4chan, in particular, did help during a certain period of my career.  grew to the point where it sort of tipped over into the official music industry."
Interviewer,Fans become possessive of their favorite artists when they grow beyond cult status. I don't think it's specific to 4chan or Reddit.
Kanye,"Teens of Denial was intended to be a separation from that whole culture because, as I said, it was a very negative one. There were certain factions of people who, I could tell, were latching on to my music for specific reasons that weren't a part of why I wanted people to be listening to my music. Like, 'It's sad and lo-fi.' I don't intend to make lo-fi records forever, so, I'm sorry about that, guy. I made Teens of Denial for myself a straightforward rock album and the reaction was better than I imagined. I thought there might have been more backlash from longtime fans who felt that it didn't live up to the old work, but the reaction has been kind of overwhelmingly positive. Maybe now there's a bit of a backlash, but it's a bit late. We're already on to the next thing and though it can irritate me momentarily, it's not something that's going to affect me."
Interviewer,What is the next thing?
Kanye,"Well, for one thing we're recording as a four piece. We only did one song like that for Teens of Denial. It's an approach that blends what we did with Teens of Denial, which was a very straightforward studio approach where we record the songs as a whole and then mix them and then it's done. And combining that with how I'd been recording before then which was more piecemeal you know, putting things together on the computer. I've got the best of both worlds. We're very tight as a band and can lay down these great basic tracks for the songs. And then I have a lot of material to mess with on my own and build something on top of that."
Interviewer,"Are you listening to your bandmates ideas, or is it a my-way-or-the-highway situation?"
Kanye,"Well, right now I've still got a backlog of me-directed stuff that we're working through. But at the same time there are definitely ideas being generated by the band, which I would like to work with."
Interviewer,You studied religion in college.
Kanye,"Yeah, I minored in it."
Interviewer,"You mention God and heaven quite a bit on Teens of Denial. Do you subscribe to any sort of religious or spiritual construct, whether it's Christianity or Buddhism?"
Kanye,"I don't subscribe to any particular religion, but it's always something that's interested me, although it's hard to put a finger on how that applied to my life. In college, it was an academic interest, but anything that you study is hopefully going to be interesting to you in more ways than an academic one. For me, it's learning how mankind deals with its problems. I think that any religion at its core has fairly good rules to follow about life, and I don't feel a need to subscribe to one over the other as much as just trying to internalize as much of it as possible."
Interviewer,"One of my favorite lines from Teens of Denial is on ""Cosmic Hero"": ""I will go to heaven / You won't go to heaven/ I will go to heaven /I won't see you there."" It's judgmental in a very funny way."
Kanye,The whole album is an example of improperly internalized religious thought. I think it's important to note that the ideas expressed on the album represent a thought process. There are impulsive moments of judgment that aren't necessarily the conclusions that I would want to draw .
Interviewer,In addition to recording your own stuff you're producing and mixing for other bands. I listened to an interview where you expressed admiration for the Elephant 6 collective. Are you trying to create a similar ad-hoc community of musicians?
Kanye,"At this point it would be a little naïve of me to be trying imitate the Elephant 6 model. These are artists I wish success for and hope I can provide a starting point for. Most recently I mixing for a band called Gold Connections. They got signed to Fat Possum this year and will be putting this thing out early next year. I knew the band's lead guy Will Marsh I knew in college, and I actually played drums in Gold Connections for one semester. We recorded the songs he had at the time, but he didn't end up putting them out. So I spent most of October remixing them. I did a better job because I had better equipment and more of a legit studio setup. I wasn't just using headphones. I had nice speakers to work off of."
Interviewer,What type of producer are you?
Kanye,I sort of have a heavy hand in the making of the song. The ideal relationship is kind of the artist has the piece and they sort of don't know what the whole structure of it is going to be because if I can hear it then I can sort of get cool ideas for what a larger structure for it would be. So I've done a lot of work with Whiting Brothers and with Naked Days which is my friend Degnan  from Virginia.
Interviewer,Would I be correct in thinking that your lyric-writing usually starts with something you're thinking or feeling about yourself?
Kanye,"Teens of Denial is an album that does do that a lot, but that's not necessarily my favorite way of creating. I think it's more a case of I'll see or react to something that's not necessarily a part of me right away. Or maybe I see a reflection of myself in something and then it grows into something that I can work on. I was never really interested in solely political or social music where the singer is condemning or supporting stuff, and there's nothing personal to it. But lately I have been interested in the idea of sort of blending the two models where it's coming from someone personally and it's also speaking to specific social things. That's one thing that Kanye is really good at. He addresses current events all the time in his songs -but you never forget who's singing about them."
Interviewer,I listened to a podcast in which you talked about meeting Adam Driver. Are a lot of celebrities and other musicians reaching out to you?
Kanye,"No that's still a rarity, but I did meet Oscar Isaac at Bowery Ballroom. He popped into the green room. We also got an email from someone who said he was Danger Mouse but it was hard to tell if it was really Danger Mouse. So I just said, I'll put you on the guest list if you let us know when you're going to be near a show, and then I never heard anything back. So it might not have been Danger Mouse."
Interviewer,ON HIS NATURAL POLITICAL PARTY.
Kanye,I would run as a Republican if Trump wasn't there. I will run as an independent if Trump is there.
Interviewer,ON HIS PREVIOUS SUPPORT FOR TRUMP.
Kanye,Trump is the closest president we've had in years to allowing God to still be part of the conversation.
Interviewer,ON HIS MAGA HAT MOMENT.
Kanye,"One of the main reasons I wore the red hat as a protest to the segregation of votes in the Black community. Also, other than the fact that I like Trump hotels and the saxophones in the lobby."
Interviewer,ON DISCUSSIONS ON RACE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.
Kanye,"One time I talked to Jared Kushner, who was saying, 'We don't have Black leaders, we just have hustlers.' Why? Because they killed all the Black leaders."
Interviewer,ON DEMOCRATS.
Kanye,"That is a form of racism and white supremacy and white control to say that all Black people need to be Democrat and to assume that me running is me splitting the vote. All of that information is being charged up on social media platforms by Democrats. And Democrats used to tell me, the same Democrats have threatened me. . . . The reason why this is the first day I registered to vote is because I was scared. I was told that if I voted on Trump my music career would be over. I was threatened into being in one party. I was threatened as a celebrity into being in one party. I was threatened as a Black man into the Democratic party. And that's what the Democrats are doing, emotionally, to my people. Threatening them to the point where this white man can tell a Black man if you don't vote for me, you're not Black."
Interviewer,ON HOW THE RACE WILL BE DECIDED.
Kanye,"Let's see if the appointing is at 2020 or if it's 2024, because God appoints the president. If I win in 2020 then it was God's appointment. If I win in 2024 then that was God's appointment."
Interviewer,ON THE CORONAVIRUS CURE.
Kanye,We pray. We pray for the freedom. It's all about God. We need to stop doing things that make God mad.
Interviewer,ON VACCINES.
Kanye,"It's so many of our children that are being vaccinated and paralyzed. . . . So when they say the way we're going to fix Covid is with a vaccine, I'm extremely cautious. That's the mark of the beast. They want to put chips inside of us, they want to do all kinds of things, to make it where we can't cross the gates of heaven. I'm sorry when I say they, the humans that have the Devil inside them. And the sad thing is that, the saddest thing is that we all won't make it to heaven, that there'll be some of us that do not make it. Next question."
Interviewer,ON DECIDING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
Kanye,"It's when I was being offered the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Awards at MTV. I remember being at my mom's house, my mother-in-law, because my house was being worked on, she calls me 'son' and I call her 'mom,' I was in the shower, thinking, I write raps in the shower. It hit me to say, 'You're going to run for president,' and I started laughing hysterically, I was, like, this is the best, I'm going to go out there and they're going to think I'm going to do these songs and do this for entertainment, how rigged awards shows are, and then say I'm going to run for president. And I just laughed in the shower, I don't know for how long, but that's the moment it hit me."
Interviewer,ON HIS FOREIGN POLICY.
Kanye,"I haven't developed it yet. I'm focused on protecting America, first, with our great military. Let's focus on ourselves first."
Interviewer,ON ABORTION.
Kanye,I am pro-life because I'm following the word of the Bible.
Interviewer,ON BEING A POLITICAL NOVICE.
Kanye,"I have to say with all humility that as a man, I don't have all of the pieces in the puzzle. As I speak to you for what a political campaign, a political walk, as I told you, because I'm not running, I'm walking. I'm not running, we the people are walking. We're not running anymore, we're not running, we're not excited, we are energized. Someone can say, 'Hey, I got a brand new car for you, it's across the street,' and you get so excited you run across the street and get hit by a car trying to run to your new car. That's how they control the Black community, through emotions, they get us excited, we're so excited, but then for 400 years the change doesn't truly happen."
Interviewer,"ON THE NEED FOR RACIAL HEALING, AFTER GEORGE FLOYD."
Kanye,"Well, God has already started the healing/This conversation alone is healing and revealing/We all need to start praying and kneeling . . . another bar after that, but when a rhyme comes together I'm going to complete it, not inside the lines created by organizations that we know as our reality. The schools, the infrastructure was made for us to not truly be all we can be but to be just good enough to work for the corporations that designed the school systems. We're tearing that up, what we'll do is we're not going to tear up the Constitution, what we will do is amend."
Interviewer,ON BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
Kanye,"Oh, one other thing, Black History Month. That is torture porn because when that comes up what we do is we see, and by the way, if I get that vibe, that's the process and we are going to a beautiful, uplifting, fun, creative process as a people, as America collectively, and show the world how great we are. So here we go. Black History Month. Every year they gotta remind us about the fact that we couldn't vote, 'they' meaning white supremacy construct, and I said that with the CT at the end, I knew what was I was talking about . . . Our minds are so much more infinite than what's coming across TikTok or Instagram, what's trying to influence our children and the next generation of who we are."
Interviewer,ON HAVING COVID-19.
Kanye,"Chills, shaking in the bed, taking hot showers, looking at videos telling me what I'm supposed to do to get over it. I remember someone had told me Drake had the coronavirus and my response was Drake can't be sicker than me!"
Interviewer,ON RUNNING IN 2020.
Kanye,"God just gave me the clarity and said it's time. You know I was out there, ended up in the hospital, people were calling me crazy. I'm not crazy. Between all of the influences and the positions that we can be put in as musicians, you go on tour, you put out all these albums, and you look up and you don't have any money in your account. It can drive you crazy, through all of that I was looking crazy because it wasn't the time. Now it's time. And we're not going crazy, we're going Yeezy, it's a whole 'notha level now. N-O-T-H-A."
Interviewer,ON JOE BIDEN.
Kanye,"A lot of times just like political parties they feel all Blacks have to be Democrat. This man, Joe Biden, said if you don't vote for me, then you are not Black. Well, act like we didn't hear that? We act like we didn't hear that man say that? That man said that. It's a rap. We gonna walk, all the people. Jay-Z said it best. For the other candidates, I just gracefully suggest y'all bow out, Trump and Biden, gracefully bow out. It's God's country, we are doing everything in service to God, nobody but God no more. I am in service of our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ, and I put everything I get on the line to serve God."
Interviewer,ON DEVELOPING POLICIES.
Kanye,"I don't know if I would use the word 'policy' for the way I would approach things. I don't have a policy when I went to Nike and designed Yeezy and went to Louis and designed a Louis Vuitton at the same time. It wasn't a policy, it was a design. We need to innovate the design to be able to free the mind at this time."
Interviewer,ON THE WAKANDA MANAGEMENT MODEL.
Kanye,"A lot of Africans do not like the movie  and representation of themselves in.. Wakanda. But I'm gonna use the framework of Wakanda right now because it's the best explanation of what our design group is going to feel like in the White House.. That is a positive idea: you got Kanye West, one of the most powerful humans, I'm not saying the most because you got a lot of alien-level superpowers and it's only collectively that we can set it free. Let's get back to Wakanda . . . like in the movie in Wakanda when the king went to visit that lead scientist to have the shoes wrap around her shoes. Just the amount of innovation that can happen, the amount of innovation in medicine, like big pharma, we are going to work, innovate, together. This is not going to be some Nipsey Hussle being murdered, they're doing a documentary, we have so many soldiers that die for our freedom, our freedom of information, that there is a cure for AIDS out there, there is going to be a mix of big pharma and holistic."
Interviewer,ON PRAYER IN SCHOOLS.
Kanye,"Reinstate in God's state, in God's country, the fear and love of God in all schools and organizations and you chill the fear and love of everything else. So that was a plan by the Devil to have our kids committing suicide at an all-time high by removing God, to have murders in Chicago at an all-time high because the human beings working for the Devil removed God and prayer from the schools. That means more drugs, more murders, more suicide."
Interviewer,ON TAXES.
Kanye,I haven't done enough research on that yet. I will research that with the strongest experts that serve God and come back with the best solution. And that will be my answer for anything that I haven't researched. I have the earplug in and I'm going to use that earplug.
Interviewer,ON CHINA.
Kanye,"When I become president, let me make some promises, the NBA will open all the way back up from Nigeria to Nanchang and the world will see the greatest athletes play. The world will experience the change in their element. The money is gonna come back. I love China. I love China. It's not China's fault that disease. It's not the Chinese people's fault. They're God's people also. I love China. It changed my life. It changed my perspective, it gave me such a wide perspective. My mom as an English professor taught English in China when I was in fifth grade."
Interviewer,ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
Kanye,'Thou shalt not kill.' I'm against the death penalty.
Interviewer,ON POLICE KILLINGS.
Kanye,"One of my to-do lists is to end police brutality. The police are people, too. To end laws that don't make sense. Like, in the George Floyd case, there was a Black guy that went to jail and it was his first day on the force. So if it's your first day on the force and it's your training day, and this OG-accredited cop with 18 violations already starts filing out, are you going to jump in front of that person and lose your job that same day? Especially in this climate when 40,000 people lost their jobs? This man was put in a position where, and also he probably didn't realize that the cop was going to take it that far, he probably was so scared, in shock, paralyzed, like so many Black people. I'm one of the few Black people that would speak openly like this."
Interviewer,ON HIS OTHER PRIORITIES.
Kanye,"Clean up the chemicals. In our deodorant, in our toothpaste, there are chemicals that affect our ability to be of service to God."
Interviewer,ON HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.
Kanye,"Well my second album is called Late Registration. I got a rap . . . The other thing is, my campaign is Kanye West YES, not YEP, not YEAH. YES. YES. YES. . . . When I'm president, let's also have some fun. Let's get past all the racism conversation, let's empower people with 40 acres and a mule, let's give some land, that's the plan."
Interviewer,Today we are speaking with Kanye West about his 2020 Presidential campaign. Thank you so much for coming in today Kanye.
Kanye,"Yeah man. Thank you for having me. I had some free time on my hands that I didn't expect to have today, which is unfortunate."
Interviewer,Oh wow. Sounds like it is a miracle we get to speak today. Did you have a fun little Friendsgiving planned for something? What were you supposed to do today?
Kanye,I was supposed to be in the White House. I didn't expect to have time today other than maybe some press conferences or something. Maybe shake hands with the losers. I don't know. I just didn't expect to have time for something like Realible World News.
Interviewer,"Oh I see. You really thought you might have won. I figured you just did this for publicity or attention or something. Anyways what made you believe you could have actually won? You were not on the ballot in every state, and you also announced your run incredibly late. Can you have me from insight into this thought process?"
Kanye,"Well it is very simple. God told me I was going to win. God is never wrong. I know it looked unlikely, but I also knew he couldn't possible be wrong. If God says I am destined to win, I am destined to win. I made sure I was free to visit the White House today regardless."
Interviewer,So God told you that you would win? It sounds like God isn't very good at bets.
Kanye,"He is very good at taking bets. Everything I have is because of God. It was my own errors that caused me to lose. You see, God wasn't wrong. I was wrong. When God told me I would be President of The United States, he meant in 2024. I rushed the process, and I shouldn't have. I was just too excited. 2020 was not the election I was supposed to win. God wanted me to learn the ropes now, so I can win in 2024. He just works that way man."
Interviewer,"That is very inspiring Kanye. I think you already have my vote next election. Now can you give me some insight on your platform? What exactly are your policies based around? I haven't been able to find much throughout my research, and you don't belong to a major party. It seems like I am unable to base my opinions of you upon some sort of generic grouping."
Kanye,"I am all about the Birthday Party. America is supposed to be one giant party, and it will finally happen in 2024. Left wing or right wing, everyone has fun at a birthday party. It is nearly impossible not to have fun at one of those things. Now imagine if God was invited and attended this party. That would be the perfect party. This is exactly what I want to do in 2024."
Interviewer,"Wow that told me absolutely nothing when it comes to your policies, but it sure sounds fun and exciting. You have my vote for sure."
Kanye,Hey thanks man. I hope everyone else can join the Birthday Party soon. I think we have a lot to offer.
Interviewer,Yeah like party favors.
Kanye,Yeah exactly. See you get it.
Interviewer,"I love your enthusiasm for the 2024 Presidential election, but that is so far away. Let's back up a bit to last night. There are memes going around showing you alone watching the results on television. Did you have a rough night? Also, were you actually alone throughout this defeat?"
Kanye,"Of course I wasn't alone, that was just a picture. People do stuff like that for laughs and clout man."
Interviewer,Oh! That is great news. I am glad you weren't alone. Who was with you through out this anxiety inducing night?
Kanye,God.
Interviewer,Oh.
Kanye,"God was with me all not. He just wasn't pictured. God was smiling and in a good mood. I knew he knew something I didn't quite understand. He wasn't upset I lost. I thought at the time he was just glad Trump was in the lead, but then it hit me. God knows my time is coming next year. The results of the 2020 Presidential election doesn't matter to him. I will be President of the United States as planned in 2024."
Interviewer,Wow God sounds like he is a huge fan of you.
Kanye,"That is what our relationship is like. We just bounce off of each other and play off of each other. Like in the studio I will have this great idea, and he will shoot me a new line that backs it up so well. Sometimes God has a good lyric and I like create a flow that just perfects it. God and I are both fans of each other and our chemistry is amazing."
Interviewer,"That is incredible. We are all out of time today, but do you have any announcements in regards to the 2024 Presidential election?"
Kanye,Actually I do. I would like to announce my Vice President for the 2024 Presidential run today.
Interviewer,Wow. I feel so lucky to be the first to break the news. Who will be your Vice President and running mate Kanye?
Kanye,God. Kanye/God will be the greatest match up in the history of the United States of America. We hope to see much success.
Interviewer,Holy cow. God has to be the best running mate someone could ever hope for. You totally have my vote Kanye. I wouldn't want to anger God!
Kanye,Man I wouldn't want to anger God either. Hopefully the general public feels the same way.
Interviewer,I sure hope so too Kanye. You are a cool dude. I anticipate your 2024 Presidential run.
Kanye,Thank you. See ya.
Interviewer,"It's hard to make beauty. People often try, and more often than not, everything starts to feel sort of cheap or kitsch. But you express yourself in a way that's beautiful. You can sing from the heart and have it connect and translate, which is a huge thing for an artist to be able to do. So my first question is"
Kanye,"I think I started to approach time in a different way after the accident. Before I was more willing to give my time to people and things that I wasn't as interested in because somehow I allowed myself to be brainwashed into being forced to work with other people or on other projects that I had no interest in. So simply, the accident gave me the opportunity to do what I really wanted to do. I was a music producer, and everyone was telling me that I had no business becoming a rapper, so it gave me the opportunity to tell everyone, ""Hey, I need some time to recover."" But during that recovery period, I just spent all my time honing my craft and making The College Dropout. Without that period, there would have been so many phone calls and so many people putting pressure on me from every direction, so many people I somehow owed something to, and I would have never had the time to do what I wanted to."
Interviewer,"So basically, it allowed you to focus, and you realized at a certain point that it was now or never, and that you had to do it now."
Kanye,"Yes. It gave me perspective on life, that it was really now or 100 percent never. I think that people don't make the most of their lives. So, you know, for me, right now it seems like it's the beginning of me rattling the cage, of making some people nervous. And people are strategically trying to do things to mute my voice in some way or make me look like I'm a lunatic or pinpoint the inaccuracies in my grammar to somehow take away from the overall message of what I'm saying .."
Interviewer,"Well, unfortunately, that is indicative of what a lot of black performers and leaders have had to go through. People will often try to undermine them in a way to take away their power. You know, when I saw you perform, I was like, ""This guy is gonna die on stage."" When I saw you play, it felt like that, like it could be the last performance that you give. There's an incredible intensity to your performances."
Kanye,"As my grandfather would say, ""Life is a performance."" I'm giving all that I have in this life. I'm opening up my notebook and I'm saying everything in there out loud. A lot of people are very sacred with their ideas, and there is something to protecting yourself in that way, but there's also something to idea sharing, or being the person who makes the mistake in public so people can study that."
Interviewer,It can be hard to take those kinds of risks as an artist if you're thinking about tomorrow.
Kanye,"Well, all we have is today. You know, the past is gone, and tomorrow is not promised."
Interviewer,"Talk to me a little bit about Yeezus. The album before that one, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, was a phenomenal success. Did that wear on your mind when you went in to make Yeezus?"
Kanye,"Yeah! So I just had to throw it all in the trash. I had to not follow any of the rules because there was no way to match up to the previous album. Dark Fantasy was the first time you heard that collection of sonic paintings in that way. So I had to completely destroy the landscape and start with a new story. Dark Fantasy was the fifth installment of a collection that included the four albums before it. It's kind of the ""Luke, I am your father"" moment. Yeezus, though, was the beginning of me as a new kind of artist. Stepping forward with what I know about architecture, about classicism, about society, about texture, about synesthesia, the ability to see sound, and the way everything is everything and all these things combine, and then starting from scratch with Yeezus .. That's one of the reasons why I didn't want to use the same formula of starting the album with a track like ""Blood on the Leaves,"" and having that Nina Simone sample up front that would bring everyone in, using postmodern creativity where you kind of lean on something that people are familiar with and comfortable with to get their attention. I actually think the most uncomfortable sound on Yeezus is the sound that the album starts with, which is the new version of what would have been called radio static. It's the sonic version of what internet static would be, that's how I would describe that opening. It's Daft Punk sound. It was just like that moment of being in a restaurant and ripping the tablecloth out from under all the glasses. That's what ""On Sight"" does sonically."
Interviewer,"So Yeezus was about throwing away what people want you to do, the so-called ""success"", so you could move on to something else."
Kanye,"It's the only way that I can survive. The risk for me would be in not taking one, that's the only thing that's really risky for me. I live inside, and I've learned how to swim through backlash, or maintain through the current of a negative public opinion and create from that and come through it and spring forth to completely surprise everyone, to satisfy all believers and annihilate all doubters. And at this point, it's just fun."
Interviewer,"But there must have been moments of doubt or depression or sadness. I mean, with what happened after the Taylor Swift incident  and all the negativity that came your way as the result of that. How did you deal with it all mentally, physically, and spiritually?"
Kanye,"It's funny that you would say ""mentally, physically, spiritually"" because my answer before you even said that was going to be ""god, sex, and alcohol.""."
Interviewer,People can get lost in all of those things. So how did you arrive where you are now after coming through that period?
Kanye,"Well, I don't have an addictive personality, so that means that I can lean on what might be someone else's vice just enough to make it through to the next day. You know, just enough religion, a half-cup of alcohol with some ice in it and a nice chaser, and then .."
Interviewer,A lot of sex.
Kanye,"Yeah, a lot of sex. And then I'd make it to the next week."
Interviewer,So was there a moment when Yeezus all kind of came together as a work?
Kanye,"I've heard people say stuff about how a work is just taken out of your hands, and there were times .. I remember that we were shooting the ""New Slaves"" video before I'd even finished the second verse. We were on our third shoot day, and I was in the studio still finishing it because my lyrics aren't written beforehand. It's very important to me that they're completely in sync with what's happening in society at that time, that they're very timeless, but very up to date .."
Interviewer,"How important is that for you, to be current?"
Kanye,"I don't use a lot of current-affairs names, I've used them seldomly, but I feel like it's just a current itself, a wave that I'm surfing. There is no sport without the wave, so I have to wait for it. If the waves are high, then we're gonna have a fun day. If the waves are low, then you just stay on the beach."
Interviewer,How do you approach the visuals?
Kanye,"Well, I'm a trained fine artist. I went to art school from the time I was 5 years old. I was, like, a prodigy out of Chicago. I'd been in national competitions from the age of 14. I got three scholarships to art schools, to St. Xavier, to the American Academy of Art, and to the Art Institute of Chicago, and I went to the American Academy of Art. So the joke that I've actually played on everyone is that the entire time, I've actually just been a fine artist. I just make sonic paintings, and these sonic paintings have led me to become whatever people think of when you say ""Kanye West."" Madonna, I think, is the greatest visual musical artist that we've ever had. If you look at her photo log, the photographers that she was able to work with throughout her career framed her in the proper way. It was the proper context. It was that visual that made sure that everything was gonna cut through in a certain way. I mean, you know as much as anyone how important the visuals are. So I like to collaborate with different masters, whether it's George Condo or Nick Knight or Takashi Murakami, on the visuals that are connected to the pieces, and just have a simple high school conversation with whoever I'm working with and bring our thoughts together, but ultimately what we do is through the lens of that collaborator, and it ends up being their final hand. You know, you can go to a bunch of people who say, ""Hey, I want to make a video based off of these white-trash T-shirts."" But ""Bound 2"" is Nick Knight's take on those white-trash T-shirts, and if I went to five other artists, they would all do it in other ways. So I think that's part of the beauty of life. It's more about the art of conversation, the companionship, the friendships, and the quality of life that you get out of working, it's about the creative process even more than the final product. I think there's something kind of depressing about a product being final, because the only time a product is really final is when you're in a casket."
Interviewer,"I wanted to talk to you about the video for ""Bound 2."" As you know, my daughter is a huge fan of both yours and Kim's, and I saw that video and thought, ""This is great. Okay, interesting, fantastic."" And then I heard about all of this controversy that came to surround it, which I had to sort of scratch my head about. I mean, call me silly, but when I saw that video for ""Bound 2,"" I just thought to myself, ""It's just a video. It's obviously a sort of romantic video of him and his partner, and it's a bit tongue-in-cheek.""."
Kanye,Yeah. I think all that stuff around it is just that
Interviewer,"To me, ""Bound 2"" looked like a Prince video. Aesthetically, it had that kind of feel. It wouldn't have looked out of place if it were part of Purple Rain ."
Kanye,"Well, I'd be biased to think that the community of Geminis is the most consistently in tune with what their spirit is telling them to do or why they have breath in their lungs. But I do think that creative Geminis, Tupac, Biggie, Prince, Miles Davis, all being Geminis, have, throughout history, been really in tune with those things. You know, some different friends of mine have been showing me these interviews that Tupac did and how they're very simple and to the point. I watched them, and one of the things that Tupac kept saying is that he wanted thugs to be recognized. Now Jay-Z is a multi-hundred-millionaire who came from the streets, so Tupac's mission, in a way, has been realized. But my mission is very different from Tupac's, and I'm not Tupac. But I think that when I compare myself to Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, Howard Hughes, or whoever, it's because I'm trying to give people a little bit of context to the possibilities that are in front of me, as opposed to putting me in the rap category that the Grammys has put me in. In no way do I want to be the next any one of them. But I am the first me. So I only mention those other names to try to give people a little bit of context."
Interviewer,All of those names evoke a sense of power and money to some extent. Is that what it means to you to be recognized
Kanye,"I want the power to create what is in my mind. That's my dream. I want to be able to have a thought or an idea and bring it into reality. I want to be able to walk into a gym and say, ""I think this gym could be better if Axel Vervoordt  worked on it."" I want to be able to say, ""I think school could be better if a director did all of the programming, and there were screens the size of the walls, and instead of kids being asked to get off their iPhones, they were encouraged to use them so they can move forward faster as human beings instead of being held back from the future with dated curriculums."" If I want to design a product, or if I think of a new way for us to view films, then I want to be able to do it. And what happened was that when we made Watch the Throne, it was such an accomplishment, and I had a bit of money in my account, so I just started chasing other dreams. I did two fashion shows in one year, at one of them, I had go-karts that people could ride. I also shot a film in ""surround vision,"" where I had seven screens, three in front of the audience, one above, one below, one to the left, one to the right. This is after designing Watch the Throne, and I was putting my money towards it. I put the amount of free income that I could put into it, which went into the millions. I went around and showed people what I'd done and said, ""Hey, I made Watch the Throne, I made this amount of music for the past 10 years, I have this level of visuals, this level of communication, I can sell this many albums, and I also have these new inventions. Will anybody help me out?"" I met with 30 billionaires, 30 companies, and basically everyone said, ""Fuck you."" I said, ""How could this happen? How could not one person want to invest in these different ideas?"" I mean, if I grouped up with three guys in a basement and started a new tech company that was very similar to another tech company down the street, but it just so happened that I had a few more followers than the other guy, then I could get all the investment in the world and value my company at a certain amount. But then I have another idea and the entire world will say fuck you? Now, that is about money and power .."
Interviewer,"How do you think your parents influenced you and your thinking? Your mom was a college professor, and your dad was involved in the black power movement, right?"
Kanye,"Yeah. Both of my parents were educated, and both of them were always telling me about the manipulation of the media. My mom had books she would read to me. My bedtime stories dealt with things like the nose being knocked off the Sphinx, this is the type of bedtime story I would hear when I was in fifth grade. Of course, my father is also educated, Christian, once a Black Panther, a militant black, he understood what it meant to be discriminated against because he was black. He also understood what it meant to be discriminated against by black people because he talked white. He was very keen and sensitive to this at all times. So if we take it back to the days of what the media calls ""meltdowns"", which I don't call meltdowns at all, I call them ""turn-ups"", at things like the MTV Video Music Awards .. I don't even think Justin  had an album out at that time, and I had Graduation out. It had just come out, with the songs ""Stronger"" and ""Good Life."" And somehow they talked me into performing in a suite at the Palms, and they promised me that no one else in direct competition was performing on the main stage. Then the next thing I know, they closed the show with Justin."
Interviewer,"Of course, your mother passed away all too soon. How did her passing affect you?"
Kanye,"It's funny, because I think about .. You know, the sketchbook, the train of my ideas, is named after her. It's called Donda. And it's amazing because my grandfather, who just passed away this year, was named Portwood, and he had the sensibility, as a Southern black man out of Oklahoma, to name his daughter Donda. And then Donda had the sensibility to name her son Kanye. How futuristic and worldly are both of those names? And then the teachings and the confidence that was instilled by my grandfather into my mother, and from my mother into me, which will now, of course, be instilled by me into North, will create the best winter coat against doubters and dream-killers ever made."
Interviewer,What does love mean to you right now at this moment in time?
Kanye,"Love .. Well, if someone has got all the money in the world, they'd still want love."
Interviewer,"But now you've got a situation in your life where you've got a daughter, which is a different kind of love, an unconditional love that maybe you only get to have in another way with your parents. What has that experience been like so far?"
Kanye,"I think I have to experience it for another few years to be able to give you an opinion. It's all brand new, how it feels to be a father. There are some things that I understand, certain things that I don't understand, certain things that I like to get off my chest in interviews, certain things that I want to talk about. But when we talk about love, I don't have an answer. All I can say is that I'm happy I have it."
Interviewer,"I hate to put a stereotype on any profession, but there seems to be a certain loneliness associated with being a musician. Do you ever feel lonely?"
Kanye,"Well, I've got my astronaut family. You know, becoming famous is like being catapulted into space, sometimes without a space suit. We've seen so many people combust, suffocate, get lost in all these different things. But to have an anchor of other astronauts and to make a little space family .. I mean, it's not like I'm the guy in The Hunger Games  begging for people to like me. I'm almost the guy with the least amount of ""likes."" I wanted a family. So god gives you opportunities, and you make sacrifices for something that's greater."
Interviewer,"You know, when you talk about these people and these companies not wanting to partner with you to do what you want to do, it sounds very similar to what was happening when you were starting off as an artist, where people didn't think that you could do it. But you eventually did."
Kanye,"It's been exactly the same. Whatever I put my focus on .. I don't want to put out a promissory note of having ultimate success at anything I'm thinking of doing, but my success will be in getting things out there. You put new ideas into the world, whether that first idea is extremely successful or an early adopter goes on to make it successful, or it's that third rendition that finally works. As a celebrity, I have an opportunity to make a living at being the spokesperson for the third or fourth rendition of a thought-promoting something that has already been proven. The problem is that I like to be the inventor, I'm the person who works on the concept, who invents new thoughts, who brings new ideas into the universe. I'm not the guy who works on selling the idea, I'm not Vanna White for the new Hyundai. I am the guy who works on the concept for the car. So success, for me, is in having the ability to get my ideas out there."
Interviewer,"You've been on the scene as an artist now for 10 years, which is impressive, given the level of interest and artistry that you've managed to sustain in your work. In the process, you've become incredibly influential. So you talk about doing all of these other things, which is great, but there's really no amount of money that could make you more influential than you are now. So my question is"
Kanye,"Well, influence isn't my definition of success, it's a by-product of my creativity. I just want to create more. I would be fine with making less money. I actually spend the majority of my money attempting to create more things. Not buying things or solidifying myself or trying to make my house bigger, or trying to show people how many Louis Vuitton bags I can get, or buying my way to a good seat at the table. My definition of success, again, is getting my ideas out there. The first company that has really given me a shot is Adidas. They did the deal .. I mean, Damon Dash did the deal, at the end of the day. He signed Kanye West 12 years ago. What does that mean now? What does that mean to music? You know, people say things about creativity and jobs and every 10 years, blah, blah, blah. But I don't have a desire to not continue making music. When I left Chicago and moved to New York, it wasn't because I didn't love Chicago; it was because I needed to go to New York. So right now, I've got other innovations and other thoughts that I want to pursue. As I was saying earlier, I create like a 3-year-old. When you're 3, you wake up one morning and say, ""I wanna ride a bike."" And then the next day, you wake up and say, ""I wanna draw."" I don't want to be in a situation where, because I was good enough at riding a bike one day, then that's all I can do for the rest of my life. I mean, you know firsthand, being a fine artist and then moving into the Hollywood space .. You know, I say to Renzo Rosso, Bernard Arnault, and François-Henri Pinault, the heads of Diesel, LVMH, and Kering, ""Come to my show and look at the mountain I made. Look at these 20,000 people screaming, and then tell me I don't deserve to design a T-shirt."" If I want to design a T-shirt in my lifetime, then please help me do it! People say, ""Well, why don't you just do it on your own?"" Are you telling me to sew every single T-shirt? People say, ""Why do you antagonize the high-end companies and your fan base?"" and this and that. But what I'm saying is that in working with partners like Louis Vuitton and Zanotti and Balmain and Fendi like I have, and please forgive me for using film as a metaphor because I hate when people do that with music, I feel like it's a better form of film that I'm working with when I work with them. I'm working with better cameras. I'm working with better editors .. Steve, please forgive me because I feel like it's super-patronizing whenever someone does an analogy or a metaphor that relates to the field that you currently work in."
Interviewer,"No, not at all."
Kanye,"I'm sorry. I find it super-insulting whenever people give me a music analogy. It's like, ""You know, I would have understood it if you just said it in English. You didn't have to put it in music terms, like you somehow know more about music or I would understand it better if it were in music terms."" So please forgive me for putting that in film terms. I mean, talking about film to Steve McQueen .."
Interviewer,"haha I grew up in Europe, in London, and you grew up in the States. When was the first time you came to Europe? Do you remember?"
Kanye,"I think it was when Damon Dash had me and some other Roc-A-Fella artists come over. He stressed the importance of connecting with London, especially. Then we went to France, and I hated France when we first went there. Now, of course, I love it. But at the time, there was a rapper out of Chicago who wanted me to show up at some event of his, and he was trying to threaten me in some way physically if I didn't show up because we had done a record together. And Dame Dash had to man-up on the situation and apply a bit of gangster to have them fall back, just for me to be able to get on that first flight to London."
Interviewer,"It's interesting how when Malcolm X ventured out of the United States for the first time, he went to Europe, he went to Africa, he went to Mecca, and then, when he came back to America, he realized that, to some extent, for him, it wasn't about black or white, it was about people. In talking to you now, it seems like you feel the same way, that it's never really been about race for you, but at the same time, it has very much been about that, if you know what I mean."
Kanye,"My mission is about what I want to create. It's for people, for humanity. It's about things that can make the world better. I'm not saying that I'm going to make a better world; I'm just saying that I will provide some things that will help, and my glass ceiling that I'm facing is based on my color. You know, I was looking at some cheesy-ass MTV videos a while ago, and it was so funny because it was like, ""Wow, these videos are pre-Michael Jackson"", and people forget that Michael Jackson had to fight to get on MTV because he was considered to be an urban artist. This was, like, the greatest pop star of all time, and they told him, ""We're not gonna play your video because it doesn't fit our format.""."
Interviewer,"It actually stunned me to find out that you've never won Best Album at the Grammys. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, but it's kind of odd, considering what you've done in music over the last decade."
Kanye,"I wasn't even nominated for Best Album this year. This year, I only got two nominations by the Grammys"
Interviewer,"Well, that's my problem with all this stuff. It's ghettoization, and I'm talking about country as much as rap. It's all just music. And I've got a problem with people kind of trying to categorize it, where it's either good or it's bad. I find it all odd, to be honest. Have you ever been nominated for Best Album?"
Kanye,"I've been nominated for Best Album maybe three times. I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne less than a year apart and neither of them got nominated. ""Ni**as in Paris""  as much as 12 Years a Slave, but Hollywood likes the idea of a black director directing 12 Years a Slave more than it likes the idea of a black director directing Shame."
Interviewer,I actually remember when I first came to have meetings in L.A. after I did Hunger  and people thought I was white. I think often people try to ghettoize others because they have an idea about who they think you are rather than who you are.
Kanye,"Which I can't stand. But the thing is that people know not what they do. There are certain people where you just have to call them on the fact that they're behaving in a racist manner for them to understand it. Of course, they do this to me, too"
Interviewer,"It's interesting that we're speaking about this on the day of Nelson Mandela's memorial service, since he is such an icon of the best that we can be as human beings, not black people or white people or Asian or Indian or Spanish or whatever race or background you are, but human beings."
Kanye,"Yeah. I mean, there have definitely been moments where I've forgotten that I was black, and I don't want people to take that as, ""Oh, he sold out."" I mean, like, when I decided to wear tight jeans. At that moment, I forgot that I was supposed to wear baggy jeans because I'm black. Or when I've said certain things on TV and I've forgotten that I wasn't supposed to say them because I'm black, that I was supposed to stay in line and be neutral."
Interviewer,"I would say that most black people don't walk around thinking about being black. People tend to think of themselves as individuals, and it's only when they're confronted in certain situations that they become ""black.""."
Kanye,"And that's not just a black thing, it's a world thing where the biggest slavery that we have is our opinion of ourselves. That's why my attitude is so shunned. It's not a matter of me believing in myself that's so scary to everyone, it's the idea of everyone else starting to believe in themselves just as much as I do that's scary."
Interviewer,What's the best piece of advice that anyone has ever given you?
Kanye,"If someone ever said, ""Follow exactly what you want to do, Kanye,"" then I would say that that would probably have been the best piece of advice. But at this point, I don't even need any advice. I just need backing. I need belief more than I need advice. People can give you advice .. I met with Deepak Chopra, right? I was supposed to go back the next day, but I told my girlfriend that I wasn't going to go. Because you know what gets me calm, baby? Success. And I went in and finished my Adidas deal instead. I felt so Zen-ed out by that."
Interviewer,Do you think you have another 10 years like this in you? Can you extend that interest and success that you've enjoyed in music into whatever other fields that you want to venture? Is that possible?
Kanye,"One-hundred percent. Easy as cake, easy as pie. Too many people are scared. But it is my job to go up every night and talk about this kind of shit. It is actually my job. I'm like a broadcaster for futurism, for dreamers, for people who believe in themselves. We've been taught since day one to stop believing in our own dreams. We've had the confidence beaten out of us since day one, and then sold back to us through branding and diamond rings and songs and melodies, through these lines that we have to walk inside of so as to not break the uniform or look silly or be laughed at. So I hope that there are people out there laughing. Laugh loud, please. Laugh until your lungs give out because I will have the last laugh."
Interviewer,Do you think that some people feel threatened by you because you make sense?
Kanye,"They try to make it seem like I'm making the least sense possible. They'll take any shot possible to try to take away the power of my influence and my words. But the proof is in the work. The proof will be when we look back on this in 10 more years, because one thing that I will guarantee to everyone reading this is success. I'm guaranteeing success. I'm guaranteeing that we're gonna win. Or let me put it another way, only one of two things can happen"
Interviewer,What is going on and it's Michelle LA's 97-01 radio is what you're listening to. First thing I walk in the door and right behind me here he is Kanye West.
Kanye,What up.
Interviewer,How are you?
Kanye,I'm awesome.
Interviewer,"I know you're doing a ton of interviews right now, this is the first time you've been to Amp radio, so I have to say thank you."
Kanye,"Okay, awesome."
Interviewer,"This is pretty major and, I don't know, you probably have no way of knowing this, but the very first song I ever played on amp radio, about four years ago, was Paranoid."
Kanye,Well thank you very much.
Interviewer,Absolutely we're huge fans around here.
Kanye,"Thank you, I appreciate that."
Interviewer,"Thanks for coming in. So what's the story behind all of a sudden we're seeing you in front of us? Because you haven't done a whole lot of these kinds of interviews but now here you are, so we're thrilled to have you here. You just feel like going out and saying hello?"
Kanye,"Yeah, that's it."
Interviewer,"That's awesome. I dig that. So you're out on the Yeezus tour right now which, first, your album is awesome. The live show sold out at Staples on Saturday night, you got another one and then you've got Anaheim on Friday, so tell me a little bit about what to expect at the tour stops, because like I just told you before we went on the air, I saw a little bit of the clips but I feel like it doesn't do it the justice of actually being there and experiencing the show in the moment."
Kanye,"Yeah even if I explain it..you know it's just like creativity central. It's an example of like what DONDA can do - that's my creative company - it's an example of what happens when you put amazing thinkers in a room together and eliminate what they normally do and all the cliches that people slip into and challenge everyone in that room to come up with something completely new, and that's what is, completely new. You know we we experiment with things, and they get better, and it's going to get better as it goes, but if I have an idea, I just do it. I just go for it."
Interviewer,"Yeah that's cool, there's a certain fearlessness about you which I really dig. Do you feel like you get crap for that a little bit? The people misunderstand you?"
Kanye,"Yeah I'm not fearless, I just have courage, bravery. Like I have fear, but I overcome my fear. I know how to swim through backlash. I know how to float, I can tread water through backlash. I don't care about backlash if anything, because it's all given me power. Negative, positive, it's all energy and I can use energy."
Interviewer,"What really inspires you? I know you're really creative in so many different arenas but what do you look for, what would spark you?"
Kanye,"God. Number one inspiration, God. How can you get something to the you know the greatest. He's the greatest creator of all time, so - if you're being creative - my greatest inspiration is God. He made our universe you know ? So you look that far and say, if you gotta push hard to create on a more major scale, nothing is more major then the creator. He's given us the power of free will and the ability to create our own space, right."
Interviewer,Do you think you're misunderstood in that aspect? Do you think people just take things the wrong way?
Kanye,They just never heard it before. They never tasted that flavor yet.
Interviewer,I just think it's awesome because you have a certain thing about you that you say what's on your mind and your true to yourself and I think a lot of people don't know what to do with that because they're not.
Kanye,"Yeah and that's what is. If I say, hey I'm a creative genius, I don't know any other way to explain what I do and the way I think up things and the way I have to fight to get ideas out, had to fight to get my record deal, I'm fighting to be able to make clothes, I'm fighting to be able to make films. It's mixing creativity with the fight, like an athlete."
Interviewer,"And that's very very valuable. So you're talking about you're influences, with God and family and your life and enjoying life and, I was thinking just how much your life has changed even in the past six months to a year and how much has that changed your daily . Does that mellow you out? Change your perspective on things?"
Kanye,"I hang out wit my the girl and my daughter everyday. There's no place I'd rather be, so now even when I was thinking about the things I'm creating or the things I'm doing in business, my biggest goal is to be able to get home to my family. So even, as I'm thinking about things I'm doing for the future, it's like how can I set it up so I can just be my daughter's soccer coach. How can I put myself in that position?"
Interviewer,"I can't imagine you showing up at the soccer game, I just think that would be awesome."
Kanye,"I'm going to be a soccer coach. Like, I'm going to design the uniforms, I'm going to have to redesigned the minivan maybe hahaha. Maybe me and Elon Musk can design a new type of minivan."
Interviewer,A new Kanye West mini van. See that's a partnership you could get on board with right there.
Kanye,"Well DONDA, we want to create everything. We have a perspective on things you see, touch, taste, and feel, just the quality of life. We want to improve the quality of life. It is a product, experience, and content company. So, a form of content could be Yeezus. That is a form of content. Experience could be the concert you went to. A product could be the Yeezy's. Those are examples of things that a collective of creative people have put together."
Interviewer,"I like that because I thought you're on the way to doing things differently, all the promotion around your album. It was really like just awesome to me, because it wasn't the traditional roll out that they do to radio where they send the single and then they're doing is they're doing that and, you know, you're doing an appearance on, you know, whatever TV show. But it was really cool. It was like when you showed in over 60 cities. You showed the you know, I wouldn't even call them videos. It was more of like a just an art exhibition that you did in these different cities. It is kind of, What's spurred that, to do it that way?"
Kanye,"I mean, we have dreams. We wake up, and we make them happen. I appreciate that my label allowed me to go unorthodox with that. And there's people at the label who appreciate it and there's people who don't appreciate that. It's like non-traditional in that way. But I have to push. And really, it's all practice to me. Being a musician is practice. Life is practice. You know, so it's not like a in go so I'm fine to make a mistake. I'm fine to, like, put out an auto tune album that no one understands. I'm fine to put out a complete punk new wave album that no one understands. I'm not trying to maintain, you know, some spot in the hip-hop charts on radio or something like that. I'm trying to open up people's minds. I want people to think more. I want people to feel like it's okay to create. I want people to feel like it's okay to make mistakes in front of people and follow what their dreams are and not feel boxed in. I want people to feel like, you know, awesome is possible. I want them to, you know, feel like, you know it's not a matter of just even what I'm doing at DONDA. It's the amount of people that are hearing me and now they're going to fight to get the best ideas out. Because the world will only be saved through good intention and design, It's not going to be saved is politics. The irony is, what holds things back? Politics! So how could that push things forward?"
Interviewer,"I heard you say that you were trying to work out a deal with the Gap and politics held you back from doing that with your merchandise for the tour, and it may be just wonder what, sort of elaborate on that. What are you talking about when you say politics?"
Kanye,"I mean it, like, what would happen if I was able to design a collection and was like backed by the Gap? It would be awesome, right?"
Interviewer,"It would totally be awesome, but then my question for you is, but you have you're not hurting. You're doing well, so couldn't you just do that yourself? You don't need the Gap."
Kanye,"No, you can't. You need the infrastructure. It's not a matter of just having money."
Interviewer,"But you have a great staff set up in everything, I feel like.."
Kanye,"No, I don't have a great staff at all. That is a skill set that takes years and years of anything. If I wanted to get into the coal business and I had and also, well-off is that, that is what's the word I'm looking for? I'm trying to use the simplest word sometimes. Yeah, it's all relative. Because I'm not, because, okay I could make an amount that seems, like, really crazy to people, like 10 million a year, right? To open up a new fashion company might costs 15 million. So if I went and took all the money I had and I invested it into trying to do it like that, it could leave me 5 million in debt."
Interviewer,"That's fair enough, I get that."
Kanye,And then you're not well-off.
Interviewer,"That's yeah I'm sorry, I know it's not all about money, but I've just been saying that the team that you have at DONDA and I would think that you could hire anybody that may want to come and work for you."
Kanye,"I'll now we are. Because of what we're doing. Because of the way we're turning up. Now we can get real designers, real infrastructure. But it's really hard. Just as much as, you know, getting a creative person is hard, it's hard to get the back office guys; the people that run the  is a great designer. I love Saint Laurent and their $1 million dollar jackets and everything. I love it. But, I should have backing from one in the majors. Louis Vuitton group which is Bernard Arnault, Karen group, which is France Rapinoe, or Renzo Rosso, who owns Diesel and Margiela. Bottom line. And that's the only way it's going to be, because the thing is, when you try to go, you know, when you go less that, the level of the product is just isn't where should be. Yeah I'm doing T-shirts that are amazing. We put all our design into it, and so many people like T-shirts. And I love that. I get people T-shirts. But I also want to create entire gyms. Like gyms. Like I want to make a gym. I wanna make a store. I want to do apartment complexes. I want to build cities. I want to be involved with hyperloop when it comes to reality, with Eli Musk. That's the conversation I want to be in. So I will not be held into a box of being a musician, or that you get it somehow confused. I don't look like a rapper. Now rappers look like me, but when I started, I wasn't gangsta enough. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm getting married to Kim Kardashian, and I've never played in the NBA."
Interviewer,Oh my god.
Kanye,"So, that's thought."
Interviewer,"You know, you raise a really good point here. If you just joined us, I'm Michelle and we're live on 97.1 Radio Los Angeles with Kanye West. You know, in creativity in rap music, do you think that, because I don't you definitely don't do things like everybody else. Do you think there's a certain lack of originality and creativity, not, you know, I'm not going to say that for all rap, but it seems like you do things a little differently. And a love that that; with music, I mean."
Kanye,"There's a lack of creativity in every field, because people are afraid. Because the powers control people. And the only place where people can be fully creative is in Silicon Valley. Everything else, there's an old regime. And oligarchs are controlling whether or not you're going to be able to feed your kids. So no one can say the type of stuff that I'm saying because they'll lose their job."
Interviewer,"You're here to save it, man. At least, like, change it, which I love. Whoo! That heat, I love that."
Kanye,"Really quick, and don't forget your question, please. I wanna stop using the term fashion, because Eve made Adam bite an apple. And since then, it's been illegal to be naked. I'm helping people follow the law in style. I'm helping people with their opinion on how to follow the law. This isn't about fashion. I'm creating new standards, things so you don't have to think about it. Fashion is too high of a skill set. It just needs to be easy. Easy as the hoodie and jeans that I'm wearing. And I'll do all the hard work. I'll figure out exactly where that collar goes and exactly where that hoodie sits and and how many times you can wash that fabric and stuff so that it looks better 5 years from now. I'll do the hard work for you. Fashion is forcing people to do all this hard work where you look back 2 years from now and say, That looked crazy!"
Interviewer,"You're one of the most famous men in the world. I think everyone has an opinion on you - I really noticed that when preparing for this interview. Everyone thinks they know you. I've watched quite a few of your interviews recently and you've talked about this idea of not being heard. There's kind of an irony to that as you have such a big direct reach, but I got the sense that you really felt that you were not being listened to or not being understood. Do you think anyone fully understands Kanye West? Do you think you're very different to your public persona? Have you created that in some way? Lou Stoppard, editor of SHOWstudio."
Kanye,"Yeah, I do think there's people who understand. They see it. It's like the same people who can feel an earthquake coming on, or see a tsunami coming. I think there's people who don't want to embrace what it really is so they use their position of like class, or snobbery, or whatever comments they have, to just try to always down things and to not give it its just due, or just opportunity as a form of discrimination. Y'know, most people don't understand who they are so people's misunderstanding of me is a misunderstanding of themselves. They don't understand that he's not being the projected version of himself. He's not being what he was taught by current society, taught by this lifetime. He's evoking something from another place and this is unfamiliar; this is alien to us. It's easier for us to shun it than to really try to dig deeper and find out more about it. It's funny that so many people that are supposed to be so super educated love to pick the lowest hanging fruit of the concept, of like fame or celebrity, as a way to diminish or to take away the validation of what is being done up to this point and what will be done in the future."
Interviewer,"What do you consider your greatest contribution to music and also your greatest contribution to creativity? Sam Hollis, 18, New Zealand."
Kanye,"Greatest contribution to creativity is taking away the bullying. People bully creatives. Well, y'know, I'm sure I bully myself sometimes but taking away people being able to bully you because you're a creative. We're bullied and controlled by organisations and money and you know the people with money are in power. That's going to change after me and Kim's lifetime. It's going to go back to when people used to philosophise and talk about proportions and shape and colour and what we can do for the next generations, but right now it's all about what people can do to make the most money and how they can not cut creatives in on any profit and use creatives against themselves in a way. Like if they know someone is a genius but not business smart, they take advantage of that. So, me constantly fighting that on the front line I think is the greatest thing I've tried to open up, so that creatives can be more empowered, because I believe the world can be saved or helped, and the world meaning us as human beings, our civilisation, us as a race, as one race, can be helped through allowing people with more positive motives, who see more colours than just green. To help be at least a part of the conversation and be heard and listened to. What was the first question?"
Interviewer,"It was about your greatest contribution to music, but maybe you don't think like that anymore? Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"Yeah.. Music synthesis. Just to synthesise. To take Mos Def and bring him to the studio with Jay Z, I think is the greatest.. When people say 'oh this is backpack or this is gangster,' or to go on tour with Roc-A-Fella with a chain and have people boo me and be like 'Roc-A-Fella is not hip hop' and fight against that. Now, it's considered to be one art form. Like what Louise Wilson would always talk about, there's this juxtaposition, high, low, these opposites and combining them. This combination that makes a greater civilisation and a greater human being. The actual human being a thousand years from now, generally, as a race we should be far advanced. Like at the beginning of 'Prometheus', like how that guy was just like *chtchhhhhe noise*. He was like Mike Tyson meets Steve Jobs meets Shakespeare as a person. There was a time when people were working on multiple things and have multiple art forms and businesses and different things that they could do but now you're only supposed to be able to do one thing and in the future, people will be highly skilled in a lot of things because they won't be afraid to fight for their education."
Interviewer,"You seem to be very open to making brave decisions and I think in someway that relates to pushing yourself to new arenas. Like the opening of BLKKK SKKKN HEAD, with the three black KKK hoods, and not putting New Slaves on YouTube or appearing naked in the BLKKK SKKKN HEAD video. Do these decisions feel brave at the time? Do you think you're being brave? And what's the bravest thing you've ever done? Nick Knight, director of SHOWstudio."
Kanye,"There's nothing to be afraid of really. I don't even want to take too much credit for being brave. I think it's just a responsibility of ours as artists to give our truth at that time. And it's as simple as that. Soldiers are brave. It's their responsibility to go and fight for their country. Police officers are brave.. Firefighters, it's their responsibility to go into a fire. For us as an artist, it's our responsibility to give our truth. So I just think, more than courage or bravery or anything, it's just.."
Interviewer,Honesty? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"Yeah honesty.. Some of the answers I'm gonna give aren't gonna make complete sense. If you're a very literal, by the book person, you might find a flaw in the final finishing, as opposed to understanding the gist of what I'm saying. The other day, I came up with an equation that explains the way visionaries think as opposed to very calculated people. If someone asked you what is 2 add 3, most people would say 5. If you put 2 and 3 in front of me, I'm gonna say, 2 plus 3 is 5, 2 x 3 is 6, 2 divided by 3 is this, 3 divided by 2 is that, and then come up with an average of all those things and then when you say that 5.76 blah blah blah, that is the thing that people marvel at. Like, 'Wow, that really was not what I was expecting or not what we wanted to put you in a box for, but I felt like I got something more out of it.' And that is the calculation of the zeitgeist because everyday, something changes. People get so caught up in the embarrassment of changing their mind in front of someone. One thing could change everything, so you have to put that as a part of your 2 and 3 equation. You don't have to, but I put it as a part of my 2 and 3 equation."
Interviewer,"You've called yourself a visionary and you've equated yourself to all these different people: Da Vinci, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Michelangelo.. How would you define a genius in that context? Also, why do you feel the need to call yourself that? Sam Thompson, 21, London."
Kanye,"Because otherwise I'm called celebrity. I'm called nigga. I'm called rapper. And when they use the words celebrity, nigga or rapper, it's not in a positive way. All those words can be used in a positive way, 'What's up my nigga?' That's not the way it's used, so I have to define who I am. All of my aspirations are things that currently only 60-year-old white people do. So I have to redefine and let people know exactly who I am. And it's not letting them know by wearing a suit, or letting them know by wearing a Rolex or letting them know by bragging about how much money a sponsorship made on top of a rap. It's letting them know by saying, 'Let's start with this, I'm a creative genius.' It's proven and I will continue to prove it. You know when people try to take the piss out of me for clothing and this and that, they never think about the fact that I never had the opportunity to be properly educated. And if given the means to be properly educated or even given the proper support group, I would completely light the lights up. So we sell shoes that people want to line up for because we put love in them, we put heart in them, we want to make Christmas presents, we want to make something that people want so bad that it hurts them if they can't have it. It's not just a financial opportunity. Of course you need finances but it's a form of discrimination and racism. Especially with blacks in fashion. And it took me being Kanye West to get this far in fashion. I was able to become a multimillionaire and invest in myself because no one else would have in a million years. I've got this one employee that's a black guy, and sometimes there'll be a piece of misinformation. Three weeks later, he'll tell me something and he says it kind of like with his voice down. And I remember being with my dad, and my dad was the type of dad who would be everybody's dad. A guy would come in and want to sell some cookies, and my dad was a salesman, so he would say, 'Excuse me, I've got these cookies,' and my dad would say 'Yo, sir, pick your head up and explain to me what you want to say and what you want to sell.' This guy, this employee, because blacks - especially in America - have been raised with a slave mentality, don't feel they have the right to speak as loud as possible and every time you hear a black person speaking as loud as possible, it's after somebody's gonna say, 'Look at those niggas over there.' So if you don't want to be called a name in a derogatory way, you'd rather put it in.. What's people's favourite word to use for me? Humble? If you go on your iPhone right now and you go to the dictionary and look up 'humble', 80% of the definition is negative. It's a controlling word; it's a way to control the masses and control the sheep. Yeah, I think there's a level of reality to being nice, to being cordial to people. But if you have the ability to lead, if you are a leader or you have the answers or you have the ability to find people with the answers, and your will is to help, you should not be humble. You should speak up. Because this world is broken. So someone needs to say something. And sometimes I just feel like I'm the only one that's not crazy."
Interviewer,"Do you think the resistance and criticism to your work is being partly because you are a black man and would your ideas and work be received differently if you were a white man? Aravin Sandran, 25, London."
Kanye,"If I was a white man that became a really successful musician, that box would have put me in a chamber that would have said that I shouldn't work. So there's a lot of white people that if they're really super good at something, they also get discriminated against in another field. You could be a photographer and someone would say you can't be an artist. You could be a designer and someone would say you can't be a musician or someone would say you can't be a film director. As far as the advantages in life, yes, if you are born white, you have that on your gene pool. Currently because the world is controlled by whites, you have that as a 100, as an advantage, and if you add a couple of other things to it, you have a very high chance of success. Whereas, because the world is run by whites currently, if you're born black, if you make it to something like the Met Ball or the Grammys, most likely you've done ten times the amount of everyone else there to get there."
Interviewer,"Your clothing line has been greeted with a lot of harsh criticism. Do you reflect like a lot of designers do, where they take that criticism and they use it to kind of develop their aesthetic and change their work? Or does it just make you even more convinced in your belief and vision? Simon Foxton, stylist."
Kanye,"Yeah, I'm convinced that I know what I like and I know that I just know. I know and I don't care. I don't care because anyone that is criticising, most likely they saw the 350s and acted like they didn't like them because they're racist and discriminatory. They're not only racist against black people; they discriminate against celebrity. They discriminate against people with multiple art forms. Or they could say, 'Oh wait a second, that cut wasn't that good,' but they do enough to throw a stab at, 'Oh that didn't fall the right way' or 'That wasn't styled the right way.' But they didn't do the research on how difficult it was to one by one put together a design team and to fight against the idea of celebrity, to get overcharged because you're a musician or people feel like you have money, to get completely taxed by the fashion world. And I love it because it's like going to Harvard. That's the reason why I'm in fashion. I think it's the ultimate training because I dropped out of art school. Eventually, I got a PHD this year, like a honorary PHD at the Art Institute of Chicago. I dropped out of that school and I wanted to go back to the school of hard knocks. Right now, in all honesty.. You know whatever the fuck I'm going to say today, I'm going to say it and I'm just gonna fucking own it and that's how I feel right now. If I feel differently in three years, I'll tell you how I feel.. but right now, the highest art form is actually fashion. What's funny about that is people in art look down at fashion designers. It's like a class.. I mean, where's architecture? The most energy currently is around fashion because with music, it's in question if a song is popular, if that person is really a good artist or not. In fashion, for the most part, if someone is really popular, it's because it's agreed upon that they're an amazing artist. They're amazing at what they've done. People do the history on what their background is. Did they intern for Christian Lacroix? Did they work at Margiela for a period? They find out what the history is and see if that someone is making a connection to something that is current, that's relative, that is in touch. And fashion designers are superstars currently too. It feels like hip-hop felt to me in the nineties. It's like, me, I'm a hip-hop artist but it's like why are you going to the fashion world? I mean it's just a really interesting art form. It's just a different art form. Business is an art, the way you talk to people is art, an interview can be an art, everything is a form of art. I appreciate the critics because when I see the collection I just did and when I used the stretch French Terry that I found in Japan and I use on market canvas, like heavyweight canvas, and I put it in my colour palette and I see 64 different tones come down together, you know, I've created like a moving expressionist painting and that satisfies me. So if someone was to go up to a Monet and say, 'This dot wasn't Louis Vuitton level,' it'd be like, 'What do you mean?' It's all an expressionist painting. By the way, you know we die. 80 years, 60 years, 50 years, you know we will die. But on that day, I lived."
Interviewer,Your dad was in the Black Panthers and your last collection did have a very political undertone. It was very much about racism. Natalie Wo.
Kanye,"Wait a second, is that a white person who said that?"
Interviewer,I don't know her ethnicity. Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"I think it's racist when white people assume when a black person uses colour, it's a political statement."
Interviewer,Were you not making a political statement?
Kanye,"No! It's a painting. It's beautiful colours. That statement is not gonna stop the murders in Chicago. That statement is not gonna help people get jobs. That statement is not gonna take guns out of hands in Atlanta. That statement is not going to stop Zimmerman from bragging about.. It's such a thing like I had this one stylist come up to me and Virgil was standing next to me and said, 'You need to watch out for him. He's taking your place.' And I was like, 'Oh, the one spot for the black guy at the dinner table in fashion? That place? Is that what you're talking about?' So the assumption that my artistic expression of clothing has something to do with race or politics - a more politically correct term ironically for racism - is racist in itself."
Interviewer,"A lot of fashion designers do see their work as political so maybe that's why people see your work as political or about social issues. Perhaps it's a compliment. They want to read something into your work because they think it has depth and it matters. It doesn't seem like you see it like that? Like McQueen's work for example, people saw it as political. Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"Yeah, I'm not gonna let anyone score points on me. If someone asks me about something, I'm gonna block all shots and I'm not gonna take any free points. I'm not gonna have someone say, 'Oh I heard you knocked that guy out two weeks ago while this happened,' and I would be like, 'Oh yeah.. ' No. If it wasn't my intention for it to be political and everyone gives it this credit, and somehow they're giving it a credibility, I'm like well no.. I don't even want that kind of credit. I don't want anything that I don't deserve. I just want a chance to drink at the clear fountain. I just want a clean shot. I just want a clean bat to swing, I want a clean bat to be able to swing at the ball with. Every one of these questions are gonna show the amount of dirt that's actually on the bat."
Interviewer,Do you think it would be easier for you if you weren't famous then? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"Yeah, being famous is like the n-word. People remind me at every meeting about how famous I am. But somehow.. . No, it wouldn't be easier. The answer is absolutely no. You need fame in order to sell your shit. That's why people pay for advertisers. So I'm basically the first of a celebrity that approached his entire career and life like he was an old bag brand that went and re-did itself and went and got a really cool designer that Anna Wintour suggested, to revitalise it and became a really big brand.. Meaning like celebrities have always had a way that they were supposed to do business with licensing deals and this and this, but I always approach myself in a luxury way whether it's calling Nick Knight a million times to work with him or going to factories in Italy or begging Tessiclub - which hasn't called me back yet - to use their fabrics because they do Céline and Lanvin. I've always fought just to have better paints to work with. When I was in high school, I was at this national competition where I did a watercolour and the colour was really intense and I lost the competition because the judges were confused. They said either it's not really watercolour because the paint was too thick or I used watercolour in the wrong way. So I lost because of that. I don't know where those judges are today but.."
Interviewer,"What will you name your son and what do you hope for him as he gets older? Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of US Vogue."
Kanye,"I don't have a name for him, but what I hope for him is that he can feel purpose, that he can learn, that he has the opportunities. The other night, I was driving in Paris and I saw these three high school kids running at top speed. I don't know if they were chasing a guy or what. Once they got up to the street, there was a bus pulling off and they're beating on the side of the bus. Then I looked at the time and it was 1am so that might be the last bus of the night. And I was really saddened because I was like, 'How can I make my son feel that?' Because once you've felt that, none of these fucking questions matter. When you've missed that last bus before, when you had the opportunity to get on the bus, you don't give a fuck about any of this."
Interviewer,When have you felt that? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,When I've missed the last fucking bus! Going through the streets of Chicago and having to sleep downtown in a parking lot.
Interviewer,Do you still get that feeling today about different things? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"No, it's almost like not feeling anything. It's almost like being numb because of what I went through. There's an employee that I'm about to hire that was the global manager of accessories at a really good company and she was really direct in the way she was talking. Then she went into this thing about how she stayed in a concentration camp till she was five years old and she didn't know that people actually took showers by themselves. After someone's been through something like that, they could give a fuck less about fuck. It's just like.. be real. None of this facade."
Interviewer,"Do you care about the negative press coverage around you and your family? But also just the general coverage that your every move is scrutinised? Floris Boonen, 17, The Netherlands."
Kanye,"Yeah. And that's the reason why, with the help of Anna Wintour and other people, we have actually made a lot of positive press coverage. The majority of the press we get is actually positive because the majority of the things that we do are actually positive. And even the negative can't outshine the truth. The truth shall come to light. You see it in front of you. You read this thing and they try to diminish me into some really simple concept and simple idea and every time someone has a conversation about this and that, they're like, 'Wow, it's a possibility that he's thinking about more things and he wants to contribute more than I thought.' So, let me dig into what I think the gist is of what that person was asking. Do I worry about being in the public eye and raising kids? Yeah. Any situation you're in, you're going to worry about raising kids. But it's champagne problems too. There's people who can't feed their kids. That's something more to worry about. So I'm not going to sit here and complain about the so-called issues I have. These aren't real issues. There's people at war. There's people trying to make it to London right now. It's really fucking serious. You guys are talking to me about some celeb shit. That's not real shit. You know what? I'm alive. I'm breathing. I did a show. We sell it. I'm doing a second collection. I have no problems."
Interviewer,"How has becoming a father changed the way you work? Carine Roitfeld, stylist."
Kanye,"Well, the way it changed who I was.. Three years ago, after this interview, I would have been on a train back to Paris to see the last of the shows and get that inspiration. And now, I'm on the first flight back home to see my greatest inspiration that's my daughter."
Interviewer,"Has having a daughter changed the type of explicit lyrics you put into a song? Ashley Geevers, 18, New Jersey."
Kanye,"Having a family period has completely made me rethink the way I rap. You know people extend their brand for a long time. There's true moments of genius and then there's just moments of looking through the archives and placing shit together. So many people rate 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' as one of the best albums. And 'Yeezus' and '808s & Heartbreak' are so much better and stronger. 'Dark Fantasy' is almost like an apology record. 'Power' was the least progressive song that I ever had as a first single. It was like me going back and spending six dedicated months - it took over two years to release the album - but six dedicated months piecing together what people liked about me, to make an entire bouquet that they loved, that was the most listenable, that was the least challenging. People want to talk about how much they loved that like it was Thanksgiving dinner. And how long has Thanksgiving dinner been cooked for? And it's great, you don't want anybody changing things on Thanksgiving dinner. But you take '808s' or 'Yeezus' where these albums got completely panned when they came out and then you see how they end up influencing things. So it's that balance of doing something that gives you a blanket of comfortability for the listeners and for yourself that you can go on tour and do this and walk around and everybody thinks it's so great and they're really happy that you did something they liked. And then you've got the times when you just have to give them what you see as your future. Give them your innovation."
Interviewer,And having a family gives you more motivation to do that? To be more true to yourself? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,No.
Interviewer,That just comes from you? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,I just love my family.
Interviewer,"You talked about wanting to be given a shot and wanting to have your opportunity. Do you actually believe that one day you will be respected and regarded as one of the greatest of all time in fashion in exactly the same way you are in music? Jeremy Mullings, 19, Florida."
Kanye,"Of course. I'm Michelangelo. Of course. There's a time when I'm sure there were people sculpting better than Michelangelo, but he made David. So as far as that question goes, is there a time that you can go on the internet and find a shoe that people want more than my shoes? Well go fuck yourself then if it isn't and don't ask me no stupid shit like that again. With the love."
Interviewer,Do you ever experience self-doubt? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,No.
Interviewer,Never? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,No.
Interviewer,Even when you were little? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,No.
Interviewer,"Okay, good to know. One thing that came in from a lot of people: they picked up on that quote of your fashion being available to everybody. They want to know what that means and when it will happen because price point really relates to that. Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"I'm not H&M, I don't have giant factories. How can I get the price point to what I need it to be if I'm running an eight person design team.. I'm saying it's going to take time to get there. This is what I'm saying when you don't have the right tools. This is the question that everybody has to ask. If you had the Céline design team and the Nike design studio and the Zara factory, could you do everything that you thought you could do? And what would everyone's answer be to that? Yes. But if you don't have the Céline outerwear person or the factory or you don't have the entire adidas studio and you don't have the marketing team or the sales team, you can only do what you can do. And we are doing a lot with what we have. What we have is the highest level of communication that has happened in the entire universe. My wife. She's like MTV and NBC and all this combined. Number one on Instagram. And then the entire family. And then you have me and my entire music family. Basically, there is no ad that you can put in any magazine that could somehow add up to any one of me or my friends or my family just walking on the street and getting photographed. That is the fucking reality of 2015 people!"
Interviewer,"Does that make it easier to care less about critics? Because as you say, it doesn't really matter what they say. The percentage of people that would engage with that is a fraction of the percentage of people that would see one Instagram post from Kim. Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"Yeah you know.. I mean, what can I say about them? I appreciate everyone's opinion, but I refuse to have a lesser opinion about myself."
Interviewer,"What specifically do you think fashion is missing that you can bring? Cameron Canty, 18, Dallas, Texas."
Kanye,"I'm not even concerned about bringing something to fashion. I'm just.. I just want to be five years old. You know, when I was five years old I picked out my outfit for kindergarten. I would go to discount furrier, my mum would take me to discount furrier and I would keep grabbing furs and say, 'What about this one mum? Or this one?' And they were always too expensive. The ones I liked when I was five. So I just want to be five years old. I loved clothes before I even knew a fuck about the fashion world. And I can't let the fashion world jade anything or try to give me a reason, or purpose, or a lack of purpose, or acceptance or a lack of acceptance to anything to just who I am when I was five. When my grandfather had a store in Oklahoma and he'd go to the flea market and hustle to get the best prices. He'd go and re-do people's furniture, he was a carpenter also. He took that store and he was able to raise a family in a time where the schools were still segregated and he named my mother Donda in 1949. He was predicting the future in 1949 and put himself in a situation where he was thirteen and his father put 50 cents in his hand and told him he was out of there. He raised himself in a situation to be able to put my mother into college to the point where she got a PhD and became the first black female chair of Chicago State University. And then had a son that she then named Kanye which meant 'the only one' that would go on to combat every form of thought, of tradition, that the media have presented up to that point. So tell me about other people's opinions again?"
Interviewer,"Is it your family who have had the biggest impact on your creativity, your sense of self and what you produce? Or were there other influences? It feels like all your creativity came from your sense of self, which obviously came from your family. Or am I wrong? Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"I can't say where my creativity came from. I'm blessed to be talented. I would say that came from God. My ability to give a fuck about somebody's opinion came from my family. My ability to fight for my creativity came from my family. I'm sure people would just take that Michelangelo comment I said earlier and would take offense to that and think 'Whoa, he still won't stop.' Let me just explain the justification of that. The proof of that. Ask any musician, period, of the past fifteen years - and I would be the closest thing to that. Those were the sonic paintings. Fashion, clothes are sculptures, wearable art. Now, if you think about any brand, do you love every single thing from a brand? Look at the few opportunities I got to collaborate with Louis Vuitton, Nike, Adidas - really established companies - and the level of love and impact people have for that product. That had proper infrastructure. So I had to take the money I made from being the motherfucking Michelangelo of music of the past fifteen years and invest it in trying to build an infrastructure against all odds, and basically building a sculpture studio. So I wanted to raise the branch up a little bit higher on that low-hanging fruit everyone was going to snatch at."
Interviewer,"Why run for president? You have proven to be more influential than a president and running for office would limit your ideas. Everything you could do and would want to do as president can be done now. Other great leaders, Gandhi, Mandela, never needed to be elected to make a change, so why do you feel the need? Caden Roberts, 14, Indiana."
Kanye,Mandela got elected.
Interviewer,"Yeah, he's fourteen, give him a break. Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"OK, I won't start cursing at him. Certain things that I'm compelled to do in life, I don't feel the need to find justification for."
Interviewer,So you're definitely going to do it? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"When you made that announcement, was it something you decided on the day or did it just come in the moment that you felt that and you just said it? Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,It had been talked about a lot for the past five years and talked about with my team and I decided I was going to announce it then.
Interviewer,Do you think Barack Obama has done enough? A lot of people have asked you that. Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,I don't want to make comments or give opinions on what other people have done. I think he's done a lot of great things and I think that there would be no chance of people even considering the concept of me running if he hadn't have won.
Interviewer,Will you run with a party or will you run alone? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,I don't have all the answers right now.
Interviewer,"What do you plan to do? What are the some of the things you really want to do when you're in leadership? Ivan Romero, 19, Miami; Aaron Lewis, 21, Philadelphia."
Kanye,"I'd like to sit with engineers and come up with solutions and alternatives for people without opportunity that end up having to go through desperate measures or feel like life isn't worth living or that other people's lives don't matter. I think that the way I collaborate with people and the way I empower the people I collaborate with is a different way to look at problem solving for the world than a normal political way. I just want to ask questions. I've already decided that when I'm on debates and I don't know, I'll just say 'I don't know, I'll get back to you with that,' and I'll just consult with the top ten, top five people on the planet and if there isn't an absolute right answer, I'll say, 'These are the two highest answers that we came up with right now,' because it's not about me. It's we. That's the whole purpose. It's the skill set that brought me back from the original Taylor Swift moment, the skill set that took the little kid in the pink polo to the top of the rap game. That skill set that took a Nike designer and three Adidas designers and made the hottest shoe. The skill set that brought my wife to the cover of Vogue. All of these journeys that.. Like these questions say, these absolute, like, this can't be done, have been almost self-serving and that's where it gets the I-I-I. It's from me and it's from my family. My family meaning my direct family, but what happens if there is a certain point where it doesn't become about me and my family but my family becomes the human race. I can do all the fight, all of that confidence, all of that problem solving, all of that asking questions, all of that trying to find the best answers, and listening through.. If I could maybe do that to help more people and you can help more people in a position of power to go back to the gentleman's question earlier. These are just now in a theory form, but I am speaking from the heart."
Interviewer,"A few people have correlated the president run with your lyrics and particularly the lyric about 'No one man should have all that power.' It's interesting, you just said you can change your mind, you can be wrong about things. Do you sometimes feel your own ideas have changed so much in the years you've been working? Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,Of course because you get new information.
Interviewer,Does it frustrate you though? Because people are inevitably going to draw the parallel between the lyric and the fact you're going to run for president. Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"That's not frustrating. There were some things earlier that were frustrating to me because they were so backhanded and ignorant in their approach, not really embracing.. But no one's being like 'Man, I know I saw people lined up for three days for your shoes but one day, will you be respected as a designer?' I designed that shoe, didn't I? I don't see somebody else's shoes getting lined up for. I think there are a lot of fourteen year old, fifteen year old, twenty-five year old, thirty-five year old people that respect me as a designer."
Interviewer,"I met you at a dinner in Paris with Riccardo Tisci and we had a really great talk and one thing stuck in my mind. You said that you felt that there was a new form of racism called class, and no one was talking about it. I found that really interesting because I come from a radical background my father was a Marxist and you told me your parents were also radicals. Can you explain to me more what you mean about that and is that something you want to explore further? Bobby Gillespie, lead singer of Primal Scream."
Kanye,"Yeah it's.. class is education. People not having the opportunity to be educated. The biggest thing that made me the uncontrollable whatever is simply by being educated. Simply being educated made me uncontrollable. It's not that I needed to be controlled. I needed to be helped, I needed to be supported. I don't wish negative on anyone. I want positive for everyone. I want everyone to win. I don't want to be in a competition with anyone. I just want people to be their best selves and live the happiest lives possible. If you keep information and opportunity away from people, certain people, a group of people, then it's destined they will stay at a lower class. The combination of that and being American. Because I found sometimes when I've worked at other design studios in London before, I find that because of the way the government is set up, people won't have the opportunity to say they will run for being the Queen. I'm going to run for the Queen! That's from birth. And you couldn't be the president of the United States because you're not a United States citizen. So it sort of circumcises your dreams from day one. Whereas America is like a land of opportunity where people can work their way, climb their way up through the class system. But to be truly honoured as a black person in what is a classless society - the final house in the suburban community with the white picket fence - and to be looked at as an equal is still a lot of mixed kids away from that. But the world is mixing. Period. So in a thousand years, the world might just be completely, what would be known as black currently, but it would just be a new race, except for people whose main goal and focus at that time is to keep the purity of separatism. But I see the future as people being mixed. I think that other races are really attracted to each other and always have been, because I believe that we're meant to, but taught to not. I was taught to never bring a white girl home when I was eight years old. But I like white girls. I liked black girls too but I still liked white girls. It was such a taboo. I'm sure, like I said in the Tyler song, 'I know you told your daughters don't take home Jerome.' I'll tell you from my single days that white women like black guys, I tell you that, but I think there's something amazing about mixing the cultures and the amount of informations that both cultures bring to the table. Or three cultures or four cultures. You ask a girl and she'll say: 'I'm German and Portuguese and Asian.' Just when I gave you that right now. What do you picture in your mind? There are probably guys gong: 'Ah shit, I have to meet this German-Portuguese-Asian girl right now!' They already picture someone beautiful. Just by me naming different races together and having the idea that a woman is saying that she's mixed with these, you picture automatically someone beautiful."
Interviewer,A lot of people asked about your vision for the world and what you'd like it to be like. It seems like that mixing of ethnicities and cultures is the most important thing to you? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,I'm not telling people who they should sleep with. I'm just zoning in on what I feel today.
Interviewer,"Do you feel like if you hadn't dropped out, you would be where you are? Because I think education is important but maybe the ability to opt out of the system is also important. Joseph Chambliss, 21, Virginia Beach."
Kanye,"I think I would be further and more dangerous. Yes, education is important. I'm envious of people who have read multiple novels and multiple philosophy books. I wish I had more information. I'm thirsty for knowledge. I'm busy with my own ideas. I want to pick up a book and see something that sparks me and it makes me think of thirty things I want to do and I'll put down the book and start working on that. I'm envious of information. So college dropout.. Now me at my age I'm looking.. OK what were the reasons why I lost money when I did this? What were the reasons why I failed at that? It all came to not having the playbook, to not having information. With me, when I work on fashion, I'm sitting here in the woods trying to chop down trees screaming screaming at the top of my lungs: 'Can somebody just throw me some water?' and everyone's sitting laughing at me. That's the fashion world, that's the fashion critics. Me sitting here, trying my absolute hardest, and everyone just laughing at me. And only one person coming up with a camera and Nick shooting a shot that then shoots across the world and they say 'Oh he's working with Nick Knight,' and then Pat coming in doing the makeup, they go: 'Oh, he's working with Pat,' or Riccardo coming in and saying: 'No you can't talk about Kim, this is my friend right here,' they say: 'Oh wow, the hottest designer likes Kim.' Then the fashion world is like: 'Hmm maybe it's okay.' And then they come again and say: 'What, do you think we can capitalise off of this in some way? Well come, come! We can capitalise and shit!' But they definitely were not fucking letting me in the shows, and fucking constantly laughing at me, and trying to keep the joke going. But you know, there's a lot of tsunamis and earthquakes that hit where people were joking on the beach. So keep joking on the beach."
Interviewer,"The Kim thing is interesting to me. I feel, particularly working in fashion, I feel like I've watched it happen, the period where people were so critical and now they want her in their shows, they want to dress her, they want her on the front row. That must upset you in a way because she's your wife and as you said, you love her. To see that U-turn, in a way, it's great, because it shows how much people respect her and they can see how amazing her influence is, but also that back-handedness. Is that difficult? Because you must feel protective. Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"It's always, always.. It's better now than it was and I feel happy about that."
Interviewer,We got a question from a guy who talked about gay people within music and within the rap world and stigma towards homosexual rappers. He talked about how you talk a lot about society moving past stigma and being accepting. He said do you feel that's still a problem within music? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"Yeah, it's funny. Isn't it so funny how just the culture of different art forms is so different? I felt that I got discriminated against in fashion also for not being gay whereas in music, you definitely get discriminated against if you are gay. It takes some amazing talents to really break down that barrier. People don't have a problem with white rappers now because Eminem ended up being the greatest artist and everybody thought that when Frank Ocean's album dropped, that people were going to be like, 'No, this is bad for his career,' and he's one of the greatest writers of all time.. I feel like it's so cliche to speak about him particularly related to this subject but there always are the people who broke the ground and I think he's the one that broke the ground. People don't give a fuck. They love his music so so much. It's the people that break the stereotypes that make history but I just thought it was interesting to point that out about the fashion world and the music world and just culturally, it's reverse discrimination."
Interviewer,"How did you feel when you heard that your stepfather was going to transition and become a woman? Willo Perron, creative director."
Kanye,"You know the first thing I did think of is I thought about black radio hosts maybe possibly making jokes about it because the black culture is generally so homophobic. News cycles are just constantly.. They're just trying to find some news and some interesting things like, 'This rapper has this transgender person in his family and.. ' But then I was like fuck what people say. Fuck what people think. I feel proud to be in a family that has so many people breaking ground for the generations to come. I just feel like whoa reality show.. like that's so fucking new of an art form to the point where my wife and their family should have had plenty of Emmy's by now. But reality shows are considered to be like rap was when the Mondrian wouldn't let Run DMC and motherfucking Will Smith stay there because they were rappers.. or the idea of a reality star not being allowed into a fashion show or not being nominated for their show even if it's the longest running and the most popular and everybody I know watches it and shit. I feel proud that not only my contribution of the credibility that I gained and garnished from music - and just my general social opinions - that I could be next to a wave of thought of this is who I am. And that is all I'm about. Like fuck, to let your life be controlled by public opinion would be like asking to sit in traffic for the rest of your life. Meaning like you want to turn this way but there's a car right here, you want to turn that way but there's a car right there, you want to go a bit faster but there's a car right in front of you, you want to just stop, cars start honking at you. That's public opinion and Bruce just got off the exit sign and drove as fast as he wanted to. Oh sorry, it's disrespectful to use that name but I'm still getting acquainted with what's politically correct because it's new, it's modern. This is like Roman times, bro, this time that we have - this 100 years - is really the beginning of the future. We finally tapped into the type of technology and acceptance and thought that we need to.. Look at the new pope. It's a bunch of dope motherfuckers out here that are just pushing towards the future. It's funny that I went to this train of thought off of Willo's question because he is one of, if not the most important person in my creative growth. He is my number one instructor. He is the reason why I was able to know who Nick Knight was. He is my greatest home tutor and educator. As I said, I felt like I had the spark in me but Mike Tyson needed a custom model, Hercules needed that little trainer guy in that movie.. He is my greatest cultural coach - as far as Helvetica fonts go - and operatic stages and you know honing and training and riding bikes around Paris and analysing and philosophising about, you know, where the future can go. And the whole idea of Donda and what we do with design and the way we've simplified things. Album covers are important again, stage shows are important, the signs, long, only sonic outros to songs.. This is all like an extension of my times and my trainings with Willo."
Interviewer,Hundreds of people asked this. Next album: When's it actually coming? Tell us about the name. What are you trying to communicate with it? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"Well as I said when I first said that name, I wasn't sure if I was gonna keep that name but I just felt like I didn't want to walk around with the name So Help Me God for the amount of time I was working on the album. I just felt like that was a heavy backpack to carry. 'SWISH' just kind of lightened the load so I could let it be whatever I want it to be. So I could just work on the painting and find something which.. actually me and Nick today.. He just showed me a piece. I could say the idea but I was really inspired by some things and you can find the purpose through a painting, through a video, through a conversation, through a sunset, through a really tragic headline and it's like I was collecting these vibes and just things that I liked but the album had no purpose. And it was finding something that's like, wait a second okay, it can go to something like this, I always wanted to do this. I did Cool Summer because I wanted to shoot surround vision. I had this idea and for people out there who don't know what surround vision is, I was performing with Jay Z one night on Watch the Throne and I was just looking at how the whole audience were experiencing the performance and I thought of this theatre experience where it was a screen above us, below us, to the left of us, completely peripheral, to the right of us, and three screens in front of us and then we made this gyroscope system and put iPhones on it and recorded some kids running across the street. You saw them on this side, then you saw them in front of you then you saw them on that side. You heard them because we had a multiple speaker system, you saw the ground below you and you saw the sky above you. Two weeks later, we went to Qatar and shot a film.. My idea - because I couldn't get money from movie houses - I went to Def Jam and said look, I'll just do an album and the whole point was to get the budget. I was thinking this should be easy, you know, I've got all these rappers on my record label and blah blah blah. Then I ended up having to rap on seven songs and taking a while to finish the album. It still has a lot of amazing songs and the idea was I wanted to do an album that's more commercial on purpose. I want to show that I can make radio songs because before that it was 808 and Dark Fantasy. It was very heavy. I want to show I can do something that's lighter. I gave you this whole example to say the reason that I did the album was just so I could shoot that film."
Interviewer,A lot of people are asking about the films and what's happening with them and when they're going to get to see them. Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"Hopefully, yeah.. I'm working on some ideas on how to be able to bring it back. I don't want to make an announcement yet of when I think I'm bringing Cruel Summer back but we're working on something right now."
Interviewer,"In a lot of your last interviews, you focus so much more on fashion rather than music. It seems like your album has been delayed because you're working on your clothing lines. Is fashion your main passion instead of music? Does music not excite you in the way it did a few years ago? Yuval Goldman, 18, Israel."
Kanye,"No, it doesn't excite me like when I heard Wu Tang. Of course it doesn't excite me like that. It doesn't excite me like when I was using auto-tune for my first time. It wasn't my first time because I did it on College Dropout too. There were things to prove. There were purposes. There was Lauryn Hill and Dead Prez. There was this idea of mixing this kind of messaging meets the hotness of Rockafella and proving that this was a possible thing. I am an inventor. I am an innovator. It's fine for other people to proliferate on an idea but I get excited by ideas, not by responsibility. So sometimes when I'm even writing a rap, it starts to feel like a big responsibility. If you look at Andre 3000 - one of the top five greatest rappers of all time - the majority of the time, he actually only had to write one verse.. so as far as doing three verses, sometimes you start to feel more like you're doing a talk show every night than doing some type of prophetic, every two year speech. I believe that there's raps that I had that meant everything and I believe that there's certain raps that were hot and there was something that meant something about hearing something that was just hot. So I'm not gonna say it meant nothing, but it meant nothing for lack of a better way to describe it, you know. People could want so many things out of you and you don't want to let people down because of Michelangelo comments and things. You want to deliver genius, you want to prove people wrong, you want to prove people right that are fighting for you. And sometimes creatively because I'm held to task by the highest critics of every genre of art, I feel like I'm one of those guys that hundreds of years ago, they would steal something and their form of death would be to be tied to four horses then they'd whip all the horses at the same time and they'd pull the arms out of their sockets each way. That's how it feels when I'm getting pressure from all the different angles. It feels like my arms and legs are being pulled out of my body at the same time."
Interviewer,So there's no chance the album you're working on will be your last just to stop a bit of that pressure? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"I'd never call out what would be the last. I'd call out what would spark more inspiration. I will think of a philosophy or think of something I want to say. I think hm this would be a great opening line or maybe I want to abstract the way you even hear rap. A lot of people liked the original of 'All Day' better than the one that eventually got released and that was so much more like a freestyle but it left things really open which felt more like later Picasso works. Oh yes, as you guys know, I think I'm Picasso also or the closest thing to it. So lesser, equal or maybe even better. Maybe there's something that's more Cubist about the way I rap and that's what I'm trying to find where. It's like do you really need to paint every angel wing in? Their paintings weren't completely finished. And here's another thing. The majority of the things that are popular now are really directly based on something that I've done over the past ten years. You can pinpoint it. Like that was that album or that song."
Interviewer,Does that annoy you? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"I think it's amazing. I think I had a purpose. That was my purpose: to innovate. So if you hear something that sounds similar to something that I've done before, that is an extension of a new album for me."
Interviewer,"So a lot of the people you talk about who you really admire or who you think are talented, do you often see yourself in the work that they're making? Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"Yeah, completely."
Interviewer,"So people you've talked about working with or you've cited in conversations - Drake, Young Thug, all these different people - do you see that in their work? Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"I'm not trying to specify people but I just feel like there is a lot of influence and you can almost pinpoint the moments when things happened. But also, I was heavily influenced by Radiohead and James Brown and Coldplay and Jay Dillon and Jay Z and Tribe and Pharside and Dr Dre or Quincy Jones or Teddy Riley. So all of that was in my work too."
Interviewer,"With your lyrical process, is it important to you that the listener completely understands explicitly what you're saying, like with each line, or is it better that they just take the abstract emotional gist of the song? Grant Tyler."
Kanye,"It totally relates to what I said earlier about finding.. You know, I think that abstraction..  I wrote this thing down the other day. I hope my words don't get in the way of how I feel, my meaning. But words, fuck, you know, it's an extremely powerful tool that can be.. I just like abstracting music. I like to listen to Coltrane and say this is amazing. I feel an era of that. I feel a rise of that, possibly coming after so many words."
Interviewer,"A lot of people really relate to specific words. He said he listened a lot to particular aspects of your music and he talks about suffering from anxiety and PTSD and he said your music has got him through a lot. He asked what gets you through similar things because maybe it's your own music but he talks about when you're feeling anxious or you're feeling down or you're feeling depressed. What do you turn to? Carl Swaygan, 25, Florida."
Kanye,I just talk to my wife.
Interviewer,What did you do before that? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"Talk to my wife. Or talk to my would-be wife. I talk to my friends. I just talk. I get really explicit, you know, with the way that I feel at that time. I'm extremely open. That way, I can sweat the anxiety out. I open up the pores and sweat the anxiety out or sweat what I'm worried about or say, 'What are we doing? If this is a game or this is a war, how many soldiers did we just lose? What can we do differently to win and to prove everyone wrong?' I appreciate naysayers. I appreciate non-believers because also sometimes it's weird for me when people do believe in me. Like someone'll come up to me and be like, 'Man, I believe you're like Basquiat.' People say stuff like that to me and I'll just be like, 'Wait a second, only I can say that about myself.'."
Interviewer,"That's a question that someone asked about the pressure you feel on yourself because things like, 'I Am A God', this sense of you being a divine power, does that scare you? Does that freak you out? Lots of people wrote in and they said lovely things like his music's got me through the hardest time, he stopped me from committing suicide, he stopped me from fucking up my life. But you must feel a sense of pressure from that when people treat you like you are this kind of god to them. Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"The reason why I made the song 'I Am A God' is so those people that feel less than can turn it up and say it loud and embrace it for themselves, that God is inside all of us. It wasn't about specifically me. It was about us as a race; that we are an extension of God, that we all have God inside of us."
Interviewer,"One question that came in a lot was: If you could give yourself advice now to when you were dropping out of college, what advice would you give? Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"There's so many things that had to happen for me to be sitting here with you right now. It wouldn't be truthful for me to give a statement as arrogant as 'I wouldn't change a thing' because when I sit on a long flight to Paris, all I do is wallow in the things that I wish I could have changed, things that I would have tweaked. So as far as the college thing - I don't seem to wallow on that that much but if you asked me a straightforward question about it, I'd say the more education, the better. The more you know.. Well, sometimes you can know too much especially if you don't have the opportunity to do things and it can drive you crazy. And that's a bit of what the Yeezus period was like. To know that I was simply not succeeding due to lack of resource, due to lack of assistance, and to have shown so many times that you had an ability but for people to doubt your ability because you're not playing your position; the position that they want you to play. You're not tall enough to be centre or something like that."
Interviewer,What was the scariest moment of your life? Malik Davis.
Kanye,"Probably my car accident. A lot of time, I try to find answers that are like, 'Mmm I wouldn't have expected that.' But yeah, that was pretty scary."
Interviewer,"You talk about luxury and about the only luxury we have being time. What do you spend most of your time doing? Rebecca Carrington, 22, Manchester."
Kanye,Working on luxury. That probably is it. I do spend the majority of my time working on my goals to create this creative ecosystem that allows a bunch of ideas to flow through them. I'm sure Nick could probably relate to that. I probably spend the most time on trying to create something that allows me to create everything.
Interviewer,"Thinking about improving the world, what would you do to make London better? Boris Johnson, Mayor of London."
Kanye,"Widen the streets. Because I get really scared when there's a truck driver coming. Like, how did they miss that truck?"
Interviewer,"How do you think your portrayal through lyrics, visual, quotes of the black woman formed pop culture's understanding of black women? And do you think it is within the function of contemporary black male rappers to uplift their female counterparts in the face of adversity? Alani Nelson, 21, Maryland."
Kanye,"I definitely think generally, rap is misogynistic and it's just a part of - not saying it's justifying the culture - I definitely think I've said 'Bitch, get out the car' in some of my lyrics and stuff like that. And is there a responsibility? I feel like rap, for the 20 years that I've studied it, it's only, as a whole, responsible to trend. So the only way that specifically what she's talking about would be hurt more if it was more in style. Rap is a communication of trend. It's a communication of the way people are in real life. It's a communication of what someone just said to their girlfriend on the phone or an argument they just had or something positive that just happened. What I notice is, there was a time when we had afro-centric rap and everybody was like how Common is. It was like 'my queen, this, that.' You haven't even heard the word 'queen' so long in that context. What I've noticed is when I come home from a meeting with some head of a studio and I just get completely dissed and I show them a bunch of creative things - like on Despicable Me where he was trying to show his mum he could make a rocket and she was like, 'Whatever, that's weak.' That's how it is going to meet with people in Hollywood and showing them your ideas. They just shit on you, like 'We don't need that, it's weak.' And I'll come home and I'll find myself being more irritated and maybe being more rude with my wife. So let's take that to the idea of a black male in America not getting a job or getting fucked with at his job or getting fucked with by the cops or being looked down upon by this lady at Starbucks and he goes home to his girl and.. Just to think about my frustration and if I was rude to my wife because of that, we are like super well off to the point where this guy is like, 'I can't take my kids school shopping if I knock my manager the fuck out if he says this to me one more time.' They cannot drink the Ye juice at all. They cannot turn up at all. It's like you scream at the person closest to you. This song that Chief Keef put out that I sang the chorus on - I was singing I scream at you cause I can't scream at nobody else - and then take that and you go to a studio and that frustration and disrespect is now coming out towards the woman next to you or the women around. Like we can't wife you, you're just a thot, we can't do this, blah, blah, blah. And the guys around are just like, 'You'd better not say that to them or I'ma shoot you.' It's from lack of opportunity. It's from being inside of traffic - that thing I told you earlier - that lack of ability to see a way out and you just start being frustrated inside of that space.. and then you go into the studio and that's what it's gonna sound like. 'I'ma shoot you, fuck you, bitch' because that 'fuck you, bitch' came from America. That 'fuck you, bitch' came from our lack of opportunities. That 'nigga, I'ma shoot you' came from racism which is an amazing tool. It's like if you could put racism in the battery of your phone, it would never stop working. It works on itself. It's residual and shit. Residual racism is to be in a racist situation where you're working at this fucking job downtown blah blah blah, they're treating you like shit, and you go home and you're just mad at everybody. It's like black people don't even like black people at a certain point. Racism is the hate that keeps on hating. And I said this thing, I was sitting with Steve McQueen when we showed our piece that we did on 'All Day' and it we put it in the LACMA. Let me say that again just to purely be a dick because I said that knowing it was a stunt and very intellectual. So me and Steve McQueen.. I think it's a very impressive thing to say shit like that right after saying nigga, nigga, fuck, fuck, wee, wee, wee. I said, 'I just embrace racism.' He just looked at me like, 'What the fuck do you mean, you embrace racism?' I was like no, it's here. This thing is like we're in a jail cell. Are we gonna keep fighting this? How do we just embrace what's in front of us as opposed to always pinpointing that it's the reason you're being held back? But I realised in order to truly be one of the greatest artists and one of the most remembered artists - I'ma get off the social subject and switch it more into the art and fashion context again - is that same assistance that I begged for and got frustrated for.. The fact that I'm starting to do it without some of that assistance is what makes it truly historical and what demands the respect. And that's the reason why even in the beginning, there's like an intellectual olive branch of 'Your show had more meaning than just being an oversized sweatshirt.' I refused that intellectual.. Get that fucking branch out of my face. I ain't gonna take it. I ain't gonna take the meaning that you proposed upon me. This is what I meant and if it's not good enough for you, then fuck you. My Aunt, one time, she let me see Robocop and my Dad was really strict and I came home and was about to tell him and she grabbed me and said, 'You're really a glutton for punishment, aren't you?' Almost like a masochist or some shit, right. And like in a way, I am. I kinda like pain, I like the challenge, I like making things harder for myself because if you can beat the game on the hardest mode possible, you'll be the best of all time. So that means if I become a good designer as a black straight American entertainer, rich dude, all the type of shit that says you shouldn't be able to have any creative thoughts, then it's like the ultimate fucking win. Then you're like Eminem or Tiger Woods or Barack Obama, just someone who just completely broke all boundaries.. And it's exciting. This interview is exciting because it's such a battle of perception and a battle of the intellects and a battle of culture and a battle of class, a battle of taste. It's like y'all motherfuckers know I'm gonna win this battle. It's so fun though. It's so fun. Because the whole trick I always say is I'm an artist and an artist can basically take on any shape, form and an artist can paint anything. So when I'm like opening up the Yeezus mountain on tour and stuff with the Margiela mask.. you know, some nights in the middle of one of my rants, I'm just like I'm sorry, the gig is up. I was actually never really a rapper, I was always an artist and that's the reason why I'm just killing this shit so hard right now. So when you talk to the lighting guys, it might not come out as good but don't feel bad because I've been trained since age 5 and went to college for this shit. It's always like that secret thing, you know. It's about sharing information. Jews are a culture that share information. That does not happen in the black community. For your family, your son, maybe. Day one, this is how this community works. This is how we grow together. And that racism, slave mentality, nigga mentality, show off mentality, I'ma fuck your bitch mentality, all that is like what makes a culture that has all the highest physical attributes going for it the weakest due to simply - like that speech DiCaprio gave on Django - simply removing the esteem and that is why I refuse to fucking back down. You have to know that you are somebody. You have to know that it's possible whether you're creative, whether you're a black person in America, whether you're a black person in London, you know, you have to know it's possible. You have to see me keep winning against all odds. I will win until I die. I won't lose. I can't lose because then it's like they win; 'they' meaning the mentality, the old guard of thought because we're just a thought. A hundred years from now, we're all just memories."
Interviewer,"Do you feel it's true all creatives die alone due to lack of understanding? In some ways, what you're saying, you sound super positive but in other ways, there is that sense of pessimism and people not understanding. Do you think that statement's true? Ian Connor, style influencer."
Kanye,"Well, I've said a bunch of wild shit and my wife hasn't left me yet so let's hope not. But I think there will be someone who will understand everyone. I don't know. Maybe there is a someone for everyone. I'm trying to be overly positive."
Interviewer,I can't really think of anything profound that I don't already know about you.. so here's a really simple question that I actually don't know. What would your last meal be? Kim Kardashian West.
Kanye,Oh it'd definitely be some of her home cooked fried chicken.
Interviewer,"Going back to the women thing, it's a question I want to know. Would you say you're a feminist? Lou Stoppard."
Kanye,"I think I'm a humanist. Is that a party? But yeah, come on, like so many black kids in America, I was raised majority by my Mum. My Dad was around - I would see him in the summers and the springtime. But I think I fight for the importance of any community that is not being properly accredited - just period - of anything. This statement is going to sound kinda gay but I'm gonna say it. I love older white men, but basically if you're not an older white man, you don't run shit. It's always gonna be more of a fight for anyone that isn't an older white man. Period. So I like to speak on behalf of people without a voice and sometimes that could be a creative, sometimes that could be a woman, sometimes that could be a man turned into a woman. My dad five years ago would live in a homeless shelter to counsel with ex-drug addicts and, you know, he really cares about people. It's like as soon as he moved to where he is now, he was like, 'How can we improve the water here? How can we improve the education system? I just met this girl. She's in this situation with her family. This and that. What can we do to improve this?' That's all he cared about. It's caring about people. So there's something where it's like I live my life, I get to be a rockstar, a rapper, this, that, and then at a certain point, it's at that moment where you just look and you see people dying and being on top of their roof and you just look at the camera and say George Bush doesn't care about.. and that's like my dad and that's my mum. I'll go to a football game and I'll be looking at the game and I'll watch the score and I look at the human score meaning like the 50,000 people there and I start to zone in and think like where did this person come from? What did they go through? What type of job have they got? What brought us all here today? What are their interests? It's like sometimes that part of my dad comes out of me that starts to get really intrigued with who people are. So even when I design, I am going to make the Apple of clothing. I don't think there's a purpose of saying you want to do it because it's obvious I want to.. But want is like this politically correct way to word your future accomplishments. This one guy was super snobby with me at a fashion dinner, of course. And I explained to him that there was a time when people said I couldn't rap and he asked me, 'Oh, so is this what you hope to do in clothing?' I was like I don't hope. I execute. As far as apparel goes, I will make the Apple of apparel and the Apple of apparel isn't high street. It isn't fast fashion. It isn't a $9000 sweatshirt. It's the thing you want to keep for the rest of your life. Just looking at human beings, sometimes you present things, people don't even know that they want it yet. I could show you two photographs. I'll show you a really well-known designer that's highly respected blah blah blah that I pulled as a reference to proportion because they had this silk jacket. It almost looked like a lining fabric. If I describe it too well, they'll know what I'm talking about. I don't want to say the person's name but it had like denim on denim and like a sock on a shoe and different things like that. It was after I did my sock shoe. And I had a photo I had just done and the guy had an olive jacket on, cotton on cotton, self-lined, a tank top.. The colour, I probably couldn't even describe it, almost an orange but really subtle, and the shorts are like some beautiful light brown with a bit of grey in it and the guy was black that the clothes were on. And everyone who I showed those two images together, now, the one image, you even know who the designer is and it's top five designers in the game and you see this image right here. And I'm like which one? And people always pick this one because of the colours and people don't even understand how important colour is as an opinion in clothing. Give a fuck if I got any of the cuts right on the last collection. Anyone who doesn't say 'I had an emotional connection to the colour palette', they don't even know how to see anymore. They don't even know what they're looking at. They see clothes and they're looking at numbers. They're not feeling emotion. They're thinking about trend. They're not seeing future. They're not seeing luxury. They're not seeing time like oh shit, I wanna go to the park with my family. I'll just throw this on. That's what I want to do: is present something that gives people some of their time back because it works together like Lego and you just throw it on. And I'm not saying that I mastered it by season 2 for Christ's sake. I didn't hit 'Watch the Throne' and 'Dark Fantasy' on my second mixtape. But the theory is there and only I can do it. Only I care about it that much. Only I have the exact 2 and 3 code in my head. I could say it out loud. I could say oh this army surplus but look at how far we jumped from army surplus in the second season. So just think about where we'll be by season 3. Look at how far we jumped. Cause I have the code in my head. You have to cut open my head and take my brain and put it on top of some big organisation and you can't. It's like completely, you know, that sweatshirt, that T-shirt decision I'm making is a piece of my mum having me at Operation Push at age five, it's a piece of my dad going to the homeless shelter, it's a piece of my grandfather having a store where he fixed furniture in the back, it's a piece of my cousin bootlegging cross colours out in LA, it's a piece of my Aunt that was the chicest woman that I knew. Even when she had Alzheimers, she would dress better than the entire family and I remember the colours and they remind me of the colours that we were able to find. We were able to start to find and penetrate this concept by the second season without being held back by the fabrics that were available, to do all-black and only have a navy blah blah blah. I don't use blue. It bugs me out."
Interviewer,"Tell me about the colour blue. Kim Jones, director of menswear at Louis Vuitton."
Kanye,"Yeah, I hate the colour blue. On this collection, Katherine Hamnett was emailing me about how I had to have blue jeans and how I'd need to have a white shirt and this and that about.. I was like I guess I could see how I would need that but like I said, I like to make it harder for myself by just doing what I want to do."
Interviewer,You say you like to make things hard for yourself and you're so driven and you're so passionate. You're obviously ambitious. Are you happy? Lou Stoppard.
Kanye,"So so so so happy. And I'm happy for the normal reasons to be happy because I married the woman of my dreams and I have a beautiful daughter and so many beautiful people around me and my cousins and families in different states - there's so many loving people. I have a son on the way. I have a lot of life ahead of me and I have the opportunity to be completely rogue and to be able to support myself being who I am exactly and now I've even opened up a whole new place to create by being able to do apparel and then going in and doing film and being able to take those horses that at one point were pulling in all these different directions and pulling my arms out of my sockets and re-aim them in one direction and have the most powerful four horses running towards you; that tsunami about to hit, that earthquake about to come in. Some people might not see it and for the people who don't see it and don't understand what's about to happen, you know, certain people are visionaries, certain people are early adopters, certain people are just followers. So I take it that the most negative reaction is from the followers."
Interviewer,"My guest tonight is a 21-time Grammy award winning performer, who last month threatened his very existence by threatening one of America's most beloved television personalities. We had a big dumb fight on Twitter, but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight. Please welcome Kanye West!"
Kanye,I'm okay.
Interviewer,"I'm very happy that you came. I'm glad you did, and I wanted to clear this up. I really felt bad about all this stuff. I did."
Kanye,Mm-hmm.
Interviewer,"I guess the first question I should ask is, who are you wearing?"
Kanye,It's Ralph.
Interviewer,Kramden? Lauren?
Kanye,Nah they've been in my mouth for three years.
Interviewer,That one on the bottom? OK well it's good to see you.
Kanye,Good seeing you too.
Interviewer,"I guess we should talk about what happened, because I do think that somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you're coming from is that true?"
Kanye,"Yeah, correct."
Interviewer,"So we did a sketch on the show where we had - you did an interview with the BBC Radio and it was an intense interview - and I'll be honest with you, I only saw a couple of little parts of the  interview when we did this sketch."
Kanye,"Yeah, that's what I thought."
Interviewer,"In fairness, there was context to it and we took it out of context. And we had a couple of little kids reenact it. Which I didn't think would be something that bothered you. Do you mind if we show a little clip of it?"
Kanye,"I mean everyone out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know that I've never done a publicity stunt in my life. Any time I went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was always what I thought was the truth. Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt emotionally. I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say. So I don't do publicity stunts, period. So don't ever think that."
Interviewer,"Me neither guys. So we talked on the phone, and I didn't really know why you were calling. I heard you were upset. But I didn't know the context, and we had a bad conversation, right?"
Kanye,"Yeah, I knew you before. And I saw you at a wedding and I remember you telling me, I want people to know this side of you and different things like this and I saw this good guy at the wedding. So when I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the way through because I didn't want to be infuriated - I was like I know you. So it was a combination of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch. And me not knowing this person. So I was like this is the one person I know. So I can go and let out everything that I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people feel is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals or act like what they're saying is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious. And you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just had as men.. that elevates sometimes, you take a guy, Jimmy does his thing. And I do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and we kind of just took it back to high school for a minute."
Interviewer,"And I got beat up a lot in high school, So I didn't wanna go back to high school."
Kanye,"I'm not running for office, I'm just here to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music. And you know when I did that  interview, I was really vocal about a lot of things that I've been dealing with over the past 10 years, when I was put in the classification of ""just a celebrity."" Because you know for me, I'm a creative genius and there's no other way to word it. I know you're not supposed to say that about yourself, and I say things the wrong way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I wanna bring more things to the world, I want to help the world. I want to make peoples' lives easier. I spent 2 of my checks in telemarketing when I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is before there was H&M and Zara, you couldn't just find cool stuff when you were growing up. And for me, I care about cool stuff. It means something to me, it means stuff to a lot of people that are like me, and that's what I was talking about on the Zane interview."
Interviewer,"I wanna go back to one thing you said which is when you say you're a genius that upsets people, but the truth is a lot people think they're geniuses, and nobody says it because it's weird to say it, but it is most certainly more honest to say I am a genius.."
Kanye,"I'm totally weird, and I'm totally honest, and I'm totally inappropriate sometimes. And the thing is for me to say I wasn't a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself."
Interviewer,"That's true, it's false humility."
Kanye,"Oh my god. It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get off the plane, here's your false humility. Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this agency they'll give you a star on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass. But it's like that's not what we're doing. By the way, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame, because they said something like they're not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she's a reality star. It's like people are so so dated and not modern. There's no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn't have a star on the Walk of Fame. Its ridiculous old concepts. And you know for me, I'm just gonna give y'all the truth. It's like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my grandmother hated Ali 'til she passed. So you're gonna love me or you're gonna hate me, but I'm gonna be me."
Interviewer,"Kanye, it's great to be with you."
Kanye,Great to be here.
Interviewer,"And these are two friends of mine. And Kanye has been a friend of mine for a long time. And Jim is, Jim came out of nowhere, and he said, ""I like what the President is doing."" A long time ago we met. Right? And I just appreciated it very much. And, you know, if you look at the employment numbers, if you look at the median income, if you look at every single indicator, we're keeping our promise, Jim. Thank you. And I want to thank you."
Kanye,You stopped the war.
Interviewer,"We really stopped the war. Saved millions of lives. You know, Seoul has 30 million people. You don't realize how big. Thirty million people who are right near the border; 30 miles off the border. Millions of people would have been killed. And I will say, Chairman Kim has been really good. Really good. And we've made a lot of progress. That's nice that you say that, because that's a big, that's a big thing. These folks were covering, they were covering North Korea not, I think not very promisingly. And there were a lot of problems. President Obama said that was his biggest problem. And I don't say anything is solved."
Kanye,"You, day one, solved one of the biggest problems."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,We solved one of the biggest problems.
Interviewer,"It was a big solving. And not solved yet, but I think we're along, I think we're on the way."
Kanye,"Yeah, we have Larry Hoover's lawyer with us today. And it's a prisoner that was focused on, he has six life sentences, and they have him next to the Unabomber doing 23 and 1. That means."
Interviewer,What did he do? Larry? What happened?
Kanye,What prison is that? Name the prison.
Interviewer,"ADX supermax, in Florence, Colorado. They house the Unabomber, al Qaeda operatives, mass killers, Oklahoma City bomber, things of that nature."
Kanye,"And really, the reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around. So there's theories that there's infinite amounts of universe and there's alternate universe. So it's very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I'm moving back to Chicago and it's not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer and having a monolithic voice that's forced to be a specific party. You know, people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrat. I have a, I've had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat. They say, you know, first of all, it's a limited amount of jobs. So the fathers lose the jobs, and they say, ""We'll give you more money for having more kids in your home."" And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the '80s and the '90s, and the prison rates just shot up. And now you have ""Chiraq,"" what people call ""Chiraq"", which is actually, our murder rate is going down by 20 percent every year. I just talked to the superintendent; met with Michael Sacks; that's Rahm's right-hand man. So I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends. But this hat, it gives me, it gives me power, in a way. You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home. And also, I'm married to a family that, laughs, you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It's beautiful, though. But there's times where, you know, there's something about, you know, I love Hillary. I love everyone, right? But the campaign ""I'm with her"" just didn't make me feel, as a guy, that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman. That was my, that's my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cape. For me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys, non-political, no bullshit, put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay, and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. Because at Adidas, when I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now we have a $38 billion market cap. It's called the ""Yeezy effect."" And I went to Casper. We had a meeting in Chicago. And I said, ""You have to bring manufacturing onshore."" And not even shore; into the core. It's not about the border; it's the core of Adidas. And Chicago is the core of Middle America. And we have to make Middle America strong. So I had the balls, because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, for no, because it's habilitation, not rehabilitation, because they didn't have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone that taught us. They didn't teach us. Exactly, we had no one that ""taught"" us. Right? So it's more important than any specific deal, anything, that we bring jobs into America, and that we provide a transition with mental health and the Amer-I-Can education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he's worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWork has a beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation. There's a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say ""abolish"" with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that's a trap door? If you're building a floor, the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you, accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up, you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship. The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment, and I think the way the universe works, it's perfect. We don't have 13 floors, do we? You know, so the four, the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn't look like the people they were amending. Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read, or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave. Again, so what I think is, we don't need sentences; we need pardons. We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain, it's equal on three parts. I'm going to go ahead drop some bombs for you, 98 percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, inaudible, so I'm going to work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent, Tesla, Freud. So he said that I actually wasn't bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name. So all this power that I got, and I'm taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn't be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage. And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That's one thing, I've never stepped into a situation where I didn't make people more money. So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories. We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring, Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota."
Interviewer,Wisconsin.
Kanye,Fifty-three thousand.
Interviewer,Wisconsin. Yeah. Wisconsin.
Kanye,"Yeah. Wisconsin. They have 4,000 jobs. People making $53,000 a year. And one of the things we got to set is Ford to have the highest design. The dopest cars. The most amazing. I don't really say ""dope."" I don't say negative words and try to flip them. We just say positive, lovely, divine universal words. So the flyest, freshest, most amazing car. And what we want to start with is, I brought a gift with me right here. This right here is the iPlane1. It's a hydrogen-powered airplane. And this is what our President should be flying in. Look at this, Jared.."
Interviewer,We'll get rid of Air Force One. Can we get rid of Air Force One? No? You don't like that idea.
Kanye,"Well, we're going to have Apple, an American company, work on this plane with, But you know what I don't like about, it's not that I don't like, what I need *Saturday Night Live* to improve on, or what I need the liberals to improve on is, if he don't look good, we don't look good. This is our President."
Interviewer,It's true.
Kanye,"He has to be the freshest, the flyest, the flyest planes, the best factories. And we have to make our core be in power. We have to bring jobs into America because our best export is entertainment and ideas. But when we make everything in China and not in America, then we're cheating on our country and we're putting people in positions to have to do illegal things to end up in a cheapest factory ever"
Interviewer,"I'll tell you what, that was pretty impressive, folks. You know, I hate to say this, Jim, do you want to say something? What do you after that?"
Kanye,It was from the soul. I just channeled it.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"I think we need to care about all people. And I believe that when I went on to NBC, I was very emotional, and I was programmed to think from a victimized mentality. A welfare mentality. I think that with blacks and African Americans, we really get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry. We say if people don't have land, they settle for brands. We want Polo-sporting Obama again. We want a brand more than we want land. Because we've haven't known how it feels to actually have our own land and have ownership of our own blocks. So when you don't have ownership, then it's all about how something looks. It's about the patina; it's not about the soul, it's not about the core. So we focus more on, is somebody wearing something; is someone disrespecting so I got to shoot them. Or the idea of someone being racist. You know, we talk about police murders, which we definitely have to discuss, and we have to bring nobility to the police officers and make, the police officers are just like us. But there's this whole hate-building, right? And that's a major thing about racial tension. And we also, as black people, we have to take a responsibility for what we're doing. We kill each other more than police officers. And that's not saying that the police officer is not is not an issue, because they are in a place, a position of power. But sometimes they're in a place of law enforcement. They need to be law-power. It's force versus power. And when you, you shouldn't have to force people to do that. So a lot of times the police officer is sitting there, they're being forced to do this and forced to do that block. And then they force somebody into something and force into something. We have to release the love throughout the entire country and give opportunities. A lot of times it's just the overall lack of reparations that we, at any given point, we say, ""Oh, this is racist. This is racist. This is racist. This is racist."" So we don't have reparations, but we have the 13th Amendment. We got to open up the whole conversation. So, and that's a move. One of the moves that I love that liberals try to do, the liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism, because they know that we are very proud, emotional people. So when I said ""I like Trump"" to, like, someone that's liberal, they'll say, ""Oh, but he's racist."" You think racism could control me? Oh, that don't stop me. That's an invisible wall."
Interviewer,"But you don't think, you reject those who say he's racist?"
Kanye,"On your question, and you had one question; we're going to do it to another question."
Interviewer,Laughs. Okay.
Kanye,I answered your question. I don't answer questions in simple soundbites. You are tasting a fine wine. It has multiple notes to it. You better play 4D chess with me like it's *Minority Report*. Because it ain't that simple. It's complex.
Interviewer,"When would you like, I'm from the *Chicago Sun Times*, sir. I would like to know what you would like to ask President Trump to do for Chicago. You're here to talk about crime in Chicago."
Kanye,"The thing that the head of the police and Mike Sacks met with me last night at the Soho House about was we feel that stop and frisk does not help the relationships in the city. And everyone that knew I was coming here said, ""Ask about stop and frisk."" That's the number-one thing that we're having this conversation about. Another thing is opening up industries. And we've got to get some tax breaks too. Because we're making, we got a Speedfactory in Atlanta, but the shoes are costing us $300, so it's costing us too much to make things. So we need some prototypes here so we can get people back working, so China can't just beat us and Vietnam can't beat us. You got Levi's, the greatest jeans company in the world, making their jeans in Vietnam. So we're going to need to get a few breaks to be able to have some places in my hometown of Chicago, and 2.7 million to the 9 million surrounding suburbs where we can create some factories. Now, I think it would be cool for them to be Trump factories, because he's a master of industry. He's a builder. And I think it would be cool to have Yeezy ideation centers, which would be a mix of education that empowers people and gives them modern information like, sometimes people say, ""This kid has ADD. This kid has ADD."" He don't have ADD. School is boring. It was boring. It's not as exciting as this. We have to make it more exciting. We have to mix curriculums. You play basketball while you're doing math. You learn about music while you meditate in the morning. We have to instate mental health and art programs back into the city. So those are, And also, Larry Hoover is an example of a man that was turning his life around, and as soon as he tried to turn his life around, they hit him with six life sentences. So I believe he's, you say don't tear down the statues? Larry Hoover is a living statue. He's a beacon for us that needs to see his family; that needs to go out and represent. When you have a block leader on every single block, they can own the block as their own. That's something I learned from Jim Brown, from ""Amer-I-Can."" We need to put curriculums for people who really came from the streets, not people who were just trying to set us up to go into a work system or prison system that applies to what people are really going through, which Jim Brown has created."
Interviewer,"What about gun violence? With all the debate about the Second Amendment going on, how do you fix that?"
Kanye,"The problem is illegal guns. Illegal guns is the problem, not legal guns. We have the right to bear arms."
Interviewer,President Trump has said that he favors stop and frisk. Are guys going to be discussing that? Do you think you can change his mind?
Kanye,"Yeah. We're going to discuss that. I didn't mean to put you on blast like that, bro, but."
Interviewer,"No, no. It's okay.."
Kanye,But this is definitely a.
Interviewer,"Hey, I'm open-minded. I'm here. I am open-minded."
Kanye,Only after him. It'll be 2024.
Interviewer,Could very well be. That's good. I'm glad to hear that.
Kanye,"We have a good, and the thing is, let's stop worrying about the future. All we really have is today. We just have today. Over and over and over again, the eternal return. The hero's journey. And Trump is on his hero's journey right now. And he might not have expected to have a crazy motherfucker like Kanye West run up and support, but best believe we are going to make America great. Now, the thing is my, another thing is black people have an issue with the word ""again."" And I believe, my feeling from that is because I'm going to throw, I'm going to go all the way, inaudible, because time is a myth. All we have is now. All we have is today. So the word ""again"", it doesn't hurt us because the idea of racism and slavery, different things; it hurts us because we need to focus on who we are now, today, I believe. So I actually brought some hats in that have a bit of a transition. I'm not trying to put you, inaudible in the spot a little bit. I made a hat that says ""Make America Great."" Just that. But I would love to see, at the Super Bowl, Trump wearing the ""Make America Great"" hat; Colin making, wearing the ""Make America Great, and showing that we can bend a bit on this side, we can bend a bit on this side, and we can learn how to be malleable in the infinite universe that we are and the loving beings that we are. That we don't have to stick to our own traditions. And we aren't a side. We are one unit. We are one country. We are one moment in history and time. We might have been here before, but right now we're here together. And our greatest value that people have are other people. And we need to stop working on inaudible. It's like gang again."
Interviewer,Let me ask you this question. You're in the Oval Office.
Kanye,Okay. Laughs..
Interviewer,How does it feel to be in the Oval Office?
Kanye,"Oh, it is good energy in this."
Interviewer,Isn't it good energy?
Kanye,It's good energy.
Interviewer,"It's a great place. Jim, how do you feel?"
Kanye,"You said, you said, I guess, you know I love you."
Interviewer,I know.
Kanye,Did I.
Interviewer,"But I don't want to take, I don't want to put you in that spot, but."
Kanye,"No, I'm standing in that spot. I love this guy right here. Let me give this guy a hug right here. I love this guy right here."
Interviewer,"That's really nice. Come here. That's really nice. And that's from the heart. I didn't want to put you in that position. But that's from the heart. Special guy. These two are special people. Whether you like it, whether you don't like it, they're special people. And I appreciate it. Jim, Kanye, I appreciate it. So let's go have some lunch. Thank you all very much."
Kanye,"Oh, OK, dope, You still got the Nashville number."
Interviewer,"I still have the Nashville um, area code but I had to change it."
Kanye,"For all my Southside as that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex."
Interviewer,"I'm like, this close to overexposure."
Kanye,"Oh, well, this one is .. I think this is a really cool thing to have."
Interviewer,"I know, I mean it's like a compliment, kind of."
Kanye,"What I give a f-k is about is just you as a person, and as a friend."
Interviewer,That's sweet.
Kanye,I want things that make you feel good. I don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.
Interviewer,"Um, yeah, I mean go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue-in-cheek either way. .. And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice."
Kanye,"Yeah, I just have a responsibility to you as a friend. .. Thanks for being so cool about it."
Interviewer,"Well, thanks, yeah. I really appreciate it. The head's up is so nice. .. Even asking or seeing if I'd be OK with it. I just really appreciate it. I never would have expected you to, like, tell me about one of the lines in your song."
Kanye,"Relationships are more important than punch lines, you know?"
Interviewer,"GQ: I'm going to start recording, cool?"
Kanye,"Kanye West: I think words are one of our lowest forms of communication. Music, sound, food, dancing are nonverbal forms of communication. We get so wrapped up into words. We got to make things that are speechless. We have to make things that leave people speechless. We have to make things to the level where no one can say anything."
Interviewer,"Before we get to the architecture and homes, I want to understand what you're up to now in terms of clothing development. What's the latest?"
Kanye,"We've been developing new products for two years now. I love having the opportunity to iterate on a piece of apparel. It's therapeutic and it brings me great joy. There's times when people used to tell me, ""You shouldn't work on clothes."" And I wouldn't allow people to tear down my happiness. There's times where, now that we're doing couture again."
Interviewer,"At Yeezy, you mean?"
Kanye,"Yes. At Yeezy. At Kanye West. Whatever you want to call it. At my office. We're doing couture. And I get to talk about a color palette for one hour. A lot of people would have suggestions: ""Go take a jog. Go get some fresh air."" Colors are my fresh air. And every piece that I make, it's not only something that I would wear, I would never make anything that you wouldn't catch me in, they're also art pieces. Everything I've ever done has been an art piece, because I'm an artist."
Interviewer,Whether it's music or..
Kanye,Any action. Any word. Anything. Even this conversation right now.
Interviewer,Sometimes it seems like you're never done iterating. How do you know when a project is done? You even kept changing The Life of Pablo after you released it.
Kanye,Nothing is ever done. That could be the new N.E.R.D. album: Nothing's Ever Really Done.
Interviewer,How does that apply here in Cody? Because you're developing these hugely ambitious multiyear projects.
Kanye,"The word ambitious is not allowed to be used around me. Kanye West is nothing if not ambitious. Because ambition, when I hear it, it says that it seems like it's almost impossible."
Interviewer,As though it has far-fetched tucked into it?
Kanye,"Far-fetched! Yeah, it's got far-fetched tucked into it. You would be amongst 100 or 200 people on the planet who are like the least racist white person possible. But it's something about the word ambitious that makes me feel like I'm young Venus Williams doing the TV interview when her dad had to come and defend her. If you say, ""Yo, it's ambitious,"" I need Venus and Serena Williams's dad to run up and say, ""How you going to say it's ambitious? He said he was going to do it!"" Have I ever not done anything I said I was going to do? I made it back from addiction, I beat the predictions, brought real to the fictions, that's off the new album."
Interviewer,Does the fact that nothing is ever really done slow down the momentum of everything you're creating?
Kanye,"Time and space are man-made constructs. That's my answer to that question right there. Art never fully explains itself, and art is never fully done. Me being normal, that's not even a true statement. You know what normal is to me? An act. I can act normal, and that's me as Clark Kent. But artists are people who have embraced themselves as a superhero."
Interviewer,"Sometimes, when I see you refusing to be Clark Kent in certain situations, I'm like, ""Please just be Clark Kent for a minute! It will save you so much trouble!""."
Kanye,"Yeah, I feel like there's a job to be unwilling to make compromise. I like when people don't have to compromise themselves to collaborate. Even as an artist, or as a composer, I compose the strongest talents and push them to be the maximum version of their superhero. People spend one day with me and they're thinking about their own ideas outside of the box. If people spend years, they should be able to make it to the Super Bowl. To have blind faith is the ultimate confidence. Sometimes it could have felt like it was arrogant. And I think that the arrogance could have come from the fact that I wasn't working for God, but I was working for my ego, which is like working for the devil."
Interviewer,"I feel like this conversation that we're having, I'm not having to use ego, because everything is defined. We're on a piece of the 12,000 acres that I own in Wyoming. It's different than me being inside a photography studio where previous to that there was somebody posing in their underwear, after that there's somebody showing a backpack. There's already a comfortability here, and then we've known each other for a long time, and then a lot of what sounded crazy or ambitious at a certain point has already been proven."
Kanye,"You seem really focused on architecture right now, developing and building these domes."
Interviewer,"When I visited the Tadao Ando Art Island in 2018, there were three James Turrells next to each other and I said, ""We need to live in a Turrell."" The funny thing is, the first time I ever talked to Turrell on the phone was the night I ended the Saint Pablo Tour. And the last thing I ever said on that tour was, ""The show's over."" Which felt like my mom talking through me."
Kanye,How so? Like she was telling you through your own voice to stop?
Interviewer,"Yeah, and telling everyone else. Like, ""My son is not just here to fill up these sports arenas. My son's got something else to do.""."
Kanye,And now the ground out here is broken and the next phase has begun.
Interviewer,"Yes. The ground between the two lakes is broken. Before, I was working with Axel Vervoordt on revitalizing  that started as a McMansion and is now an iconic home that informs a lot of other people's homes, just from my wife's Instagram Stories. That was a language that Axel guided that would cap, for me, the end of the vicennium. I would just word it like that and let people Google."
Kanye,"I mean, I'm going to have to Google vicennium."
Interviewer,"A vicennium is 20 years. So it capped the end of the vicennium. We begged Axel to redo the space. This is before I went to the hospital. I felt like I might go crazy, and we felt like having this wabi-sabi space might help deter that."
Kanye,"When you say ""we,"" do you mean you and Kim?"
Interviewer,"No, it was me and longtime collaborator Vanessa Beecroft. Vanessa literally said to Axel, ""You must do this to save Kanye's life.""."
Kanye,No pressure! And he said?
Interviewer,"Yes! And now we're really good friends. We were at James Turrell's crater on my birthday, June 8, 2019, and Turrell designed an entire home and gave it to me on my birthday."
Kanye,What did he physically hand to you?
Interviewer,"A sketch. Axel was saying that James Turrell's spaces are too pure for us human beings to live in, and I told Axel, ""You're not going to bully me on my birthday.""."
Kanye,Was being Kanye West a help or a hindrance in establishing a relationship with James Turrell and Axel Vervoordt?
Interviewer,"A lot of people are celebrities because they're vibrating at such a high energy. They're just stars. I felt that me and James always had that connection. That first time I talked to him, I was literally screaming at the top of my lungs about how important it was for us to work together."
Kanye,That didn't send him running the other way?
Interviewer,"Well, you know, not everybody's a pussycat! That would be the Christian way to say it. Some people actually like energy."
Kanye,"I want to understand the timeline of your rebirth as a Christian. Did it evolve out of Sunday Service, and can you tell me the story of the moment where you accepted Jesus?"
Interviewer,"I surrounded myself with the healing, the highest-level healing possible: singing about Jesus with my friends and family surrounding me  every single week. This was a place, contrary to popular belief about Christianity, of no judgment. I feel that the church that most people grew up on as kids had a negative environment. The greatest thing for me, as someone who's given their life to Christ, is knowing that other people have that as an anchor and a form of healing, because you're talking to a person that went to the hospital and back. Now you see the measured nature, being able to let the child take the driver's seat but still be measured."
Kanye,Do you attribute that to the anchor of faith?
Interviewer,"Yes, because when you're not in service to God, you can end up being in service to everything else. To live inside of sin, it's going to cost you more than you can pay. You don't want to continue to sin with no repentance. I understand that people feel that I've made some cultural sins. But the only real sins are the sins against God, and you don't want to continue to sin against God."
Kanye,Do you conceptualize yourself as having been born again?
Interviewer,I'm definitely born again.
Kanye,You specifically highlighted that Sunday Service is a place without judgment. But what happens when you take it on tour and you're headlining Christian festivals.
Interviewer,"I feel that we all have sin, and when certain sins are worn more on our sleeves, it's easier for Christians who are not Christ, but are human beings, to be able to channel judgment at what they see in front of them. The other thing is, if anyone claims to be Christian, they're accepting accountability to other Christians. But people don't realize that Christians are loud. That we have a right to righteous anger. That Jesus flipped tables. They think that all of a sudden you believe in Christ, so we're not even supposed to speak up. And if we speak up, people will say, ""Oh, you're being judgmental."" And it's like, Oh, now, because I'm Christian, I don't even have an opinion any more? I'm Christian and I still have an opinion. But my opinion is based on the Word."
Kanye,"Let me phrase the question differently: The Kanye West that I have known over the years hates institutions and hates systems of control and will do anything to break out from being controlled. I'm wondering if that Ye will persist as you encounter more churches and religious institutions, which I, at least, conceptualize as systems of control."
Interviewer,"You know, I see opportunity for creativity inside our faith. But let me, because I know you're looking for a real answer to How does the guy who made Yeezus, which is a very punk album, make a Jesus Is King?"
Kanye,"Well, not how do you make Jesus Is King, but how do you headline a Christian festival or interact with various churches? You having your own personal relationship with Jesus is clean and clear. But what happens when these other organizations come into play that are institutions of control?"
Interviewer,"I think yes, there are groups, as man does, that take the Word and use it to control other people. But as you said, I'm expressing my personal relationship with Christ. When I was not owning up to the maximum of who I could be as a dad and the maximum of who I could be as a husband, that kind of behavior, that kind of mentality, landed me in a place where I needed to be medicated."
Kanye,"So this is an election year, and I'm curious how your faith plays into your thoughts on politics. To go back to when you put on the MAGA hat, how do you see that moment from where we are now, sitting on this plane, in January of 2020?"
Interviewer,"Both my parents were freedom fighters, and they used to drink from fountains they were told they couldn't drink from, and they used to sit in restaurants where they were told they couldn't eat from. They didn't fight for me to be told by white people which white person I can vote on. haha."
Kanye,What do you make of how that moment reverberated? Did it have the effect that you intended?
Interviewer,"I didn't intend for anything except to speak my mind and express how I felt. I have no intention other than to be free, and I don't intend to be free, I just simply am."
Kanye,What is the responsibility of celebrities who are able to move culture? There is this idea that you have to be accountable to people other than just yourself.
Interviewer,"Yeah, usually you're accountable to people that are in control of your check. And you're accountable for whatever they deem you to be the face of, for the people that they are controlling through you. So that's what celebrity in America truly means. Celebrities are scared! Celebrities don't have the real voice. But I don't want to diss the organization of celebrities. I don't want to be sending shots at celebrities, because I am one. I know a lot of celebrities."
Kanye,I don't think that was a shot at people who are celebrities. I think that was an analysis of the way the system works.
Interviewer,"What do you want me to say? This is America. One in three African Americans are enslaved, and we go more crazy if, you know, someone scores a touchdown. Modern-day mass incarceration is right in front of us, and if I even use the word slavery, I'm treated like I'm a white person talking about slavery. I remember when I became a billionaire I was told not to say out loud that I was a billionaire. What?"
Kanye,How did that go?
Interviewer,What? What is the point of being a billionaire if you can't even say it out loud? We're not completely free yet.
Kanye,The one thing that seemed at odds with.
Interviewer,"Oh, I got one for you."
Kanye,Yeah?
Interviewer,"""George Bush doesn't care about black people"" is a victim statement. This white person didn't do something for us. That is stemmed in victim mentality. Every day I have to look in the mirror like I'm Robert De Niro and tell myself, ""You are not a slave."" As outspoken as I am, and the position that I am in, I need to tell myself."
Kanye,"A lot of the reaction to you wearing the hat was ""How could the guy who gave us the gift of 'George Bush doesn't care about black people' now do this?""."
Interviewer,"Black people are controlled by emotions through the media. The media puts musicians, artists, celebrities, actors in a position to be the face of the race, that really don't have any power and really are just working for white people. When it's said like that, it's kind of obvious, right? We emotionally connect to someone of our color on TV and feel that this person is speaking for us. So let me say this: I am the founder of a $4 billion organization, one of the most Google-searched brands on the planet, and I will not be told who I'm gonna vote on because of my color."
Kanye,"Now, if that speaks to you, cool. But I'm speaking for myself."
Interviewer,"What was at odds to me about you wearing the hat is that ""Make America Great Again"" is about looking back. Whereas, to me, you are a perpetual forward thinker."
Kanye,I buy real estate. It's better now than when Obama was in office. They don't teach you in school about buying property. They teach you how to become somebody's property.
Interviewer,"For the election ahead, do you plan to speak more about it, or are your interests elsewhere?"
Kanye,"No, I'm definitely voting this time. And we know who I'm voting on. And I'm not going to be told by the people around me and the people that have their agenda that my career is going to be over. Because guess what: I'm still here! Jesus Is King was No. 1! I was told my career would end if I wasn't with her. What kind of campaign is that, anyway? That's like if Obama's campaign was ""I'm with black."" What's the point of being a celebrity if you can't have an opinion? Everybody make their own opinion! You know?"
Interviewer,"But there is an expectation that when you have a voice as powerful as yours, you can't just express yourself for yourself. You have to think of other people."
Kanye,"Well, it's good that we found out about all of those awards shows that partially led me to alcoholism. Whistle been blown, you know? Imagine My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Watch the Throne  the same year and neither of them being nominated for Album of the Year. Imagine doing The Life of Pablo and driving down the road and never hearing none of those songs on the radio and your wife and your daughter are in the car."
Interviewer,"Well, especially when it comes to Dark Fantasy, the record has been corrected. It's one of the most lauded albums ever. Nobody remembers whether you did or did not win a Grammy."
Kanye,"But when Rolling Stones sic wrote it, they said you've probably already forgot about Jesus Is King. Meanwhile, ""Selah"" is my daughter's favorite song. So Chicago ain't forgot about it, Rolling Stones. This is the only album that has this level of production that can be played throughout the house like music was when we grew up. Yeah, we had spirituals about Christ that kept us alive on the slave fields. Then we got opportunity to make money by making R&B, rock 'n' roll, which removed the name Jesus from the songs. It made it about falling in and out of love. Then the next frontier was to really make the song about how I'm going to kill somebody. Or how I'm going to be with somebody else's wife. I almost fell into that trap."
Interviewer,"So in a way, the sound of the music you're making has evolved and modernized, but you're putting the content back to where it began in American music: back into the church, back into faith."
Kanye,"Yeah, the church, where it's spiritual."
Interviewer,Let's talk about the music you're making.
Kanye,"I was thinking of not rapping again, because I rapped for the devil so long that I didn't even know how to rap for God. Then one of my pastors told me, ""My son just said that he would want a rap album about Jesus from Kanye West."" He didn't say, ""Kanye West, you should do this,"" or ""you need to do this."" He just told me something that a child said. And that one thing made the difference."
Interviewer,"One day I was in my office working on the couture collection, and there was some Grey Goose in the fridge and I was just going to get a daytime drink, and I looked and thought, ""Devil, you're not going to beat me today."" That one statement is like a tattoo. I haven't had a drink since I realized I needed to take it day by day, but I never owned up, or was even told, ""Hey, you're a functioning alcoholic."" People have called me a crazy person, people have called me everything, but not a functioning alcoholic. And I would be drinking orange juice and Grey Goose in the morning."
Kanye,"There was never a public perception of you as an alcoholic. Of course everybody knows the Hennessy-on-the-red-carpet moment, but there wasn't a perception of ""Kanye West has a drinking problem.""."
Interviewer,"Right? I really grabbed the drink to be able to even go to the awards show due to the information that everyone knows now. To say, ""Okay, I can handle this.""."
Kanye,To be Clark Kent.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"At the ranch today, we talked a lot about clothing you're developing. Is Yeezy coming back in a big way? And is it in tandem with the development of the domes and everything happening at the ranch?"
Interviewer,"Yes. It's in tandem. My vision, well, I prefer not to say the whole vision. It'd be like if I told you all the lyrics verbatim from the new album. I want people to come and visit Willy Wonka's factory when it's ready."
Kanye,But Yeezy fashion apparel hasn't gone away?
Interviewer,We're there every day. Like Willy Wonka.
Kanye,What about the new Yeezy basketball sneaker? What was the inspiration behind it?
Interviewer,I'm not going to give the exact codes of how we got there. I got kids! There's pain that comes with those codes. And there's more innovation to push and to drive.
Kanye,"Okay here's another one: Can Nike retro the original Air Yeezy 1 and Air Yeezy 2 sneakers? And if they made a move toward rereleasing them, what would you do?"
Interviewer,"Man, I'm with everything."
Kanye,What do you mean? You could be okay with that?
Interviewer,"Man, anything that the kids want and the people want. People should be able to have what they want."
Kanye,"I've also noticed that you have studio setups in pretty much all of your workspaces. With everything you're doing, when do you decide it's time to record?"
Interviewer,"I just rap into my iPhone. Best microphone on the planet. Thirty, forty percent of The College Dropout was recorded on a  VS-1680. Twenty percent of Jesus Is King was recorded on an iPhone."
Kanye,Your actual vocals on the album are just voice memos?
Interviewer,"Yes. I first started doing that on Yeezus. Like Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A, that part is off the phone."
Kanye,"We talked about how Jesus Is King went to No. 1, but in my opinion people's ears are still catching up to what you're doing. Since Yeezus, I feel like you've been making music according to a different value system than the one that people are using to judge it."
Interviewer,What value system do people judge music by?
Kanye,It has to do with their own expectations and the way a song by Kanye West is supposed to work for them.
Interviewer,"I mean, ""Follow God"" was No. 1  out the gate and stayed there, and what's the format on that?"
Kanye,So you're saying the audience gets it and you're not focused on the criticisms?
Interviewer,"Nah. I'm just focusing on myself. haha You know, music to drive by. Music for me. I actually think Sunday Service is like the Wu-Tang Clan of choirs."
Kanye,Why?
Interviewer,"Because when you first heard Wu-Tang, it sounded completely different. It sounded more aggressive. It even sounded, I think artists are so concerned with perfectionism. All these people say Dark Fantasy was this album that was so good, and then people didn't like 808s, they didn't like Yeezus. Dark Fantasy, I just made it to that level because people were saying my career was going to be over. I always felt like ""Power"" was my weakest first single that I ever had, because I felt like it was bowing to the expectations."
Kanye,How so?
Interviewer,"Just like, ""Here's the ultimate Kanye West song!"" Versus ""Love Lockdown""? ""Can't Tell Me Nothing""? ""Diamonds""? ""Follow God""? I always do the songs that people never heard before. But you had actually heard ""Power"" before. You heard ""Crack Music."" You heard ""Amazing."" You heard that song before! It's just a mix of things. But when I showed you a photo of the anorak that we're developing today, it's like, Oh, okay."
Kanye,"""This is the start of a whole new conversation.""."
Interviewer,"Yeah. The anorak feels different. The Yeezy Slide feels different. The Foam Runner, you hadn't seen that shoe before, either. And I like how all of these things now start to be spoken about as art pieces. A song, a Foam Runner, an interview."
Kanye,"How are you feeling after your fashion show last night? Afterward, everyone was talking about North's performance. Or about the coronavirus."
Interviewer,"I'm just proud of my daughter. It felt, one conversation is about the end of the world. The next conversation is about the beginning. Really, that's how it is out here! Two days ago, I sat there in the atelier  as we all talked about the virus, and just thought: If we were to not be here anymore, all I can think is, What a wonderful life it is. You think about those movies where the world is ending and I just simply thank God for life. Thank God for all these experiences."
Kanye,"In Cody we talked a lot about getting out of cities. Into nature. A sustainable environment. Surrounded by family. You said to me, ""How far are we from Paris Fashion Week right now?"" Now that we're here in Paris, and fear of the coronavirus is spreading, it makes even more sense, you would certainly be sealed off from the virus if you were living in a sustainable dome in Cody."
Interviewer,Perhaps.
Kanye,"So why come back to the center of the cultural vortex, to Paris?"
Interviewer,"Well, it's interesting to see Michèle Lamy and Rick Owens be present. Like, Rick Owens, existing with us. I'm 42 years old. When Rick started doing the spaces and the furniture, he was probably my age. It's a few people, the space program wasn't made by itself. It moves me to be able to see Rick Owens in a setting of the past, which is our now. It makes me think: Life is a song that's already been written, that takes your entire life to hear."
Kanye,I believe that.
Interviewer,"Something I've really been on in the past few weeks is the way we use memories to express ourselves. We're taught that the color white is white when we're super young. So now if I point at this tablecloth and say ""white,"" you agree with me. You're agreeing with something that we both have been programmed to understand in the past so we can communicate in the future."
Kanye,How does that inform how you create? Are you looking to break some of the programmed ideas that we are all supposed to agree upon?
Interviewer,"The greatest freedom is to challenge the vernacular. Or add something to the vernacular. I saw  Matt Williams in the hotel lobby at the Mercer a couple weeks ago. Right when I saw him, I started communicating in, like, beep sounds."
Kanye,Can you give me an example?
Interviewer,You know the beginning of the Bobby Digital song? Like that.
Kanye,Did he beep back?
Interviewer,Good question. haha We hugged and started using memories to attempt to communicate the future.
Kanye,Matt posted a photo of the two of you with Virgil  in New York. What did y'all talk about?
Interviewer,I don't remember barely any of what we were talking about. But I remember the way it felt.
Kanye,"For most fashion brands, the goal is to show a new fashion collection, then produce it and sell it. To make revenue and grow a business. But last night, when talking to the press, you said showing the clothes, producing the clothes, it's all just a creative exercise for you."
Interviewer,"Yeah, because who programs us to have certain goals? I like to wake up and exist in a place of ideation every morning. But the way our human nature works, we can increase our productivity when there are checkpoints. I love the video game OutRun 2. Arcade version. I love hitting all the curves and getting all the straightaways. But I also love hitting the goals. Having a fashion show is a step into the goal of the inevitable, which is Armani meets Aman: food, clothing, shelter, space. Showing at an Oscar Niemeyer building gives the apparel some context. But I don't exist in context. I exist in KAN-text. hahaha The thing about the spaces that you've seen, once those are in place, certain ideas will feel more appropriate as it all joins together."
Kanye,Do you think that one of the things you do is make really far-out ideas accessible?
Interviewer,"I get to exist inside of my own mind and then have these moments where I can pull a piece of what's in my mind out: Here's an image from the living spaces we're doing. Here's a shot of what me and Axel did with the home over the past five years. Last night was like, This is what the housekeeper looks like in Kanye West's mind."
Kanye,"Isn't this what people have always come to you for, these little downloads that suggest where we're headed?"
Interviewer,"Yes. Today everyone that's looking has to sit through the questions that it presents: What just happened? Why did I just look at that? We know from the past ten years that, you know, when I wore the Pastelle jacket at the ""Heartless"" performance at the AMAs, it was awesome. But neither me nor anyone else around thought it was better than or even equal to what Hedi  was doing at Dior. Or to what Nigo was doing then. But now that jacket would definitely be equal or better."
Kanye,Because the context has shifted?
Interviewer,"You know what it is? Farming. Farming ideas. Planting seeds. Fashion Week and the internet is the soil. This is the seed. If I don't show, then I never plant the seed. But the thing is, people say, ""This is Kanye West, and we love the huge trees that you have given us. We want to come to your garden to see your trees."" And when they come, they just see dirt."
Kanye,"You're like, ""Trust me, there's seeds in there.""."
Interviewer,I get so excited about the dirt.
Interviewer,"When your debut album, ""The College Dropout"" came out, the thing that people began to associate with you besides music was"
Kanye,"I think you got to make your case. Seventh grade, I wanted to be on the basketball team. I didn't get on the team, so that summer I practiced. I was on the summer league. My team won the championship; I was the point guard. And then when I went for eighth grade, I practiced and I hit every free throw, every layup, and the next day I looked on this chart, and my name wasn't on it. I asked the coach what's up, and they were like, ""You're just not on it."" I was like, ""But I hit every shot."" The next year, I was on the junior team when I was a freshman, that's how good I was. But I wasn't on my eighth-grade team, because some coach, some Grammy, some reviewer, some fashion person, some blah blah blah, they're all the same as that coach. Where I didn't feel that I had a position in eighth grade to scream and say, ""Because I hit every one of my shots, I deserve to be on this team!"" I'm letting it out on everybody who doesn't want to give me my credit."
Interviewer,And you know you hit your shots.
Kanye,"Yeah, you put me on the team. So I'm going to use my platform to tell people that they're not being fair. Anytime I've had a big thing that's ever pierced and cut across the Internet, it was a fight for justice. Justice. And when you say justice, it doesn't have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly. It could be clearing a path to make it fair within the arena that I play. You know, if Michael Jordan can scream at the refs, me as Kanye West, as the Michael Jordan of music, can go and say, ""This is wrong.""."
Interviewer,You've won a lot of Grammys.
Kanye,"Yeah, I don't want them to rewrite history right in front of us. At least, not on my clock. I really appreciate the moments that I was able to win rap album of the year or whatever. But after a while, it's like"
Interviewer,For you.
Kanye,"For what's right. I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things. So when the next little girl that wants to be, you know, a musician and give up her anonymity and her voice to express her talent and bring something special to the world, and it's time for us to roll out and say, ""Did this person have the biggest thing of the year?"", that thing is more fair because I was there."
Interviewer,"But has that instinct led you astray? Like the Taylor Swift interruption at the MTV Video Music Awards, things like that."
Kanye,"It's only led me to complete awesomeness at all times. It's only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That's all it is."
Interviewer,So no regrets?
Kanye,I don't have one regret.
Interviewer,Do you believe in the concept of regret?
Kanye,"If anyone's reading this waiting for some type of full-on, flat apology for anything, they should just stop reading right now."
Interviewer,But that is something that you apologized for.
Kanye,"Yeah, I think that I have like, faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn't perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure."
Interviewer,"That's fascinating, to look at that record through that lens."
Kanye,"I don't have some type of romantic relationship with the public. I'm like, the anti-celebrity, and my music comes from a place of being anti. That was the album where I gave people what they wanted. I don't think that at that point, with my relationship with the public and with skeptical buyers, that I could've done ""Black Skinhead""."
Interviewer,"Does that make ""Dark Fantasy"" a dishonest album in some way?"
Kanye,"It's always going to be 80 percent, at least, what I want to give, and 20 percent fulfilling a perception. If you walk into an old man's house, they're not giving nothing. They're at 100 percent exactly what they want to do. I would hear stories about Steve Jobs and feel like he was at 100 percent exactly what he wanted to do, but I'm sure even a Steve Jobs has compromised. Even a Rick Owens has compromised. You know, even a Kanye West has compromised. Sometimes you don't even know when you're being compromised till after the fact, and that's what you regret."
Interviewer,"Even though you had always wanted to be out in front, was there ever a point where you valued your anonymity?"
Kanye,"Yeah, I held on to the last moments of it. I knew when I wrote the line ""light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson"" , and I would go there and just go up the escalator and say to myself, ""I'm soaking in these last moments of anonymity."" I knew I was going to make it this far; I knew that this was going to happen."
Interviewer,"But producting happened for you first, especially after Jay-Z used you so heavily on ""The Blueprint.""."
Kanye,"I used to have tracks that sounded like Timbaland; I had tracks that sounded like  Kweli, they helped to get out of me"
Interviewer,Is that true?
Kanye,"Yeah, that's how I discovered my style. I was just hanging out with them all the time in New York. I would produce for them. You know, I was able to slip past everything with a pink polo, but I am Dead Prez. And now, because I was able to slip past, I have a responsibility at all times."
Interviewer,"What were the things that you were trying to do on ""Late Registration"" that you either did not or could not yet do on ""Dropout""?"
Kanye,"I was trying to do different things with orchestras. It was just a vibe that I was trying to get at, a sound I was trying to mix with hip-hop to try to see how far I could expand it. I guess that was a Chicago thing, like Quincy Jones."
Interviewer,"But you came here, you worked with Jon Brion ."
Kanye,"I really liked the sound of some projects that Jon Brion had worked on. I was always considered this crazy hothead kid, but I would always just go and just really break bread with someone who I respected. I will completely bow to anybody I respect."
Interviewer,"That era also includes what I find probably the most moving thing that you've ever done, which is calling out President Bush at the Hurricane Katrina telethon. To me, that moment is actually the peak of putting a message in a pop format, even though it's not a song."
Kanye,"Yeah. I guess it's a very pop moment of a lifetime or generation. I mean, my dad's generation is a generation of messaging, you know? But that's just a piece of me being the opinionated individual that I am."
Interviewer,"Were you conscious that that's what you were doing, or was it totally just instinct?"
Kanye,"Yeah, it was pretty bugged out. When you think about it, I was wearing like, a Juicy Couture men's polo shirt. We weren't there, like, ready for war."
Interviewer,"You look at Jay or Diddy, and I'd say like, 90 percent of the time, you think they're having a good time. With you, I would say, I don't know, 50-50 maybe? Or 30-70?"
Kanye,Maybe 90 percent of the time it looks like I'm not having a good time.
Interviewer,"But you're in a very public relationship, a seemingly long and satisfying relationship"
Kanye,"Any woman that you're in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of, you know, energy. It's actually easier to focus, in some ways."
Interviewer,"When you're uncertain about love, it can be such a distraction. It infects all the other areas."
Kanye,"Yeah, that's what I mean when I say like, ""Yo, I'm going to be super Zenned out like, five years from now."" I'm the type of rock star that likes to have a girlfriend, you know? I'm the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me."
Interviewer,"On ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" there's a really affectionate scene where you go and help Kim sort through her clothes."
Kanye,"That was from a place of love. It's hard when people read things in a lot of different ways. You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get. Because I just see like, an amazing person that I'm in love with that I want to help."
Interviewer,"One of the things I thought when I heard the new record was, ""This is the anti-'College Dropout.' "" It feels like you're shedding skin. Back then, you were like"
Kanye,"Architecture, you know, this one Corbusier lamp was like, my greatest inspiration. I lived in Paris in this loft space and recorded in my living room, and it just had the worst acoustics possible, but also the songs had to be super simple, because if you turned up some complicated sound and a track with too much bass, it's not going to work in that space. This is earlier this year. I would go to museums and just like, the Louvre would have a furniture exhibit, and I visited it like, five times, even privately. And I would go see actual Corbusier homes in real life and just talk about, you know, why did they design it? They did like, the biggest glass panes that had ever been done. Like I say, I'm a minimalist in a rapper's body. It's cool to bring all those vibes and then eventually come back to Rick , because I would always think about Def Jam."
Interviewer,"His records did used to say ""reduced by Rick Rubin.""."
Kanye,"For him, it's really just inside of him. I'm still just a kid learning about minimalism, and he's a master of it. It's just really such a blessing, to be able to work with him. I want to say that after working with Rick, it humbled me to realize why I hadn't, even though I produced ""Watch the Throne""; even though I produced ""Dark Fantasy"", why I hadn't won Album of the Year yet."
Interviewer,"Talk about making an appearance on the red carpet. Kim Kardashian, Kanye West. Kanye, you're back after six years, are you happy to be back and performing tonight, much anticipated performance with Paul McCartney and Rihanna."
Kanye,"I'm just extremely happy, can you tell by my face?"
Interviewer,"The Grammy's have frustrated you in the past with their selection. What does it mean to you though to be back here now, you look at, you know, you're nominated again, have you given the Grammy's another chance, have you kind of purged your system of what was going on before."
Kanye,"I'm appreciative of my nomination but I really just wanted to use the stage to perform this song Only One. It's extremely important to me. Also the Grammy's could adjust their voting system, I think it's extremely flawed but we're going to work on that, I'm not going to complain from stage about it. I'm gonna work on it from the inside."
Interviewer,"Tell me about the new music and what was it like collaborating with Paul McCartney and just, once again, another musical direction, a different musical direction for you."
Kanye,"I mean it was just fun to go in and vibe out and not worry about what was happening on radio or how successful the song would be. Just do something from my heart, you know. Sometimes its challenging for people to create something without boundaries and I feel like I have a responsibility to innovate."
Interviewer,"Kim I gotta ask you, how happy are you now? We see the pictures with Nori and you've really become a family, how is she doing?"
Kanye,"It's given me a whole perspective on what to work for, what to live for, and an understanding on how other families, you know, operate."
Interviewer,"So take me back to college, did you graduate from school?"
Kanye,"Nah, man. I'm a college dropout. You ain't heard the album title?"
Interviewer,Nah.
Kanye,That's the album title.
Interviewer,"Oh it is? Hey man, I'm right there with you."
Kanye,"That's exactly what I want people to think with that title: ""I'm right there with you."" I've thought about calling my shit I'm Good, because that's a ""cool"" title, like just having a title that's like, ""Yo, you can't criticize that."" But for me to try and put on the facade of being the coolest motherfucker ever, it's not going to come across like that. I'm not saying I'm the coolest motherfucker ever, I'm just saying I'm just a fucking smart-ass. I got to put it in raps.""."
Interviewer,Tell me about growing up in Chicago.
Kanye,"In Chicago you're going to do one of three things. You're either going to be sports, straight basketball or football, or you're going to be hip-hop, like really focus on hip-hop and the culture, or you going to be gangbanging. You might be doing all this and gang-banging at the same time because 99 percent of people in Chicago is gangbanging."
Interviewer,"We was gangbanging in kindergarten. We was on the school bus throwing up gang signs like, ""Which gang sign was which again?"" Perpetrating and shit. Moving our hats to the whatever side, and when the Starter coats came out, ""I'ma get the Bulls and I'ma do this, this, this."" And if you wasn't none of that, you was just a fucking lame and shit."
Kanye,"That's how Chicago is. This gangbanging shit is so real that you not going to front whatsoever. Once you grown and you see niggas getting their heads chopped off and you going to funerals, you either going to take it to the fullest or you going to be like, ""Nah, it's not for me."" I know it's not for me. I know that."
Interviewer,"So basically, my main focus became music. I been making tracks since seventh grade. I was on the basketball team freshman year. I used to play for Eisenhower and we went to some tournament or something. But by sophomore year, I had been working on my music so much that by the time we went to tryouts, I'm just straight missing layups and shit."
Kanye,You said you used to bring back slang and whatnot from the East Coast.
Interviewer,"Yeah. My father stayed in Delaware for the latter part of his life but his father was in the Air Force, so he had to fly around. He spent some of his high school years in Germany so he was never at one school. And they always stayed around white people. So when he finally got the opportunity to go to a black school everybody was like, ""Yo, you talk white."" They wouldn't accept him. And when he was around white people, you were a nigga off the bat so they weren't trying to accept him. I seen how that hurt him. So whereas my father struggled with that, basically I learned how to speak every language."
Kanye,So what was the first thing you started building beats on?
Interviewer,"The Casio, that old sampler that everybody talks about they had. I didn't have that until some talentless dude down the street had it. And he would never let me keep it, he'd just come over with it. My mom had bought me a keyboard. Just to establish, she didn't know, I wanted to be a freestyle biker, I wanted to draw, make video games, so she didn't know I wanted to make beats. I remember one day when I was making beats in her crib, she told me, ""Kanye, until you make money off this, it's a hobby."" But she's never the type to say nothing negative toward music."
Kanye,What records were pivotal to you?
Interviewer,"The reason I'm so real today is because of MC Hammer and Kid 'n Play. Those were my favorite rappers back in the day. I felt like they was real. They making music that I wanted to hear. I remember someone played me some Jungle Brothers, and I was like, ""Ew, I'm not feeling that right there."" De La Soul's ""Me, Myself, and I"" was the first hip-hop song I liked. At that point it was EPMD, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Beastie Boys. Remember that? I'd be at my mama's crib. This is back when people used to sit they record player on top of they TV."
Kanye,What music do you listen to for inspiration?
Interviewer,"Midnight Marauders. I listen to certain classics to figure out where I want to go. I listen to Lauryn Hill's album, Pharcyde's first album, that's one of my favorite albums of all time. That joint still sells 1,000 a week."
Kanye,You say you weren't feeling the Jungle Brothers. Where did you pick up your ear for that sound?
Interviewer,"I got that from No I.D., from Common Sense's first album, which is much later than the Jungle Brothers."
Kanye,It's definitely the same thing though.
Interviewer,"It's the same thing but the way they was doing it wasn't like they made me want to do it. It's kind of like how people had soul beats, but there's something about the way me, Just Blaze, Bink, and Jay Z did on The Blueprint that made everybody want to do it. People had throwback jerseys for the longest. I went out and bought that actual jersey soon as I saw Big Boi in the ""Sky High"" Goodie Mob video. There was something about Hov and Fabolous, something about the way they did it made everybody go out and get it. And I'm a good producer but the opportunity to have Hov rap on your beats makes all the difference in the world because he sets trends. People do what he does. They want to do whatever he does, he's like the poster child of industry, fashion, business, hustler , everything that people want to be. So when Hov rapped on soul beats everybody else wanted to rap on soul beats."
Kanye,"You worked with Dead Prez, Jermaine Dupri, and the Harlem World shit before 2000?"
Interviewer,Yep.
Kanye,"Speaking of which, I just noticed that Harlem World had a joint from you and from Just Blaze."
Interviewer,That was crazy right?
Kanye,Was that random?
Interviewer,"Ma$e is the type of rapper that wanted to give new producers that he felt a new drop. So let's not forget Ma$e, to a certain extent, found Just Blaze, Kanye West, and The Neptunes. That's a nigga that knows how to pick beats. Ma$e found them, but Hov, to a certain extent, made Just Blaze, Kanye West, and The Neptunes stars."
Kanye,When did you first start rapping?
Interviewer,"I've been rapping since third grade and I had to figure out at an early age about audience and who you're rapping to and saying the right thing to your audience. Right now I could spit any of my raps to a nigga on the corner, somebody in a barbershop, but I could go into a corporate office and say the same rap  ""The fat girls are back/And you know they will never be wack/The fat girls are back.. .""."
Kanye,"Aside from Dre and Large Professor, there have not been that many producers who became successful rappers. How good is your new album going to be?"
Interviewer,"I think Large Professor's dope. Anything I would say would be too arrogant at this point. But I feel like I really am going to be a very, very big artist. Not just a hip-hop artist or just an underground rapper."
Kanye,"You've been told endlessly to stick to music and leave fashion alone. But you put together the most talked about show at New York Fashion Week with a full, cohesive collection, and today's sneaker launch was a massive success. Do you think people are still going to try and keep you confined within a single box?"
Interviewer,I don't know. I can't.. I don't know. People never cease to amaze me.
Kanye,"With all that you've unveiled in the last few days, do you think that you've torn down the walls that people have built up around you?"
Interviewer,"I do think that it's been a strong week. It's been a strong past three years. From the messaging leading up to it, to that front row, to the presentation, to the price points we want to hit, to the purpose of getting product to the people. And, you know, having a think tank that's equal to what a normal fashion house would have, but for the people."
Kanye,"Right, and with that you've been so adamant about raising the general standard in taste and aesthetics across the whole spectrum. With the arrival of ""Yeezy Season 1,"" how far along are you in this mission?"
Interviewer,"I think with DONDA and what we've been doing, and the way we affect the way people do their artwork or the way Kim's wardrobe affects the way people approach shopping, it's been an ongoing thing slowly creeping and slowly creeping. Before, when I drove down the street I would see these brands and think they're really desirable for a girl who would dream of one day walking in that runway show or something like that. And that's a, you know, dated view and degrading to women, in a way."
Kanye,A more conscious consumer?
Interviewer,"Well I don't want them to have to think of it. We have a think tank, DONDA, and it's an idea group. We're sitting there and just bouncing ideas with each other. The people who worked on the moon boots, it was a mix between a guy I got from Nike, and the head adidas designer, and a girl I got from Céline, and you could feel that. The girl, she worked on those Doc  Célines. As a person who's bought a lot of shoes for my wife, if I saw those white Céline boots I would've copped those right quick, from Monge Market or whatever. Whoever they were by. Whether they were by Céline or whoever, you know what I'm saying. And now we can bring that to the people."
Kanye,"A lot of people don't realize or choose to ignore how vast your knowledge of fashion is, and just to kind of showcase the fact, how about I throw out a few labels and you just give me some thoughts off the top of your head?"
Interviewer,Okay.
Kanye,Haider Ackermann.
Interviewer,God.
Kanye,You love his stuff.
Interviewer,Yes.
Kanye,How'd you discover him?
Interviewer,Barney's.
Kanye,Galliano's first collection at Margiela.
Interviewer,Passion. Soul. Spirit. Breaking walls. People allowed to create again.
Kanye,Supreme.
Interviewer, Legendary. Street standard.
Kanye,Hood By Air.
Interviewer,Shayne is energy.
Kanye,You excited for his show tomorrow?
Interviewer,Hell yeah!
Kanye,What was going through your head when you came out and took a bow on Thursday?
Interviewer,"I just felt that my life was dependent on the success of this show. I set myself up to win or fail. To win or fail. And people were just waiting. ""Is he gonna do it?"" It was almost like the Super Bowl of culture in a way. It was like a David Blaine move in some ways. Are the sharks gonna eat me alive? It was, ""Will he be eaten by the shark tank, or will he survive? Can he hold his breath for this long?"" The three on the back of the Tyvek jacket invites was about the three years that I had been off the runway. And I had to hold my breath for that long."
Kanye,And now you've exhaled and you're breathing.
Interviewer,"Yeah, we got a little bit more air. I mean, how did you feel?"
Kanye,"You know, for someone who isn't thinking six months down the road for a magazine issue, fashion shows can begin to feel pretty routine, especially from, like, the third row. But at your show, there was just a palpable energy you rarely feel. It was an event. Of course I went through everything online later, but while there, it was about what you expressed in your intro. You know, ""cracking the pavement"" and telling kids not to be afraid and just to create, I feel like that's what this is a platform for, in a way. And you probably opened the floodgates for what's the come from whoever got affected."
Interviewer,For real.
Kanye,From the unknowns out there.
Interviewer,Yeah. For the unknowns.
Kanye,"But going back to the established dudes, you're friends with a lot of fashion designers, like Riccardo Tisci, Alexander Wang, Olivier Rousteing.. Have they given you any feedback on the collection?"
Interviewer,"They support me one hundred percent. They sent flowers, emails, and just love. They know I'm in that design office. They know I'm there giving an opinion. They know the concept of celebrity designer is so far out the window. I feel like I'm Eminem, you know? You don't think white rapper. You just think Eminem. You don't think celebrity designer, straight designer, black designer, all these types of things that kind of held me back conceptually in being accepted as a designer. You just think of those words. But when those moon boots come out, you put them on your feet and just swag out and go somewhere with your friends, those words don't matter."
Interviewer,"The most important artist of this generation. Over 21 Grammy's. 6 Consecutive number 1 albums. One of the most impactful voices to ever grab a microphone. One of the most talented producers to ever produce music, fashion, art. One of the most prolific people to ever speak on behalf of his thoughts; to trigger emotions and trigger thoughts of you. One of the most clever people to ever manipulate the internet. I watched him go from:."
Kanye,Sway you gotta hear my rhymes man you gotta hear my rhymes I know I make beats but you gotta hear my rhymes.
Interviewer,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome for the first time to Sway in the Morning here at Shade 45"
Kanye,"You know Nike told me when I asked them? We ain't sure. You know what they told the store though, of my- of my boy that run the store? They said if you want that Red October, you gotta take these 10 other shoes. So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you want that Red October- but legally, we gotta both sign that contract, Mark Parker. I'mma put Mark Parker all on that Summer Jam screen. And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in Donda. I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes. But if you guys that're investing in the arts, y'all don't want to invest in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to Africa, I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney. Nike. Google. Now who's gonna be the Medici family and stand up and let me create more; or do you wanna marginalize me 'til I'm out of my moment."
Interviewer,But why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself?
Kanye,"How, Sway!?"
Interviewer,"Take a few steps back, and-."
Kanye,"You ain't got the answers man! You ain't got the answers! Kanye You ain't got the answers, Sway! Kanye I been doing this more than you! Doing what more than me? You ain't got- C'mon, chill out, bro! You ain't got the answers! Kanye, relax! You ain't got the answers! Bro, rela- I'm asking you a question! You ain't been doing the education. Bro! You ain't been doing the education! Kanye, calm down! You don't have the answers though. Calm down! Because you trying to give me advice about something- No! No no no no, listen You ain't- You ain't got the answers! You ain't spend 13 million dollars of your own money trying to empower yourself!"
Interviewer,"I know, and you're absolutely right, but I've spent hundreds and thousands putting out clothing line at a smaller degree."
Kanye,And that and that ain't Ralph though! It ain't Ralph level.
Interviewer,Okay well let me ask you this.
Kanye,What's the name of your clothing line? We don't know.
Interviewer,Why is it that you can't?
Kanye,I just told you I lost the money.
Interviewer,"Thanks for doing this with me, Kanye."
Kanye,You're welcome.
Interviewer,Kanye?
Kanye,This is Ye.
Interviewer,Good. Great.
Kanye,No.. I was snubbed by the people but I was recognized by God.
Interviewer,Great. Glad to hear this loss didn't hurt your ego.
Kanye,"I will be president in 2024 and the reason why I will make a great president is because I'm sensitive. I'm here to serve. Even as a Gemini, I feel the energy in the room, I read body language, I read this energy, and."
Interviewer,Let's talk about who you voted f.
Kanye,"Two days ago I voted for the first time in my life, and I did it for the person I trust more than anyone. Me. I voted for Ye."
Interviewer,So technically you didn't vote.
Kanye,I did vote.
Interviewer,You're right. But it didn't count.
Kanye,"I'm going to tell you something, I don't care if I win the presidency or not. I'm not here to win. I care that there are homeless people in front of the Gucci store."
Interviewer,What Gucci store?
Kanye,All of them. There are homeless everywhere. They are out there.
Interviewer,Okay.. so you want to fight for the homeless?
Kanye,"Listen to me, I want to get to a point.. . actually, we shall all get to a point where we communicate as simple as Yoda. There are so many words and people get caught up in the words and we're having fights over words and."
Interviewer,What does that have to do with anything? I thought we were talking about the homeless..
Kanye,We are.
Interviewer,So.. the homeless need to communicate more simple?
Kanye,No. We all do so there are no more homeless people in the world.
Interviewer,Gotcha. And what about Co.
Kanye,Praise God for you. I'm not answering questions anymore.
Interviewer,Let's start with the seven words that made national headlines
Kanye,"I've never been asked this question before, but I totally didn't plan to say it. I planned the bullet points about the media portraying black people as looters and how it took the government so long to go down there to help. Bad news is great news, and I felt like CNN, NBC and all these stations were capitalizing on the tragedy."
Interviewer,Describe what led to your making that statement.
Kanye,"Tim McGraw did a song, and it was really emotional, showing all the imagery from New Orleans. When I went up to read the Teleprompter, I just thought what was on it wasn't heartfelt enough. They wanted me to read some random point about the levees. Mike Myers and I talked about how we had a problem with that word. He said, g""I just don't want to mispronounce levees."" That was his main goal when we went up there. He was already nervous, and I told him, ""Yo, I might stray off the Teleprompter a little bit."" I told him I was going to ad-lib. I was talking to him backstage, and I saw Chris Tucker. I remember telling Chris, ""Get ready for live TV.""."
Interviewer,Did Myers say anything when you got off-camera?
Kanye,"He shook my hand and said, g""It is what it is.""."
Interviewer,What kind of greeting did you get backstage?
Kanye,"The Red Cross and the NBC execs didn't say anything to me. They acted like I wasn't even in the building. Before that, it was all VIP."
Interviewer,How did the day end?
Kanye,"At the bar, taking shots of Patrón. hahaha You know, if you go up and hit the class bully in his face, you're like, m""What am I going to do tomorrow?"" I still live in a country that George Bush controls."
Interviewer,"When NBC broadcast the telethon on the West Coast, it cut your comment about the president."
Kanye,"I thought that was great because it proved my point about the media. It let America know that the media still censors us and monitors us and brainwashes us. For them to chop it, everybody in America was like, g""Oh shit, they still do that? I thought this was America."" Yeah, this is America. This is America."
Interviewer,Did the reaction surprise you?
Kanye,A lot of people feel that Bush doesn't care about poor people. It's a common opinion.
Interviewer,But you didn't say he doesn't care about poor people; you said he doesn't care about black people. There's a difference.
Kanye,"There just happen to be way more poor black people. If you pick at the statement, I'm sure you could find something wrong, but that was the overall feeling of America at the time."
Interviewer,"Entertainers don't often really speak their mind, especially not on live TV."
Kanye,"And entertainers who would say what they're thinking wouldn't be given that opportunity on live TV. Networks are more apt to put a five-second delay on me now. They didn't really listen to g""All Falls Down"" and ""Jesus Walks"" and ""Crack Music."" They just heard the hooks. They didn't hear what I was saying about social issues. With my polo collars popped, they never saw me coming."
Interviewer,There's an element of social awareness to your music but also a party element. They probably thought they were going to get the second guy.
Kanye,I bet they wouldn't have put Dave Chappelle up there. But that's who I am
Interviewer,What's the similarity?
Kanye,"He talks about serious things, but he makes you laugh to keep from crying. The humor is the honey in the medicine."
Interviewer,Actually Chappelle's been doing a joke about you
Kanye, Oh shit. That's why we were popping Patrón that night.
Interviewer,"Laura Bush denounced your comment as disgusting, and Bill O'Reilly said it was g""simply nutty"" and called you a ""dopey little rapper."" Did any of the criticism bother you?"
Kanye,"I didn't even know that until now. I care as much about Bill O'Reilly as I care about somebody at my show who goes to the bathroom during g""Jesus Walks."" I'm not going to stop the song; I'm not going to stop my show. Matter of fact, I need to never say his name again, because I'm making him too hot right now."
Interviewer,He does love to pick on rappers.
Kanye,"He can't pick on us. He picks at us. We're like statues. He picks at pop-culture icons, which is what we rappers are right now, like modern-day royalty."
Interviewer,Did anything about the coverage of your comments bother you?
Kanye,People kept misquoting me and using incorrect English
Interviewer,Has the comment hurt you in any way? It seems you got a lot of publicity from it.
Kanye,I wouldn't say it was the smartest business move. At this point I'm not going to say any more things that could be harmful to me. PLAYBOY
Interviewer,"During the telethon, you announced you were going to donate g""the biggest amount I can give."" So how much did you donate?"
Kanye,"I would never tell you that. I called my business manager, and I was like, g""Yo, what's the most I can give?"" And that's what we gave."
Interviewer,You won't name an amount?
Kanye,I'll just say it's way more than I would have made in a year if I'd gone to college and gotten my doctorate.
Interviewer,"Before your career as a rapper, you were one of the biggest producers in hip-hop. How good a rapper are you? The New Yorker described you as m""merely average,"" and Entertainment Weekly said you have a m""clunky flow.""."
Kanye,"I'm nowhere near as good as Jay-Z, Eminem or Nas. So I compensate."
Interviewer,How do you compensate?
Kanye,"With star power, sheer energy, entertainment, videos, really good outfits and overwhelmingly, ridiculously dope tracks. Justin Timberlake isn't the best singer, but he's a true star, the entire package. The main thing I use to make up for my lack of rapping skills is my content, my subject matter."
Interviewer,What's an example?
Kanye,"I'll use words or rhymes no other rapper has used. Raps m""Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you're bulimic/ Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic."" Damn, nobody would ever rhyme those two words together. When they come up with a hip-hop curriculum, I want my raps to be in the textbooks."
Interviewer,"Let's start with your company, Donda. When you announced it nearly five years ago, you said it would encompass 14 different categories: everything from hospitality and marketing to consumer finance and medical research to transportation and protection services. Why did you envision all of these things together in one organization?"
Kanye,"I'm really bad with answering questions. Usually, I don't even answer them. I try to find inspiration inside of the question. I think, and I jump from one beam of inspiration or energy to the next, as opposed to explaining the energy."
Interviewer,"In general, the hard part about interviews, for me, is the idea of two plus two equals four. I always refuse to land at four. Landing at four is hella basic."
Kanye,What's your dream for Donda?
Interviewer,"In some ways, my dream is already happening because of the people I've worked with and the mental pushups they go through. I hate when someone comes and works with me for a couple weeks or two months, and then they try to tell people they've worked with Kanye West. You haven't worked with Kanye West unless you've had to redo a project 100 times, or had to word something in a specific, perfect way, to communicate it in the exact. That  was ironic, because I'm not communicating well at all."
Kanye,"People come, they go away, they work here for a bit, they work on other projects, we argue. We're all these fighting artists with a common goal of wanting to affect the world through positive change, which is this really politically correct way to say ""save the world."" If you don't have the vision to see where you could go, there's no way you can believe in the possibility of a utopia."
Interviewer,"When you say utopia, it sounds like a bad word. It's something people can use to make fun of you or make you look stupid or overly optimistic."
Kanye,What's your version of utopia?
Interviewer,"I don't think people are going to talk in the future. They're going to communicate through eye contact, body language, emojis, signs. Imagine that. If everyone was forced to learn sign language."
Kanye,"When I was a kid, I'd see people who only spoke sign language and think, Wow, that's gotta be difficult. I was really happy I could speak. Now, I would prefer to , do that without having to use words. It's funny because I've made a living off of words, but words get in the way of what you really want to say."
Interviewer,Wordless communication would be your preferred method?
Kanye,"Yeah, sign language, eye contact. Or thank God for emojis. So often one emoji goes a long way and lets me get on with my whole day."
Interviewer,"I don't want to be a jerk, but there are certain people who are geniuses. Their emotional and social IQ is super high and they can get stuff done. Often, people who get really amazing stuff done have to cut off their emotional IQ. I can't stand this whole ""How was your day?"" thing that agents always say. I'm like, ""You don't care about my day. Why'd you ask me about my day? Did we get done what we were supposed to get done?"" But I do want to know how my daughter's day was. I do want to get an explanation of what she learned in school. I sincerely care about that."
Kanye,"I think business has to be stupider. I want to do really straightforward, stupid business, just talk to me like a 4-year-old. And I refuse to negotiate. I do not negotiate. I can collaborate. But I'm an artist, so as soon as you negotiate, you're being compromised."
Interviewer,How do you know when you've found someone or a group you want to collaborate with?
Kanye,"I like the idea of companies more than I like the idea of brands. There's something about constant self-promotion in a brand. I'm sitting here. It's me. I'm Kanye West, in Adidas. But the ultimate goal is to be like water, to create in an invisible way, to create something where you can add some kind of information that can help people along their path."
Interviewer,You mentioned that you view yourself as an artist.
Kanye,I didn't mention that I view myself that way. I just am. I never worded it like that. That's really offensive. Why did you say I view myself like that? Do you not view me as an artist?
Interviewer,I totally view you as an artist.
Kanye,"Okay, cool."
Interviewer,So what is your personal definition of art?
Kanye,"I would have a George Costanza moment if I were to answer this right now. I would come back in three days and be like, ""I got this!"" And sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable by saying what you said was offensive. But it was."
Interviewer,"Earlier this year, you tweeted, ""The definition of art, or at least my personal definition, is to be able to see the truth and then express it.""."
Kanye,"That's the answer I wanted. Thank you. Lead the witness a little bit. If I've already answered a question, we're just digressing."
Interviewer,"How do you manage to think about art and fashion and music, all of these worlds you're working in? Do you ever have to compartmentalize them?"
Kanye,"It's all one. It's in your hands, like being a piano player, the keys of life just playing a chord. People can't wrap their head around why a wrong note drives me crazy, but I'm trying to hear a beautiful chord. People say, ""If you've got this, this, and this, why are you so mad about that?"" Well, I'm trying to play a chord with two hands, and then eventually a symphony."
Interviewer,"When you made an impromptu appearance at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2013, you said, ""The world can be changed through the power of design."" Why do you think design is powerful enough to change the world?"
Kanye,Did I already answer this before and you're not letting me know the answer?
Interviewer,"No, no, no! But this does connect with what you were saying about companies vs. brands. Some companies make great products; brands often just manufacture hype."
Kanye,"I think companies that are also brands can come together for a single mission to change the world. These might be people who are focused on prosthetic arms, or focused on cancer, or focused on some type of movie script, or focused on some new form of tech. I don't want to pinpoint whom, but there is a collective that can figure out the killings in Chicago, for example, if that was their goal. I think it's extremely difficult to figure it out through politics."
Interviewer,"I don't want to tell you an idea that's so 17 years from now that it will get fucking ridiculed for 16 years, so I'm trying to figure out how to word it in a way that people can understand in the now. A simple now  would be: There is currently a lack of people in power who are motivated by the idea of helping people, but thanks to the internet, there are people who would never have made it through a corporate system who are able to jump into positions of power in their twenties. They can collectively work on ideas for the new world."
Kanye,I think I worded that in a 2016 way.
Interviewer,"Yeah, there are a surprising number of leaders who are in their twenties and thirties, in large part because of the internet."
Kanye,"And those are the people who can make the change. And will. It's not can; it's will. You have to will things into fruition. I think that in our time, our civilization, we can get to a place where ..  When you say way overly optimistic things, they just get attacked."
Interviewer,Why do you think that is?
Kanye,I don't want to digress about why. I just want to word this in a way that somehow puts an idea out there without people beating me up for saying it out loud.
Interviewer,"More people need to know that they're not fucking cool. In today's world, having money has allowed people who are extremely uncool to think that they're cool and carry it like that. People who really are cool and people who really are artists and have ideas have to literally turn in their cool card to society just to make it past the age of 28. It's either die at 28 or turn in your cool pass. I would love to be a part of creating a world that allows the artist to think and create at the highest form and be respected for their ability."
Kanye,How did you develop the ability to seek out and find these kinds of people? Or do you think you were born with taste?
Interviewer,"I've been struggling with the word taste. Who's to say having good taste is a good thing? Some people say everyone was born an artist, and society and their parents beat it out of them. After I said I was going to run for president , I saw a video of someone making fun of me about it. I was thinking, Wow, if this person had been doing this to me from the age of 3, I would have never been me. People say geniuses are kids with good parents. How do you nurture the things that people will call weird into something that could be considered exceptional?"
Kanye,"Maybe this will be an eloquent interview. It's a 50/50 chance every time I open my mouth. At the end of the day, words get in the way. Regardless, whether you understand this or that, you know it's Rain Man sitting here. You just fucking know it's Rain Man. No matter what Rain Man's doing, you know, if you take him to that fucking table, he's going to pick the right cards."
Interviewer,"One exceptional person you've mentioned frequently is Steve Jobs. Earlier this year, you tweeted about how he had wanted to lower the cost of textbooks. This was part of a series of several tweets about changing the nature of education."
Kanye,"Both of my parents are educators. I think that knowledge is power, and it's not just about the information that's held in books. It's about codes that are held in cultures."
Interviewer,Which codes specifically?
Kanye,"There are codes in management to get from A to Z. Everything is like one of those drug movies. You've got the guy on the block who's cool enough to figure out how to dodge the cops and also sell. Then you've got the guy who used to do that, and that guy has to figure out how to get a connect. Whether I'm going to visit Herzog & de Meuron, a shameless name drop that somehow relates to Surface magazine, or at a fashion show, I always just feel like I'm in Scarface, going to talk with the connect. It's the idea of: What would you give up for the information about how to really accomplish what you're thinking, and can you make it out alive?"
Interviewer,Can education help a person negotiate those systems?
Kanye,"People across the world just lack opportunities, period. I feel a responsibility because of my parents. They're activists and were in the world-changing business. Any extra goodwill or good skills I've gained I learned from them, and take along on my Legend of Zelda role-playing path in life. Life's like a RPG  can get it off of Google."
Interviewer,"I met Axel through Willo . It was eight times separated. A piece of information that led me to another piece of information that led me to another piece that led me to another piece .. that led me to Maastricht, I might say it wrong."
Kanye,The city in the Netherlands.
Interviewer,"Willo says, ""Man, I really like this guy's blog."" He was referring to Justin Saunders, who runs the blog JJJJound. I'm into his perspective on art. Jound's been doing it for 10 years, and I, to this day, say, ""Is that Jound-approved?"" I remember I once had this girl in my hotel. We were getting into the bath, and she was like, ""I don't know if my body is Jound-approved.""  That was so funny."
Kanye,"I reached out to Justin and explained the certain elements of my background that you might not have been able to see just from the albums and videos I was doing, or the red leather jackets I was wearing. Or the minks. Or the furs. Or the  Sometimes I can be distracting like this in conversations. Just creating memes every step of the way."
Interviewer,It does remind me of.
Kanye,"Hold on one second. You're going to break my thought. So I hired Justin, explained all this stuff, and we built this relationship. I was living at this hotel apartment in Paris, Justin was out there, and we were working on some ideas. I was like, ""This space is wack. What can I do?"" He said, ""My favorite architect is Joseph Dirand.""."
Interviewer,This is turning into a 12-minute freestyle. Which is good. When I talk it's like a painting.
Kanye,"So I reach out to Joseph Dirand, he comes by, and he gives some ideas. He says, ""You gotta cover up this nasty bookshelf over here, and you gotta cover up this glass bannister."" We went and plastered over the bookshelf and the bannister in the hotel room. We didn't nail up a curtain, but plastered over it. It's still like that to this day."
Interviewer,When did you become interested in architecture?
Kanye,I've been interested in architecture and furniture design since I was 18.
Interviewer,"I bumped into this one guy at the Paris flea markets who pulled me to the side and said, ""I do furniture with Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt"", that's kind of relevant right now. He said, ""I know a place where you can get Jeanneret chairs."" Jeanneret chairs are my favorite dining-room chair. Me saying it out loud, there it goes. I'll now never get a real Jeanneret again for under a certain amount, first-world problem."
Kanye,"So he was like, ""I know where we can get real Jeanneret chairs 45 minutes out from Paris."" The chairs were from this Le Corbusier project in, I'm going to say it wrong, this city in India."
Interviewer,Chandigarh.
Kanye,"Yeah. So he showed me a place where they were way cheaper and all wrapped up. This guy showed me where I would not get hit with the celebrity, Michael Jackson price. He said, ""You should go to Maastricht."" I believe he said this. But I was also working with this architect, Oana , who I still work with and kind of stole from Rem Koolhaas. Maybe she told me to go to Maastricht. If Oana told me, everything I said earlier was false."
Interviewer,"So I go to Maastricht, and there was some nice furniture, some midcentury stuff, and then there was this booth we bumped into that was ..  Like I always say, words get in the way .. spiritual. I said, ""Who did this?"" Axel Vervoordt did it. He was there, standing and talking to somebody, and I came up to him and said, ""You are the master."" I might have bowed to him."
Kanye,I think you should just run this interview clean. You gotta let the painting be open with this let-me-just-zone-out-with-Ye-for-a-second thing.
Interviewer,"Unlike Axel, there have been decorators who have tried to diss my wife and me and position us in a lower-class way, not class as far as the idea of finance, but class as."
Kanye,Cultural class.
Interviewer,Cultural class! It's like an editor completely trying to annihilate my credibility because we didn't have water and the show started late.
Kanye,"For some reason, I just wanna say ""Wiz  wears cool pants"" right now. He really does. He dresses really good."
Interviewer,I want to talk about the idea of me saying these things in the color that I'm in currently.
Kanye,"""Color"" meaning?"
Interviewer,"Skin color. I'm not saying ""currently,"" as if I'm going to change. I'm saying currently because, I'm actually not that good at words; it's better when a beat is on. What I mean by currently is that 10 years from now to be black is going to be a completely different thing, because of what we're doing now."
Kanye,Through culture?
Interviewer,"Through culture. And business. And interracial dating. There was an moment in rap, through the '80s, '90s, and 2000s, when people said, ""Hey, I'm Jewish, own a record label, and I need a black guy."" Because of what we've done at Donda, collectively, 20 years from now, people are gonna go, ""We need a black guy to creative direct something."" There have been very few directors, period, who are black."
Kanye,"When I'm under the gas at the dentist's office, sometimes I think, One day, all the things that were only afforded to the rich, Hermès, Helmut Lang, Margiela, the bleached canvasses from Sterling Ruby.."
Interviewer,"When I go to Sterling Ruby's studio, I go, ""I want my daughter to come back here!"" I'm just so taken aback and inspired. That inspiration needs to be taken out of the box of luxury and given to all people. The world would be better. People would be happier."
Kanye,"Do you see yourself as a bridge, as someone who's helping bring the high and the low together on a mass level?"
Interviewer,I think so. I will be a part of this because I don't want to miss out. I don't wanna be dead when the world starts getting good.
Kanye,It seems like you have this crazy optimism about the world. Where does this come from?
Interviewer,"Knowing that art can beat anything. Knowing that the artist shall rise. As sure as people have eyes, artists shall rise. Masters of visuals. Masters of communication. The art of conversation. Anything could be art in 10,000 hours."
Kanye,"I wanted to touch on something you said at the Design Dialogues event Surface hosted with Hans Ulrich Obrist, Jacques Herzog, and you during Art Basel in Miami in 2013. You said you paint with words. You also brought it up a moment ago. Do you mean that literally?"
Interviewer,"I have synesthesia, I see sound. And I actually have paintings and drawings from high school where I was trying to show what the sounds in front of me looked like."
Kanye,How has that helped your work?
Interviewer,"I think it's my mutant handicap. All X-Men have a little handicap that helps them become X-Men. I didn't know the term synesthesia until I was working on Cruel Summer. Halfway into writing that, I really understood that my entire life I had been trying to describe this condition of mine: through painting, through this seven-screen Surround Vision film we shot in Qatar, through all these things."
Kanye,"Most people who run publicly traded companies have a tendency to be extremely fearful, especially if they're not the founder, because they have to answer to people. And then they've got a wife and kids or a husband and kids. I think that often people can be scared of brilliant people throughout time, Einstein, Newton, Thomas Jefferson. I've said the successful man is the one who can afford to make the most mistakes. Or I'll say something really obvious, like: You have to look past the surface to embrace opportunity."
Interviewer,"I guess this is the difference of a visionary, they have X-ray vision. They can see past the surface, and they can also see into the future. It's like Dark Side of the Moon: If you look through the pyramid, you can see the core and the beauty in the middle.  cover is the best description of a visionary."
Kanye,"You don't pigeonhole yourself. You've entered the realms of fashion, music, art, and design. What worlds do you want to enter next?"
Interviewer,"What's more important, design or art? Design is the ability to put structure to art, and art is the ability to break from structure. It's like a man and a woman, and obviously the woman, in the traditional sense, is the artist. I don't have an answer. I'm just posing this as a question."
Kanye,What do you believe to be the biggest misconception people have about you?
Interviewer,I think I've evolved and have arrived at a place where I don't really care about misconceptions. I'm so used to always being underestimated.. Being underestimated and over-delivering is my vibe. I like to over-deliver and be underestimated.
Kanye,I don't think people underestimate you now.
Interviewer,Really?
Kanye,What's an example of that? They don't do that anymore..
Interviewer,"I don't know. I feel like it's just my life, you know?"
Kanye,Maybe you underestimate how other people see you. I think other people are expecting someone else.
Interviewer,"But misconception.. For example, my mind is so focused right now on law school. There is a misconception that I don't actually have to study and I that I've bought my way into getting a law degree that's absolutely not true. I have to put in just as much work as everybody else, the same number of hours that are required by law, and I have to write essays, take tests, and actually pass them. There are no short cuts; there is no easy way out."
Kanye,"If you could choose not to be a celebrity and have a more peaceful but happy life out of the spotlight, would you do it?"
Interviewer,"I think I live an awesome life. Even in my darkest of times I don't regret putting myself out there for the world to see. People have shared with me over the years how much it has helped them to feel less alone when dealing with their own adversity. I love having a voice and I appreciate the platform that I have been given, even though I do wish I could have more privacy at times."
Kanye,Some people say that fame is addictive. What are your views on that?
Interviewer,"I do agree that fame can be addictive and it took me a long time to recognize how lost you can become when you put too much focus on it. People often ask me, ""Money or fame?"" My focus has always been on success, and with success comes money. I'm at this place now where I am not concerned anymore about fame but if you would have asked me this question 10 years ago, I probably would have said that fame and money were of equal importance. My focus has shifted a lot."
Kanye,From fame to money?
Interviewer,"Money was always the goal but I was obsessed with fame, like, embarrassingly obsessed. I have the funniest stories from 15, 20 years ago that I have no shame in sharing because I was younger and it was who I was at the time."
Kanye,And now you're obsessed with money?
Interviewer,"No, no. My goals were so much lower than what I have been able to achieve. Now that I have beyond anything I could have ever dreamed of beyond my wildest imagination, I can say without question that the fame isn't important to me. But I do recognize and appreciate that fame has given me the biggest platform."
Kanye,"We are constantly in the news, and sometimes we end up reading unpleasant things about ourselves. Does it affect you?"
Interviewer,"When it's about my family, I get really protective. Most of the time when things are so baseless or absurd, I have a good laugh. But as far as dealing with it on a daily level for me, I'm pretty content. If it's about you, or the kids, or my sisters, I can get worked up when I read things that are false or negative. But when it's about me, I've learned how to block out the noise for the most part."
Kanye,What did you think of me the first time we met?
Interviewer,"This was before you released your first album and you were known as a music producer. I was really shy. You thought I was Brandy's assistant, which I wasn't. Ever since you said that, it's everywhere.. like ""Kim is Brandy's assistant."" I was her friend and stylist. hahaha. I thought you were attractive, nice, very charming, really funny, powerful I was in awe of you, but I was really shy, quiet, and a little nervous, to be honest."
Kanye,How did you realize I was the one for you?
Interviewer,"When I went to New York and we went to dinner and the movies, it was just so much fun. I remember I wore a Givenchy feather jacket and leather pants. It was super chill and so effortless being together. After spending that whole week together, I realized you were the one and then I was like, damn, why did I waste so much time and energy? Why didn't I do this sooner?"
Kanye,Was it always in your plans to have a big family?
Interviewer,"I really wanted four kids and apparently your psychic told you that, too. . Growing up, I always thought I wanted four kids and then after we had North, I didn't think we were going to have another one because of how difficult the pregnancy was. After we had Saint, I for sure thought we were done but then we kept going and now we have four."
Kanye,What traits do you see in our children?
Interviewer,"North is your twin, she is so creative, expressive, and has so much of your personality. Saint, I think, has more of my personality. What do you think?"
Kanye,"I would agree with that, I think so too."
Interviewer,"Chi, it's still too early to say. She has a temper that we don't have but then she's so calm, which is just like us too. For Psalm, it's too early to tell. Hopefully they will have little bits of us and lots of themselves."
Kanye,How do you want our children to remember us?
Interviewer,"I think about this all the time. I often reflect on the most amazing childhood I had and I want them to always be able to look back and say, ""I had the most awesome life. My parents gave me all of the tools to be great and happy in life. They were fun, good, awesome parents and they were always there.""."
Kanye,What are the things you had to give up in order to build your brand and raise a family?
Interviewer,"This year I had to give up a lot like my friends and going out. Unless we work together or have babies together that are same age or I've known you my whole life, it's really hard to stay in touch and keep up. I've had to change my number. I need to stay focused I have to figure out law school, I have to launch my shapewear brand and continue to oversee all aspects of my beauty and fragrances businesses. I've had to cut out all of the things that took time away or did not involve God, our family, my businesses, justice reform work, or law school."
Kanye,I'm always amazed at your capacity to create new business ventures and ideas. Where do you get your inspiration from?
Interviewer,"From you. I have a lot of my own ideas, obviously, but you have had so much influence on how I see things and the decisions that I make. From you I've learned to not compromise and to only create businesses that are authentic to who I am."
Kanye,Why do we work so hard? What do you think drives us?
Interviewer,"We have such big visions of what we want our life to be. But for me, it's probably not as big of a vision as yours. I saw my parents work so hard growing up; my dad always respected hard work, which is such an Armenian trait. Their hard work influenced me from a very young age."
Kanye,Many young girls see you as a role model due to your talent for business and your sense of style. Do you feel any sort of pressure in pleasing such a demanding audience?
Interviewer,"I don't think it's a demanding audience. I never felt the responsibility of being a role model until I had kids and I don't really like the word ""role model."" I feel like it's a bit self-centered in a way. I just try to be a good person and lead by example. There is a lot of pressure, especially when parents put that on kids that ""people have to be perfect and not make mistakes because people are watching you."" That's not a way to live. For me, I just try to be a good person and when I make mistakes, I try to own up to them, learn, and grow. I think that is what people should really strive for instead of trying to be perfect at all times."
Kanye,"I know you love all your sisters, but which sister do you feel closest to and why?"
Interviewer,"It changes, just like friends or relationships go in and out. I think this year has been a really strong Kim and Khloé year. I'm obviously so close with Kendall and Kylie too but I've spent so much more time on this earth with Kourtney and Khloé 16 and 17 years longer with them. We have more history, have been through so much together, and we have more friends in common. Kourtney and I will always be really close, but this year, Khloé and I really bonded."
Kanye,Your style has evolved a lot in the past years. Talk me through some of your best and worst moments.
Interviewer,"I love my worst moments now. I look back and have to laugh; it was so much fun. It was who I was, what I could afford, and what I knew at the time. I think it was the first seven years of filming Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Then, when I met you, you gave me the biggest closet makeover. I didn't understand at the time why you wanted to get rid of pretty much everything I owned, but I pretended like I did. You were showing me all of these different designers that I had never heard of before. Now, I totally get it. Now I'm very confident in what I wear. You have been my best stylist."
Kanye,You have become very experimental and artistic in terms of fashion. Where did this confidence come from and who are the people you have loved collaborating with through the years?
Interviewer,"It's so hard when you're asking me this because you know you were one who brought out that confidence in me. You showed me a whole other way. I really wasn't that artistic or anything before. Who are the people I love to collaborate with? I mean, you. There are so many that it's hard to name only a few but some who come to mind include"
Kanye,What motivated you to start studying law? Did you choose law to feel closer to your father's heritage?
Interviewer,"No, I've always been interested in law, in studying law. As I started to become interested in criminal justice reform, I felt the urge to learn more so that I could do more. I knew that the only way I could help was if I was really educated on the laws and the system. But I know that my dad would love it, he would be so proud. He would totally be the one helping me study and would have taken the job of helping me with my flashcards away from you he would have been so happy to do that."
Kanye,It's a bit of a cliché but how do you see yourself in 10 years' time?
Interviewer,"In my mind I'm already living in those 10 years. I see us living on a ranch in Wyoming, occasionally going to Palm Springs and our home in Los Angeles and becoming a lawyer."
Kanye,Would you set up your practice in Wyoming and fly in and out to work on prison reform?
Interviewer,"I would probably do it from there and fly into DC, NY, and LA."
Kanye,"When you're at home, are there any simple tasks you really enjoy doing yourself?"
Interviewer,"I love cleaning out our garage and our storage project that I'm working on right now it gives me life to find treasures. I love organizing. I love lying in bed and watching Catfish and Hoarders. After I watch Hoarders, it makes me want to clean and organize even more."
Kanye,What role do you think faith in God has played in your life and in our home?
Interviewer,"My father was a devout Christian, so growing up, we would go to church together as a family every week. He would talk to us about the importance of having faith in God and the power of prayer. Now that we have a family of our own, I love the conversations that we are having together and with our kids about how we can be more in service to God in everything that we do. Sunday service this year especially has been such a blessing. I'm so grateful that you brought that into our lives because it's brought us even closer together as a family. It's something that North especially looks forward to every week. She loves singing with the choir. We are truly blessed."
Interviewer,"You send things out on Twitter and sometimes, like Kim has said and I'll tell you this also, I don't know if she's told you this along with not wanting more children but Kim has said.."
Kanye,I'm fine to just practice.
Interviewer,"That's all you get to do. Kim said there should be a board of directors that goes through your tweets. Like, when you have an idea you give them to Kim and a bunch of people and they go, Okay, you can tweet that or No, you cannot tweet that. Do you think you should have a board of directors?"
Kanye,Absolutely not.
Interviewer,No?
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Everything you tweet, you think have you regretted anything you've tweeted?"
Kanye,Nope.
Interviewer,"Nothing, never? You don't go, Maybe I should have thought about that a little longer?"
Kanye,What's the point of thinking?
Interviewer,"What's the point of thinking.. Well, sometimes I understand, but sometimes there is a point to thinking. And then you tweeted out that you want Mark Zuckerberg to give you $53 million. In hindsight, should of that have gone on Facebook?"
Kanye,Yes.
Interviewer,Yes.
Kanye,"I could've put that on Facebook, now I understand why he didn't hit me back."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,I understand that Zuckerberg doesn't use Twitter.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"Even though I have had dinner with him and his wife and told them about how I wanted to help the world and he said he'd help me and then blah, blah, bla, like.. and that's how it feels though, you know? It's like the pursuit of happiness, like it's like, you're trying to sell this bone density machine or something. You know, like in that movie. I feel that if I had more resources, I could help more people. I have ideas that can make the human race existence, within our 100 years, better. Period. Fuck the paparazzi, whatever perception you have of me, starting with the truth, starting with- starting with what everyone's thinking. Start there.. put some dope shit with it."
Interviewer,"Ok, I'm with you on -."
Kanye,"'Ye is in the building! Put your motherfucking hands in the air right now! Put your hands in the air right now! Yeah, okay."
Interviewer,"I'm with you on the truth part. When you say put some dope shit with it. Give me one example, the ideas, 'cause maybe someone watching will give you the money."
Kanye,"We're in a renaissance period. We're in a place where people are, like, multi-disciplined artists. Like Steve McQueen that directed 12 Years a Slave; he was considered to just be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar. We're not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life. So the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put into my music, I put them into shoes and they worked."
Interviewer,"Grab a seat, grab a seat. So, you remember this place? Graduation? I was also thinking about some of the other things we've done as well with the BBC, like Abbey Road sprung to mind with the strings."
Kanye,"Oh yeah. That was good. That suit was like, I would've worn something different if I could look back right now. I could still do a suit, I just wouldn't have done that exact lapel situation."
Interviewer,"But talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. That was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and that kind of to give yourself that objective. What are your thoughts when you think back about Abbey Road, where.. it's just nuts."
Kanye,"I thought it was good. I thought it was what I was supposed to do at that time. If I see something, if I see an opportunity, I'm gonna go for it. You know what I'm saying We're all gonna die one day."
Interviewer,"Yeah, that's true."
Kanye,"So live like that. Live like you could die tomorrow. Go for it. Those steps have been the, you know, the platforms that allowed me to make it this far."
Interviewer,"And you have, man, and you're here. Six original albums of your own, a Throne record, various records with G.O.O.D. Music to talk about, man. But seriously, man, Yeezus. Bravo, dude. I mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre I've heard in a very, very long time, and you know, just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, I think."
Kanye,"Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I feel I was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. Cause, you know, Cruel Summer is definitely Kanye West, and there's something weird and kind of off about ""Mercy,"" like when it has the high-pitched, that type of sound. It sounds like art still a little bit, even thought it obviously was a radio smash."
Interviewer,"hey, I completely hate that, or I completely love that, but let me just think differently. Because everybody is bound to these, no pun intended, they're bound to sixteen bars or eight bars, and you know the normal radio the radio thing."
Kanye,"Yeah. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself. I showed showed people that I understand how to make perfect. Dark Fantasy could be considered to be perfect. I know how to make perfect. But that's not what I'm here to do. I'm here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, you know, sonically and society, culturally."
Interviewer,"You've done that with Yeezus. Yeah It's fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when I talk to artists about records of this nature, it's in the lead-up to something. So we're all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what I mean? You could tell me what you think of the record, but I'm trying to find my way around it, the audience probably won't have heard it. In this case, it's been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. You've seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. But I'm fascinated to know, today, how you would describe Yeezus, as someone who made it. How you would describe that record. You know?"
Kanye,"I just think that I'm a production person, I'm a product guy, I'm a producer. So if I'm working on a John Legend album, I'm gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in. And I'm gonna try to push Pusha T, no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me, to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most. And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up. laughs Ah-ha-ha!"
Interviewer,"And you did, dude, seriously. From the minute it starts. I mean, seriously. It's disgusting."
Kanye,"Nah. This is me going to the studio with Thomas and Guy-Manuel, who's Daft Punk. They had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. This is just one session right here. This beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and I ended up making that the intro."
Interviewer,"You know, I got a beef with you over this track. It's too short! I wanted more out of it. Cause it's one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like you're just getting warmed up. Was that kind of deliberate, you know, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, we're going to get on with the album now?"
Kanye,"Nah, it's just what I felt, like it should be."
Interviewer,Wow.
Kanye,"Which, psychologically, I know would have changed certain Yeezus naysayers about the album. It wasn't that time for me. I I I didn't want to come up there and perform. A lot of times, music can be presented as a service position. But I wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music."
Interviewer,"No. You're so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. Like you talked about, the way you use your voice in different ways, you don't rely on conventional rhyming flows. Your opening line, ""Yeezus season approaching,"" you know? ""A monster's awoken."" You're laying it out there, this isn't My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy Part 2. I'm wilding out on this record, straight away."
Kanye,You can.
Interviewer,And you did.
Kanye,"That's how life is. It's like a car crash. You could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens."
Interviewer,"At what point did that very deliberate feel to the record, whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very very contradictory but it works kind of way, at what point did that start to take shape? Because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole, the way it flips between one and the other. Was that in your head early on, or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record?"
Kanye,"Well, I didn't reduce it. Rick Rubin reduced it. He's not a producer, he's a reducer."
Interviewer,"Nice but was it always part of the process for you, to say, why don't I take elements of this and this and just claps hands bolt it together?"
Kanye,"Yeah. It's just the way I was consuming information in my life at the time. Negative information to positive information, from the Internet, just going to the Louvre, going to furniture exhibits and understanding that, trying to open up and do interviews with this, learning more about architecture. Taking one thousand meetings, attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. Like, getting no headway whatsoever. It was just that level of frustration. This is what frustration fucking sounds like."
Interviewer,Ya.
Kanye,"Now let's take people who have issues with me as Kanye West. They classify my motivational speeches as rants like ""Why is he saying that? Why is he doing that?"" Well I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. And I've got to a point that Michael Jackson did not break down. I have reached the glass ceiling as a creative person, as a celebrity."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I do."
Kanye,Remember how funny that was? Do you think there would be a Givenchy in the hood if it wasn't for that South Park photo. But no one thinks about that no one thinks about the names I got called for wearing tight jeans.
Interviewer,"You reference that in the record, you talk about that. ""No one's liked him since he's been wearing tight jeans."" Everybody knows you brought back real rap. I mean you reference that in the record."
Kanye,"I'm saying y'all had all that, but I brought real rap back. I'm going to do dope things. And I wanna take this opportunity to speak to something, because I go to Hypebeast sometimes to look it up, the new things that're coming out. And every time my name goes up, there's a series of people who write just negative comments they wanna joke around and say, ""Why is he still trying? Why is he doing this?"" Why is he they like diss me as a person for trying. Now mind you, I've brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity."
Interviewer,Ya.
Kanye,"You know, and now, what they don't realize when I say ""Hey this is Pusha T, this is what it is"" I have to remind Pusha T that he's Pusha T. Because the radio, if they're not playing a song of his that has an R&B hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in , it's like we forget about that Clipse album that meant everything."
Interviewer,It's been like that now for a minute.
Kanye,"It's been like that for a minute, Hedi Slimane! It's been like that for a minute. We the real rock stars, and I'm the biggest of all of 'em. I'm the number one rock star on the planet."
Interviewer,"There it is. That record, it says that. That's what your album says when you come out, and there were songs on there, you make that very clear."
Kanye,"So what I want to explain to everybody out there, it's like, I make music I can do it, but I shouldn't be limited to only one place of creativity. And it's literally only like one or two or three reasons why I haven't been able to break that down."
Interviewer,"But why would you feel that you are, because and I'm just.."
Kanye,"This is the thing you guys don't understand. You guys don't understand. You guys don't understand that I did the Yeezus and they eBay-ed it for $90,000."
Interviewer,Right.
Kanye,"And people wanted them bad as whatever, right? But I didn't get a call from Nike the next day. You guys don't understand that I've met with companies and they say, ""What we're trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that"". If you're a architect, if you're a world builder, if you have all these ideas and you're Gaudi, and you want to build buildings, if you don't ever get that out, what's going to happen?"
Interviewer,Isn't that why you do it? Isn't it the process? Isn't it the point to do it?
Kanye,I don't think you're really hearing what I'm saying.
Interviewer,But I'm trying to.
Kanye,As a creative..
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"For you to have done something to the level of the Yeezus and not be able to create more and you cannot you cannot create that on your own, with no support, with no backing. So when I say ""clean water was only served to the fairer skinned"" what I'm saying is we're making products with chitlins. T-SHIRTS! That's the most we can make! T-shirts. We could have our best perspective on t-shirts. But if it's anything else, your Truman Show boat is hitting the wall."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"And then, it doesn't get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and they're talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how it'll be higher priced tickets and it will be something that's surrounding you and blah blah blah, but maybe it's in the goggles, I said, ""Wait a second, I just only did the interview to tell people that I invented it. I made it.""."
Interviewer,"I mean, I know in the past you've talked about, like, you know, building hotels, doing things that are beyond people's normal frame of reference."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"They know you as Kanye West, an artist. They know that you're moving into fashion, but these things I guess in a way are hard for people to comprehend because they don't have that level of drive. Do you know what that mean? Has it always been like this for you? Have you always felt like you can set your mind to anything and you will achieve it, ultimately?"
Kanye,"I always felt like I could do anything. That's the main thing people are controlled by, thoughts, their perception of themselves. They're slowed down by their perception of themselves. If you're taught you can't do anything you won't do anything. I was taught I could do everything, and I'm Kanye West, aged 36. So just watch the next ten years."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Kanye,"One thing I want to express to people also, people think a lot of my motivation is very like megalomaniac, and self-oriented. To the contrary completely I just want to help, from day one, I just wanted to help."
Interviewer,"No, not entirely true by the way."
Kanye,"A little bit but no number one records, no Kanye West, blah blah right. So then I was going back at forth, with the company I'm in touring right now. And I said I want to perform in the round and then creatively we just couldn't find it, so I said put me against the corner like how we did in Watch the Throne, well just do that instead. They said, well you know we just can't technically do it, because why, technically why. Why can't you do it? They said, look if you do that you are going to be in breach of contract, right. So basically meaning like if I didn't sell the tickets, I would go into debt."
Interviewer,Right.
Kanye,"So they pushed me my back against the ropes, right and I said I'll take that chance. I'll take that chance right. So pre-order 9,000 the first day in Chicago doubling Watch the Throne, four pre-orders in one day. That made the people stood up said, we like what Kanye is saying. We like New Slaves."
Interviewer,But we do that all the time.
Kanye,"Yeah, but not through radio."
Interviewer,"Well, yet but I'm a radio broadcaster and I love your records. I mean for me.."
Kanye,"No I'm not pin-pointing just you, I'm talking about the overall radio, there is no, ""Get Lucky"" on the album, and perhaps you know it's just because that just wasn't the song, and maybe it could be that, but it sounds like there's hits on that album to me. But it sounds like this hits that is distracted by the statements ""fuck you and your corporation, ya'll niggas can't control me"" on the first single."
Interviewer,"Yeah I mean this to me sounds like a radio hit where I'm coming from, but you said yourself back in the start, you made a record that was built out of frustration and then you were trying to create cracks in the pavement. I like that description more than you made an album for the radio hits. As a Kanye West fan, I don't turn to your .."
Kanye,I never described it as an album for the radio hits.
Interviewer,"No, no, no, what I'm saying like I preferred than you to describe it as cracks in the pavement than to have made a record just full the radio hits. You know what I mean, I want to hear where you are at."
Kanye,"Pause that, pause that. That song is a hit song, minus the line, ""fuck you and your corporation, ya'll niggas can't control me"" on your first single."
Interviewer,I think it's a great record.
Kanye,But you ain't hearing what I am saying.
Interviewer,Go ahead.
Kanye,"That song is a hit record minus, ""fuck you and your corporation, ya'll niggas can't control me, said on your first single. Because if you can't control me then you can't control him, then you can't control him, then you can't control him, and then the information age starts, where it occurs while I was talking about starts where Steve Jobs has left as starts. Steve Jobs made the internet usable. This is the information age, we barely scratched the surface."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"There is things that are moving. The entire music industry was hit by a fucking glacier by the internet and Sean Parker, just like that glacier up in there, and Steve was like no, no, wait a second, come on, give him a little time. There won't be any music, if you just give it away like that. You know what I'm saying, but shit it's changing. People are going to look at this interview and say, ""Hey, I understand what he's talking about."" ""People are going to look at this interview and say, 'I don't like Kanye. Look, he looks mad. I don't like his teeth.' They're going to say, 'Why doesn't he just focus on music? I liked him as music.' They're going to say, 'Hey, I want the old Kanye, blah blah blah.' But one thing they will do, they will play this interview in five years. They will play this interview in ten years and say, he called that, he called that, he called that, he said that was going to happen, that was going to change."
Interviewer,You're a futurist.
Kanye,"Yeah. I'm a postmodernist, as best as a career. I'm a futurist, mentally."
Interviewer,"Talking about the Internet where you feature into that. Obviously, it's just a small part of the future and being a futurist. It's not only just isn't aspect of it. It's changed the way everything moves, but it certainly with regards for music."
Kanye,"It's the biggest part. It's our earth. Like you remember like, that you see future movies and everything was in the sky, like it moved to the sky."
Interviewer,That's where it is.
Kanye,That's the Internet.
Interviewer,Right.
Kanye,That's what it is. That's our sky.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"That's our future sky. We kind of thought we knew it was in its flying cars. We didn't get flying cars, but we can send movies like in two seconds."
Interviewer,"Yeah, it's a very good point. It's a very point."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"So you talk about it being in its early stages and it being really not even yet at a point where it's developed to its true potential. I mean, what are the key things that you've learned in your journey. I'm fascinated to go down this road for a minute if you want."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,We could talk about this because I'd love to.
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,But while we hear..
Kanye,"This record is just the codes of that. Go listen to all my music. It's the codes of self esteem. It's the codes of who you are? If you're a Kanye West fan, you are not a fan of me. You're a fan of yourself. You will believe in yourself. I'm just the expresso. I'm just the shot in the morning to get you going, to make you believe that you could overcome that situation that you are dealing with all the time."
Interviewer,Can I ask you a question about that?
Kanye,"Yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,"I want to talk to you about that aspect of your personality because you said that you're not here to be talk about you you're here to help, and I believe you, when you say that man. You know, I think, you know, you've given us great records. You'd like to think about where things are going to appear in the future. You keep your eye on things. You want to make like you said, you want to make basketball tops for you. If you're in high school, you want to do things right."
Kanye,"Yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,"Do you allow yourself the time to be good to yourself? Do you allow yourself anytime for yourself at all? Do you know what I mean, I know you've got a good self esteem and who you are, but you seem to be doing a lot for the bigger picture, for everything that's moving around you."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,Do you give yourself time?
Kanye,"Yeah, it's like family time. Yeah, it's what Kim gave me."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"She gave me everything. She gave me a family. She gave me a support system. She was in a powerful enough situation, where she could love me without asking me for money, which is really hard for me to find."
Interviewer,"Yeah. What are the some other things you know, that you've learned about yourself since you became a family man?"
Kanye,"You know, I can't pinpoint that I don't have the answer right on me. I got to think about a little bit and give you a really good answer."
Interviewer,"Okay, cool."
Kanye,I've got a lock and loaded amount of information that I like to express on a very wide scale that I'll give you. But if you ask me a question like that I'll go back and think of it maybe I'll have an answer for you in a couple of days.
Interviewer,"Okay. No problem, no problem."
Kanye,"Yeah. When you get other outlets, you can relax and give other outlets more breathing room, meaning like, okay. When I did the Coachella performance, I had 30 dancers on stage, modern performance artists and I had this lift, and I had the Roman wall and I had like the Celine shirt and above all this types. So when Jay told me to watch it, I always say I didn't want to use dancers of course. And I said, that's fine, because I was doing a fashion show in Paris. So I still had 30 girls on the stage, but you know, I still had these elements of the emotion."
Interviewer,"You must have been recognized that wasn't to through anything either I mean, that was I mean this only what throwing was about that type of performance necessarily."
Kanye,"Um, what I'm saying is it's about what I want to make it about. This is my world."
Interviewer,But you're with Jay on this start. It is a collaborative project. It's not just your vision on throwing.
Kanye,"Yeah. So then I would have to separate my world, but still get to my world out to the fact that I had a fashion show. You see I'm saying, so it's like right now, people could say oh, he is frustrated, He is that. He is that. No, all I need is the breakthrough. The joint venture for of my clothing, same as Stella McCartney has, same as I can name so many people. They have joint ventures of backing to be able to express themselves that way. Okay, bam!"
Interviewer,"Give us an insight to the fashion world though, what you've been going through there with that whole experience. The biggest challenge you've had clearly to get your vision across?"
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"Well, be helping me."
Interviewer,"Is that partly and please don't take this the wrong way I just mean this in for the process of conversation. Is that partly do you think because some of the people who are making fashion look at you and they go well, you say it yourself they dedicate their whole lives to one thing, you are exceptionally successful and gifted in this area. To move into the area, it's understandable, there is a human aspect of suspicion involved there because they are like ""well, hang on a minute, this is our life"". So what is it you are trying to achieve there? Do you think it plays a part of that what's going on do you think?"
Kanye,"I've dedicated the past 10 years of my life to this. I spent 80% of my time working on this, and 20% of my time working on music. Why do you think this song Niggas In Paris is called Niggas In Paris, because Niggas was in Paris, because I had a office and a small courtyard across the street from Colette, where I couldn't even find a good pattern cutter. That's why we were in Paris."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,100..
Interviewer,"Okay, so let's .."
Kanye,.. features.
Interviewer,"Let's get to the solution Kanye, let's work out. How are you going to kick that door in as well? How are you going to get in to that world in you're way, in your terms?"
Kanye,"I'm not trying to get into that world. I'm trying to make a higher level of product for the real world because people say life is unfair and unless you're Kanye West, you know, this pretty girl that dates this soccer player, or your parents had money, you don't get to wear Versace all the time. And you hear it, we love Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace. We love Versace. Versace is the greatest designer of all time. We love Versace. But unless you set a point or you rap so good, and knock down so many doors to produce so much shit, that you was able to actually get Dame Dash to give you a record deal because he was a producer, not because he liked your raps because he was a producer."
Interviewer,Right.
Kanye,You still feel like the greatest version of you..
Interviewer,Right.
Kanye,".. when you have those Nikes on, right? But you can have on a ZARA pant, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Kanye,"And a girl walks in with the Celine version, and you feel like shit. That is the problem. That is the problem."
Interviewer,"I mean, obviously not my problem because I live like a.."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"I mean, I dress the same way I do it all the 12.."
Kanye,"But I'm talking about, I'm talkin' about us, the new slaves, the people who love fashion. I'm talking about us, you know? Because I'm a slave to it. I love it."
Interviewer,"Oh, dude, I can tell like.."
Kanye,I love it!
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"I love it since age five, when my mama brought me to a discount fur spot. And she asked me what I like? Everything I liked was too expensive for us. That's five years old. I went to my grandfather's funeral like three weeks back, and my cousin that works with me, stood up and he told the story about you know, how his mother was a tailor, so he won best dress. I worn best dress in the high school too. A bunch of people in the lineage and my family worn best dress. But his mother was a tailor right? His mother was a tailor, a black, an African-American tailor."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"Remember, remember how that girl in there, the people that was raising here were.."
Interviewer,Glitch.
Kanye,"Yeah, she was the glitch."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"You telling me they don't look at me like I'm the motherfucking glitch? You telling me people don't look at Kanye West like the Glitch? Right now. And she was on the side of the video game, the whole time! It's in my code. It's in my code."
Interviewer,"I mean, I watch what happens when you get on the mic or you get on stage, and you say what you want to say, and I don't want to refer this back to you comment about the glitch, right. And I watch people, you know, I see what some people say in comments and whatever after these things get posted, and I go, all right, those are the people that think you're the glitch."
Kanye,"Yeah, they broke Vanellope's car!"
Interviewer,"But, but, but.."
Kanye,"Vanellope Von Schweetz, they broke her car!"
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,Like.
Interviewer,"But there is also a lot of people in the audience that love what you have to say, love hearing what you have to say. You know.."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,.. appreciate what you have to say.
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,Do you focus on them as well?
Kanye,"Yeah, 100%. But I'm doing it for everyone. I'm doing it for the people who don't appreciate it because they'll appreciate it later, and of course, I'm doing it for the people who appreciate it. If no one appreciate it, I know, there is couple of people up there to appreciate it."
Interviewer,For sure. I appreciate it.
Kanye,"So and thank you very much. And then people will say your voice was so strong, why are you so focused on just clothing or why would you focus on just that award show or why will you focus on that? The same reason why I sat there and focused on that Otis beat."
Interviewer,Sure.
Kanye,"You're walking down the street without a headphones, it's like, 'Oh what's up? How you are doing today? No headphones today? Cool! No music today'. What you did, you know. No shoes? 'Look, man. What's going on?"
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,You're having problems with the family?'.
Interviewer,Is he okay?
Kanye,"Wear your socks, at least."
Interviewer,Yeah. Sandals.
Kanye,Sandals. Yeah.
Interviewer,"Flip-flops, very rarely."
Kanye,Flip-flops.
Interviewer,Very rarely.
Kanye,Sandals with socks. Keep it gangster.
Interviewer,I mean. I'm from New Zealand flip-flops are far more standing.
Kanye,"Yeah, exactly. But not for black dudes, though. No flip-flops for black dudes. I don't care where you at. I don't care where you at. No flip-flop for black dudes. Wear some hot-ass Jordans on a beach."
Interviewer,Dude! We've covered some stuff.
Kanye,What about you?
Interviewer,"Now can you do me a favor, like my brain is just like. I walked into his house, two more of the guys there sipping in, man I hope I'll learn some stuff today, my god I have no idea, but would you indulge in me for five or 10 minutes and would you let me just geek out on a music label, because you know me."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"I love hearing what you have to say, some of it I love, some of it upsets me, because as a fan I think you are too out on yourself but that's you, that's who you are, that's not for me to say."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,But..
Kanye,What points do you think I'm hard on myself?
Interviewer,"Well I think you expect a huge amount of yourself on every level, as well you should and I think that you expect a huge amount of everybody else to understand your motives at all times."
Kanye,"Oh no, I don't expect to be understood at all."
Interviewer,"Okay, but."
Kanye,Like I don't expect to be I think that there's people who are wired by their parents to understand what I'm saying.
Interviewer,Sure.
Kanye,"And there's people who are wired by their parents to reject what I'm saying, but that doesn't mean that after I make what I'm saying, that they won't use it, because they will."
Interviewer,"Lets talk about the production side of things, because you've opened the door to collaboration in a big way on this record and even though you produced every song on this record you've been very, very open to the idea of working with all sorts of very talented individuals."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Have you enjoyed that aspect of it, I mean in the past you know it hasn't necessarily been that much of a group mentality in making records."
Kanye,"It's the only way I can do it at this point. I can't do it by myself, I can't, like I won't, it is I have no interest in sitting down in the studio by myself and making a track. When I made 'Overnight Celebrity,' which is great, like; I sat down there by myself and made it. And there's people like, 'Yeah, that's the answer, make the music by yourself again 'Ye, we want the old 'Ye.' But No, I don't feel like doing that."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"I want to utilize the best resources that we have and have a conversation, as you see I would rather have a conversation."
Interviewer,"Was 'Throne' a turning point for that, because I felt I would 'Throne', there was a freedom there that didn't necessarily feel like you were carrying the whole thing on your own, and also you are free to be an MC, to be upfront and be a part of that process with Jay and it wasn't like oh Kanye the producer rapper or the whole encompassing thing. Did that began around that time?"
Kanye,"Yeah around it but Dark Fantasy though. When we sowed that fabric so tight you know like for eight, nine months Pete Rock, and No I.D., and Q-tip everyone coming down to Hawaii, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, we like textured and Jeff Bhasker we created those textures collectively, you know like I would be eating breakfast with Ross in the morning, and just come up with a line and stuff and we all go play ball and Naz would come out there and play ball with me and Common and stuff, come up with another line, then go there and then Virgil will have a idea we say that and , because its that communal process a lot of times."
Interviewer,You can't do it all on your own.
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,You can't handle everything on your own.
Kanye,"Hey how about us as a people, we can't do it on our own."
Interviewer,That's true.
Kanye,"We have to understand that we're not each other's enemy. We have to stop discriminating against each other due to class and due to race and due to location or financial position. We have to say ""wow that is the best version, lets use it, lets bring it, lets bring it to light, lets move forward, lets push forward as a civilization"" because we are so jacked up on our own egos and so misguided by mainstream marketing, we don't know what the fuck is real, we would be out again to a fight, this quick for the dumbest reason, definitely something that's like racially, there is a gender set, you know its like, you know which is like we are pitted against each other, we are mentally not in a place to be accepting, to not be jealous and that part of that jealousy and that frustration that goes across an entire globe is due to some of these other high corporation level limitations, everybody is being served a nasty lunch food. Like you know you heard the word minimalism a lot on this project."
Interviewer,Yes of course.
Kanye,"Even this is like, you gave us what you need, may not be what you want, give us what we need to proceed."
Interviewer,"Not what we necessarily want, because we can't be trusted to a certain extent, you know."
Kanye,"Yeah, because we don't have the education."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,To know what to want.
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah."
Kanye,"We don't know what to want, this is what I was telling that writer in NW  I'm learning what I want, this is the reason why I'm working at five architects in a time, but that time that I'm spending in a bad apartment, I can't get that back, and that education that I could get from working on it is priceless, and there is very few people that are in the position to educate themselves as much as I can educate myself. For me its constant information intake, I hang around architects mostly."
Interviewer,"Yeah I want to talk about that side of things, because I know that that's how you know that was that's been talked about in relation to this record as well and that blows my mind, I mean for me I try and connect the dots to my favorite records as much as I can."
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,But I need you to help me connect the dots and how architecture and how certain type of design that you surrounded yourself with Walston Paris has somehow manifested itself into this and how they are not separate things.
Kanye,"Yeah, it all parallels, its like you know synesthesia seeing sounds, it all parallels. People will tell you this business inst like this business, it's the same people every where you go, the same type of guy you might meet in Hollywood, you might meet that same type of character in fashion, you might meet that same type of character in music."
Interviewer,"You know people will look at what is being going on with you and the cameras, that's been going on with other people for a long time as well and I need you to help people who don't live your life and look at those magazines and there is millions and millions of people that do and look at those pictures who don't understand what it is that you go through in that situation, what is it from your perspective, you have got this platform, you have used this to talk about a bunch of things, so use it now to explain to them why is it what is it, what is it like to go through that?"
Kanye,"Okay, for me first of all Dopeness is what I like the most, Dopeness People who want to make things as dope as possible and by default make money from it."
Interviewer,"Understand, give it rules, give it boundaries."
Kanye,"Yeah and obviously like publishing, like because publishing, like because they're selling our image. And they're selling it in a bad way, and if."
Interviewer,"But let me get this straight, what is offending you more, the fact they are selling your image or the fact they are selling your image in a bad way, in a bad way?"
Kanye,"In a bad way, a bad way and I'm not getting paid for it."
Interviewer,"Right, there you go."
Kanye,"So it's like the dopeness which makes the money, I want the dopeness and the money."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"I'm changing things for my daughter. I'm going to tell my daughter, by the time she understands what it was, Man, me and your mother were in a completely different situation than you're in. At that time, Paparazzi wasn't legal, people could take pictures, people could climb over your fence, people could do that you wouldn't even get paid for it. You see all these checks that you're getting at age six, because people taking your picture? You don't have to worry about thing, a thing ever again just because people want to take your picture, like and I made that happen, Lowe. That's what I'm going to tell her."
Interviewer,"So  to be done, oh I want to talk to you about control, I want talk to you about the verse and control. About Kendrick verse and 'Control'. Because obviously he credited you, he put you at the table where he rightfully should be with the M&Ms and the Jay Z's, he put you on that side of the equation and then and then raddled off the list and I thought okay its great you deserved to be at the table, but 10 years ago if you hadn't been at the table and you had been on his list, how do you think you would have reacted, would you have been appreciative of his message or would you have come out swinging do you think and written a response?"
Kanye,Yeah I don't diss records.
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. You are looking forward to two with him; I mean that's an incredible double bill."
Kanye,"Yeah its 100%, its 100%. I'm just looking forward to the opportunity to speak to this brother as much as possible. That those conversations is going to be more than everything I even say it right here. Because that he is one of our future messengers and I'm going to give him them jewels."
Interviewer,"Let's talk about this track here, which was the first track that we were given off this album to play on the radio which we did. He said no singles, but we ran with this one early and we proven to be right. So just talk about this track here and who you worked with, you worked with Daft Punk on this in part, and how the song came together?"
Kanye,"Daft had the drums, and I then just took the reck and I just started, both this song, 'I Am a God' and this song were made after Hedi Slimane didn't let me into his first Saint Laurent show, but it wasn't that he wanted me to go, but he just told me I couldn't go to any other shows other than that."
Interviewer,"Right, right, right, right."
Kanye,"And I was like, wait a second. I can't go? You're not telling no editor they can't go to any of these shows. I'm not your boy you can control me in some way. So I made off of that, I went into the studio with the producers that made the music for his show and made 'I Am a God' and 'Black Skinhead.'."
Interviewer,That was your reaction to that situation again.
Kanye,That was my reaction.
Interviewer,That was the aspect of frustration you talked about that's important to this record.
Kanye,Yes.
Interviewer,"Yeah right on. I mean just talking about another track on here as well. New Slaves which is one of my favorite songs on the record and you know its just as far as beats go its just remarkable, before you even get stuck into the subject matter which is a whole other level. I mean you know you are talking about the materialism, about communist, about corporations and everything else, but at the same time you know there is a blurred line between whether or not you are part of it, whether you are objecting to it or where it stands. I mean just give us some insight into what this song is."
Kanye,"I'm 100% a part of it, I'm 100% in it, and 100% I want to over come it, sometimes I'm the communicator of it, some times I'm the maker of it, some times I'm the consumer of it, I'm in it, I'm in the game. But for me yeah I say I am a New Slave, you could be a slave to a lot of things At this point obviously I'm a slave to my passion; I'm a slave to my mission. It's funny; you drive in a Maybach past a homeless person and you ask Who's more free? You could be trapped to your possessions. You got to do this next deal because you got to do this with your house and you got to get this car and you got to keep up, everybody stay next to you last name is Jones, and you trying to keep up with all of them. And that's what it's like to be a celebrity a lot times Especially every rap is about how much money you make how many spends you get, how many cars you got, what house you get, you know what house A Rock got. We like you know Rappers and musicians trying to compete with ball players with way bigger contracts. Meanwhile, the music is the Titanic that's going down like this and everybody from the execs to the musicians are running around trying to see how they could still keep that certain house level, that certain car level that certain thing up And of course for me I'm blessed and I'm blessed and I'm privileged because I made such a powerful impact that I can make a certain amount on tour. But also I'm blessed and cursed by my level of education, you know to be a visionary, all you have to do is make decisions based off of your eyes instead of your ears and your memory. I mean so at the moment of the MTV awards, I made that decision based off of my eyes"
Interviewer,Good luck.
Kanye,Thanks.
Interviewer,"All right, thank you crew."
Kanye,Thank you.
Interviewer,"Oh my god, that was the most intense fucking interview in my life."
Kanye,Not since Pac right?
Interviewer, Hello Mr. West.
Kanye," What's up? What's going on, man? Good to see you,."
Interviewer, Good to see you too. We finally did it. We're here. We made it happen.
Kanye," We're in the building. Yes, sir."
Interviewer, Yeah. So what.
Kanye, What are you doing? You're running for president.
Interviewer," Uh, yes."
Kanye," What made you decide to do that? Aren't you busy enough? Clothing company, successful rapper, family man."
Interviewer," It was something that God put on my heart back in 2015, uh, a few days before the MTV Awards."
Kanye, It just it hit me in the shower.
Interviewer," And when I first thought of it, I just started, like, laughin to myself."
Kanye," And it, it like all this, like Joy came over my over my body just through my soul. And I could just I just felt that energy. I felt that spirit. So then two days later, I accepted the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Awards at the MTV Awards."
Interviewer," And um instead of performing, you know, my array of hit songs, you know, I gave, uh, just my perspective on award shows."
Kanye, But always I knew at the end I was going to tell people I'm running for office. I'm running for president in 2020.
Interviewer," And, you know, just to have the it even took heart to say it in that context and people are just like, oh, like their minds are blown."
Kanye," And then I was hanging out with different I had different friends that were, you know, some people in the music industry, some people, tech elites, different things like that. And they would really you know, they just really took it as a joke."
Interviewer," And they're telling me all these millions of reasons why I couldn't run for president. I remember running into Oprah two days or one day after that, she's like, you don't want to be president."
Kanye," And, you know, people just, you know, thought projecting putting this on you."
Interviewer," And I remember saying one of my responses to one of the people that one of the naysayers was, Will, I'll definitely be a billionaire by that time. And not that that's a reason why someone should become president. But as to say, you know. At that time, I was 50, around 50 million dollars in debt, and I knew I had the confidence that I would be able to turn that around."
Kanye," And now, you know, just going into it, I want to give you a that that's a clear answer."
Interviewer," Well, I know you're saying I don't I don't want to go off into it. No, it's OK. Yeah, well, you basically saying is, you know, to set goals in order to achieve them."
Kanye," Well, what was Oprah's rationale when she said you don't want to be the president? Like, what was she saying? Because remember when people were saying that that's our next president. Remember when Trump got elected? You know, they showed Oprah and they were like it was I believe it was like NBC tweeted it, this is our next president. Like, they a lot of people wanted Oprah to want to run."
Interviewer," And they felt like if Trump could win, Oprah could win. When I saw Trump, when I was like, see? You can win out, you know, you can win if you're coming from outside of politics. I was young when Ronald Reagan was in was president. I don't remember. Ronald Reagan was the governor of California before he was the president."
Kanye," He had actually proven himself as a politician, at least somewhat, which is an idea that people have thrown out at me to to be governor of California, to be governor of California."
Interviewer," Anyone better than this guy to do good, start there, get a shot, open things up again, man."
Kanye," But I think I think my calling is to be, uh, I believe that my calling is to be the leader of the free world. That not I mean, if it's in God's plan, that part of my path is to be the governor, then that's fine, but my calling is to be the leader of the free world."
Interviewer," So when you say this, like when you say your calling is to be the leader of the free world, what what does that mean to you? Does that does it mean do you have a plan that's different than the plans that have been implemented before? Does it mean that you have no idea what kind of plan, like the plan to be the leader? Like what would you do if you were the leader of the free world? Like, what would be different about the way you would handle things?."
Kanye," Like if that's your plan, like what is it about that?."
Interviewer," That is your calling? Like, why why would you want to do that, like, what do you want to do differently if you were the leader of the free world? Well, well. There was a couple of questions in there, you said wise, you know, why is that you're calling this? People say to me, you know, they'll say, well, music is bigger than politics or more influential than politics or celebrities or more influential."
Kanye," And I thought of it like if I was a pastor of a 100000 person church. But then I was also a captain, a sailor. And then we went to war and I said, I'm going to man this ship that has."
Interviewer," A thousand people, a thousand soldiers on it, because God is calling me. To take this position, even though I'm the pastor for. You know, however big my audience is in hip hop, in music or as a just an influencer or celebrity or just as a dad and a husband in my house. The world is like. It couldn't be a better time to put a visionary in the in the captain's chair."
Kanye," And that's not to say we haven't had visionary's be before, I'm not coming here to turn down any of the other, I'm not here to down Trump, down Biden. I'm just here to express why. Why? God has called me to take this position. So when you say a visionary, you think of yourself in terms of like as an artist, as a creator, as someone who has these thoughts that they manifest in terms of music and art, creation, design, the things that you do."
Interviewer, That's why you think you're different as a visionary.
Kanye," Yeah, I. I think that. I think I'm different from I mean, we're all different, so I'm definitely different from everybody, we're all different from each other. I mean, I do bump into people that seem to be like the same character inside of."
Interviewer," Yeah, it's like other people's before. Yeah."
Kanye," People play the same roles, like I just met you before you, that you're just like the head of this company over here are the same kind of person."
Interviewer," Yeah. You know, I mean, I manifest, I see things."
Kanye," I'm a great leader because I listen and I'm empathetic and I feel the entire earth and I feel us as a as a species, as the human race, like I did."
Interviewer, Sometimes people think a utopia as almost like a negative word.
Kanye, That's that's like we couldn't have that. But I do believe in world peace.
Interviewer," Like the people hit me with the one of the things Oprah said is she said, you got to bone up on foreign affairs. I remember this, like, because it's Oprah talking."
Kanye, I remember a lot of what the conversation was.
Interviewer," But that's the first thing she said was, you know, foreign affairs and foreign policies like this."
Kanye," I think the reason why I say leader and not politician and not even specifically president is, uh."
Interviewer," This is the time, you know, when the constitution was written that was in innovation. Now the world is innovated all around our political system, but we have innovated and simplified our political system."
Kanye," So I met with this gentleman, Sam, one of the founders of Y Combinator."
Interviewer, So Y Combinator is a a.
Kanye," Is a contract that my friend, the head of Dropbox used and that a lot of tech guys use and it's a standardized deal. So one of the ideas I had when I was in this process of Innova, I'm not I'm not at war with the music industry."
Interviewer, It's just it's time for us to innovate and we need to have contracts that make sense with exactly how we sell music.
Kanye," So, you know, people every Vicini and that's like every 20 years, that's like the like decade is ten of seniors, 20. And as you see now, it's like the world has just stopped for a second and there's an opportunity to look and say, what are the things we need?."
Interviewer," What are the things we don't need? So I don't know if you saw when I posted my contract, I had ten contracts that kept on putting me inside a labyrinth. And there's things that we don't need now. I believe that the distribution."
Kanye," Partner, that the label is like Prince would go and say, oh, we don't need the distribution partner, especially if Prince was, you know, really alive and thriving in this Internet era. I'm the kind of person where I'm not trying to go and eliminate anyone's job."
Interviewer," So record labels are afraid of saying, OK, we're going to hand over the distribution completely to you guys, which is, you know, that's a possibility."
Kanye," There's a way where both parties can be happy and that these infrastructural partners can be of service to the influencer, to the artists like these."
Interviewer, These deals can be.
Kanye," Flipped in a way that they're just more fair, you know, a record and I just let me just go into this specific place with the record labels for a second."
Interviewer, I'm talking about this is a confusing thing for people on the outside.
Kanye," Yeah. So before when I told my father I wanted to rap, he was very like Laoghaire."
Interviewer," Of that, I'd said this this I heard this business is terrible and, you know, he's right."
Kanye," Like people are all seeing things that are wrong inside of contracts, turning a blind eye to it. And everyone's responsible. Everyone's a part of it. You know, it's like when the Metoo movement happened, you know, it wasn't just the guys that were getting tagged and, you know, some of the guys should have got hit with it. Some guy shouldn't. You know, that's not what I'm here to talk about."
Interviewer," I'm saying that. In a way, everyone's responsible. Everyone's a part of the problem. That's why I really love that Black Mirror episode when, you know, everyone was making comments and anyone that even made a comment, the bees, it was about these, you know, mechanical bees, anyone."
Kanye, And this is a spoiler alert if you haven't seen this episode.
Interviewer," But anyone who made a comment, the bees came to go get them. And that's the thing about what you put in the universe, even a thought, you know. You put that thought into. It's another thing to say something negative and put then to the universe is another thing."
Kanye," To see someone being raped, you know, is the reason why I compare what's happening to in the music industry to me, too, because artists are raped."
Interviewer, You've heard that term before. I'm not this is not like this. Not like a new thing that I'm making up. The the contracts are made to rape the artist.
Kanye," And, you know, I put my like I think about. You know, this is like a thought right now, it's like is this a a negative thought that I'm putting into the universe?."
Interviewer," But I have to say, like when I was going on Twitter, I was thinking about Bruce and Brandon Lee that crossed my mind to say I'm this is Sony. This is Universal. And I'm willing to put the blue. Pain on my face and go out and do this. Because it's the right thing to do, like music at this point loses me money, it doesn't make it doesn't make money. It is my my five dollars billion net worth and 300 million dollars of cash that I see a year."
Kanye, Music is like negative four million for me.
Interviewer, So these contracts for me were kind of like whang grow and heat where this guy had everything.
Kanye," But he still said Wango messed up this, this, this heist that we're going to do."
Interviewer," Like I look at the music industry and that music and the love of music itself. But the music industry, I look at it like Wango, like. I blame. You know. The loss of my mother partially on the entertainment. Industry, the always fighting to. You know, represent, you know, who you are against media, entertainment industry that's trying to tear down anybody that's not going with the flow. I see."
Kanye," You know, I've got those kind of reasons personally, but vengeance is mine, said the Lord."
Interviewer, So it's not a matter of going in for revenge.
Kanye, That's just me as a human being where I fall short like I'm not a monk. Can you explain what you're talking about with Bruce Lee and Brenda Lee would have lost you there.
Interviewer," OK, so Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee were both murdered. Well, Brandon Lee died in an accident on a movie set. Yeah, you think it was a murder?."
Kanye," I felt that's a conspiracy, right? The conspiracy was that the Chinese triad killed him the same way they killed Bruce."
Interviewer," But the coroner's report was that Bruce died from a reaction to a medication, right?."
Kanye," Yeah. I mean, but I think about that any time I go to the go to the hospital, I'm very. You know, I'm mindful of that stuff you think about, like Bob Marley. They didn't just JFK or MLK him. There's like reports that it was something in his toe or he had cancer."
Interviewer, Right. I believe he had a skin cancer. Yeah.
Kanye," Like, I went to go. I got a shot in my in my hand because just from text in and out of my thumb was, like, hurt."
Interviewer, And then I posted so much. You hurt your thumb. Absolutely. Just texting way too much. So I post a picture.
Kanye," Of the screen at the hospital, and then I was asked to take it down. Bye bye. People just call them, I forget exactly who asked me, but it was like they got to my management, they get to this and they said, take that picture down like the hospital. It was in the weirdest place, you know."
Interviewer, So what did they not like about the picture?.
Kanye," I think it had like it might have had some information on it that they didn't want to go out, like an address or something like that."
Interviewer," And I was just like, but I don't want to go down, go down these rabbit holes. I'm just saying, like Michael Jackson not waking up one day, Prince not waking up one day, Bruce and Brandon Lee, Bob Marley, all of these things are have crossed my mind, you know, as I'm going and saying I need to innovate with these contracts are not just for me, but for all artists."
Kanye," It's not about me getting my masters back. It's about. It's about. Freedom and I say on a new song, I say, if I would put myself in harm's way to get my masters, they would put their self in harm's way to stay the master."
Interviewer," And that there's a complete parallel to the way the music industry works and the way the world currently works and the influence that America has on other countries and the way governments work, the influence and the way government and the way people in power and control deal with. You know, disaster relief deal, deal with Haiti, deal with the Bahamas, like where is the money going? Why aren't things being built? And this concept of money."
Kanye," Right? I asked myself this. I asked him one week ago, like, how much is America in debt? And they were like this many trillion. And then I asked a rhetorical question, but the dumbest question I've ever asked myself, I said, well, you know, how much does the earth cost?."
Interviewer," I think they got a bad question. But how much is the earth worth? Yeah, what is what is the worst? What all the things on earth. Yeah."
Kanye, And it's saying we can't buy it. We couldn't make enough money to buy the Earth. Right. So that means we made money.
Interviewer," So if money is the key to all people's happiness and will solve everything and everyone's doing things for money, let's just make more money. But it's not about making more money. It's about keeping poor people, poor and rich, people rich and people keeping people in their place."
Kanye, And right now we're experiencing the fall of Rome or the Titanic has now hit a glacier.
Interviewer, And there's people who would prefer to go down with the Titanic than to get on a lifeboat because they don't want to get sea water on their dress or the nice outfit that people are so programmed and brainwashed into classism and protectionism that.
Kanye," It's difficult for people to embrace innovation unless it has a tag on it. That's got a name brand connected to it that says with this innovation, you will be better than the person, you'll be better than your next door neighbor."
Interviewer," You know, when I a Sunday service, I completely stop rapping because I didn't know how to rap for God. You know, all my raps always had, like. You know, like nasty jokes on it and. And then, you know. I made I made when I when I went to the hospital, I know you want to get into this. When I went to the hospital in 2016, I wrote Start a church in Calabasas."
Kanye," And as you left from twenty eighteen going into 2019, I said, I'm not going to let one Sunday go by without starting this church. And there's people who said it wasn't a church and different things."
Interviewer," But to start a ministry, I'm like the little drummer boy. I'm saying you know this all. I got to bring my drum. I might not be well versed in the word and but I know how to make music and I know how to put this choir together and all things can be made good for God."
Kanye," So it like quickly became the best choir of all time because all the best singers moved to California and now but a lot of them grew up in the church. So it's like the opportunity for you, for them to actually get paid singing for God because I would be funding it."
Interviewer, And that for me was like a tithe for me to fund Sunday service. And I was four months in before I gave my life to God like I wasn't saved.
Kanye," It's just I had a calling saying, just go make this church and the whole thing, the comparison to this church, to me going and saying, OK, why, why am I running for president, is to be in service."
Interviewer," And that service to my my own ego, you know, I feel like God says to me like, haven't I given you enough?."
Kanye," I gave you an ego that helped you overcome all these, you know, roadblocks and smokescreens and people telling you what you can't do. Now, you need to realize when you're doing things for your ego and when you're doing things for me."
Interviewer," This is like God, what I feel God is saying to me, because it really irritates me when people say God told me to tell you."
Kanye, So I'm very like mindful with this kind of word. And this I'm saying I have a feeling that that's what God is saying for me to be in service.
Interviewer," So the ultimate service position is leader of the free world, to be the president of the United States."
Kanye, It's sometimes you see me on Twitter. I say I want all to smoke. I want all the problems because the problems are the opportunities. There's an opportunity to solve things.
Interviewer," And Kurzweil, he created the keyboard."
Kanye," Well, he he has this video that Mark Romantic, this director that shot 99 problems for Jay-Z, which is like my favorite like top five or top ten favorite videos of all time."
Interviewer, He also did closer for Trent Reznor.
Kanye," And I like I just grew up on MTV in the 90s and I love more romantic videos, but he would share he'd share little bits and pieces."
Interviewer," I remember Ray Kurzweil talking about the ability for us to have a utopia, but us being led by the least noble and the most greedy."
Kanye," But if someone or when someone gets in a position of leadership. That is in service to God and in service to people, period, but immediately the American people I had the joke, I was saying like, man, no one outside of our country should be able to see these debates."
Interviewer, This is family business right here. This is only for America to see.
Kanye," We can't let anyone outside a country see but to be in service. So I stepped away already from my rap career for a year and served God every week, sometimes twice a week, three times a week."
Interviewer, Never missed a Sunday until covid.
Kanye," And and this is thing there are people inside of the church dealing, doing different things, trying to just take them out. And God still provided a way for us to keep that boat afloat."
Interviewer, We never missed a we never missed a service.
Kanye," And then one of my pastors, Pastor Adam, who is the way he preaches, is called expository. It's like one to one by the word. I like all different kind of preachers, but there's some type of preachers."
Interviewer," They they get up, they have the Bible in their hand, and they closed the Bible and then they just talk for two hours."
Kanye, And it's and and some do have anointing.
Interviewer, But the expository preachers go line for line. And for me it's like I come from entertainment. I got so much sauce. I don't need no sauce on the word.
Kanye, I need the word to be solid food that I can understand exactly what God was saying to me through the King James version.
Interviewer," Do this, you know, through this translation or the English version."
Kanye," So Pastor Adams was coming by my spot. I got this 300 acre spot in Calabasas that we had a little house in that I was recording. And I would play this music, these chords that I love."
Interviewer," They're almost like Monk like. And that's going to go on to something to talk about later, because I'm building a monastery, I'm building them a monastery."
Kanye, That will then be the future of monasteries.
Interviewer," It's like full sustainable energy. Now, he says to me, Pastor Adams says to me, when I was thinking about should I rap or not? He said, my son. Just said, you know, I wish I want to hear your rap album about Jesus, a rap album about Jesus, and it was through the mouth of babes like this person. I'm going to listen to the kids, bro. You know, I'm going to listen to my daughter."
Kanye," I'm going to listen to kids before I listen to, you know, super programmed out adults, and especially if that adult hasn't done something that I am looking to do."
Interviewer, Right.
Kanye," So it's so funny how people are so like free and almost arrogant with their advice. And I'm just like, why would I listen to you?."
Interviewer, You don't even ask me for any advice. I'm the most successful person I know. So the.
Kanye, So you said my son wants to hear a rap album from you. And that just that was that was the paradigm shift for me. I use that word alive. I like that. I like paradigm shifts in my favor. The and I I made this rap album.
Interviewer," And, you know, for a lot of people, it was the first album that they could play with a certain production level in the house with their with their with their family. Now, you know, you could argue if the watch the throne production was stronger or better than Jesus is king production."
Kanye," But when I go and I like I've been working with Dr. Dre and some of the beats to just be like, you know, the hardest beats possible."
Interviewer," And it's something that was very spiritual and meditative about the mix on Jesus is King, that it wasn't hitting as hard as Jesus or hitting as hard as watch the throne."
Kanye," It was like, this is how God wanted me to make this make this sonic painting and the way he wanted me to communicate. And so we did that album and then we did the Jesus Born album, which also got that idea from Pastor Adams and."
Interviewer," I mean, there's people who that's the only album they play and it's just bringing these gospel and I tell you, like my formula for these hymns I'm writing because I'm writing the songs that we're doing at Sunday Service is basically my book of hymns for the Future Gospel University that I'm creating where I've vision and will manifest a 200000 seat stadium circular with 100000 gospel singers."
Kanye," And people will go to this university and they will train the way, you know, a Russian Olympic swimmer, you know, a picture like they would be in the pool six days a week at least, if not seven days."
Interviewer," But for people who sing for the church or, you know, you know, because it's it's a tide is pro bono."
Kanye, All this like people don't practice that as much as we practice going in studio to rap or practice playing basketball if we're in the NBA.
Interviewer," So it's making the NBA, so to say, the Coliseum for God and what that if you like her like soccer chants and I and just like 60000 pairs."
Kanye," So I envision that for God, 100000 people sometimes singing in harmony, sometimes in unison glory, glory."
Interviewer, Oh God Almighty. We lift our hands and give you praise class.
Kanye," Oh or oh God Almighty, we lift hands and give you pray pitch a hundred thousand people in unison."
Interviewer," And that feeling what that would do for our spirits, our souls."
Kanye, It's healing.
Interviewer," There's natural forms of healing about our environment, the friends that we're around, what we're wearing, what we're eating, our diet. So Dondi is a design company that that I formed around ten years ago."
Kanye, And some of the people that worked at Donder now have went on to become heads of fashion houses like Virgil's.
Interviewer," They had a Louis Vuitton and he was the head of Donder at a certain point. Another guy that worked a Dhanda is now the head of Givenchy. So this is like the talent pool. And this Dhanda is basically my version of like a cyber, you know, extension of my brain."
Kanye, Like there's something that I'm thinking of that you can't touch.
Interviewer, But we need to we need to bring it into fruition.
Kanye, We need to manifest it and we have to see how to use things of our past and things of our now to create our future.
Interviewer, So it's a organization created to guarantee the future of the human race.
Kanye," Really. I thought about even calling it Edna because I see us all as superheroes. And Edna was the designer in The Incredibles, which is kind of almost really similar to Donna."
Interviewer, I'm just seeing these lineups and stuff.
Kanye," So so now our focus is food, clothing, shelter, communication, education and transportation."
Interviewer," So at the school that I just created, Easy Christian Academy, you know, we call NASA, we call different places about this hydroponic vertical, growing garden."
Kanye," And I remember sitting, you know, the idea of the garden is from A to Z. You have to be able to make your food right there fully sustainable, right there on your land."
Interviewer," And, you know, it's a bunch of people like, oh, I made this salad right here. It's like I'm not good enough."
Kanye," You still got to go to the grocery store for 80 percent, 60 percent of your stuff. I remember this one. You know, this one farmer we had you know, hewanted to build this class for the kids and all this I'm going to show the kids."
Interviewer, It's like people always make the kids version. I don't like this the kids version thing.
Kanye," Like kids need to understand how what of the pandemic was? You know, they lost all their parents."
Interviewer, And it was also the kids need to understand early how real life works. So physics is one of the anchors of the school that I'm creating.
Kanye," I remember, you know, the city is all self-sustaining, so it works off of our four main resources, Earth, when water and and fire and 90 percent of it is running off of water. What, like aqueducts, like the city of Masada. And I was talking to this engineer and saying, I need the whole thing to run off of water. And he said, well, we're going to have to use solar power. And I said, I don't."
Interviewer," And please, you know, don't take this as any offense. I don't like solar panels, I feel that their part is still of what Edison's idea was."
Kanye, I don't feel like they're really in line with what Nikola Tesla really wanted to do with alternative current get into the whole Tesla and what Edison did to take Tesla down and the fact the world would probably be free by now if Tesla wasn't basically destroyed by the media that Edison control and the propaganda that Edison control.
Interviewer, So I'm talking to my engineer and saying this needs to run completely with water and I don't want to use solar anyway.
Kanye," And he says, no, I'm saying we're going to use a mirror and it's going to connect to a steam engine and that's going to push the water back up. And I was like after, like, screaming at the guy. I was like, look, if I had known physics, I wouldn't have been screaming at my engineer. So if we think about what we're learning in school to learn physics, to learn farming, I was I was talking to."
Interviewer," A friend of mine that's a rapper and super super God following spiritual supersmart, and I was showing her the, uh, some of the designs for the monasteries and some of the designs for the fully sustainable community saw the same thing."
Kanye, And then it said bioengineering on it.
Interviewer," And she said what he is like for her bioengineering has a negative connotation. And my response was, isn't like farming and cooking, like bioengineering at the at the simplest form, like we went to going from like grabbing apples off of a tree to, oh, we put this boom in the ground."
Kanye," Oh. And we could grow this and we could grow this, you know, we could grow this harvest right here."
Interviewer," So it's you know, I want to just simplify and round up the the principle behind the Donder way of thinking is."
Kanye," We've got all this information and all this, you know, the science in the scientific exploration, these things that Tesla never completed, these things that Da Vinci never completed and. We can look at all of these things and see how do we create the most primitive versions of this to create a fully sustainable ecosystem, which is."
Interviewer," You know what, covid actually helped us to, you know, get closer to our families, get closer to our children, understand like, oh, wow, that, you know, that was mapped out for us to be 50 minutes away from our home and our kids school, to be 30 minutes away and to put us in traffic for that amount of time."
Kanye, And these cities have been designed to promote industry and just to make more money. They haven't been designed to promote happiness. So we're at this paradigm shift in our existence.
Interviewer," You know, it was when when Muhammad hit the market, I think that's who it was and brought money because before it was slave and trade. And this is something, you know, dishonorable men honor money. I got this bar from Dave Chappelle."
Kanye," I'm not trying to, like, steal his bar."
Interviewer," And, you know, we as human beings, this race on earth have like been honoring money. And, you know, money isn't."
Kanye," It's not even real, you know, it's not even backed by anything I don't want to, like, go too far into that, but when you unprogrammed yourself, you see that there's other forms of currency now, like relationships are a more important currency than money itself."
Interviewer," And that's what we really saw. It's like the end of the movie. Our existence would be pretty covid postSoviet. And so as the Titanic is crashing and sinking and Rome is falling, there's got to be this new civilization like the end of where everything starts to light up and it's been under this like dark cloud."
Kanye," So, you know, God is using me and he has a calling, you know, in my life to make the world better for all people like people say is bad people."
Interviewer, There's good people.
Kanye," No, there's there's people that are possessed that have demonic ways. But we were all children at one time, say some people know they were born bad."
Interviewer," You got to remember, like, say, oh, there's bad people."
Kanye," Even even the devil is an angel, a fallen angel, a lost angel like Los Angeles, if you let me."
Interviewer, But that's a city of angels. Let me let me let me start from the beginning.
Kanye," So you you essentially deconstruct things. So when you say in many ways, when you're describing yourself as a visionary, this is what I'm saying is that you're looking at all the systems that are in place, whether it's the record industry or the contracts that are wrong with artists, that civilization is set up, I think, visionaries to the glossy and too saucy of a title."
Interviewer," OK, whatever the engineer you are, you're deconstructing all of these things and you find flaws in the systems."
Kanye," So all these systems, whether it's the music industry system, whether it's the political system, whether it's the system of gathering food, whether even a religious system, like I remember when you started doing your Sunday service and my friend was like, what is he doing?."
Interviewer," I go, he's going to church, cool again. Like, you don't think that's a look at all these people having a great time."
Kanye, You've thousands of people that are chanting and singing along and he's not asking for anything.
Interviewer," Look, if anybody should be doing something like that, it's him to go because he's making great music. Everybody's having a good time. And what do you get out of that? The best thing that people ever get out of church is a sense of community, a time where you get together and you all agree this is where are you going to concentrate on good. You're going to concentrate on goodness. You're going to concentrate on on trying to find these shared values that are going to help the community."
Kanye," Are you doing this in this mass form? You got the superstar musician who's doing this and this mass form with thousands and thousands of people in these gigantic areas, like that's nothing but positive. So you deconstructed the idea of how how to do a religious service but make it cool. And now you're thinking about deconstructing all these different things. You're thinking about deconstructing how how food is harvested. You're thinking about deconstructing how we make energy. You're literally trying to deconstruct and and reimagine the idea of civilization."
Interviewer," Yeah, exactly. So talk me through how this starts with you. Have you were you always religious your whole life?."
Kanye," Yes, I was. And then I you know, then I hit high school now."
Interviewer," So but, you know, when you're a young man and you're you know, you're a superstar musician and you know, you live in a wild life, what what was it that led you back to this?."
Kanye," Just a feeling in your life that there was more to life, there was more to your position, there was more to, you know, this idea of a calling that you felt like you could do more and that it resonated with you more to to to produce these Sunday services and to to start thinking of of life in this. Like, you can improve things there."
Interviewer," God, knock me off my horse. God, like, literally called me and said, OK, now I need you. I need you right now."
Kanye," I need I mean, not that God needs needs me. We need God. But he called me to serve him and I was tired of serve in the music industry, start tired of serving, you know, filling up stadiums."
Interviewer," You know, the last concert and last tour I did, we had a floating stage and and actually it was a hanging stage, but it looked like it was floating."
Kanye," And that's just another thing. That's illusion, where we need to dispel the illusion. I wouldn't even call it the floating stage today. But the whole thing about is people used to say how lose money on tours?."
Interviewer," Because I put so much into the creative and I and I was like wanted to prove prove to who, you know, prove to man, prove to greedy people, you know, that I could make more than anybody."
Kanye," And that's like the gladiator position that all artists are put into, like we're in the middle of this coliseum."
Interviewer," Let me show you. I can kill. We're lions and tigers and bears and people more than than any other gladiator that happened, so that's what I'm that's what I was doing. And then I remember talking to James Turrell and I was like at the top of my lungs, like screaming about saving, saving ourselves and humanity."
Kanye," And the reason why me and James needed to connect. And then I went to my show and then it's like my like this like my head popped back in the spirit, jumped out, and I felt like it was like my mom talking."
Interviewer," And the last thing I said was, this thing is over. And I'm saying it like I sound like my mom, like Donda."
Kanye," Like that's something she would have said if she was in the physical form when she sees her son, you know, exhausted."
Interviewer," Like, I just went through a I had this fashion show."
Kanye, We had this fashion show where we took over MSG and just broke all boundaries.
Interviewer," So twenty six, 16000 seats and played the new album."
Kanye," And it was, you know, a thousand black people in the show. And yeah. Like all young thug plugging in the iPhone and Travis and Cudi dancing at 50 Cent their Jay-Z there."
Interviewer," Lamar Odom. The first time that people, you know, saw him and walk again was we walk together into the into the stadium and he's cammo Yeezy jacket or head to toe."
Kanye," And the reason why that is so important is like when he was in a coma, I would come by and play him the new music. And once he was out of the coma, he said that he remembered that music when he was in a coma."
Interviewer, And that was the album I was playing that day. So that's the reason why me and Lamar walked in together.
Kanye," And then the next few months later, I did a fashion show and it started 45 minutes late."
Interviewer," And the media, they just killed me."
Kanye," They LeBron to me, as I would say, like when LeBron went to to Miami and they said, you know, who are you to have a choice? You know, like what?."
Interviewer," One of my other heroes, Tom Brady, he he left. I didn't see no jerseys getting burned, like when LeBron left. So then less than a week after that, my wife is robbed in Paris."
Kanye," And so we we just because I'm in the middle of a tour while I'm doing the fashion show, I'm doing this. So we cancel the tour because it's very traumatic."
Interviewer," And then, you know, we start the tour back up and we get back into it. And then I just keep on saying I want to go to Japan."
Kanye," I just want to go to Japan, because Japan is like a way that people treat their isn't like this systemic racism embedded in every single individual that's inside of the place, like in America, black, white, anything."
Interviewer," There's a systemic white white supremacy, like when I tag, you know, white supremacy or we say this is like the yes, that is America. That is the world."
Kanye," Currently, we've been taught that my first superhero was Superman, you know, and my dad was a Black Panther. But, you know, when Disney makes Black Panther now, when you look it up, you don't see my dad protecting his neighborhood or snatching a mike out of somebody's hand while they're lying. I don't know, you know, like father like son right there."
Interviewer, But you see this character that's made for black people to idolize that was designed by a white white person and put out by white company.
Kanye," So it's controlling the narrative to say we're going to show you Harriet Harriet Tubman, we're not going to show you Nat Turner."
Interviewer, And they do every chance they get Maleficent.
Kanye," They called her her race, the people, the Moors and the Moors."
Interviewer," And I just saw it again. I was just like, yo, if you were race are history."
Kanye," Like most black people, we don't know where we come. We think we came from slaves. We don't know our bloodline."
Interviewer," And we're giving Black History Month. And we take that like it's some gift to us. No, it's a programming to us."
Kanye, Racism doesn't end until we get to a point where we stop having it put the word black in front of it because it's like we're we're putting the ram a little bit lower for ourselves.
Interviewer," Like it's when I say I'm the second wealthiest black man in America, like, why do I have to say that?."
Kanye," Because, you know, obviously if we just go on wealth, period, what we call wealth like financial wealth, that scorecard, you know, I'll be like I'm the."
Interviewer," On the 17th wealthiest man in America, but we shouldn't have to have a special box, a special month, because also what they show in Black Black History Month is us getting hosed down, reminding us that we were slaves."
Kanye," Like, what have we had?."
Interviewer," Remember when I cheated on you a month? Like remember when you first found the. I found the text messages, remember? How does that make you feel?."
Kanye," It makes you feel depleted and defeated. You know, it's no matter what religion you are, what we can agree on as it is always now."
Interviewer, But now is the shortest moment of our life.
Kanye," It's gone in an instant, the longest moments of our life are our memories and our imaginations."
Interviewer," Think about how long a kid imagines Christmas before, I mean, versus how long Christmas really is."
Kanye," And when you think back to your Christmas, are you under the table like Jim Carrey and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, like under a chair? Or are you a giant? Are you a king?."
Interviewer, Are you what? Black what what Black History Month has told you you are.
Kanye," And this is me speaking to, you know, black people specifically in America that. You know, I know people who would, you know, kill someone and or have a gun or, you know, in their own hood and be afraid to go downtown and literally be like afraid of white people, like the most gangster gang of gangsters wouldn't go downtown. And that's just a programming. But that program is inside of the curriculum. It's it's inside of the media."
Interviewer," And it and it goes to this whole idea of Yae when people say is Jay crazy is a narcissistic, edgy egomaniac, edgy, self-absorbed Adjaye, all these no Yae know who he is."
Kanye, I know who I am and I'm not finished.
Interviewer," I'm not fit to bow to to an idea that you want to have me. I am going to be the fool idea that God has of me. And when I do things that are that God don't like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm being the lesser version of me. This is where I, you know, in my weakness, God becomes strong."
Kanye, I have to be the higher me when when people are doubting me.
Interviewer," It's not like me fighting fire with fire and me attacking or as you say, like, you know, stooping to, uh, stooping to that level."
Kanye," It's like the devil will use you against you. You become your own, you become your own worst enemy."
Interviewer, And I just went on a riff right there. But the thing is this.
Kanye," Isn't that what you do, though? Well, yeah. Yeah. One of the things that I when anybody ever talks about you to me, they they say, well, he's all over the place. And I say, I think that he's got a different power source."
Interviewer," Like if you look at the way everybody interfaces with the world, if there's a universal power, most people have like a 20 watt charger. The way I describe you, I say I think that motherfucker's got like 150 watt charger and these ideas are just coming at them. So you do go on these rants that sometimes need to be dissected into individual things. But overall, you're an incredibly productive. So my question is. Why do why do people think there's something wrong with you?."
Kanye," This is but I would legitimately like you've been medicated. They've they've put you away, right? They've brought to you. How did that happen? Well, I'll say these two things, I think. A very three dimensionally, I don't think, in the black and white lines that I've been programmed to think in and I and I think in full color."
Interviewer," So when I talk, I have to describe a thought in five ways. You know, we enjoy food that has multiple seasoning in it. We enjoy music that has multiple instruments. So when I talk, it's not a rant. It's a symphony of ideas. And when you collect him, you say, oh, these are all these things that connect. Yeah."
Kanye," You know, I, I, I just tell the truth. And telling the truth is crazy in a world full of lies."
Interviewer," That's simply it, but none of the things you're saying are crazy, not the things you said. It's fascinating the way you think, because I can see that you're thinking in all these different layers and you're looking at things from all these different perspectives and they all come together out of your mouth and like a tornado of ideas. Now, if someone wants to just have a conversation with you back and forth, I could see whether the guy's crazy, just doesn't stop his ranting."
Kanye, But what I'm seeing is just you're a very thorough thinker.
Interviewer," You're thinking of things independently, but you're thinking of things in a massive perspective. Now, who convinced you that? That's it. Have you always been this way or were you less is it was it less manageable before? Did you have issues with it before?."
Kanye," Yeah, I believe before I found Christ and gave my life to God, I would try to lean on my own understanding."
Interviewer," And that's what the universe is. Like a black hole of information would lead by your own understanding, meaning when people, as Einstein said, you're the smartest person, what would you like to know? He and his Einstein's response was, I'd like to understand the mind of God. Meaning? Meaning God is all knowing and we can only know or see."
Kanye," And for me, as a visionary, we can only know or see what God allows us to see and what he feels."
Interviewer," We're ready to see and understand to to maximize what our Maslow's hierarchy and chart is. You know, what sets our dopamine's what sets our tone is off, what makes us feel good."
Kanye," Basically, like, you know, we did a good deed and it's like it was somehow, you know, you know, just doing a beat for a famous or just doing a beat for a local dope rapper really meant a lot to me."
Interviewer," When I was 14 years old, doing a beat for just anyone famous that had a major record deal was a lot to me at age 19, me being able to, you know, put out my own music and put my own."
Kanye," Oh, I was a lot to me at age 24, meaning as I grow, God sets new stages in the game of life for me that you get your satisfaction, like Maslow's hierarchy of need is like our satisfaction chart."
Interviewer, What makes us feel whole and accomplished as a as a as a human being.
Kanye," So as I go through these different levels, there's times where I would use confidence when I knew what I was doing and I would use arrogance when I didn't know what I was doing. But I'd rather use arrogance than to let someone diminish my idea of myself, because that is what keeps us going."
Interviewer," Hope actually keeps us alive. Anybody you ask most people is like, do you want tomorrow to come? And they say, yes, they have they have hope for it. But I went from having confidence and arrogance to having faith. And faith is the opposite of fear."
Kanye, And that created this fearless approach that I have.
Interviewer, And that's what made now has made me the fearless leader that I am that I've like crystallized into the leader that my mom always knew I would be.
Kanye," When kids follow me in preschool, the leader that people saw when we changed the Sound of Music, the leader, when we change the sneaker industry, the leader and what we're doing with with farming and with with shelters, when I was building, you know, the homeless shelters a couple of years ago and visiting parks and then going to Skid Row and understanding the the dynamics and empathizing with what actual mental health issues are."
Interviewer," Not someone, you know, telling their truth or being exhausted and then being labeled as such like I am."
Kanye," So that's what you felt happened to you, like you were absolute truth and you were exhausted and they labeled you as mentally unhealthy?."
Interviewer," Yes, absolutely."
Kanye, Am I saying this right that what happened with you is you feel like maybe or you probably feel like that having this higher calling and recognizing this higher power was the glue that kept your thoughts together.
Interviewer," They kept your mind straight and it kept you on a righteous path. So instead of being scattered with all these crazy thoughts and being exhausted and being labeled manic, right. Like we talked before and you were saying that they had you on medication, but the medication fuck with your creativity, it fucked with all kinds of things. , it blocked my ability to channel what God wanted me to do. But we're all we're all on medication right now. Did you use toothpaste with fluoride today? blocks your pineal gland and they put children on it and we put we put our kids on it. You know, it's inside. e deodorants that we use is all these things to create like a disconnect to God to serve that. 's like, are you serving man? e you serving the one and only master? But what did they tell you when when they said they were going to put you on medication? What did they put you on and what did they tell you? e of my favorite things that they did is they put me on this medication that made me gain a lot of weight. And I said, I'm not going to take this. And they said, OK, we got a medication. You can take what you don't gain weight. d this shows you they were trying to kill a superhero, slowly trying to kill genius, trying to make me not feel like I could run for president, make me not feel like I can go be born."
Kanye," And Atlanta, grow up on the south side of Chicago, go into music, go and win all these Grammys, change the sound of Music and look on stage performances, all that, and then still end up in 53 million dollars in debt."
Interviewer," What music industry has people going to the exact debt, the house that they think they're going to buy after the tour is over and it's and it's at strategizes criminals all over everyone's almost accounts in the music industry."
Kanye, It's not a safe place. It's a it's a treacherous place.
Interviewer," So with money, sometimes things are filled with money. They're filled with people that are trying to take advantage of other people, steal money. Bees come to honey. So they put they put you on this ship because you were exhausted. What did they put you on? You know, I can I can research, I'm not I'm actually forgetting the exact medication that they had, but what did it do? The main thing that it did."
Kanye," Is. It destroyed my confidence. It may be this shell of who I really am. It like grade over my eyes. It it it made me. It made the Mustang not Buck anymore. Mm. They sedated you? Yes, yeah, and they what was the the thought process behind it?."
Interviewer," We talked to a doctor about this. What did they tell you was wrong with you? They they told me I was bipolar. And I remember going on TMZ and saying, you know, slavery is a choice. And they medicated me for saying that, for having that opinion and saying it out loud, but as I put those contracts up, I'm saying this is a choice."
Kanye," As I you know, you didn't mean people being abducted and brought into slavery and put into chains was a choice. What you were talking about is people making decisions that would enslave them financially and enslave their life. Yeah, it was taken out of context and it was taken in the least charitable way. And they decided to try to say, look at crazy. Can you look at this shit? He's saying, yeah. Then they medicate you. Yes."
Interviewer, And the media is always taking anything out of context that isn't a part of the overall narrative. Yeah.
Kanye," That because there's, you know, like Hollywood and media has control so much of the narrative and then. He had Silicon Valley, and that's what's so beautiful about one of my heroes, Steve Jobs, because there wouldn't be a Silicon Valley or Silicon Valley wouldn't be what it is today if Steve Jobs didn't make information accessible like this, which is still a bit controlled."
Interviewer," But it feels like Twitter is the the safest fleet, freest mass platform to communicate on."
Kanye," And, you know, it's like they mess with Jack because of that, you know."
Interviewer," You know, well, it's still censored. There's a lot of issues now. But I think that's internal. I think that's people that are working there that are woak that want to stop people from saying certain things. And there's a lot of struggles with that today. And it's unfortunate because I do agree that it's an unbelievable way to get ideas out there. Yeah, but it's also it's a new thing and it's mismanaged by the people that use it often."
Kanye, They don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it.
Interviewer, Every version of anything that man has made will be flawed. Sure. And it has to go through a bunch of different steps of evolution. It just has to evolve and change.
Kanye," So why did you agree to let them do this to you? Why? Why did you agree to let them medicate you? Because if that is that, look, I'm crazy for sure, but if someone came to me and go, hey, we're going to put you on some medication, that medication is going to calm you down, I'll be like. Everything I do is because I'm not calm. Everything that I've ever done that's made me successful is because I have more energy, is because I have a wildness."
Interviewer, Like I'm not common that down. Like I know how to calm myself down. I can self medicate with exercise and meditation and marijuana and a bunch of different things.
Kanye, But I'm not going to I'm not going to take some medication that removes anything that's unique with you and all these wild ideas that come to your head.
Interviewer," Like very few people could string together these thoughts the way you're describing them today. If somebody asked me if there's anything wrong with him, I just fucking he's filled with awesome. Like, what's what's wrong with that? If you can keep that together, what you just did, the way you just described, reimagining civilization, reimagining church, reimagining the food supplies, there's nothing bad about that."
Kanye, This is all very interesting and very good.
Interviewer," Like I would never say that's bad, but are you this way all the time or is there good versions of Konya and versions of Cannier where you don't feel like you have a grip on these thoughts?."
Kanye," You know, what I love is there was a."
Interviewer," Some perspectives that people showed. About what a true manic episode really looks like after I was in South Carolina and this one guy was talking about his mom. Being in an episode and kidnapping his brother and, you know, like proper extreme cases, you know, I cried and was."
Kanye," Gut wrenching, like at the I don't even like to say out loud what I what I said on South Carolina, but the idea of, you know, I'm just trying to worded in a way that's really safe and covers my family."
Interviewer," People saw this clip of me crying, some people didn't know what I was crying about, but I was crying about. That there was a possible chance. I'm just I'm looking at a way to say this. I know what you're going to say, that there was a chance that. You know that we didn't make that Kim and I didn't make the family we have today. That's much that's almost like family friendly, you know, way to work that."
Kanye, And just the idea of it just tears me up inside that I was a part of a culture that promotes this kind of thing.
Interviewer, Like one of the major statistics on the subject of life is.
Kanye," That the greatest. Advocates for. The A the award is are men from ages 31 to 37, and that's how old I was and I felt like I was too busy. My dad felt like he was too busy for me. And we have a culture of that. And they have a child, rebel soldiers that were in Africa that would be doped up and psyched out and made to kill their parents were well, in our culture, we're doped up and psyched out and made to kill our children."
Interviewer," You know, we have to decouple the conversation of Planned Parenthood and woman's choice now. So, of course, I'm Christian, so I'm pro-life."
Kanye," And when I go into office, I'm not."
Interviewer," Changing laws, because I realize we live in an imperfect world, an imperfect society, what I will be presenting is a Plan A and we've already started to work on a plan to change the connotation of orphanages, to change the connotation of foster care and not just change the connotation, you know, verbally, but to create places that are to the level of like the Emon, Geary and Disney World, how to how to kid, you know, what is this like?."
Kanye," And we have so much land that this can be created and then spread across the world to orphanages in Africa and in China and just across the globe to to create these environments that when there's expecting families, moms and fathers, that they feel like there's a place, even if they don't feel well-off enough to bring another life into this world, that there's a place to go."
Interviewer," There's a plan A because. Plan B and Planned Parenthood were planned by a eugenics that set out and said out loud, I'm doing this to kill the black race and to create population control."
Kanye," You know, if we win."
Interviewer," What do you saying, plan B? I mean, the pill, meaning the the morning after pill, you know what I mean? Planned Parenthood. Let me let me let me decouple those things. Let me let me talk about Planned Parenthood, OK?."
Kanye," There's the last figure I saw was there were 210000 deaths due to covid in America and everywhere you go, you see someone with a mask on. A, they were a culture. I'll say it one time with abortion culture. One thousand black children aborted. A day daily, we are in genocide. We. So more black children have died. In the past, since February, then, people have died of covid and everyone wears a mask. So it's a matter of where we are turning a blind eye to like the media can control."
Interviewer, A lot of times it has control what we care about. I even heard somebody say at one point.
Kanye," This is the actual sentence I heard someone say Puerto Rico so played out, meaning there was a time where people were caring about it and now the media says don't care about it."
Interviewer," But these people, it still hasn't been solved."
Kanye," The hurricanes still have hit, the earthquake still hit, and people are still suffering from that. And no one has really gone to fix it. And when that 11 billion goes to Haiti and it doesn't get to the people."
Interviewer," You know, the Daily Mail posta a swimsuit pic or something and the deters our energy to what we have to do collectively to to to."
Kanye," To help our brothers and sisters, you know, I look at society as as one body, I want to just go into this because my thoughts are like these clouds and Mario Brothers. And I'll jump to this and I'll see another one. I'll jump to another and say, oh, yes, I jump to another."
Interviewer," I need to express this this story. I believe that. You know, love will heal all and we have to look at I believe I believe that world peace is possible and I believe it's us looking at each other as."
Kanye," A moment in time. Time is love, you love the things you put time into. That's why I'm at time is love like this is like this intangible thing, this thing you can't grab, you can't just grab time in your hand."
Interviewer, You can't grab love in your hand.
Kanye, But but we feel both of these things are real for us to love one another.
Interviewer, Just as simple as that. Like love will heal the world. This is what is going to take to heal the world. But we have a competitive spirit.
Kanye," We like having a bad guy. We like having a competitor. So what we need to do is change the bad guy, change the competitor, make the competitor be."
Interviewer," The Roman era, the Roman civilization, make the competitor be the Egyptian kingdom and say, we're the first society, we're the first civilization that ever became civil because we are still just as much in the dark ages as medieval times or as Game of Thrones, you know, level, black mirror level."
Kanye," I know I went past future other dimension for a second, but we kill each other."
Interviewer, We kill each other on social media.
Kanye," We kill each other in high schools, like in the way that we talk to each other. We physically kill each other in our own neighborhoods and outside of the neighborhoods."
Interviewer," You know, this planet when we when we keep turning a blind eye to."
Kanye," Our brothers and our sisters and our family, which is us as a whole, as all of humanity, then of course it's going to get to the point where there's, you know, homeless sleeping under, you know, a a bridge in Calabasas because we ignored the homeless person sleeping in front of the Gucci store."
Interviewer, How do houses just look at that visual? It's a homeless person sleeping in front of the Gucci store.
Kanye," We have builders. We have people who know how to make communities. We have people who know how to cook and how to make food and how to. How to bring this food, people are fighting over land and not really realizing that we're not we're not maximizing our resources and our existence."
Interviewer, We've got genius level scientists.
Kanye," We've got people who roeg, you know, people who have broken out of the chains like Elon, like imagine if Elon was working at GM on a third floor somewhere, you know, we wouldn't have electric cars."
Interviewer, We wouldn't have that new Porche hybrid.
Kanye," We wouldn't have what's happening with, you know, Hyperloop. Imagine if the guy that, you know, started Airbnb was shut down or the guys who started Uber were shut down."
Interviewer, All of these people who break away and then create the new society and the next frontier of where we're going.
Kanye," People like I've said, like it feels to me like MIT is a place that has to be funded by people who want to take the smartest people on the planet and make them work on the smallest things that won't change anything."
Interviewer, And I've talked to people from MIT and I could look at things like this brilliant person.
Kanye," I was talking from MIT and he was he was afraid. Everything was fear. Everything was about his his girlfriend's pregnant. And, you know, we just got a house. And I don't want to do anything to change this."
Interviewer, And this is like one of the most brilliant people on the planet.
Kanye," But if you mix brilliance with bravery that we can ignite something, even this conversation alone can ignite the people that are going to change the world because there's people who have been anointed. You can't teach the brilliance and the anointed people who hit the game of life. And they've got something that they're going to do no matter what school they go to. They know they just know how to do it. They know how to do it before they got here and they were going to do it."
Interviewer, And these people just need to see what it looks like to overcome. The smoke screens of public humiliation of bankruptcy.
Kanye," I was in debt, the fear loss I lost my mom or the fear of death, you know, what are the fears are there? There's a lot of fears."
Interviewer," But the thing is, when you remove, like even in the schools, you remove prayer, you remove God, you remove the fear God, you create the possibility of the fear of everything else."
Kanye," But watch this. If you. Instill the fear of God, you eliminate the fear of anything else. And it's not that. I am. Fearless I am. Deafly literally, definitely shaking and in so much fear of my father, I fear God and I don't fear nothing else. There's some power to that, right, just as a mental management tool, there's some real power to that because so many people are afraid of every single little aspect of life bills and debt and love and relationships."
Interviewer," And if you have a higher power and this is one of the things that I've always used to make, what's the main word that you use even for fear?."
Kanye," This is the main disease that that people use in politics is the main fear, is it? But it's a main word. Is the disease attacking the world because it destroys it changes your posture?."
Interviewer, Does it change your idea?.
Kanye," It's a worry. Yeah. Well, really. Yeah, anxiety. That's that's what it is. Stress like it can kill you."
Interviewer, You can't be free. You can't be afraid to take chances to be worried about stuff like this. Yeah.
Kanye," So to be able to anchor and eliminate worry and say this, I am walking in a righteous path and I don't have to worry about anything."
Interviewer, I don't have to worry about going to jail and worry about being killed. I'll have to worry about bankruptcy.
Kanye," I don't have to worry about, you know, humiliation, you know, because this comes this is where smart aleck prayers can get you."
Interviewer," I used to have this really smart aleck prayer. I said got. Deliver me from pain. And then he took my mom. So it's hard to hurt that much ever again. And created almost like a character like Deadpool, I'm like Deadpool, Fagone. Like, there's no noise, there's no human noise that can and, you know, if someone tried to like there was there was a friend of mine that did like a really bad move where he tried to say."
Kanye," I was using this this this lawyer, and I was about to work with him and he said the lawyer said he wouldn't work with you until you get my contract done."
Interviewer," And I was just like, how do you not know me at all? I'll be the type to cut off. If I move my hands like this, I'll cut off my own hand. I come back in the room and be like, Yo, what you're doing here? I thought we tied you up like."
Kanye," And then I go just make like a Luke Skywalker, you know? You know, and this is one thing I want to say, like and this kind of made me mad right here."
Interviewer," The first time you see me get mad in interview, they said that George Lucas's prequels are worse than the corporate made Disney Star Wars. I'll get mad at that, too. Like, that's fucking ridiculous."
Kanye," Revenge of the Sith. We saw how Darth Vader was made. Yeah, like, I watched that like ten times doing covid don't jump in again. I got the high ground. Those early movies were pure."
Interviewer," It were pure. I mean, no, no, I'm saying even the prequels are better than anything that and I'm sorry, Disney Star Wars design team. I know you're going to like, put my face up in the, you know, office and be like, forget no, man."
Kanye, This is George. This is his baby.
Interviewer," That thing was set in his heart to show us his children the hero's journey, you know, and these these like, how can we run it back and replay, like even at Disney, you know, there's there's people, you know, at Pixar that have left. People have left. You know where."
Kanye," They call, I've got the exact title, but saying, like, every time is a new idea, they call it like an unproven idea. So they'll get to Toy Story 800000 in frozen trillion before there's a new concept to take a chance on."
Interviewer," Yeah, to take a chance."
Kanye," And we've been we've been programmed, like when you see the you know, the homes, the style of homes that I've been developing, they're far closer to the way the galaxy looks, the way water looks, the way our makeup in our body feels."
Interviewer," We've been we've been put into these boxes. And that was, you know, due to money, due to construction that we have to be in these these boxes."
Kanye," And we've been stuck in a loop like on Westworld and did not feel like Tandy knew. No, w we're aware she had to use the people that enslaved her, that trapped her to make it to make it out. You know, the. And it's funny when I like the box and what I'm talking about farming. I had a point about farming that I didn't finish earlier."
Interviewer," I hired this guy to do the A to Z concept. I made it plain as day, make it so everything we cook in the kitchen at the school we planted here and they would just do it to 70 percent."
Kanye, They do it to 60 percent.
Interviewer," Earlier when I had that point, I went to this whole riff about children need to learn physics and children need to learn how to really do things and not having to separate thing like we are programmed to lock ourselves in a box."
Kanye," And what's amazing right now is. The opportunity and the platform that we have that the world is hurting for everyone, for those that are in power, for those that are inside the program, even those that are in power are still a part of the program."
Interviewer," And, you know, I read this this tweet that someone say I finish watching Netflix, what's next? And that's so true that. We can't even program enough to satisfy ourselves. The program has done Forrest Gump has stopped running and just turned around. It's like all of this thing is a setup."
Kanye," The the concerts that musicians go to where we don't you know, we're not thinking about the fact that we're not getting the lion's share of our masters because we're making the money on tour."
Interviewer, And then tour has girls and tour has the the the arena singing your song. And I need you right now. Did you do good chap.
Kanye," You know, like with Floyd Mayweather is is such a hero of mine and so excellent because he is a champion."
Interviewer, Right.
Kanye," But then also he wasn't afraid to say, I do my deals, I make my money. And what I like is, you know, he didn't let the older system tell him how to spend his money or how to show his money. It was up to him because he's the he's his own king. You know, God is the king of us all, but he's his own king. And a lot of times in America, we haven't seen we haven't seen kings."
Interviewer," We haven't seen the the the royal blood in our bone marrow. And the way it comes through now, we could show it in. And rap in the way we put our chains on the way we dress, we can show in the way we play ball and things like that, but it's another frontier to being to being a king."
Kanye," Well, there's also something where you feel diminished in the fact that, you know, that your money is being stolen by people that don't deserve it. So if you have some record executives, if you have some people that, you know, have looped you into a fucked up deal and they're making millions while you're making thousands, that fucks with your head. Yeah, it just makes you worry."
Interviewer," Makes you stress, anxiety. It eats at you. It could drive you crazy. Yeah. It could drive you crazy. Yeah."
Kanye, Yeah. So I still don't understand how they talked to you into medication.
Interviewer," Man, I wish I knew you better back then because I would have just had to exercise."
Kanye," I would, I would say what whatever he's doing you can't do like you have to understand that different people have different amounts of energy."
Interviewer," They have you have this ability to to have these, like, really all encompassing thoughts where you have these long trains of ideas and thoughts in your head and you're implementing them. This is all good. This is this is a powerful thing."
Kanye, And I don't think it's a negative thing at all.
Interviewer," I mean, some of it comes to, you know, I'm dealing with issues that are not just, you know, black and racial issues. I'm dealing with maverick, you know, innovator issues."
Kanye, Yeah.
Interviewer," I'm dealing with, you know, just as many, uh, you know, issues where there's walls of, you know, invisible walls and invisible chains."
Kanye," As you know, Michael Jackson dealt with as a black musician or urban musician where he had to go. And I'm urban. And he came with Thriller."
Interviewer," He's like, oh, let me go get this person to direct it, which is an easy way to get a movie director. And he change, you know, movies forever."
Kanye," I'm dealing with some some walls that, you know, people have done to hold back agents of change throughout history."
Interviewer," You know, it's like the movie is here, like this part, you know, us talking right now may be a scene from my life's movie, like Tesla was."
Kanye," You know, a white guy that was a ladies man and he would be going to all the fancy events and everything, and he stopped having sex at age 40 and said, you know, I'm going to focus on it."
Interviewer," And and I mean, he died. He died penniless at the end."
Kanye," You know, I'm not going to say like he turned evil, but he's trying to sell a bomb. And he had all these, like, answers. That would change the Kocherga society, and my best example is like codecs is there in a place where they can barely pull it together now, but they invented the digital camera and they didn't bring it to market because."
Interviewer, Because.
Kanye," They had all this film to sell or one of the things is really, you know, that's a challenge for me is, you know, I, I, I designed this thing, this we call it the phone runner, and we built a factory for it and code."
Interviewer," And you can make these in 25 minutes. And what I'm saying about design, I was talking to one of the just awesome designers that we just got over."
Kanye," We got like this. Amazing crew, we got guys that Nike sued us for and one of these guys, I was trying to hire him for two years, he had to we had an he had to go surf for a year."
Interviewer," And Isaan and when he, like, you know, does is as a cad drawings, it's almost like one shot, one kill."
Kanye," You know, sometimes you design stuff, you got to do it like five, eight times. Like his first one is so close to being ready to go to market because he sketches in a certain kind of way."
Interviewer," And for the longest we said, you know, let's I'm not saying I want to get rid of laces and we still have shoes."
Kanye, We sell with laces because this is a popular shoe and people love this shoe.
Interviewer," And it it hurts me. I feel like Steve Jobs trying to, like, remove buttons off the side of the next apple. And one of the things that's interesting about this, if you look at most sneakers, if you look at you guys sneakers right now, you have a tongue, you know, and it it goes this direction."
Kanye," This is one of the innovations about this is one reason why this is one of the most important sneaker designs, is this goes this way because it's ergonomic."
Interviewer, And I remember putting it on and being uncomfortable with wearing it because I'm so used to like the way like a Jordan or something fits with my jeans that I remember talking to Kobe and I'm talking about having to make sneakers that fit with jeans.
Kanye," And that was a big thing because, you know, that's what we grow up."
Interviewer," We go where, you know, cock and eye jeans and Jordans or something like that."
Kanye," So this also I feel that just the process when I design, I become like a three year old. I have to go to my gut. I have to forget everything I know and really focus in to what I feel like some straight Jedi Yoda or like, you know, if I grab that water bottle, like, I would have been cool if I just did it right now."
Interviewer," I should add a magnet on there that you like. Yeah. Oh, this is a wizard."
Kanye," So, so, so for me, you know, I, I'm going to make this to be twenty dollars and, you know, money isn't real, so that means the world should be eventually free."
Interviewer, So I'm going to manifest the world being free.
Kanye," My dad, he lives in a diary. He says, you know, anything that you put in the ground grows. So why do people still go hungry? And I like that in theory, but I was like, man, farming is really hard, though, man."
Interviewer," I think, you know, I might go hungry if I have someone to farm this food."
Kanye," It's like but, you know, back in the days we we had that skill set. Now we're losing these skill sets that actually we can sustain off of."
Interviewer," So with this and I love give me guys my riff's, I'm like a human version of Instagram."
Kanye," When you look at Instagram, you look at, you know, you're looking like a hundred images a day."
Interviewer," Well, I've got millions of images in my mind and the majority of them haven't been realized yet."
Kanye," You know, there's some images that are from my memory, but I got this whole the future that's in my mind that has to be brought."
Interviewer," So this is you know, we talk about high culture and shoes being sold on the you know, the resale market."
Kanye," And Yeezy lives in that place. But, you know, I don't like the idea. I don't love the idea that some of the reason why people buy it is just a."
Interviewer," For hyp culture or you ain't got this or I got this colorway and you don't have it, that type of mentality, I'm an I'm an Essentialists, I'm a I'm a minimalist."
Kanye," And like, I have to I will bring the the fully A to Z our existence version to existence like Victor Gruene design the shopping centers, but he designed for utopian communities and people were like, oh, we're just cool with the shopping center."
Interviewer," That's all we want. And these ideas that he had never got brought to fruition, a little bit like Disney kind of Epcot Center on like on Victor growing. But these. This next frontier of these communities and villages of happiness are way closer to a Kenyan village than it is to like a gated community village."
Kanye," But one of the things about your this aversion to hype culture, one of the good things about the high culture is if people get into your products, they're going to get into you and they're going to get into your ideas. And all these ideas that you have will become a part of their thought process. They'll start thinking about it and they go, hey, he's got some great points."
Interviewer," If people really get into your shit, they're also really going to get into your ideas. I think that's one of the things that make people uncomfortable about you because you have the courage to have all these bold ideas and to implement them and to do all these different things that bothers people."
Kanye," And there's a lot of people that don't have that kind of courage and they are straddled down by anxiety and they see a guy like you and they try to find flaws. They try to find things that are wrong with it instead of looking at the positive aspects of it. The only concentrate on the negative aspects of it, I don't think I don't see it that way. I never saw it that way. I would look at that guy if I could do anything."
Interviewer," There's people like Tesla and there's people who you know, there's a person who killed animals with test, of course, to make people not like Tesla."
Kanye, The person Edison. Yeah.
Interviewer," Person who made the electric chair be made with the test, of course, so people wouldn't like Tesla."
Kanye," Tesla still has inventions that haven't been brought to our society that would have brought more simplicity and happiness to our society, like the Westinghouse ability to transmit electricity through the air, which is fascinating."
Interviewer," I don't know if that would have worked in today's world with cell phones and all the different electronics and even, you know, modern air travel. I don't know."
Kanye," I don't know what it would have worked, but things would have been different."
Interviewer," People are over designing into industries where they see they can make some money as opposed to stepping back and saying, how do we look at the entire Earth as an opportunity to free everyone and create happiness for for everyone."
Kanye," So, like only there's only a billion people on the Internet. You never think about that, the seven or eight billion people on on Earth, but then there's only a billion people that are influence and that are on the Internet."
Interviewer," We feel like the Internet is everything is only like 15, you know, 18 percent of human beings."
Kanye," But in order to make it possible for us to survive, we have to make more human beings. We have we have family. We have we have to have food. We have to have shelter that we don't have to have the Internet. We don't have to have music. We don't have to have. You know, that's a conversation."
Interviewer," I mean I mean, it enhances life."
Kanye," Yeah, it enhances the quality of life is better. But look at the music. Look look at look at the information."
Interviewer, We're we're we're we're putting in it like I feel bad when I hear rap songs. I feel bad.
Kanye," Even the stuff that, you know, I just recently put out, I was like, you know, how you listen to labels? They The Imitation Man."
Interviewer," Like, why is that's just I don't like that message because we're all the imitation of our parents in imitation of this imitation and then imitation of Adam and Eve."
Kanye," You know, we're we're we're all the next versions."
Interviewer," It should be the V to V three, like, you know, Michelangelo and Da Vinci had the same teacher."
Kanye," You know, there's times where, you know, my like, people who work with me or say like my mentees or whatever who go out and they'll do something that I wanted to do. And then I'm I'm torn because as a man, you know, I'm I'm I'm jealous and I'm proud at the same time."
Interviewer," And it's like a father son relationship, because sometimes when when the sun goes out and is more successful at things the father wants to say, that's a good job."
Kanye," But every time the son does something, does a good job, he reminds the father of his failures. Yes."
Interviewer," So it was just I mean, it's it's a it's a it's a strong dynamic that that's where I have to lean on God to not be like, you know, this just like a prick that's jealous of, you know, people who are innovating or taking, you know, the goal line, because we got to realize we're in a relay race of humanity at a certain point, whoever."
Kanye," You know what what the inventors and the in the past, it is now handed over to the inventors. Today, they hand it over to the next inventors."
Interviewer," The good thing about the walls and the perception and all that is this like smaller barrier to entry allows there to be, you know, a Walt Disney and a Steve Jobs and a Henry Ford."
Kanye," So what I'm doing right now, there's a there's a there's a real barrier to entry to do into constructing homes and communities and farm."
Interviewer," Like, you can't you can't just do it, like how you can just, you know, it's hard for someone to go from."
Kanye," I'm not saying it can't happen. I'm just saying that is difficult for someone to go from, you know, programming and putting their music on the Internet today to what it was that Michael Jackson had to do."
Interviewer, That very entry was so hard for him.
Kanye," I mean, since this guy was the leader of the Jackson five when he was five, like his entire life led up."
Interviewer, And this is what he focused on. And it made and it was all focus on that. So it made the great Michael Jackson.
Kanye," Now, I want to do this comparison to Disney, Steve and Henry Ford and what is."
Interviewer," It's really hard to make houses, it's it's like a corrupt industry also. You got control. How many times have you started in a house and are contractors like start overcharging for stuff?."
Kanye, And the budget ends up being twice the amount and it's twice as long.
Interviewer," Look, if you had a relationship, this is why relationships are better currency than than the money."
Kanye," If you had a relationship with the contractors, if you were part of their family, your house would be done quick."
Interviewer, I feel like it's a practical joke on rich people. How long houses take to Bill? I was in the airport and there was a first class line that was super slow and there was a coach area with like eight openings and there was no one in it. And then I hopped out and as other gentleman hopped out with me and went to that line and we went through.
Kanye," But the rich people with the Irma's belts didn't want to lose their position so bad that they would rather wait in the first class line than to have the time back and go to that. Now, this gentleman is a surgeon that works on people's hearts, do their feet."
Interviewer," So it's like that kind of engineer's surgeon doctor mentality is like, yeah, I got money because this this is what I'm doing. But I'm here to serve. And I have a mentality that I'm not better than the person that's in coach, which is the reason why we were the only two that went through that. How do you segway off of this one? I just go into this."
Kanye, I even find a question.
Interviewer," What do you think it over there? Oh, no, there's no love in this. Yeah, there's no reason to worry about it."
Kanye, Yeah. You have this.
Interviewer," Do you have a rigid process that you organize your day with? Like, how do you you seem to have so many different thoughts and so many different things going on simultaneously."
Kanye," Like how do you how do you organize your day? Do you have, like, ritual, do you have. Yeah, I drive my children to school, I drive my kids to school and I stay at school with them all day."
Interviewer," And, you know, I'm in the kitchen, like working with the top chefs on the planet to create this, you know, these healthy menus."
Kanye, And I'm working with the farmers.
Interviewer," So the school that I'm at is also it's like this new. I don't want no disrespect, and as I was going to say, new NASA, but of humanity, that we're anchoring it around our children. So that's what my day consists of."
Kanye," But then I also, in the past couple months, have been going to Atlanta for two days a week or three days a week because I'm building this 120000."
Interviewer," Oh, I'm not supposed to say that."
Kanye, I'm building we're building a soundstage.
Interviewer," But and but it was funny because I go back and forth on content. Should I work in content? Should I work in tech? I have all these like website ideas and tech ideas. And sometimes I was like, I'll say I'm curse by tech."
Kanye," Like, I'm not you know, I don't have any curses or God has led to me break the curse and break the chains."
Interviewer," I'd rather say I, I don't know if content is my calling, like messaging."
Kanye," Like let me show you what a school of the future looks like. Let me show you monastery's of the future. Let me show farms the future looks like. But we're 20 years past the future, like it's in 2020, like we're supposed to be in the future by 2000."
Interviewer, So it's my job to pull the future into now.
Kanye," And that's something I struggle with when I talk about the different things that I'm doing, getting into the idea of doing like content for Netflix or content for Hulu and like what that content, because I believe we're in the movie."
Interviewer, I believe we're in the game. We're in like Grand Theft Auto was just too many things that align. And we're not we can terraform.
Kanye," What we can do is be like if you're Grand Theft Auto character just started redesigning the world, his self, like painting his own, his own world."
Interviewer, We have this opportunity to make life as fun as the second life.
Kanye," But if you look at how politics, just general unhappiness, misery, control the speed that contractors go, the farmers that wouldn't finish the farm the way we are with each other is why people feel like, look, everyone's going to go into like this ready player one second life."
Interviewer, And I believe that our first life can be just as imaginative and it will be.
Kanye, So that's my and I have a bunch of friends that work in the gaming industry and I have friends that work in the content industry.
Interviewer," And I'm saying I'm anchoring on real life to make real life as awesome as games, to make real life, as awesome as movies."
Kanye, So did I answer the question of my schedule every day?.
Interviewer," Yeah, but I mean, you so you just basically go on what you feel like working on. You basically just start your day, you do your stuff with your kids and then whatever these ideas you have, you just nourish them. You just encourage them. You just you just feed whatever thoughts are in your head."
Kanye," Well, yeah, but what I was expressing on that on that last symphony I gave you was this was."
Interviewer," That I do have this challenge, that's where I'm designing I'm I'm actually designing what I'm doing with my time saying. Should I be even taking a meeting like when I take a meeting? I know if is a good or bad meeting, if someone's talking to me and I just get sleepy, I know that that's not what I should do."
Kanye," But if someone's talking, you know, energize."
Interviewer," I like saying the word energize over the word excited because this is what they do to this is what they do to all of us to get us excited, excited and anxiety, kind of go together like someone to say, hey, I got you a new car and it's across the street and you get so excited, you run across the street, get hit by a car, trying to run to your new."
Kanye," But if you're energized about having the car, perhaps you look both ways."
Interviewer," I play this dictionary game with the like this this small Webster pocket dictionary, and we'll go to a page and say, go to page with the word help on it. And we say highlight all the words you think are positive. And then we talk about afterwards, why do you think that's positive?."
Kanye, So the word help is like it's like it's like a bad leg on a table.
Interviewer," You think you could stand on it, but if you stand right there, that table could flip over."
Kanye," The fourth definition in the word help is to ignore. And it actually makes sense, you know, all like if you have a meeting."
Interviewer," Right. Here's the answer. When, you know, the meeting didn't do good, didn't go well, the person says it, then, oh, how can I help?."
Kanye, That means they don't want to do nothing. They're just give you a phone number.
Interviewer," Right. You know, the word is to ensure and then there's a lot of words."
Kanye, And would you agree that a very powerful future. Sure.
Interviewer," Pure endure and that goes into like the right, because I'm literally trying to figure out the video game at all times and see where these things parallel."
Kanye," I know this can get into like a riff for people like, OK, yeah, you're losing what you're saying right now."
Interviewer, But but look at that. Look at the dictionary. Look at these words. I have friends that English is their second or third or eighth language.
Kanye, And they say that English is the hardest language to learn because there's so many words to that mean the same thing.
Interviewer, It like it tears me to my core that my daughter has to learn to swallow the difference between NATO and Teoh.
Kanye, I want to just be like just draw the number two. I just make it like I sometimes I don't know when you know the difference. I'm like a terrible speller. And I believe that there's like curriculums that are that are European curriculums that don't even apply to our genes.
Interviewer," You know, who we are as a people like African descent people. We don't even talk like that. Like this is a skill set."
Kanye," But I'm still talking white, basically, like you'll see like a black pastor, you know, give this amazing, like, sermon or like Mary, someone I was at a wedding. And this guy, they said, wow, he speaks so well."
Interviewer," What do you mean? Well, he speaks super white, like went."
Kanye," Yeah, that's what the definition of. Well, right. Right. It just sounds that you use and to communicate ideas. Right. Well, that's funny."
Interviewer, I bumped into a friend of mine. I actually Matt Williams is that juvenilia. I wasn't expecting to see.
Kanye," I wasn't expecting I mean, expecting to see him."
Interviewer," I wasn't expecting to see him. And we're at the Mercer lobby. And he caught me off guard and I was like. I didn't use words when when I when I when I saw them, I like almost communicated in a different language, like a language, like joy or happiness."
Kanye, Only 30 percent of our communication is is verbal.
Interviewer," That's why the mask just really throw me off, because I can't tell what someone is thinking and feeling, because a lot of times people don't say what they're thinking or feeling."
Kanye, Right. And I have to decode it with the mask.
Interviewer," I can only, you know, hear what they're saying. That's the problem with social media, too, right?."
Kanye," Yes. Things are black and white and things being taken out of context. I mean, that's a reason why people like, you know, love the show, that they're like, oh, we got the yay Joe Rogan."
Interviewer, We can hear him going to all of these riffs. Yeah. And we can feel him.
Kanye," You could see, you know, how I'm looking. You can see my energy and the way I'm saying it to so and and you see people sitting down having an actual conversation."
Interviewer, A real conversation. Yeah.
Kanye," And a conversation where anybody that comes on this show, you don't have like this like sometimes with reporters they have like people, they're media. They have like a complex. You don't have a complex."
Interviewer," You'd like your let's first off to get this straight, like if I like, I could whip your ass. I'm Joe Rogan."
Kanye," I'm a professional fighter. Now, let's start the conversation, which I think is another reason. Like what? Nick Cannon. He's like, man, I married Mariah Carey. I did all these."
Interviewer," And both of these interviews have been very positive because people aren't carrying something already, like some form a chip on their shoulder where they got to like every sentence."
Kanye, Sometimes I talk to reporters.
Interviewer, It's like they're saying the thing they wanted to say to this guy in high school that they never got to complete the conversation and they're taking it out on me.
Kanye," I'm like, yeah, I think there's a lot of people that have conversations with people and they want to create a viral moment, too, that it's not just a conversation. They have an agenda. It's it's almost like you were talking about the Disney Star Wars movies, that then it's not a work of art. It's it's a formula like two plus two is four. Let's put those together. We'll make some money instead of the original Star Wars, which was the hero's journey, which was like a Joseph Campbell book."
Interviewer," It's like there was a beauty and a purity to it. It's a it's an expression like someone comes up with an idea and they bring it to fruition and then you get to watch and you're like, wow, it moves you. The new movies don't move you."
Kanye," And it was a crew of of of leaders of thought leaders that like I was as a Brian De Palma that told George to put the words at the beginning, because it's like you really I've been feeling like it's like when I talk up to this point I just been making, you know, and then the toys from Star Wars have now come out first, which would be like, you know, like the Jeezy's or something like that."
Interviewer, And now it's making the whole Star Wars in real life like backwards.
Kanye," Like the product came first, kind of like Disney, like Disney."
Interviewer, He was Mickey Mouse became super popular before he was able to get all of his Imagineer Imagineer is in.
Kanye," I want to point out, you know, when people talk about being, you know, self-absorbed or the center of your own universe, what's the main character in Star Wars name?."
Interviewer," Luke Skywalker, who created Star Wars, George Lucas. But did he write it, but listen to that last name. Yeah, that's yeah. George Luke. Yes. Yeah."
Kanye, He's the main character in Star Wars. He gets disaster.
Interviewer, And it was awesome.
Kanye, Yeah. There's there's something about things that are pure. Right.
Interviewer," Versus things that are attempting to recreate something that people are going to like. There's a difference. And it's in music as well. Right. Like your music resonates with people because it's obviously coming from your mind, whereas some people are creating songs that they think are going to be hits."
Kanye, They're creating top 40. It's coming from my heart and my gut.
Interviewer," But when it's the most pure, it's coming from God."
Kanye, And I'm being used as a channel.
Interviewer," It's like when Tonya Harding hit the triple flip, you know, she had all that skill."
Kanye," And then at some point it's that Calatrava's, because I'm about to say triple triple Lindy, like is Rodney Rodney Dangerfield."
Interviewer, But it's like there's these moments where we do things that are seem like superhero level. And I think that's what M. Night Chalamont was laying out for us with unbreakable glass.
Kanye," And what was the other one with the guy with the multiple personalities, just like he's got three of these films that are like showing us, hey, you're superheroes, you can believe it."
Interviewer," The greatest disabler of our of our abilities, our greatest our greatest kryptonite is dout. Right? You know, fear. Yeah, doubt."
Kanye," Like, why did I, you know."
Interviewer," Like going to why did I register so late to run for president covid like I remember like I had I had the virus and I was sitting, you know, quarantined in my house and my cousin text me about being prepared to run for president."
Kanye," And I just completely, like, put it off to the side because I was, like, shivering and, you know, having the shakes, taking hot showers and eating soup and, you know, just like have it."
Interviewer," I don't think it was that bad. I think it was a mild case and it just threw off I mean, threw everyone off."
Kanye," It threw everybody's plans off. And then, you know, it was just a calling on my heart."
Interviewer," And I remember talking to, like, really like elitist, you know, writers."
Kanye," You know, I was trying to avoid saying a white supremacist, but like elite, like the liberal elites are like."
Interviewer," You know, so, boy, who are you going to vote, you know, like who are you to run for office and why would you sign up for office?."
Kanye," You know, if you if you can't even get on ballots that people are saying that to me and I could get on the ballot. It's like there's black mothers that go into to hospital and the doctor will tell them that there's something wrong with their child to get them to. This is happening to this date. And then when people say, you know, are you a are you a pawn like for the Republicans? The reason why I think that people are asking me that is because because the Democrats do create black pawns, they do have celebrities that they'll sit down and meet with and say, you're going to be an advocate for the Democratic Party."
Interviewer," And, you know, everyone's like, you know, and I'm not trying to take any sides of like Republicans or Democrats."
Kanye," I'm just saying, why were why were people so much thinking that I was like a form of a pawn?."
Interviewer," And then the idea that, you know, liberals who say, like, the funny thing is liberals, I think and I'm I don't know if I could classify myself as liberal, but I'm definitely kind of liberal elite."
Kanye," I wrote my beautiful, dark, Twisted Fantasy like I've had some of the best writing."
Interviewer," So that would put me in that class, so to say."
Kanye," But I'm also just a purist, like I see a Kenyan home and be like, that's beautiful right there. I'm not like I got to have the."
Interviewer," So the one of the most racist things that liberals who pride themselves on not being racist have said to me is like you're going to split the black vote. And that makes it seem like. Black people can't make decisions for ourselves and that don't know white people know me like I'm only like only deliberately, literally make it seem like only black people will vote for me. Right. Think about that statement, the the nuance of institutionalized racism. And this would be like somebody from the art world, you know?."
Kanye," I mean, they just have a place where no one has really been able to embrace the idea of blacks not being in a block and staying in one place for blacks out to vote Democrat."
Interviewer," Yeah, blacks have an opinion like us not being on boards or us being like handlers for other black people."
Kanye," Meaning like if we work at a label, we work at a big corporation, it's our job to go talk to the other black people, you know, to calm other black people down."
Interviewer," But we're working for, you know, Universal or Vivendi or whatever the organization is where, you know, I was thinking about buying my masters and I realized that that was too small of a thought."
Kanye," I'm going to buy Universal. Are only a three billion dollar organization, I'm one of the greatest product producers that ever existed. I'm and I'm a child."
Interviewer, I'm 43 years old.
Kanye," I was 53 million dollars in debt, you know, four years ago. And now it's proven that I'm the new Michael Jordan of products. I went to Adidas and we were 15 billion dollar organization, losing two billion before covid hit our market cap of 68 billion. I went to the Gap and our partner with the Gap and our stock jumped 45 percent in two hours. The organization made two billion dollars and two out in two hours. And now we've double."
Interviewer," I mean, the gap was Markopoulos lower than it was like three billion dollars. When when when I first got there. Now it's like seven, eight billion dollars. And we haven't even released a product yet. But what I loved, I you know, I sat there and I did the deal without getting on the board."
Kanye," And I looked at my cousin and I and I didn't want to sign the deal without being on the board. And I looked down and said, I'm doing this for you. Meaning like, this is part of a relay race. It would just be a given that if someone of color was to your position, my position of influence will be on the board. But Michael Jordan had to break down walls and Michael Jackson had to break down walls for us to break down the next walls."
Interviewer," And the next walls are the boardroom, because you know what the boardroom is. It's an opinion. See, people are fine for us to play basketball and, you know, rap and make clothes, but."
Kanye," Society as a setup is not really used to are fine with us actually having an opinion and I can understand why, because what is our opinion based on if we grew up thinking we were slaves or if our opinion isn't based on, hey, my dad taught me how to run this company, you know, my dad is smarter than me and everything he wanted to do, black people thought he was crazy and he had to do it with white people who thought he was incompetent because he was black."
Interviewer," And the way these companies and the way the music industry, the way managers and the way society generally looks at black people is the way like a misogynistic man looks at a hot lady. Hmm. What can you give me? What can you do for me? No one misogynistic man. I can look at a hot lady and say. Can you run my company? So, you know, this idea of me, you know, and I got like, you know, I'm building my factories, I've simplified the design and I was working with a guy that, you know, that's helping me to, you know, build some of the factories. was an older white gentleman and he just matter of factly says, we're sitting at his house in Malibu. 's a nice day. As a matter of fact, he says Adidas will never put you on the board. d I'm like this this wall has to come down like, how could you not have the guy that has the best idea? one of the great things with Universal, one of the approaches that we have is, you know, universal. en Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre sold Beats by Dre Universal had a chance to buy in to do different things. They sold it for three billion dollars."
Kanye," That was half of the value of Universal at the time of six billion due to the Internet, which the music industry was afraid of in 2000. Universal."
Interviewer," Now, I think is worth thirty three, thirty five billion dollars, and now they have another Steve Jobs, you know, Howard Hughes, Henry Ford, Disney, Elon kind of character within their midst."
Kanye, But they're so concerned about the control of the idea of artists because they're using me as like this artist that has attracted other artists.
Interviewer," Also, I use them."
Kanye," I got famous, I made some money. I got to tour, you know, I became this superstar. So we use each other. Now, is it just an adjustment that needs to be made in the relationship?."
Interviewer," And I can make and I will make products that. Will make more money than Universal is worth, but it's not about the money, as I said earlier, it's about the fact that even though my net worth is five billion dollars and I'm one of the most famous, most influential God-Fearing Christians on the planet, the."
Kanye," I still have to go to this man or this organization and ask him for something, and that is what it's about, you can have a company right, when you go into your company, don't think because you got the most ownership that you actually have the control."
Interviewer," If you don't have the information and the knowledge of how the distribution works and you're not having that conversation, you don't have the control. So what I did in my organization with Universal, with Gap and with Adidas, I told my lawyers, my managers everything."
Kanye, No one could communicate with these organizations except for me.
Interviewer," You can give me advice, but they got to talk to the boss, which is me."
Kanye," And right there, you start to get the information flow, I guess."
Interviewer, Who's my CFO?.
Kanye," Who, me? So that means I do have the time I do this 10 to 15 transactions, what I do is I pay because I had open credit cards, I had checks, you know, I had people flying in and out. I had a consultant agreements like people who weren't on the salary, but they were consultors."
Interviewer," I had, you know, people paying for flights, hotels, cars, food, Netflix, like everything, just running the account."
Kanye," Just even right now, I cancel all my credit cards except for one credit card."
Interviewer," This is like the Oprah Winfrey moment where she's like, man, when I started spending cash, I was like, I really realize, you know, how much I was spending."
Kanye," And I've signed all my own checks. And I think that happens in the music industry is just a lot of industries that people tell you that someone needs to do something for you. And it's like, look this, Siiri, do everything you know you can do. It's possible."
Interviewer," And it's just when you ask me, how do I delegate my time, it's important for me to delegate my time. If I made 210 million dollars last year."
Kanye," Yeah, I have a lot of maverick ideas. I'm working on cities and homeless shelters and farms and I'm reinventing myself."
Interviewer," So a lot of mavericks will, you know, spend their money on their ideas and they'll invest in what they see the future is. And I ended up with a net worth of ten million."
Kanye," I remember, you know, a few a month ago, people were like, you can't show your taxes because people won't understand that you're a billionaire if they see that you only needed ten million last year."
Interviewer," And after the Gap deal happened, my net worth went from three point three billion to five billion. And I've been asking the people around me to run the story and they were going to run it with Bloomberg. They never ran it. I was not afraid of people looking at me like I was not a billionaire."
Kanye," And I said, be honest, show my taxes, show everything."
Interviewer," And then the reports came back, oh, you're worth five billion."
Kanye," It came from me just being honest when I want to say something about the Gap deal also and specifically the name The Gap in my my journey with that, like at age six, I worked at The Gap."
Interviewer," I always saw the gap as like being the apple of apparel, always had this comparison with Seijas."
Kanye, I always felt like I was the Steve Jobs of the Gap.
Interviewer," If somehow how clean it was and what Mickey Drexler done all these commercials and like, you know, at age 16, I was working at The Gap and I got fired for stealing and I was actually still in khakis."
Kanye, I was still in khakis from my friend. Funny thing.
Interviewer," Look, I stole khakis from my friend when I started doing music at age 98."
Kanye," I went and bought a chain. I came home one day, didn't see what the chain was, come to find out my friend was smoking crack and it stole my chain. So the guy I was stealing for enough stealing from me."
Interviewer," But his khakis, I was still in some gap khakis. I wanted those khakis that bad. So then 27 years later, you know, I give my life to God and I start doing Sunday service."
Kanye, One of the things that I had to do for Sunday service I got to do that was fun for me to do was to design the wardrobe for Sunday service and we would redesign t shirts. And it says in the Bible that Jesus wore seamless garment.
Interviewer, So we started building T-shirts with a seam was only here are only two seams on the shirt or moving it around and what the neck was. And I made t shirt after t shirt after t shirt and cristiana we say we stand in the gap.
Kanye," So watch this. This opportunity is presented, and I always had clothes that were kind of chill like they could be at the Gap, they were not overly fashionable."
Interviewer," And God said, you you you stood in the gap. And I'm how you stand in a gap for real, and I'm going to give you favor and increase, and I know some person, I know somebody with all that design and Tshirts who come in handy, I literally was designing T-shirts for Sunday service, like David working out in the field, tending to the field. You know, when Goliath came, they wanted one of his brothers in the Warriors to to go up against Goliath and his father chose David and David."
Kanye, I don't need all this armor. I just need these three smooth stones.
Interviewer," I just need you know, this is how I got to see. They didn't know David had had to fight a lion and had to fight a bear. So God, by him tending to the feel and humility and in service to God and honor to his family, he was able to have the skill set to take down Goliath. We hit the street. You know, it's a term that I had to learn Wall Street. We hit the street like you never, ever saw it before."
Kanye," I used to be in San Fran, ask people to invest in me. Nobody would invest in me when I went to a wedding in San Fran with all these billionaires and investors, angel investors, you should have seen people's faces. They were like, you jump from the three point line. You ran a stock by 45 percent. You see, think about this."
Interviewer," You're going to split the black vote. You can't vote for the you you're only a rapper. You want to. It's like all these things that diminish me. Yeah. And now it's like Deadpool, like I came back is like a superhero. And I won't let that be the kryptonite. I won't let my own ego be my kryptonite. I won't let other people's opinions be my kryptonite. I won't let these labels that people put on me be my kryptonite."
Kanye," And a lot of times I don't like to watch these interviews back until about, you know, three, four or five years later, because I'm always, you know, I'm visiting the now I'm existing in the future and visiting the now when I'm speaking to you."
Interviewer, And they make a lot more sense in the future because I can tell you. But he can show you guys a lot of stuff.
Kanye," I'm telling you, some people are following me. Some people are believing in it, and some people are just doubting it because they want to put this label on."
Interviewer, He's crazy or it's just a black guy saying it or it's just a rapper. It's just a it's just an entertainer. It's just whatever it is. So I can say the most wild ideas. I last like Veronica Cornerstone wanting to be an anchorperson.
Kanye," And I remember she says, Iran, I told you I wanted to be. He said, yes, I heard you. I wrote it down. Veronica Corticosterone had a very funny joke tonight. And every time I talk, it's like Veronica Cornerstone having a very funny joke tonight."
Interviewer," Like when I said I was going to run for president, that was like, OK, go ahead. Would you like to interject? Do you have thoughts and ideas also that you'd like to have be a part of your interview? Well, you went from what you want from people mad at you."
Kanye, They're splitting the black vote all the way to the gap and all the way to Veronica.
Interviewer," I mean, but I then I brought it back. Yes, you did."
Kanye, To the vote to run for president back from to people doubting you and people putting limitations on you people to tune in on this podcast to go on the journey with us.
Interviewer," Yeah. Doesn't do or they don't. It's up to them. But do you know, the beautiful thing is you're not listening to these people, these people that are trying to put these labels on you and tell you what to do and you're not saddled down by fear, you're not saddled down by doubt. You're willing to take these chances. If you did become president, what would you do that was different? I mean, pretty much everything I was just looking at the suits last night, I was like, yo, what would you redesign?."
Kanye," I don't wear white anymore. They had a white shirt. You know, they had a like a. I just, um, I would I would redesign this, I will, and it's I would it's not as if it's not as if it's just win. Right."
Interviewer," We've got to start with a budget, I feel like, you know, the fact that I went from being in debt. To to begin, I don't even like the way he sounds about it, because we think about Steve Jobs, his money is like the least of what's awesome about him."
Kanye," And the money is just a tool. Like it's like nails, like I got the most now feel like it's scored on the scoreboard, though."
Interviewer," It proves it proves not just value, but it proves effectiveness."
Kanye," Yeah. And it's like you're crazy to you're right. So it proves in some way that a lot of the things I said, they were crazy. I was actually right about. Yeah."
Interviewer," Looking at that budget. And I think that that's part of God's like training, like Mr. Miyagi. Paint the fence, you know, Karate Kid Danielsson. I own that."
Kanye, I gave like the full description of the of the analogy just in case people didn't.
Interviewer," What do you think you would do, though, if they come to you with talks about foreign policy?."
Kanye," People love talking about foreign policy. That's the number one question. But when I talk about the budget, you know, this paint the fence, the fact that I had to. You know that I have to understand. Three hundred dollars million of cash a year that you don't get trained for that. That's like astronaut training that I have to understand how to have multiple industries that I have to understand how to build and house and provide. You know, I provide people with health care."
Interviewer," And I could have I had this idea of doing a zero employee org where I put everything on my partners on Universal, on the Gap, on Adidas."
Kanye, But I believe this is amazing training for me as a black person.
Interviewer," There's people who who have been raised to respect a penny, but as a black person, I've been raised to look down at a penny."
Kanye, But the people who really hold their money respect every penny. They respect the money.
Interviewer," And it's interesting, I had an argument with one of my managers because I made my own travel ban and my organization because, you know, I did when I did a Sunday service a month and a half ago, I was 25 flights coming in of people I didn't know because there's criminals in my organization trying to kill Bob Marley, not to JFK or MLK me, but deplete my resources."
Kanye," So I created the shovel to explain that what do you mean by that, what I mean by what criminals in your organization like, what do you mean?."
Interviewer," Meaning there's people that, OK, I fired this one CFO. About three months ago and up to a week ago, he still had an open credit card because I want to dig lower and lower and go to it."
Kanye," It's like always like, is this the new person that's in charge?."
Interviewer," Your money is like, no, I'm the new person that's in charge of your money. That's in charge of my money, rather. So."
Kanye, So that's why you became your CFO? That's why I became and it's it's the best and it's it clears my thoughts and it really helps me with design.
Interviewer," It helps me as I'm designing designing what I'm doing at the job, helps me when I'm how I'm designing the curriculum."
Kanye," It helps me and the way I'm designing the kitchen, the way I'm delegating, the way I'm working, the way I am and being a better leader, being a better being a better listener. But there was some question you had. I had I was answered and I gave it all before you went to foreign policies. I went to the the budget where I said, it's like Danielsson painting the fence."
Interviewer," The fact that I've had to really look at and understand that kind of money and this God given anointing, being a producer, being a head of industry, to be a God fearing and God and a servant of God and a producer and had an industry at the same time is literally like the perfect combination for a president."
Kanye," And to be honest, I'm Laeter."
Interviewer, Like every now and then America has to get America deserves the world deserves a leader that they can 100 percent trust that.
Kanye," Whatever I'm saying to you with the information that I have in front of me, I 100 percent believe that, like when I talk to the when I was with the president of Haiti and he gave us an island, me and Shervon Pushover, that was early angel investor at Uber and is working on the Virgin Hyperloop right now, really great friend of mine."
Interviewer, He saved me. He had me avoid deals where I was going to give up a percentage of my company for a third of the value and different things like that.
Kanye," So we go to Haiti and the president gives us this island to develop, to make a city of the future."
Interviewer," And also we're going to have the farmers and the people who live there take a percentage, I mean, take ownership of the land that they have right now."
Kanye," So when it raises in value, they all eat off of what the ideas. But he said that. The way that he has done business with our president is so straightforward, I believe that I know that me as president would be the best thing that ever happened for America's foreign policy."
Interviewer," I've traveled more than any president already, and I bring people together. I put rivals on songs together to create masterpieces."
Kanye," I go in, I empathize when I meet with leaders in Africa, when I meet with leaders in, um, I don't really have a good next thing."
Interviewer, I want it to sound good.
Kanye, And I named my leaders and I wanted to set fire bit that. But when it's the honesty.
Interviewer," So when I, when I meet with and when I meet with leaders, I'm not trying to go in there and see how they can use my Internet. I'm not trying to go in there and buy up their land and develop it and buy it up for cheap."
Kanye," You know, we're going to share information."
Interviewer," You know, we're you know, we have an idea. We just have a dual citizenship for Americans with African descent that."
Kanye," The ability to create environments in communities completely can change the way people act, you know, if people are hungry, they're going to act a certain way and people have food, they're going to act a certain way."
Interviewer," And people are away from their friends and family. They're going to act a certain way. They're going to need to go to college town. They need to stop by this, you know, frat party and, you know, drink and do that. But when they're, you know, but you got to go here."
Kanye," So then you could go there. And like, society is all about dismantling the family. I see things being more like a kibbutz or, you know, where the family can be as close and where the grandparents can be next to the children."
Interviewer," And you know, these ideas I have about how communities should be our world wide, simplified ideas and that they're not based on industry, even though I understand industry, they're based on serving God and serving families."
Kanye," And that's something that everyone across the globe, no matter what. Country in the world, whatever continent in the world, all of the moms and dads have something in common, they want the world to be better for their children. We all want the world to be better for the children, and we can show ways that we are not at odds."
Interviewer," Think about the world as a giant piano, but we're playing off key. So for a producer to synthesize those ideas and not say, OK, we're going to shut."
Kanye," I spent time in China, I spent a year in China when I was in fifth grade, I used to speak Chinese like Nehama Shishani, like, I don't know a lot of yeah."
Interviewer," My mom was an English professor and I had an exchange program where a Chinese student could come to America and she could go to which was there was like Chinese at that time, couldn't come to America as as easily so. You know, there's America's greatest export is influence and culture, China actually has like imitation Paris imitation."
Kanye, They probably an imitation calabashes at this.
Interviewer, They probably do at this point.
Kanye," You know, the artists define culture. That's what makes these artists that made the design. The Statue of Liberty is the artists that designed the Eiffel Tower. This is the reason why I donated one hundred million dollars to James Tyrrell's Roden crater project when I went to this is like the eighth wonder of the world."
Interviewer," But I saw spaces that we can exist in that would be helpful for our health, our well-being."
Kanye," These are healthier places for us to be. We need to be like almost like Terralliance, like our our life is like a Shakespeareans."
Interviewer, Like Shakespeare has written 30 percent of our language that we use.
Kanye," Like I say, like he must have been a really nice person, like de Vinci used to walk away from people when he would talk to people."
Interviewer," And that's but that's the reason why The Da Vinci Code and at The Da Vinci Life, because he never was able to get it across to the to the to the level to affect us for generations to come."
Kanye," These people love art, but they want to put art in the box."
Interviewer," We need to surround ourselves with the artist because the artists are the the most connected, the most truthful, and their dinosaur never got killed."
Kanye, Somehow the people who have figured out how to make a real a living off of art is what do you mean by the dinosaur?.
Interviewer," Never killed meaning? Art class will be considered to be fun like every kid loves to draw. Yeah, right. But some people got to grow up and like the artists, right. And so we don't have to. Yes. Like this. We're all children. We're all if you're if you're alive, you're a child. We're all children in God's eyes."
Kanye," And we're all young people like Jesus is old, like he's only, you know, like Adam is old."
Interviewer," You know, if you're alive, you're you're young and we're like children."
Kanye," And there's all these things, these sharp edges, these corners, these anxieties, these fears, these things put in our our food, our diet, our diet of what we consume right here that turn us old and make us breteau and make us put that fear on our kids."
Interviewer," Don't you put that evil on me, Ricky."
Kanye," Bobby, I put that they put that. We put these evils on our children, put racism on our children."
Interviewer, We put fear on our children. And the children are fearless to children. It's funny. It's like Claudio Sylvester in one of our lead architects I work with since age 24.
Kanye, He built this home in America with with John Paulson. And he has like this golf course where it's the acoustics are incredible.
Interviewer," But it's this part where you can walk along that's 20 feet high. And I said, you know, would you you know, what about the kids?."
Kanye," You know, you have a balcony, you have a Bannisters. And he looked at me, said, they're smarter than we think."
Interviewer," Wow, and meaning, like, if we were never taught the missing Bannister theory that we could all tightrope walk among the missing Bannister theory, I wrote it in my book."
Kanye, Thank you. And you're welcome. I wrote my friend Sakia that's actually here right now.
Interviewer," That's that you're talking to earlier is look, you could walk down a straight line without worrying about anything, but you take that as a straight line and put a 20 story high, 20 stories high. You know, I'm going with it. Yeah."
Kanye," And you move the balconies, you're going to be so concerned about the idea of falling that it will make you fall. Yep. And that's where the superpower is in removing the fear. Yes."
Interviewer," That's a beautiful thing to say right there. And it's also probably the first sound bite thing that I've said, the entire thing. All right. Let me talk to you about so we're serious here."
Kanye," So let's talk about like real presidential issues. Let's talk about here's here's some things that just when we talk about this country, here's some things that are that mean a lot to me. One student debt. I think it's crazy. I think it's crazy that we take children when they're 17, 18 years old. We sent them away to college. We make them literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. And then we ask them to go out into the world and try to manage this money and try to get a job that's going to pay them a fraction of what they owe for their education."
Interviewer," I think it's crazy. I think we should figure out a way to absolve student debt. I think we should figure out a way to make education, at the very least, far less expensive than it is now. This is this is a big issue for people."
Kanye," I'm I'm completely confident that I will figure out how to get America out of debt, that I have the ability once I see everything, I never make the wrong decision."
Interviewer," When I'm given all the information, that's my that's my skill set, anything I go into producing rap, homes, clothing, anything, once I'm given the right information, I apply my tastes and I have the best taste on the planet."
Kanye," I mean, Quincy Jones is a couple of people that's like, OK, Quincy Jones might be better than me, but if Quincy could you imagine Quincy Jones as a president?."
Interviewer," I could, yeah. Walt Disney, Steve Jobs. Like maybe maybe some of these personalities are a little volatile."
Kanye," Yeah, yeah. But that's how he gets things done. Yeah. Like for America to be as. Warming and inviting as as as Disneyworld, there used to be, you know, this dream of, you know, people still have this dream of coming to them."
Interviewer," They're coming to America like it's the America that I grew up even with, like when Ronald Reagan was in office. It's like he was hanging out with Michael Jackson."
Kanye," And, you know, it's like it felt a plus of the way the media show things like the American dream was alive and well and even at the same time."
Interviewer," And the ghetto, it was a living hell."
Kanye," And we were being, you know, given, you know, bricks were put on the street, bricks are put on the street during the riots."
Interviewer, Now bricks are put on the street in a these different kind of brick. And there were guns plays and the fathers were being taken out of the hood. And this is all this.
Kanye," So don't let me say, like everything was perfect doing that during that era."
Interviewer," But the perception right now, perception is more important than it's ever than it's ever been. Like what we show, you know, it's just I mean, it's outright."
Kanye," It's just I don't even want to I don't want to I don't want anyone to dwell on it. Let's keep going into what you're saying about the debt, because also I don't have like if you ask me about covid, I can only give you my perspective as a civilian."
Interviewer," I don't I'm not talking to these the same people, you know, and also in power, the geniuses I was talking to, my man Fred and my boy Anthony about crypto and bitcoin, you know, the yesterday just to be prepped for this conversation and not about the specifics of alternate currencies, which is like AC, which is like Tesla, which but the the that my mind just goes on."
Kanye, He's like Riff's right here.
Interviewer, But Jack Dorsey decentralized Twitter two months before it really hit because he was talking to the Bitcoin guys. And these are guys that really have a perspective on what the true liberation of America and humanity will be.
Kanye," These guys, a lot of that, the specific that he's got. But a lot of the tech guys were able to use the new highways, the new information highways and create the next frontier of our existence. Wow."
Interviewer," The powers of our political system are still anchoring on Electoral College, which was based around slavery, about the idea of slaves being three fifths of man."
Kanye," And get this. It wasn't even created by pro slaves, three fifths of man was created by the anti slaves in the north as a compromise, and that basically explains the existence of black people in America to this day. The people that were on our side supposedly said we were three fifths of men. Hmm. The people that were on our side, the people on our side thought of us as three fifths of man, meaning like, yeah, come work for us."
Interviewer," But, you know, your three fifths of men sitting have Electoral College and gerrymandering happening to this date, where if you have Latinos, blacks, other minorities, they're redrawing the lines to affect the vote to this day. That does not relate to the information highway that we live in today that allow all these, you know, tech guys to become multibillionaires and lead and and and lead free thought or allow, you know, as best as we could a version of free thought."
Kanye," And I gave you a symphony, but you see how all this really connects. We're sticking. You know, why don't we just keep why are we when we put the white wigs back on, they still wear the white wigs out. Yeah. England, they still wear, you know, that's the whole thing."
Interviewer," Just because, you know, someone's not, you know, wearing a KKK uniform or a white wig doesn't mean that they aren't holding on to the very core of the country being, you know, based on and built off of slavery."
Kanye," So when everyone's saying vote in, that's the reason why my Merce's vote, Kanye, because, like. Vote for who? Look, man, if you ain't going to say who you vote, no, I don't even wear the vote t shirt. That's so random, right? That's so right. And we have these no vote is like Democrat. And because there's nobody is the Trump that's like where's the vote T-shirt? Isn't that funny? It's such."
Interviewer," Well, go ahead. Did you say that? Yeah."
Kanye, You say vote is mostly vote Democrat.
Interviewer," And if you have an American flag, mostly you're voting Trump like these are these are realities that we've sort of accepted and it's subs."
Kanye," It's all the subliminal stuff that's that's based on like fear and control. Even like this. Like this. Look at this. The whole this is the three fifths of man thing. Right, OK. The Democrats were willing to take the chance. Of not winning as long as the conglomerate could be completely in control of. As a completely controlled you know, I'm saying that Bernie yeah, Bernie would have won, he would have won this is so I would try that."
Interviewer," I'm saying, like, Bernie is a hero. Yeah."
Kanye," You know, and he would be the perfect, the perfect and the perfect person to be the opposite of what Trump represents. Yeah. He's an anticapitalist. He's a he's a guy who is a social Democrat."
Interviewer," And you but you know the problem, they couldn't control Bernie because you can't you can't control."
Kanye, And he's he's been so consistent his whole life.
Interviewer, So so what I'm saying is they literally kicked at this. Doesn't say so. It's like they kicked the superhero in saying they they want to control.
Kanye," That's the same thing they did with Tulsi Gabbard. But Bernie was interesting because he's this democratic socialist, because he's got these ideas that are scary to capitalism."
Interviewer," You know, it's funny because I created the birthday party, which on the on the next election, what's going to happen is, I mean, you guys got 300 million viewers, you know, after this would probably be 900 million because I run the stock up and I was a little bit of Bill Cosby in the development, but that's exactly exactly so."
Kanye," So this is a long rant, but I really would like to talk to you about specific things, OK? And it was a beautiful long symphony, but there's a there's a cap on it."
Interviewer, There's a pop.
Kanye," We don't we don't. We don't. I mean, we're cap here maybe."
Interviewer," OK, and an end note thing, as I said, we get everyone away, but there's a possibility that I could. It's actually technically possible for me to win now, which would be the best option for America."
Kanye, I would I'm on 12 ballots and in 17 states that you could write me in on.
Interviewer," So if people got up, people that never voted, got a registered voter for me, they'd have to take it, take it to the House because. I would you know, I could possibly win. Now I'm definitely 100 percent winning in 2024, and with that thought, I was like, OK, I got the birthday party, but I was thinking. Maybe there's a possibility I would be. They said that wouldn't happen. I was thinking I would possibly be the Democrat, you know, I don't think they would ever let you in like that, but I don't know maybe who knows what happens after this."
Kanye," Joe Biden, Kamala Harris thing, who knows now knows what they think."
Interviewer," You know, I would be the first. I'm. I'm trying I'm not trying to I'm one of the. First. Super famous public. Black Freewill Servants of Christ, since modern media has come to pass, meaning when I, when I when I talk, I'm not talking for a conglomerate, I'm talking for myself in service to God."
Kanye," That's it, that's it, like I'm not you know, I'll cover my people, cover my family, but there's not some big plan or like some practice script thing where it says you go in and you you say this, you do this."
Interviewer," We've got we want to keep selling Kodak film. So we want to stop, you know, you from bringing out the digital camera."
Kanye," We want to keep, you know, sell this, raise the price of gas."
Interviewer," So we're not going to look to how to safely harness nuclear power to do electric power. OK, go ahead."
Kanye, Ask another question. I really just I quite love the sound of my own voice.
Interviewer," As you can see, it's fairly it's OK. It's this microphone we start. It sounds great. We so we started with student debt and we got on this long symphony."
Kanye, Yeah. Have you given thought into the idea of free education? And particularly here's a big one for me as well.
Interviewer," Free health care. I think if we think of ourselves as a country and our country as a community, we're all a bunch of people that are together. If we're going to take care of things like the fire department, if we're going to take care of things like the police department education, we've got to take care of health care. We got we got to make it so that people get sick. They don't go bankrupt. We got to make it so that no one has to worry about being taken care of."
Kanye," And I don't mean to eliminate the ability for someone to hire a private specialist for surgery or anything like that. I'm not I'm not saying that, but I'm saying at the very least, we have to cover basic medical concerns for the population. It's just it's a giant part of what it is to be a person, is to worry about your your body being broken, to worry about being sick, to worry about what it's going to cost your family financially and how it could ruin people."
Interviewer," This is a I mean, this is a huge issue in our country, is medical health. So have you thought about that? Absolutely. I hear you and I feel you and I feel what people are going through."
Kanye," I think that. There is a. It's not just how we treat people, there's preventative measures, yes, that can help us from getting sick, are our diet, are our locations, are the our jobs."
Interviewer, There's a lot of that that affects us and puts it in those situations.
Kanye," Transportation, you know, like as you go to like autonomous vehicles and tram systems, like just kind of, you know, trains that are like floating malls or floating Starbucks or something like moving like designing our world to be the world of the future will will help us with health."
Interviewer," That's the preventative measures. And then as far as being more inventive in the way we we connect holistic medicine with modern medicine, I believe in both medicine."
Kanye," I believe in God. I believe in God. And nature, I believe in science and physics and, you know, it's like the first simplest form of bioengineering, I think is farming."
Interviewer, And to be able to.
Kanye," I have like I talk about the guys at Emit, the greatest scientists in the world, there's people who are that are like the islands of the the medical field, but perhaps they're sitting there on the on on the floors, like serving on the front line, fighting covid, where, you know, they didn't have the opportunity to create people and become a billionaire and go to the next idea or when they present it and want people to invest in these inventions that they have, they haven't had the voice of the platform to bring this invention."
Interviewer," There's cures to things like one of the things is the silver bullet, like what I went through with the medication when they gave me the medication that made me fat."
Kanye," But then they said, OK, we have one that doesn't."
Interviewer," We all know what a silver bullet is, a medication. Right."
Kanye, So it's the it's a medication that goes and just kills exactly what it's supposed to kill.
Interviewer," But for capitalism, that's not the best medication to actually cure people."
Kanye," Capitalis want to keep people. They want to treat them. They want to treat they want to keep you sick because that's how you keep making money to have a guy. Like for me, when I say I put my life on the line, I think about Abraham Lincoln."
Interviewer," I think about JFK to go in and sit and say, you know, the whole thing is now everyone is going to be more prosperous."
Kanye," I think is the word. Now, specifically, are you going to five x your money?."
Interviewer," Everyone's like trying to you know, it's about prosperity and to be able to really have real conversations with the lead heads of like Big Pharma and real conversations with the heads of, uh, of, uh, holistic and natural healing to put these people in a room together."
Kanye, People learning to have they're mad at each other. They're afraid of each other. Hmm.
Interviewer," I donated to a Christian school in Cody and, uh, I also went by and saw this other amazing school in in Cody, where they have autistic children and kids with special needs in the same classrooms as other as regular kids and."
Kanye," I just saw this juxtaposition and the head of that that school is a Christian, but it's a state school, so there's no prayer in the school. And then the other school is fully Christian, but it's not a state school, so they don't have money in the school."
Interviewer, And I wanted to have dinner with both of the principals come to find out.
Kanye," The principal and these guys, they talk maybe at a softball game or some the principal. House is one block walking distance, the principal of one school's house is one block walking distance from the school or the other principal that were this close."
Interviewer," Right now we have the solutions, but we all have our backs to each other."
Kanye," We need to face each other like how we're facing each other right now and have these conversations. The solutions for Utopia are in front of us. But what's holding us back? Fear. People are sitting on their money. Really, they're sitting under their money. I know. I may give you a thing. OK, that's it. Next."
Interviewer, Did you get did you get my perspective of the way I approach?.
Kanye," You would bring people together to communicate and try to figure out a better strategy for health care. I mean, in reality, some financial realities that have to be in London when you go to the hospital."
Interviewer," No, let me give you the American example, when I go to a hospital, I had something on my foot three years ago. They asked me, you know, do you want to take something, do you want a pill? I said, no. Five doctors and nurses asked me if I want a pill, this is like worse than when you don't accept water on the plane and they just keep. Like, do you want some more water?."
Kanye, I'll take the water because I don't want to be responsible for the water. Like when the plane takes off and it goes like this. And I got.
Interviewer," I told him, I don't want no water. Like, I don't even know my like son said I should drink more water."
Kanye," So the so they they there are like people, they have Christmas parties about bonuses, about giving out more medication. So when we talk about they do look at this, how much does it cost."
Interviewer," There's no price on it. Right. We make money. Money is not even backed by gold anymore, so. It's engineering, it's where the budgets are going and like it was the best part of one of the best parts on the Sixth Sense is when."
Kanye," When they looked at this video and it was a nanny, they saw that the nanny was like putting stuff in the like the porch for the child that it passed. And and then they said the ladies looked at it and said you were keeping her sick."
Interviewer," You're keeping her sick like we are sick. We are sick of abortion, culture, sex, culture, capitalism, we are sick, we as a people, as a not just the American society of the world, we are sick and we are keeping ourselves sick. We're all responsible, like the Black Mirror episode. We're all responsible in some way. We all play some part, like if I go to PornHub and the very next thing and I and like backslide and do this because I've struggled with this since I was like five years old."
Kanye," Right. And the very next thing says something about like trafficking. Then I literally would have to, like, put my hand over that part and like, click the thing, I'm going to end thinking that, like, I'm not a part of the the bigger conglomerate that we're all, oh, I'm not really a part of the main problem because I'm I'm not as bad as that guy."
Interviewer, And I'm not looking at this part.
Kanye, And I'm not like we all play a part of it and we're all sick in some way.
Interviewer," And the world has been designed to keep us sick, like spacial engineering based of faith can save a world literally like building will save the world."
Kanye," Spatial engineering, like engineering, not going to space engineering our spaces. The amount of space that we need, the way that we interact with each other, how close we are to our loved ones, our families, how close we are to our jobs. We got to experience a lot of this. Some people it wasn't good, some people it's better. They connected with their children and their families in a whole different way. Like we're talking this is my thing."
Interviewer, We could talk about all of these important current issues.
Kanye," There's deeper reasons based on the slave mentality, based on fear, based on protectionism, not specifically white supremacy and racism, protectionism, people just want to protect what they have."
Interviewer," And there's this, like photograph where you're holding the guys at the little girls holding a teddy bear and Jesus has a giant teddy bear behind her, her back, I mean, behind his back."
Kanye," She don't want to give up the small teddy bear for the bigger teddy bear that Jesus has waiting for her. There is prosperity for all families here on Earth right now in service to God. There's happiness, there's joy. It's not a possibility is a probability. Just the fact that God woke me up, got me here safely and allowed me to talk to you right now and spark the minds of the people that are anointed to change the world is already what God wanted me to do if I didn't take a breath after this point."
Interviewer," God had me here for this conversation right now. But I think God has more for me playing out. Think they don't come for me to he done until he's done with me, they ain't gonna come for me today."
Kanye," I want to make it so small and dissemble and put in a to be like perfect really. They they go, they go come for me until he's done with me then go come for me until he's done with me and uh."
Interviewer," Yeah yeah yeah. And help yourself. You always create and now. Yeah but do you understand what I'm saying. You have to go. OK, tell me what I'm saying."
Kanye," What you're saying is that it's, it's your overall philosophy, the way you're approaching life, you're approaching life, that there is good for everyone."
Interviewer," If we all work together, if we all work together in the spirit of the way you think, the spirit of God that did not not approach this like with a famine mentality, but approach this like there's enough for everybody. There's an abundance. If we if we engineer correctly, if we think about it correctly, if we all come together with the spirit of everybody helping everybody. This is the spirit of Christianity. This is the the good spirit of Christianity, not the Christianity that gets despised or disparaged or, you know, evangelists drive it around in private jets, the spirit of of goodness and treating each other like brothers and sisters."
Kanye," Yes, but this can be done on a national scale. Yes."
Interviewer," Because those evangelists or the people who spread the word of God, you know, there's people who were praying for me. You know, we're praying."
Kanye," Like I said, I like to say, OK, yes, I am a genius. But one of my most genius skill sets is recognizing other geniuses and empowering them and giving them the platform. So the people that I've been praying for me this whole time, you know, for Jay to work for the kingdom, look at me."
Interviewer," Look at me right here, working from the kingdom, not not leaning on my ego, not leaning on anything, but leaning on God in this situation, saying, let's, you know, let's rise up together and show people what it's like to be Christ."
Kanye," Like, yeah, we fall short, you know, I mean, people love to like, look at the Christians that are the least Christlike to judge Christianity as a whole. Well, a lot of people got jawans in twenty three years old and very few of them play like LeBron."
Interviewer," You know, they want to be like like Mike. Yes. But it's very few people that get that close, you know, it's like. Yeah, yeah."
Kanye, What you're saying is beautiful. Yeah. That they do judge the people that fail.
Interviewer," People always go to the furthest extent, like if you talk about abortion culture, people immediately go to rape."
Kanye, But don't do the math on what percentage that is.
Interviewer," And for me, as a as a Christian president, you know, as I said, I go on that I touch on it before I realize we're in an imperfect world. You know, when I talk to my fellow Christians and we talk about meet, talk about guns, we talk about in this imperfect world, there's a transition between where we are today and where we're going."
Kanye," Yeah, there's a meat industry have a great impact on the ozone from what I hear it does."
Interviewer," And we have to transition. One of the things I wanted it it's a thought that came in. And thank you for allowing me to give you the thoughts that are coming into my head as opposed to trying to put me on a grid because I'm off the grid, period. The way I think. Clearly, I paint in circles, you know, I don't I don't paint inside of the lines."
Kanye, Right.
Interviewer," So I was thinking about I forget the lady's name starts with a T, but she changed the meat industry because she was hsp like highly sensitive person."
Kanye, That's and put the the cows in and round beans and.
Interviewer," That's what I'm doing when I say spatial engineering, that's what I'm doing with our spaces that I'm designing with the farms and with the school systems, the unlearned systems to what are the things that you're going to need, you know, in the future. Because 30 years we don't we don't even know."
Kanye," We think probably the things that we're learning in school right now won't even apply to people when they're 30 years old that are learning this stuff, you know, age, especially with technology, especially with technology."
Interviewer, And the people who designed the curriculums are did what they did way before technology. Yeah.
Kanye," So, I mean, I was in computer programming when I was eight years old and I used to know how to program is how I got into music."
Interviewer," In seventh grade, I had a Amiga computer that had four thousand ninety six colors. That's why I got that one. And I would program the different sprites and draw out each of the characters and animate them. And I thought that was the next frontier, the like, because I would do like animation books. I wanted to be an animator. And then I started doing the music."
Kanye, They had a music program on do the music for the video games. And then I found myself running home from school all the way from 91st to 100 nineteenth street to go and just keep programming the music.
Interviewer," So this is like third age, you know, 12, 13, you know, programming video games."
Kanye, And that being the gateway into programming music.
Interviewer," I got a longer story about that, but I know you want to ask me some more serious stuff."
Kanye," So ding, OK, this is a big one. The military, if you really did become president when excuse me, when you do become president, you're going to have to deal with hostile governments."
Interviewer," You're going to have to deal with hostile militaries and dictators, you know, people in other countries that in other countries that don't have a value of human life. And throughout history, we've had immense problems because of that, because of military conflicts. How do you think you will approach that? I mean, you will be the commander in chief of the greatest army in the world has ever known, if you're in that position and we have to deal with some sort of a military action with China, would have China takes over Taiwan."
Kanye," What if they invade Taiwan? What if something happens with Syria? What if something happens with Iran? What if something happens with Russia and you have to make decisions about military action? Have you thought about this? Yes, I would. I have to say, again, like covid. I'm a civilian and people can have all their perspectives that they could have of what they would do in that situation, but I would have the greatest professionals on the planet, the most skilled people that have all the experience that would present the information."
Interviewer," And I would make the most sound rational decisions. And I would. Follow God's will in my approach. To. To dealing with these other countries, to dealing with these other leaders, there's there's something about, you know. Our president's personality and. The leader of North Korea's personality, where there's. There's a level of common respect and and that's the reason why they were able to talk and we the fear had been taken off of us like people who are."
Kanye," God-Fearing. Self-made. Servants of their. People. These these other, you know, scary dictators, they feel like they're that for their country and if they see. A president that they know is just taking a check or part of a bigger conglomerate. I don't want to like I said, I want to denounce any of the."
Interviewer," Candidates. Then. It's. It's very it's very transactional. It's. As I said, a prayer in this situation, this isn't you said a prayer because of what? What what motivated you to say a prayer through? The seriousness, the significance of the subject. Yeah, absolutely, we can't we can't jump from jokes about this to, you know, joking about people's lives. Right."
Kanye," We have to completely. Be still in this moment. Allow God to guide our steps and ask the right questions. With the highest ranking officials possible. This isn't something that you just wing or that you just come in and say, I did a bit of research, I got this like political answer. It going to get a rise out of people like this is this is people's lives."
Interviewer," This is. You know, this is a whole different. You know, setting or mood than what this whole interview has has been about, this is."
Kanye," You know, people are suffering and throughout all sides and in in in Israel and in Nigeria and Haiti, where we're suffering the police force in in in Chicago and the people who have been harmed by police and the police like."
Interviewer," This all is going to take. Serious time like Time is love, it's going to take that love in that time and. Moments of listening, moments of understanding, moments like when my wife goes and visits people in prison and she hears their stories, she says, I understand, I understand why."
Kanye," You're into in why you're in that situation, I would have did the same thing in this situation and for us to go to foreign countries and really understand why that they're, you know, that they're in these situations or why the killing has gone for so long or why the hate has gone so long and why the pain just keeps on. You know, compounding and compacting. There's an empathy that I just have as an artist that it doesn't become a two plus two equals four situation."
Interviewer," My dad was actually a psychology major and a Christian therapist. And. This therapy we talk about therapy, period, it's like. We need healing internationally, not just selfishly, for America. America's number one internationally. We need healing. And. I would lead, I would. I would lead with. With love. Dignity. The responsibility to our country, the coverage of our families. Of our soldiers. And in full service to God and to the American people."
Kanye," It's the. There's a mode that I would be in in that position, like when I was a producer and I was a really young man."
Interviewer," I was running around. Hopping on trains or. You know, Hoppen turnstyles this stuff and like stealing from cars and I mean, that's stealing cars but still in clothes from stores and."
Kanye," Then I was. Selling music and, you know, going and buying leather jackets and stuff, you know, dating a whole bunch of girls going on tour, and then I had a family and. I had to just a lot of my mentality and behavior to grow and be the man that I needed to be. Then God called me and I gave my life to Christ. And God is helping you to be the Christian that I need to be, and when it's in God's will that I become the leader, I will become the leader that I need to be."
Interviewer," So right now, as I said, I'm a civilian, but. My heart, my mind and my spirit is in a place where I feel I know that I'm being I'm being call to captain this ship, like when Roosevelt went in America was in shambles."
Kanye," When I when I'd say those things about those numbers, when I went to Adidas, when I went to Gap, like I'm the person."
Interviewer," That you actually call when things are not going so well. You know, you had the mob movies is the guy that goes cleans up everything. And I put everything."
Kanye," I'm I'm like the forensic. We're in the same way how you saw my mind touch on ten things at a time. And then I had to say ten sentences at that time, if I could say him or maybe narrow them down to seven. That's the way my mind takes, you know, information in and then synthesize it and it comes out as a song or comes out as a product using that mentality as a leader. arless, god-fearing. We will heal. We will show the world what America. Should be the dream, you said all this shit, all the things that you've said in the most nonpolitician way I've ever heard anybody describe these things, I know you really mean these things. is is this is resonating with me that you're being 100 percent honest and natural. And that's that's what we're missing in politics today. I mean, it's one of the things that made people excited about Trump as at least he was an alternative to the political talk. He was an alternative to politicians speak where, you know, they're being dishonest and disingenuous, but you just accept it. You know, they're reading things that have been written by speechwriters, but you just accept it because it says the things that you want to hear checks the boxes that'll say, OK, you got my vote."
Interviewer," What you're saying, though, is what you really feel and you really think and you're not saying that like a politician. And that's what's going to resonate and people are going to be mad at me. If you get a."
Kanye, You've made Kanye West seem likable. You turned him into the fucking president.
Interviewer," You made him seem like a rational choice for president. This conversation exposes a side of you that I don't think anybody has ever seen before in a long form conversation where you realize that you are a visionary. You do you do have these ideas are real. You're not posing. It's not bullshit. This is who you are and you're well thought out response, particularly to the idea of military conflict. It's very impressive, man. Praise God. I'm glad I did that prayer."
Kanye," Brother is with three hours into this. Let's wrap this up on a beautiful high note so people can write you in if they want to. And we have a we have a video on that, Bryan. Yeah. So, Bryan, I'll play this video on how they can write you in and we'll wrap it up here. Here it is, how to write in Kanye West on your belt now for people that are watching this on YouTube, you'll be able to watch this on on Spotify."
Interviewer," You'll be able to watch this. But if you're just listening, you just got to go down to the part where it says or write in. It's pretty straightforward. Write in candidates. It'll show you where you could write it in. This video will be available. This video is on YouTube, right?."
Kanye," It's on his Twitter. It's on Twitter. OK, right. In Kanye West on your ballot. It's going to be very interesting to see what happens with this."
Interviewer," I'm telling you, man, that was one of the most interesting and impressive answers to any question because it was so obvious that you were you were coming from the heart. And that's that's what we all need right now. We all need no bullshit."
Kanye," Absolutely. Thank you, brother. It was an honor, really. Thank pleasure. I'm glad we finally did it. Yeah, awesome. This won't be the last time."
Interviewer," All right. Let's do it again. Good bye, everybody.

Interviewer,Nice to see you again man. Thanks for stopping by the BBC for a chat.
Kanye,Good to see you too sir. Thank you.
Interviewer,"So, I was thinking today like where do we begin? Because you've been having some remarkable conversations lately, some really in depth, really interesting conversations addressing recent things that have gone on, you know, successes, things that have kind of made people think, talk amongst themselves and it got me thinking like, where were we last time. We were 18 months ago, not far from here and so much has changed in the last 18 months. The first question I wanted to ask you, cause I've always wondered how you felt at that time."
Kanye,"I had so many interviews where I'm trying to express that I can create, that I can create outside of just the music box and I'm giving examples of work that I did that was really successful and I'm getting just completely shut down. But not just by the company we talked about last time but every single company, every single company you could imagine is just like ""no, you are celebrity. You are not allowed to create, you're not allowed to think, you're not allowed to have an opinion. You're just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up."" And it's true that as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the product and you know, as I told you last time I said I'm a product guy."
Interviewer,"Yea, and it was an electrifying conservation, and I mean, it felt like you were taking names that day, it felt like you were also trying to reach people that day and what's occurred since you know is you have made serious moves into that world. You know, what's happened recently with Yeezy supply, you know your deal with Adidas, how has that experience been overall for you now with product out and with peoples opinion about the shoes and about what they've seen how has that experience been for you? How can you put that into context for us?"
Kanye,"I mean, every day when you go to the gym or you go to work it's a challenge. You gotta work hard and you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what. So that's the way I'mma word it. You know what I'm saying, so we made it to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a company that was flexible enough and had been used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was very close to my heart. You know, they original hip hop."
Interviewer,"Of course, Run DMC man I mean they were right there at the very beginning it was kind of a perfect partnership when it was announced, you know, not long after and I wondered when did the conversation actually begin with Adidias after you starting talking about your aspirations and what you wanted to achieve in that industry?"
Kanye,"That conversation had already started before then. There was a few conversations with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember calling Jon Wexler you know, it was a certain point where I just felt like I couldn't breathe anymore like I had all these ideas and I felt like I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone's creative, you know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something. And anyone that's creative understands that there's no amount of money that can be given to them to make them not want to or have to create. There's no check out and there's no cheque to stop you from creative. No pun intended when I'm saying no check."
Interviewer,Was a good one though.
Kanye,"Just even thinking about it takes the breath out of me because I mean, as soon as we got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many ideas. I mean I look at over 500 images a day on my laptop. And I remember I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I said ""people be dissing me on Hypebeast"" and it's like wait a second, dude, like I been fighting this battle for a long time, since like Universe City. Like no one has any idea what the meeting were like. I'mma throw this one out here. I remember this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was working on Yeezus and I had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a deal with Puma. And the guy, actually I forgot about the meeting right, so I had my jacket on and it was a jacket I had done with A.P.C. and I was about to leave, so he shows up at the door and we go to my dining room table and I'm sitting with him, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket. And he makes some joke about, you know ""You did look pretty hot. I'm happy to know that you put on all those clothes for me.""."
Interviewer,Was he joking do you think?
Kanye,"He was leveling. He was leveling the conversation, this is what people do all the time. Like if I meet someone who I respect or I look up to, I will literally like kiss their feet. You know someone that I know that's put in a lot of work. And it's a lot of agents, a lot of people who work under the main guy that will level, that will try to level you. You know when they talk to you, they talk down to you. And I'm just sitting like ""Whoa, ok."" Obviously I have to show him like hey I'm working on this stuff and it's coming out good and this is all I have a chance to work on. You know like when I worked with A.P.C. I only had two times to look at the collection, you know I couldn't really grab it and dig into it the way I dig into like working on ""All Of The Lights"" or something like that, it's like, there's a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you're dealing with apparel and the way that people make apparel currently."
Interviewer,"I can imagine the frustration for you at that moment in time as you're leading up to what has effectively occurred in the last year. Seeing something like you say, close to the vision you have in your mind. At those early stages, man the frustration of trying to get those ideas out and just like you said, and getting just levelled."
Kanye,"Everyone, everyone I talked to would try to level me. You know. And then there was this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the head of Adidas. And I say ""was"" because he passed away recently. And I showed him what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using 7 screens, the surround vision idea which we've never shown online because you have to experience it in it's space. It's the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know this is the new frontier on the way we need to see film. And which I got all no's on that to date. And this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed. He believed that maybe I had something more than how big my rap record was. In me he could tell, he knew, he's like this guy has something to say and to give that's past the current box that he's put in. And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done. And the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society. The deal is all about the moment when I can bring a shoe to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it back to when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet. That is what the deal is about. The deal is about when the star of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl, when there's never been a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show. The deal is when the kids came to 42 locations across the world to see Yeezy Season 1 x Adidas Originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater, and when they saw that line up, they saw that brigade, they reacted to it when they heard ""Wolves, when they saw the boots, when they saw the runners, when they saw the matrix sweaters, when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back. This is what I fought for. None of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini. It, like, it wasn't about that. It was about these kids having a moment. To be themselves. To be a stronger version, you know, of themselves. I make this stuff to empower people. I feel like there's so many things that are made to, you know, to wear the people as opposed to people wearing it. And I asked my assistant one time. I was like, how does these clothes make you feel? She said, I feel powerful. And that's our, that's our main goal. As the song says, no one man should have all that power. No one man should have it. Everyone should have it."
Interviewer,"You seem to be totally, well, a lot more aware of what it is that. well, in a much, sort of like a more focused way you're able to know where you wanna be and what impact you wanna have. And it feels like you're very attached to the well-being of the people and what they can get out of this. You know, and across the border. And when that moment kind of occurred to you. Cause that doesn't happen overnight, you know. there's. but it does lead up to that. And 18 months ago you were fighting, you know, you were like really fighting to be heard. And now it seems to me like you're very consciously aware."
Kanye,"Yeah, I was still off, you know what I mean? I might have some things that are off now, but I feel like, in the same way when I came up with All Falls Down, and I was able to differentiate myself from whoever I was trying to rap like at that point and I found my voice and my message. It's like, I felt like."
Interviewer,"That was the moment you felt like that was, yeah."
Kanye,"When I wrote All Falls Down. That's when I was like, okay, this is who I am in the. this is what I'm, this is what I'm presenting. So now I feel like. it's funny, I would always say, you know, I wanna sculpt with marble. And it wasn't until I was working on Yeezus, and I was learning about furniture and the fact that I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot for. And one of the things they had was this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement, and it was this beautiful sculpture that was..it really inspired me because he made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone. And it was made of cement. So it wasn't the material, it was the idea that was the most important. And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a cement in comparison to, you know, the type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use. That I find a message, a voice, a reason, a reason to create. You know, it was a futile argument for me to say, hey, everyone, get behind me so I can make another $5000 jacket that you can afford. It's like insane. But now I feel people rallying because they know that I wanna fight for H&M, Zara type concept and I know that Adidas can eventually get those price points. And I want to apologize to everyone right now because I believe that Season 1 may still be in that upper price point and there's still the words exclusivity, you know, being thrown around. Exclusivity is the new N-word. Not nigga, exclusivity. Am I saying the word right?"
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"Yeah, that is the new N-word. Cause nothing should be exclusive. Everyone should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain. The idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept. And saying, we're gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to, you know, drink at the right fountain. You know, we have to reboot our mentality. Period. Of a generation. You know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold one sweatshirt. You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and know this and or someone in position of power or someone that will be in a position of power in the future has a chance to make a difference. And they say someone who was at the lowest point grabbing at straws, express themselves freely, and overcame it through all adversary, all adversity, means that they can do the same thing. You know."
Interviewer,"Yeah. Because the thing is when people hear you talking at times I think that there's a genuine consensus from those cause believe me, you're compelling to a lot of people. And, you know, what you say is. I think you have very unique views on things that should be heard. But some people I think have thought overtime that. they've obviously missed the point. They've thought that you bringing it back to you. But you're actually trying to open up to everybody else. You're trying to break down that barrier of exclusivity and say you know. If you have to lead the way you have to lead the way. It might not end with you, but maybe if it starts with you is your point."
Kanye,"And I was, I was using the wrong words. My rap was wrong. You know what I'm saying? I was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night. You know, cause imagine, think about the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews. And imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl at a bar. Yo, what up, baby? I'm a genius! They be like, yo, who's this guy? No, I'm telling you, I sold all this, I sold this many shoes. Then she be like, yo, chill, chill. Like, gosh, get me out of here already. You know what I'm saying? And that's who I was and that was that frustration I had cause I'm seeing like this. I'm looking at this girl like, man, I know that."
Interviewer,"We could be good together, this could work."
Kanye,"Yeah, I know, I just don't know how to work it."
Interviewer,"So I'm messing it up, yeah."
Kanye,And the right way so I'm gonna stumble. I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know.
Interviewer,You're the 40 year old virgin of dealing with corporations?
Kanye,"Yeah. I did not know how to communicate at all. And it's like I had my point, my message was, you know, simply like, your egg, my semen, we change the world. You know, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong."
Interviewer,"That's a hell of a pick up line, man."
Kanye,"I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like."
Interviewer,"It's okay, it's okay, wrong."
Kanye,We have the right to be wrong sometimes.
Interviewer,"That's a great line. You know I wanted to talk to you. when we started talking, you know, a while back, music was on my agenda because, you know, I mean, we talked a couple times before as well. And you know I'm a music guy, I mean, it really drives me, and it's a big part of my life. And over the course of this conversation, you know, I wanna ask you at some point what the future looks like and feels like to you cause I'm fascinated in the certain things I wanna touch on, but I do want to talk about your forthcoming, new record if that's cool. Do you want to talk about music?"
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Cause to me it feels like over the course of that frustration last time you had to make sacrifices to be heard and it felt like you didn't really wanna talk about Yezus. You were like, that's cool and everything, but I wanna talk about this. And lately, I just, maybe I'm, I feel like you're really energized with music in a big way."
Kanye,"You know, after I did the presentation in New York I was able to get that alien out of my stomach, you know like. I was on a flight back in the morning to go shoot the Blessings video with Big Sean and Drake."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"And I couldn't have been happier. To go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the game. Well, let's be respectful and truthful. The hottest rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the game. And I fall somewhere in that, you know? In that, that field. So."
Interviewer,"Getting back to music for a minute, I feel like we're right back, I gotta bring you right back for a second. I want to know what we can look forward to on this record. You talked about cookout music, you talked about what this album represents. And every record you have made has been something new and fresh. You've taken yourself and your craft to a new place. Where's your head at right now with this new album?"
Kanye,Just working hard. On it.
Interviewer,And it's fun?
Kanye,"And it's fun. And it's fun to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I think are important and very. can be inspiring to people. That fight, and you know, The College Dropout came out of a fight to want to rap. And this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to design. And."
Interviewer,"I wondered about that, cause Yeezus was punk-rock to me. That was like, that was Sex Pistols to me. That was like Public Enemy to me. That was one of the records that stands as establishing an industrial, strong statement. And I wondered like where the desire is coming from on this record. And without giving away too much cause the proof is in the hearing, the joy is in the hearing. Where it's coming from."
Kanye,"I mean, it's a joyful noise onto the Lord. Like, it is still, you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the struggle. You know."
Interviewer,As opposed to just the struggle?
Kanye,"Yea, the song Amazing Grace, you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, possible. You know I wanna perform ""Only One"" as many times as possible. You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I said I didn't come here to be liked I came here to make a difference. I'm not talking about this interview, I'm talking about life. Some people's job they're very extremely likeable and I think I could figure that out. I think I'm way nicer to people just in general. Everyone I meet I'm extremely nice. But as soon as people start playing games I stop. I stop playing games. And at any moment I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back to day one. People be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick. But it's all love, and great energy and positive energy. I like the, I like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I'm sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I come in I have all these lists of complaints like ""da-da-da-da-da!"" and this happened and that happened and he say ""Yo man, it's all cool though! How bout we make a song?"" And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song."
Interviewer,"He is the most, cause I've met him many times now and he is just so tapped into the joy of making music. And he so gets it in the sense that it's like kinda let it lead you. Let the song sorta lead you to where it needs to go is the vibe I get from him like yea, let's just see where this goes."
Kanye,And yea that's what we did. You know people think that our first two singles don't have drums but both of those are percussive instruments.
Interviewer,"Yea totally that's what he's doing. That's like ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"" that's what it is. S I just wanna talk about working with him because I haven't actually seen too many people focus on that which surprises me, maybe I'm wrong, but I just, I love the idea of that collaboration occurring and it's a natural one. Certainly on ""FourFiveSeconds"" I think that's one of Rihanna's greatest vocal performances period."
Kanye,She was killing that right?
Interviewer,"My gosh man. I mean that's like a whole other attitude that I haven't heard from her as a star. She's really gone inside that record and wrangled it. How was it making that and getting that song out cause it feels effortless to listen to, it almost has like a 70's FM American rock, sort of country-rock radio vibe to it, you know what I mean, like something you would've heard in Los Angeles in '76 or something."
Kanye,"I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I was growing up. And I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don't need to understand them, and to be able to be involved with that."
Interviewer,It's because he invented them.
Kanye,"Yea exactly. And be able to be involved with writing a song like that, it's just like way next to, like meeting Paul McCartney is like meeting Ralph Lauren."
Interviewer,"Yea, totally!"
Kanye,"It's like ""whoa!""."
Interviewer,Dude he's the greatest.
Kanye,"The greatest of their field, period. Of all time."
Interviewer,"And you got to say ""wildin'"" in a song with him it's just incredible cause it's still hip hop, that's what's amazing about it."
Kanye,"Yea the whole cadence was trap. Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trap."
Interviewer,"That's again is the fusion of cultures which I love. It's what did you call it before when you when you were talking about Sean wearing  and your shoes you were saying, it's I can't remember what you said."
Kanye,"Fusion is the future. Period. The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the two lunch tables working together, you know. Humanity period man, we're one people and maybe that's like incorrect English I'm sorry mom but you know I went to Louise Wilson's memorial, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time. And I'm talking about of all timers."
Interviewer,"Educate us man, tell us."
Kanye,"Ok so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion school, ever. Notorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a 12. So the first time that I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo's Céline collection, I was looking at a 12. When I saw McQueen's last show the Atlantis collection, I was looking at a 12. Christopher Kane's Bandage collection I'm looking at a 12. Alber Elbaz I'm looking at a 12. That's the designer, the designer of Lanvin which completely revolutionized the men's sneaker, fashion sneaker industry. Last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my favourite restaurant in London and I think she knew that she was gonna pass and she just wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my wife. And she said so many students, they don't give it their all. And the problem is soon as they do anything halfway good, when they're 2 years old, 3 years old, their parents clap."
Interviewer,clapping.
Kanye,"Exactly, that's what she said, they clap. And she just looked at me, she said ""Kanye, don't clap.""."
Interviewer,"Aww, what, that's just! How you getting on with that?"
Kanye,"I didn't know we were gonna lose her. You know I just um, and she told me she said, you know ""thank you for the times you know, when we came to performances"" and ""this has like really meant a lot to me."" You know she would."
Interviewer,You ok?
Kanye,"Yea, I'm ok, I think I'm ok."
Interviewer,We're gonna change the subject. Here we go. One of the things you said recently which really kinda made me think was you know you really truly believe that you're gonna be the head of the world's first trillion dollar company and the first thing that sprang to my mind Kanye was what is that company going to look like?
Kanye,"Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion from what I know, Elon Musk included, is like the world's greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design. And I said from what I know because there might be other, there might be some others, there are a lot that are great but Johnny Ive's the best that I know. He said that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I think that, I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a way. So, if we talk about this type of company, it wouldn't be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me driving down the westside highway ""there's no money in the innovation.""."
Interviewer,"Yea, and he's got a point."
Kanye,"The money's in the repetition, you know so."
Interviewer,It's in the quality.
Kanye,"And making something of better quality for more people. So it has to be a balance of both. I've said this a few times but I wanna just say it right here for people who haven't read it or seen but I think people think that I pander to fashion particularly. You know because, people say ""why fashion?"" It's not politics, world war it's not that, it's fashion, it's just a jacket or something, it's just a dress. But I believe that the world can only be saved through design. And I think that the fashion world has. and when I say through design, I know it's some snarky classist editor that's gonna take that and say ""Kanye West said that the world will be saved with a couture dress."" That's not what I'm saying. The mentality behind design, you know art is to be free. Design is to fix."
Interviewer,"This is important, you're talking about the actual, like you say the mentality, the purpose behind it, what it means behind the actual product."
Kanye,"No politics, just truth. Does it fucking work or not. Irrigation, you know, that's a form of design."
Interviewer,"What are those conversations like, because you, one of the great privileges that you're in because you know you push yourself is that you get to find yourself in rooms with people that push themselves. So that conversations can be pushed. And I wonder what those conversations are like because I'm fascinated by somebody like Elon Musk and his absolute inability to be restrained by boundary. And you are very much cut from that same cloth. What is it like when you guys get together and do you talk about things as kind of obvious or  as what the future will feel like or is it more casual than that?"
Kanye,That's exactly what we talk about. What does Kanye West and Elon Musk talk about? The fut'.
Interviewer,The fut' TM.
Kanye,"So when I put out things that if I say hey, I want to work with Miucca Prada one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just put it out, you know. We just put it out there. Or as I told Obama last time I saw him, hey, I want, I would suggest that you sit with Elon Musk. I would suggest that both you guys go to China. I would suggest this. The, I think it may happen."
Interviewer,"Must be amazing, those conversations man must be amazing."
Kanye,"I got scared of the idea you know someone call you crazy so many times you start to believe it. And I almost got scared of the idea of like going crazy in some way but I wasn't going crazy, I was like the only person that wasn't crazy. You know what I'm saying like, I just stand there and I just look like ""is anyone else here seeing what I'm seeing? None of you guys are seeing what I'm seeing"" or it's just like your Maybach and your house is like that important that you won't move at all."
Interviewer,It's distractions.
Kanye,"That you won't say anything at all in risk of losing something. You won't say anything on anyone's behalf at this point? You know so, if you have that ability to do that, to see that, you know that Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to apply it. You have to use it. You can't be psyched out. You know, everyone's on our side. I was just in my own way, but everyone's on our side and everything that I ever said will happen, will happen. Just as much as you guys saw that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you saw that front row. The juxtaposition of the people in the front and second rows to where the people standing in the show had come from is the fusion and is the future. It is the glass shattering of the class system, which is the new racism. Class is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in a place based on where their kids go to school, how much money they make, what they drive, where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much, you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement. To somehow say that this person right here means more than this person. Like I know I tweeted Black Lives Matter but all lives matter. Like, my doorman is more important to me than any head of any company. He keeps us safe. My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work every day. The guy painting the windows at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know what the architect suggested, he is just as important as anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne. It's no more of this separation of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty. Whatever it is that people use to separate people."
Interviewer,"But was that moment, which I didn't want to talk about but you raised it and I want to actually bring this up because you have to learn from experience. You can't have all those answers straight away, you have to make those mistakes yourself I think in order to come to that level of clarity."
Kanye,"And I'm not saying I have answers, I'm just saying these are my current opinions. As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is my current opinions now."
Interviewer,"Sure, sure, and that's great, that's what we want, that's why I'm asking questions so we get to hear your answers. But when you, I think.. Cause you know I was nominated for that Album Of The Year as well as part of the Sam Smith album as a producer and a co-writer."
Kanye,"Oh, oh wow."
Interviewer,"Right, so I was at the awards ceremony with the other producers and co-writers that are part of each records. And, like I'm a huge fan of all the nominees that were nominated and I'm a huge fan of Beck and it's funny that you say, you talk about everyone you want to get it to a place where people can exist in their own terms and that leaves it open for fusion. But then like you say you can just push a button and be back and be old Ye, you know old Yeezy. Is that what happened that night? Just ""gaaah, I can't take it I've gotta get up on this stage, I've gotta wild out."" Cause we all thought you were joking. You know what I thought was brilliant about that night? When you did it on the night, I was applauding because I was like, ""that was Sun Tzu, that was Art of War."" He waited for the right platform, went up, pretended to do it, walked back down everyone's like ""aww, so funny"" I was like ""he just got the last laugh on this."" And then I woke up the next morning and it was like ""naw, he's not an artist"" and I was like ""aw man, I love that album!""."
Kanye,"Yea, I never said that he's not an artist."
Interviewer,"Ok, I'm misquoting you. But you were talking about artistry. And do you learn form those lessons yourself? Is that when you kind of get a little bit closer to understanding what you believe is really important? When you do things like and think, well maybe I did kinda misconstrue that."
Kanye,"I think yea I misconstrued it but I think that everybody has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be wrong. You know, there could be a lot of people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball. But there's a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn't get the ball. And everyone has a right to their opinion. You know, and I expressed my opinion, and I'll take the weight of it."
Interviewer,"He's great though. You know, he is great though. There's three."
Kanye,"Naw you know as I said on the Charlamagne interview when I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I was like ""this is really good.. maybe I might've been wrong!"" You know like, and uh."
Interviewer,It's a great album man.
Kanye,"And I hadn't been in like 6 years. And the Grammy's are definitely like an ex-girlfriend. Soon as you get in a car with them, you wanna go right back home."
Interviewer,"So we're gonna get a record this year, and I'm excited to hear it, I really am excited to hear it, and as we draw closer to the end of this particular talk I want to do it once again bring it back to like, the thing that really."
Kanye,"only one thing I want to say, people say I'm a hypocrite right?"
Interviewer,Some.
Kanye,People say that right?
Interviewer,Some.
Kanye,"Yes, I am. 100%. I'm a human being. I'm super hypocritical. I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time. I do it in the design office. I do it in the studio. I'm super hypo- I really love this, I do it when I get dressed. ""I love this"" tsk, tsk ""I hate this!""."
Interviewer,How long does it take you to get dressed on a daily basis?
Kanye,3 minutes. 2 minutes. Bars.
Interviewer,How long does it take your wife to get dressed every day?
Kanye,"Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes longer. I mean she's a woman."
Interviewer,"Course. You know it seems that um, you know what I love about ""Only One"" is the interaction and the way that you've been able to create different generations of your life and of your family communicating with one another, through one another, as a portal. And I love that. And I think it's one of those songs that successfully does that. And um, I'm a father, you're a father, it's the greatest thing of all time. No question about it, it is the great level of all time, it's the greatest thing of all time. And, you know your daughter is what, 18 months now? 18 months old? You an only child?"
Kanye,Yes.
Interviewer,Do you think about giving her brothers and sisters? Do you think about your upbringing and what you went through and how you feel in this life and what it means to have siblings?
Kanye,"Oh, I'm practicing really hard. I try as many times a day as I can. Nori this one is for you! You need a sibling!"
Interviewer,"For all the good ones, and all the ones where everyone's like totally engaged with everything you're saying, for right or for wrong or whatever, I think you've got it totally sussed. I think you know you absolutely know that you've talked recently about being the villain, like how you know everyone wants the villain and everyone does well when the villain opens his mouth kinda thing. But then at the end of the day you can go on another interview and you can show a really softer side and a very understanding and very human side that people who know you will tell me you totally are, 100%. And it's so funny it goes from like ""Boooo!"" to like ""Yeaaaa!"" to like ""Boooo!"" to like ""Yeaaaa!"" and it's like, I think you've got it sussed, I think you know what's going on all the time with all of this."
Kanye,You win some games and you lose some.
Interviewer,You win or you learn right?
Kanye,"Yea, you win or you learn. Bam, there's a jewel, I'll take that one with me."
Interviewer,"Right on, quote book. So album this year, sneak attack, no doubt, no question, sneak attack's coming and um, and there was a leaked poster that came out as well, you gonna tour with Rihanna? Is that out there now? Has that been confirmed or not confirmed, or what the story with that it?"
Kanye,I don't believe I'm supposed to confirm or not confirm.
Interviewer,"So that's happening. I've been long enough in the tooth to know what that means! Um, but needless to say you're excited about returning to the stage in some capacity this year and we're looking forward to new music this year."
Kanye,"Yea, and I been doing a few performances since doing the SNL performance, did a couple performances out here and of course gonna do the Brits. I've been really liking these performances. I feel like these are like the performance version of that you know Drake, you know of the 6 God album, of the you know If you're Reading This It's Too Late. I feel like I'm a visual extension of what he's doing like sonically."
Interviewer,Can we talk about Drake for a second cause he's just to me he's the monster at the moment out there.
Kanye,You know.. that shit is good yo!
Interviewer,"Dude, ""6PM in New York"" that moment when he's like opening up and telling the truth about how he feels about his detractors and he's just basically just opening up what's going on is my real honesty, not guarding himself or hiding away with any bravado or anything. Just like you know, ""they scream my weaknesses and whisper my accomplishments"" like pffff I mean that moment for me is just like, that's what, I mean I love that about him that he's totally open in the sense."
Kanye,"I mean yea, that element is great. There's a lot of people that can't rap that can do that. But the main thing is that fact that he's delivering you know a level of product as I said last interview, I'm a product guy and he's delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality. It works. 80% of the time works all the time!"
Interviewer,That doesn't make sense!
Kanye,"Haha, but it works. It works. You know what I'm saying. And you have to. it works. That's it. And I was just thinking like, I don't have any advice for this young man, but what I can say is run. Fly. Go as fast as you can. Don't stop. And you know any time I can be of any service, advice, you know a beat, verse, you know whatever you need. You need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over at the other company, I'm not supposed to say that! You know anything that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a team. You know, not just me and him. Us all."
Interviewer,"Thanks man. I always love talking with you bro, I really do. Alright we're good."
Kanye,Got some vibes? Bars?
Interviewer,Bars!
Kanye,More bars!
