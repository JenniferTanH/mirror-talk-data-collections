Interviewer,The following is a conversation with jack dorsey co-founder and ceo of twitter and founder and ceo of square.
Dorsey,Given the happenings at the time related to twitter leadership and the very limited time we had we decided to focus.
Interviewer,This conversation on square and some broader philosophical topics and to save an in-depth conversation on engineering.
Dorsey,At ai and twitter for second appearance in this podcast this conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the.
Interviewer,Pandemic for everyone feeling the medical psychological and financial burden of this crisis.
Dorsey,I'm sending love your way stay strong we're in this together we'll beat this thing as an aside let me.
Interviewer,Mention the jack moved 1 billion dollars square equity which is 28% of his wealth to form an organization that funds kovin.
Dorsey,19 relief first as andrew yang tweeted this is a spectacular commitment and second it is amazing that it operates.
Interviewer,Transparently by posting all its donations to a single google doc to me true transparency is simple and this is.
Dorsey,As simple as it gets this is the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube review it.
Interviewer,With five stars an apple podcast supported on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter and lex friedman.
Dorsey,Spelled fri d ma n as usual i'll do a few minutes of as now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of.
Interviewer,The conversation i hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience this show is presented by.
Dorsey,Masterclass sign up on master class comm slash flex to get a discount and to support this podcast when i first heard.
Interviewer,About masterclass i thought it was too good to be true for $180 a year you get an all-access pass to watch courses from.
Dorsey,To list some of my favorites chris hadfield on space exploration neil degrasse tyson and scientific thinking.
Interviewer,Communication will write creator of sim city and sims both one of my favorite games on game design jane goodall on.
Dorsey,Conservation carlos santana on guitar on my favorite guitar players gary kasparov on chess daniel negreanu on poker and.
Interviewer,Many many more chris hadfield explaining caracas work and the experience of being.
Dorsey,Launched into space alone is worth the money for me the key is to not be overwhelmed by the abundance of choice.
Interviewer,Pick three courses you want to complete watch each all the way through it's not that long but it's an experience that.
Dorsey,Will stick with you for a long time it's easily worth the money you can watch it on basically any device once again sign.
Interviewer,Up on master class comm / lex to get a discount and to support the spot cast and now here's my conversation with jack.
Dorsey,Dorsey you've been on several podcasts joe rogan sam harris rich roll others excellent conversations but i think.
Interviewer,There's several topics that you didn't talk about that i think of fascinating that i love to talk to you about sort of.
Dorsey,Machine learning artificial intelligence both the the narrow kind and the general kind and engineering at scale so there's.
Interviewer,A lot of incredible engineering going on the year part of crypto cryptocurrency a blockchain ubi all kinds of.
Dorsey,Philosophical questions maybe we'll get to while life and death and meaning and beauty so you're involved in building.
Interviewer,Some of the biggest network systems in the world sort of trillions and interactions a day the cool thing about.
Dorsey,That is the infrastructure the engineering scale you started as a programmer with c by building yeah so.
Interviewer,I'm a hacker i'm not really an engineer not not a legit software engineer and i'm a tracker at heart but to achieve.
Dorsey,Scale you have to do some unfortunately legit large-scale engineering so how do you make that magic happen hire people.
Interviewer,That i can learn from number one i mean i'm a hacker in the sense that i you know my approach has always been do.
Dorsey,Whatever it takes to make it work so that i can see and feel the thing and then learn what needs to come next and.
Interviewer,Oftentimes what needs to come next is a matter of being able to bring it to more people which is scale and there's a lot.
Dorsey,Of great people out there that either have experience or are extremely fast learners.
Interviewer,That we've been lucky enough to find and with for four years but i think a lot of it we benefit a ton from the open source.
Dorsey,Community and just all the learnings there that are laid bare in the open all the mistakes all the success all the.
Interviewer,Problems it's a very slow-moving process usually open source but it's very deliberate and you get to see because of.
Dorsey,The the pace you get to see what it takes to really build something meaningful so i learned most most of.
Interviewer,Everything i learned about hacking and programming and engineering has been due to open source and and the the.
Dorsey,Generosity that people have given to give up their time sacrificer time without any expectation in return other.
Interviewer,Than being a part of something much larger than themselves yeah just great open-source movement is amazing but if.
Dorsey,You just look at the scale like square has to take care of is this a fundamentally a software problem or.
Interviewer,Hardware problem you mentioned hiring a bunch of people but said it's not maybe from our perspective not often talked.
Dorsey,About how incredible that is to sort of have a system that doesn't go down often that secure is able to take care of all.
Interviewer,These transactions like maybe i'm i'm also a hacker at heart and it's incredible to me that that kind of scale.
Dorsey,Could be achieved is there some insight some lessons some interesting tidbits that you can say about how to make that.
Interviewer,Scale happen is it the hardware fundamentally challenge is it a software challenge is it like is it a social.
Dorsey,Challenge of building large teams of engineers that work together that kind of thing that quotes is there what's the.
Interviewer,Interesting challenges there by the way you're the best russ hacker i've ever met i think thank you both if the.
Dorsey,Enumeration you just went through i don't think there's one you have to kind of focus on all and the ability to focus.
Interviewer,On all that really comes down to how you these problems and whether you can break them down into parts that you can focus.
Dorsey,On because i think the biggest mistake is trying to solve or address too many at once or not going deep enough with.
Interviewer,The questions or not being critical of the answers you find or not form not taking the time to form credible.
Dorsey,Hypotheses that you can actually test and you can see the result of so all of those fall in the face of ultimately.
Interviewer,Critical thinking skills problem-solving skills and if there's one skill i want to improve every day it's that that's.
Dorsey,That's what contributes to learning and the only way we can evolve any of these things is learning what is currently.
Interviewer,Doing and and how to take it to the next the next step and questioning assumptions the first principle is kind.
Dorsey,Of thinking it seems like the fundamentals this whole process yeah but if you get to overextend it into well.
Interviewer,This is a hardware issue you miss all the software solutions and you know vice versa if you focus too much on the.
Dorsey,Software there are hardware solutions that can 10x the thing so i i try to resist the categories of thinking and.
Interviewer,Look for the underlying systems that make all these things work but those only emerge when you have a skill around.
Dorsey,Creative creative thinking problem-solving and being able to ask critical questions and having the.
Interviewer,Patience to like go deep so one of the amazing things if you look at the mission of square is to increase.
Dorsey,People's access to the economy maybe maybe you can correct me if i'm wrong that's from my perspective so from the.
Interviewer,Perspective of merchants peer-to-peer payments even crypto cryptocurrency digital cryptocurrency what do you see.
Dorsey,As the major ways our society can increase but this patient in the economy so if we look at.
Interviewer,Today in the next 10 years next 20 years you going to africa maybe in africa and all kinds of other places outside in.
Dorsey,North america if there was one word that i think represents what we're trying to do at square it's it is that word access.
Interviewer,One of the things we found is that we weren't expecting this at all when we started we thought were just building a.
Dorsey,A piece of hardware to enable people to plug it into their phone and swipe credit card and then as we talked with.
Interviewer,People who actually tried to accept credit cards in the past we found a consistent theme which many of them.
Dorsey,Weren't even enabled and enabled but allowed to process credit cards and we dug a little bit deeper again asking.
Interviewer,That question and we found that a lot of them would go to banks or these merchants acquirers and waiting for them.
Dorsey,Was a credit check and looking at a fico score and many of the businesses that we talked to and many small businesses they.
Interviewer,Don't have good credit or a credit history they're entrepreneurs were just getting started.
Dorsey,Taking a lot of personal risk financial risk and it just felt ridiculous to us that for for for the for the job of.
Interviewer,Being able to accept money from people you had to get your credit checked and as we dug deeper we realized that that.
Dorsey,Wasn't the intention of the financial industry but it's the only tool they had available to them to understand.
Interviewer,Authenticity intent predictor of future behavior so that's the first thing we actually looked at and that's where the.
Dorsey,You know we built the hardware but the software really came in terms of risk modeling and that's when we started down.
Interviewer,The path that eventually leads to ai we started with a very strong data science discipline because we knew that our.
Dorsey,Business was not necessarily about making hardware it was more about enabling more people to come into the.
Interviewer,System so the fundamental challenge there is so to enable more people to come into the system you have to lower.
Dorsey,The barrier of checking that that person would be a legitimate vendor is that the fundamental problem yeah and a different.
Interviewer,Mindset i think a lot of the financial industry had a mindset of kind of .
Dorsey,Distrust and just constantly looking for opportunities to prove why people shouldn't get into the system whereas we.
Interviewer,Took on a mindset of trust and then verify verify verify verify verify so we moved you know when we when we entered.
Dorsey,The space only about thirty to forty percent of the people who apply to accept credit cards would actually get.
Interviewer,Through the system we took that number than 99% and that's because we reframe the problem we built.
Dorsey,Credible models and we had this mindset of we're going to watch not at the merchant level but we're going to watch.
Interviewer,At the transaction level so come in perform some transactions and as long as you're doing things that feel high.
Dorsey,Integrity credible and don't look suspicious we'll continue to to serve you if we see any interestingness in how.
Interviewer,You use our system that will be bubbled up to people to review to figure out if there's something nefarious going on and.
Dorsey,That's when we might ask you to leave so the change in the mindset led to the technology that we needed to enable more.
Interviewer,People to get there and to enable more people to access system what uh what role does machine learning.
Dorsey,Play into that in that context of you said first of all that's a beautiful shift anytime you shift your viewpoint.
Interviewer,Into seeing that people are fundamentally good and then you just have to.
Dorsey,Verify and catch the ones who are not as opposed to assuming everybody's bad this is a beautiful thing so what role does.
Interviewer,The to you throughout the history of the company has machine learning played in doing.
Dorsey,That verification it was it was a media i mean we weren't calling it machine learning but it was data science and.
Interviewer,Then as the industry evolved machine learning became more of the nomenclature and and as that evolved it became more.
Dorsey,Sophisticated with deep learning and as i continues continues to evolve it'll be nobody another thing but they're all in.
Interviewer,The same vein but we built that discipline up within the first year of the company because we also had you know.
Dorsey,We have to we had to partner with a bank we had to partner with visa mastercard and we had to show that by bringing more.
Interviewer,People into the system that we could do so in a responsible way that would not compromise their systems and that they.
Dorsey,Would trust us how do you convince this upstart company with some cool machine learning tricks is able to deliver on.
Interviewer,The sort of a trustworthy set of merchants we we stage it out in tears we had a bucket of you know five hundred.
Dorsey,People using it and then we showed results in a thousand and then ten thousand that fifty thousand and then.
Interviewer,The constraint was left was lifted so again it's it's kind of you know getting something tangible out there i want to.
Dorsey,Show what we can do rather than talk about it and that put a lot of pressure on us to do the right things and it also.
Interviewer,Created a culture of accountability of a little bit more transparency and i think incentivized all of our early folks and.
Dorsey,The company in the right way so what does the future look like in terms of increasing people's access or if you.
Interviewer,Look at io t internet of things there's more and more intelligent devices you can see there's some people even talking.
Dorsey,About our personal data as a thing that we could monetize more explicitly versus implicitly sort of everything can become.
Interviewer,Part of the economy you see so what what is the future of square look like instead of giving.
Dorsey,People access in all kinds of ways to being part of the economy as merchants and as consumers i believe that the.
Interviewer,Currency we use is is a huge part of the answer and i believe that the internet deserves and requires a native currency.
Dorsey,And that's why i'm i'm such a huge believer in in bitcoin because it just our our biggest problem is a company.
Interviewer,Right now is we cannot act like an internet company opened a new market we have to have a partnership with local.
Dorsey,Bank we have to pay attention to different regulatory onboarding environments and a digital currency like.
Interviewer,Bitcoin takes in a bunch of that away where we can potentially launch a product in every single market around.
Dorsey,The world because they're all using the same currency and we we have consistent.
Interviewer,Understanding of regulation and onboarding and-and-and what that means so i think you know the the internet.
Dorsey,Continuing to be accessible to people is number one and then i think currency is is number two and it will just allow for.
Interviewer,A lot more innovation a lot more speed in terms of what we can build and others can build and it's just it's just really.
Dorsey,Exciting so i mean i would i want to be able to see that and feel that in my lifetime so.
Interviewer,In this aspect in other aspects you have a deep interest in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger tech in general i.
Dorsey,Talked to metallic butterman yesterday on this podcast he says hi by the way hey he's a brilliant brilliant person.
Interviewer,Talking a lot about bitcoin and aetherium of course so can you maybe linger on this point what what do you.
Dorsey,Find appealing about bitcoin about digital currency where do you see it going in the next 10 20 years and what.
Interviewer,Are some of the challenges with respect to square but also just bigger far for a globally.
Dorsey,Farah world for the way we we think about money i i think the most beautiful thing about it is there's no one person.
Interviewer,Setting the direction and there's no one person on the other side that can stop it so we have something that is pretty.
Dorsey,Organic in nature and very principled in its original design and i you know i think the bitcoin white paper is one of.
Interviewer,The most seminal works of computer science in the last 20 30 years it's it's poetry i mean it's a really cool.
Dorsey,Technology i mean that's not often talked about sort of there's so much sort of hype around digital currency.
Interviewer,About the financial impacts of it but the actual technology is quite beautiful from a computer science perspective yeah.
Dorsey,And the underlying principles behind it that went into it even to the point of releasing it under a pseudonym i think.
Interviewer,That's a very very powerful statement the timing of when it was released is powerful it was it was a total activist.
Dorsey,Move i mean it's it's moving the world forward and in a way that i think is extremely noble and honorable and.
Interviewer,Enables everyone to be part of the story which is also really cool so you ask the question around 10 years in 20 years i.
Dorsey,Mean i think the amazing thing is no one knows and it can emerge and every person that comes into the ecosystem whether.
Interviewer,They be a developer or someone who uses it can change its direction in small and large ways and that's what i think it.
Dorsey,Should because that's what the the internet has shown is possible now there's complications with that of.
Interviewer,Course and there's you know certainly companies that own large ports so the you know net and conducted more than.
Dorsey,Others and there's not equal access to every single person in the world just yet but all those problems are visible.
Interviewer,Enough to speak about them and to me that gives confidence that they're solvable in a relatively short timeframe.
Dorsey,I think the world changes a lot as we get these satellites projecting the internet down down earth because it.
Interviewer,Just removes a bunch of the former constraints and and really levels the playing field but a global currency.
Dorsey,Which a native currency for the internet is a proxy for is a very powerful concept and i don't think any one person.
Interviewer,On this planet truly understands the ramifications of that i think there's a lot of positives to it there's some.
Dorsey,Negatives as well but i think it's possible sorry to interrupt do you think it's possible that this kind of digital.
Interviewer,Currency would redefine the nature of money so become the main currency of the world as opposed to being tied to fiat.
Dorsey,Currency of different nations and to really push the decentralization of control of money definitely but i think.
Interviewer,The the bigger ramification is how it affects how society works and i think there were there there are many positive.
Dorsey,Ramifications outside around money just outside of just money money money is a foundational layer that enables so.
Interviewer,Much more i was meeting with an entrepreneur in ethiopia and payments is probably the number one problem to solve.
Dorsey,Across a continent both in terms of moving money across borders between nations on the continent.
Interviewer,Or the amount of corruption within the current system but the lack of easy ways to pay people makes starting anything.
Dorsey,Really difficult i met an entrepreneur who started the the lyft / uber of ethiopia and one of the biggest problems.
Interviewer,She has is that it's not easy for her writers to pay the company it's not easy for her to pay the drivers and that.
Dorsey,Definitely has stunted her growth and made everything more challenging so the fact that she's she even has to think.
Interviewer,About payments instead of thinking about the best writer experience and the best driver experience is is pretty telling.
Dorsey,So i think as we get a more durable resilient and global standard we see a lot more innovation.
Interviewer,Everywhere and i think there's no better case study for this than the various countries with and within africa and and.
Dorsey,Their entrepreneurs who are trying to start things within health or sustainability or transportation or a.
Interviewer,Lot of the companies that we've seen that we've seen here so the majority of companies i met in november when i spent.
Dorsey,A month on the continent were payments oriented you mentioned there's a small tangent you mentioned the anonymous.
Interviewer,Launch of bitcoin is a sort of profound philosophical statement sudama's what's that even means there's a pseudonym for.
Dorsey,Said there's an identity tied to it it's not just anonymous it's a nakamoto so a nakamoto might represent one person or.
Interviewer,Multiple people but let me ask are you satoshi nakamoto just just checking thank you i wear what i tell you yes.
Dorsey,Sure um but maybe you slip a pseudonym is constructed identity anonymity is just kind of as you know ran random like.
Interviewer,Drop something off and leave there's no intention to build an identity around it and well the identity being built was a.
Dorsey,Short time window it was meant to stick around i think and to be known and it's being honored in you know how the.
Interviewer,Community thinks about building out like the concept of satoshi toshi's for instance is one such an example but i.
Dorsey,Think it was smart not to do it anonymous not to do it as a real identity but to do it as soon an mb.
Interviewer,Because i think it builds tangibility and a little bit of empathy that this was a human or a set of humans behind it.
Dorsey,And there's there's this natural identity that i can imagine but there is also sacrifice of an ego that's a pretty.
Interviewer,Powerful thing from beautiful would you do sort of philosophically to ask you the question would you do.
Dorsey,All the same things you're doing now if your name wasn't attached to it sort of if if you had to sacrifice the ego put.
Interviewer,Another way is your ego deeply tied in the decisions you've been making i hope not i mean i i believe i would certainly.
Dorsey,Attempt to do the things without my name having to be attached with it but it's hard to do that in a corporation legally.
Interviewer,That's the issue if i were to do more open-source things then absolutely like i don't don't need my particular.
Dorsey,Identity my real identity associated with it but i think you know the appreciation that comes from doing.
Interviewer,Something good and being able to see it and see people use it is is pretty overwhelming and powerful more so than.
Dorsey,Maybe seeing your name in the in the headlines let's talk about artificial intelligence a little bit if we could 70.
Interviewer,Years ago alan turing formulated the turing test to me natural language is one of the most interesting spaces of.
Dorsey,Problems that are tackled by artificial intelligence it's the canonical problem of what it means to be intelligent he.
Interviewer,Formulated as the turing test me ask sort of the broad question how hard do you think is it to pass the turing test.
Dorsey,In the space of language just from a very practical standpoint i think where we are now and and for at least years.
Interviewer,Out is one where the artificial intelligence machine learning the deep learning models can bubble up.
Dorsey,Interestingness very very quickly and pair that with human discretion around severity around depth around.
Interviewer,Nuance and and meaning i think for me the chasm the cross for general intelligences to be able to explain why.
Dorsey,And the meaning behind something behind a decision mm-hmm for being behind the decision so we got a sub so.
Interviewer,Delta so the explained ability part is kind of essential to be able to explain using natural language why the decisions.
Dorsey,Were made that kind of thing yeah i mean i think that's one of our biggest risk and artificial intelligence going.
Interviewer,Forward is we are building a lot of black boxes that can't necessarily explain why they made a decision or what.
Dorsey,Criteria they used to make the decision and we're trusting them more and more from lending decisions to content.
Interviewer,Recommendation to driving to health like you know a lot of us have watches that tell us to understand how was it.
Dorsey,Deciding that i mean that that one's pretty pretty simple but you can imagine how complex they get and being able to.
Interviewer,Explain the reasoning behind some of those recommendations seems to be an essential part although it's a very hard.
Dorsey,Problem because sometimes even we can't explain why we make this that's what i was i think we're being us sometimes a.
Interviewer,Little bit unfair for to artificial intelligence systems because we're not very good at these some of these things.
Dorsey,Do you think a project for the ridiculous romanticized question but on that line.
Interviewer,Of thought do you think we'll ever be able to build a system like in the movie her that you could fall in love with so.
Dorsey,Have that kind of deep connection with hasn't that already happened hasn't someone in japan fallen in love with.
Interviewer,This who's ai there's always going to be somebody that does that kind of thing i mean at a much larger scale of actually.
Dorsey,Building relationships of being deeper connections it doesn't have to be love but it just deeper connections with.
Interviewer,Artificial intelligence systems you mentioned explained it there's lots of function of the artificial.
Dorsey,Intelligence and more a function of the individual and how they find meaning and where they find meaning do you think we.
Interviewer,Humans can find meaning in technology in this kind of way yeah 100 percent 1 percent and i don't necessarily think.
Dorsey,It's a negative but i you know it's it's constantly going to evolve so i don't know but i meaning is is something.
Interviewer,That's entirely subjective and i i don't think it's going to be a function of finding the magic algorithm.
Dorsey,That enables everyone to love it but maybe but that question really gets that the difference between human and machine.
Interviewer,The you had a little bit of an exchange with elon musk basically i mean it's a trivial version of that but i think.
Dorsey,There's a more fundamental question of is it possible to tell the difference between a bot and a human and do you.
Interviewer,Think it's if we look into the future 10 20 years out do you think it would be possible or is it even necessary to tell.
Dorsey,The difference in the digital space between a human and a robot can we have fulfilling relationships with each or do.
Interviewer,We need to tell the difference between them i think it's certainly useful and certain problem domains to be able to.
Dorsey,Tell the difference i think in others it might not be as useful i think it's possible for us today tell that.
Interviewer,Difference as the reverse the meta of the turing test well what's interesting is i think the technology to create is.
Dorsey,Moving much faster than the technology to detect you think so so if you look at like adversarial machine learning.
Interviewer,There's a lot of systems that try to fool machine learning systems and at least for me the hope is that the.
Dorsey,Technology to defend will always be right there at least your sense is that i don't know if they'll be right there i.
Interviewer,Mean it's it's a race right so the detection technologies have to be 2 or 10 steps ahead of the creation.
Dorsey,Technologies this is a problem that i think the financial industry will face more and more because a lot of our risk.
Interviewer,Models for instance are built around identity payments ultimately comes down to identity and you can imagine a world.
Dorsey,Where all this conversation around deep fakes goes towards the direction of driver's license or passports or state.
Interviewer,Identities and people construct identities in order to get through a system such as ours to start.
Dorsey,Accepting credit cards or into the cash shop and those technologies seem to be moving very very quickly our ability to.
Interviewer,Detect them i think is probably lagging at this point but certainly with more focus we can get ahead of it but this is.
Dorsey,Going to touch everything so i think it's it's it's like security and we're never going to be able to build a.
Interviewer,Perfect detection system we're only going to be able to you know what we should be focused on this is the speed.
Dorsey,Of evolving it and being able to take signals that show correctness or errors as quickly as possible and move and to.
Interviewer,Be able to build that into our newer models or the or the self learning models you have other worries like some.
Dorsey,People like elon and others have worries of existential threats of artificial intelligence of artificial general.
Interviewer,Intelligence or if you think more narrowly of all threats and concerns about more narrow artificial.
Dorsey,Intelligence like what are your thoughts in this domain do you have concerns are you more optimistic i think you've all.
Interviewer,And his in this book 21 boilin lessons for the 21st century yeah his last chapters around meditation and you look.
Dorsey,At the title of the chapter and you're like oh it's kind of old meditation but the was interesting about that chapter.
Interviewer,Is he believes that you know kids being born today growing up today google has a stronger sense of their preferences than.
Dorsey,They do which you can easily imagine i can easily imagine today that google probably knows my preference is more.
Interviewer,Than my mother does maybe not me per se but for someone growing up only knowing you know not only knowing what google is.
Dorsey,Capable of or facebook or twitter or square or any of these things the self-awareness is being offloaded to.
Interviewer,Other systems and particularly these these algorithms and his concern is that we lose that self-awareness because the.
Dorsey,Self-awareness is now outside of us and it's doing such a better job at helping us direct our decisions around should i.
Interviewer,Stand should i walk today what doctor should i choose who should i date all these things were now seeing play out.
Dorsey,Very quickly so he sees meditation as a tool to build the self awareness and to bring the focus back on why do i make.
Interviewer,These decisions why do i react in this way why did i have this thought where did that come from.
Dorsey,That's the way to regain control or awareness maybe not control but put awareness so that you can be aware that.
Interviewer,Yes i am offloading this decision to this algorithm that i don't fully understand and can't tell me why it's.
Dorsey,Doing the things that's doing because it's so complex that's not to say that the algorithm can't be a good thing and.
Interviewer,To me recommender systems the best of what they can do is to help guide you on a journey of learning new ideas of.
Dorsey,Learning period it can be a great thing but do you know you're doing that are you aware that you're inviting it to do.
Interviewer,That to you i think that's that's a little risky identifies right is that's perfectly okay but are you aware that.
Dorsey,You have that invitation and it's it's being acted upon and so that that's your that's a concern you're kind of.
Interviewer,Highlighting that without a lack of awareness you can just be like floating at sea so awareness is key in just the.
Dorsey,Future these artificial intelligence systems in the other movie wall-e well richard i think is one of pixar's best.
Interviewer,Movies besides ratatouille right you had me until the ratatouille okay that error is.
Dorsey,Incredible all right we've come to the first point where we disagree okay the entrepreneurial story in the.
Interviewer,Form of a wrath mm-hmm i just remember just the soundtrack was really good so excellent.
Dorsey,What are your thoughts sticking on artificial intelligence a little bit about the displacement of jobs that's.
Interviewer,Another perspective that candidates like andrew yang talked about in getting forever yang yang so he unfortunately.
Dorsey,Speaking of yang yang has recently dropped out i know it was very disappointing and depressing.
Interviewer,Yeah but the on the positive side he's i think launching a podcast so really cool yeah that's he just announced that i'm.
Dorsey,Sure he'll try to talk you into trying to come on to the podcast so about reddit tori yeah maybe he'll be more.
Interviewer,Welcoming of the ratatouille argument what are your thoughts on his concerns of the displacement of jobs of.
Dorsey,Automations of the of course there's positive impacts that could come from automation in the eye and but there.
Interviewer,Could also be negative impacts and within that framework what are your thoughts about universal basic income so.
Dorsey,These interesting new ideas of how we can empower people in the economy i i think he was a hundred percent right on.
Interviewer,Almost every dimension we see this in squares business i mean he identified truck drivers i'm from missouri and he.
Dorsey,Certainly pointed to the concern and the issue that people from where i'm from feel every single day that is often.
Interviewer,Invisible and not talked about enough you know the next big one is cashiers this is where it pertains to squares.
Dorsey,Business we are seeing more and more of the point-of-sale moved to the individual customers hand in the form of.
Interviewer,Their phone and apps and pre-order and order ahead we're seeing more kiosks we're seeing more things like amazon go.
Dorsey,And the number of workers in as a cashier and rito's immense and you know there's there's no real answers on how.
Interviewer,They transform their skills and and work and into something else and i think that.
Dorsey,Does lead to a lot of really negative ramifications and the important point that he brought up around universal.
Interviewer,Basic income is given that this shift is going to come and given it's going to take time to set people up with new.
Dorsey,"Skills and new careers they need to have a floor to be able to survive and this $1,000 a month is such a floor."
Interviewer,It's not going to incentivize you to quit your job because it's not enough but it will enable you to not have to.
Dorsey,Worry as much about just getting on day to day so that you can focus on what i'm what am i going to do now and what am i.
Interviewer,Going to what skills do i need to acquire and i think i think that you know a lot of people point to the fact.
Dorsey,That you know during the industrial age we we had the same concerns around automation factory lines and everything.
Interviewer,Worked out okay but the the biggest change is just the velocity and the centralization of a lot.
Dorsey,Of the things that make this work which is the data and the algorithms that work on this on this data i think the the.
Interviewer,Second biggest scary thing is just how around ai is just who actually owns the data and who can operate on it and are.
Dorsey,We able to share the insights from the data so that we can also build algorithms that help our needs or help.
Interviewer,Our business or what not so that's where i think regulation could play a strong and positive part first looking at the.
Dorsey,Primitives of ai and the tools we use to build these services that will ultimately touch every single aspect of.
Interviewer,The human experience and then how data where data is owned and how its how its shared so those those are the answers.
Dorsey,That as a society as a world we need to have better answers around which we're currently not they're just way too.
Interviewer,Centralized into a few very very large companies but i think he was spot-on with identifying the problem and.
Dorsey,Proposing solutions that would actually work at least that we'd learn from that you could expand or evolve but i mean.
Interviewer,It's i think it's ubi is well well past its it's do i mean it was certainly trumpeted by martin luther king and even.
Dorsey,Even before him as well and like you said like you know the exact thousand dollar mark might be might not be the.
Interviewer,Correct one but you should take the stuffs to try to to implement these solutions and see see what works so i.
Dorsey,Think you and i eat some more diets and at least i was the first time i've heard this yeah so i was doing it first time.
Interviewer,Anyone has said that to me yeah but it's becoming more and more cool and but i was doing it before was cool.
Dorsey,So the intermittent fasting and fasting in general i really enjoyed i love food but i enjoy the the i also love.
Interviewer,Suffering because i'm russian so fasting kind of makes you appreciate makes you appreciate what it is to be human.
Dorsey,Somehow so but i have a outside the philosophical stuff i have a more specific question it also helps me as a.
Interviewer,Programmer and a deep thinker like stifling that from a scientific perspective to sit there for many hours.
Dorsey,And focus deeply maybe you were a hacker before you were ceo what have you learned about diet lifestyle mindset.
Interviewer,That helps you maximize mental performance to be able to focus for this thing deeply in this world of.
Dorsey,Distractions i think i just took it for granted for too long which aspect just a social structure of we eat three.
Interviewer,And there's snacks in between and i just never really asked the question why oh by the way in case people don't know i.
Dorsey,Think a lot of people know who you you at least you famously eat once a day yeah you still eat once a day yep.
Interviewer,Sooner by the way what made you decide to eat once a day like cuz to me that was a huge revolution that you don't.
Dorsey,Have to eat breakfast that was like i felt like i was a rebel like i yeah like abandoned my parents or something and it.
Interviewer,Doesn't an artist when you when you first like the first week you start doing it feels you kind of like have a.
Dorsey,Superpower yeah then you realize it's not really a superpower but it i think you realize at least i realize like it.
Interviewer,Just how much is how much our mind dictates what we're possible of and and sometimes we have structures around us.
Dorsey,The incentivize like you know there's three may thing which was purely social structure versus necessity for our.
Interviewer,Health and for our bodies and i i did it just i started doing it because i played a lot with my diet when i was a kid and.
Dorsey,I was vegan for two years and just went all over the place just because i you know a health is the most precious thing.
Interviewer,We have and none of us really understand it so being able asked the question through experiments that i can perform.
Dorsey,On myself and learn about i is compelling to me and i heard this one guy on the podcast wim hof who's famous.
Interviewer,For doing ice baths and holding his breath and all these things he said he only eats one meal a day i'm like wow.
Dorsey,That sounds super challenging and comfortable i'm gonna do it so i i just i learned the most when i make myself i.
Interviewer,Want to say suffer but when i make myself feel uncomfortable because everything comes to bear in those.
Dorsey,Moments and and you really learn what your what you're about or what you're not so i been doing that my whole life.
Interviewer,Like when i was a kid i could not like i could not speak like i had to go to a speech therapist and it made me.
Dorsey,Extremely shy and then one day i realized i can't keep doing this and i signed up for the for the speech club.
Interviewer,And you know it was a the most uncomfortable thing i could imagine doing getting a topic on a note card.
Dorsey,Having five minutes to write a speech about whatever that topic is not being able to use the note card while speaking.
Interviewer,And speaking for five minutes about that topic so but it just it puts so much it gave me so much perspective around the.
Dorsey,Power of communication around my own deficiencies and around if i set my mind to do something i'll do it so it gave me.
Interviewer,A lot more confidence so i see fasting in the same light this is something that was interesting challenging.
Dorsey,Uncomfortable and has given me so much learning and benefit as a result and it will lead to other things that i.
Interviewer,Experiment with and play with but um yeah it does feel a little bit like a superpower sometimes the most boring.
Dorsey,Superpower one can imagine no it's quite incredible the clarity of mind is it's pretty interesting.
Interviewer,Speaking of suffering you kind of talk about facing difficult ideas you meditate you think about the broad.
Dorsey,Context of life of our society let me ask sort of apologize again for the romanticized question but do you ponder.
Interviewer,Your own mortality do you think about death about the finiteness of human existence when you meditate when you.
Dorsey,Think about it and if you do what how do you make sense of it that this thing ends well i don't try to make sense of.
Interviewer,It i do think about it every day i mean it's it's a daily multiple times a day any afraid of death no i'm not afraid of.
Dorsey,It i i think it it's a transformation i don't know to what but it's also a tool.
Interviewer,To feel the importance of every moment so i just use as a reminder like i have an.
Dorsey,Hour is this really what i'm going to spend the hour doing like i only have so many.
Interviewer,More sunsets and sunrises to watch like i'm not going to get up for it i'm not going to make sure that i that i that i.
Dorsey,Try to see it so it's it just puts a lot into perspective and it helps me prioritize i think it's i don't i don't.
Interviewer,See it as something that's like that i dread or is dreadful it it's a it's a tool that is available to every single.
Dorsey,Person to use every day because it shows how precious life is and there's reminders every single day whether it be.
Interviewer,Your own health or a friend or a co-worker or something you see in the news so it's to me it's just a question.
Dorsey,Of what we do with that daily reminder and for me it's um am i really focused on what matters and sometimes that might.
Interviewer,Be work sometimes that might be friendships or family or relationships or whatnot but that that's it's the.
Dorsey,Ultimate clarifier in that sense so on the question of what matters another ridiculously big question of once you.
Interviewer,Try to make sense of it what do you think is the meaning of it all the meaning of life.
Dorsey,What gives you purpose happiness meaning a lot does i mean i mean just being able to be aware of the fact that i'm alive.
Interviewer,Is pretty pretty meaningful the connections i feel with individuals whether they people i just meet or long.
Dorsey,Lasting friendships or my family is meaningful seeing people use something that i helped build it is really.
Interviewer,Meaningful and powerful to me but but that sense of i mean i think ultimately comes down in a sense of connection and.
Dorsey,Just feeling like i am bigger i am part of something that's bigger than myself and like i can feel it directly in small.
Interviewer,Ways or large ways however manifest this is probably uh it's probably a last question do you.
Dorsey,Think we're living in a simulation i don't know it's a pretty fun one if we are but also crazy and random and.
Interviewer,Brought with tons of problems but yeah would you have it any other way yeah i mean i just think it's taken us.
Dorsey,Way too long to as a planet to realize we're all in this together and we all are connected in in in very significant.
Interviewer,Ways i think we we hide our connectivity very well through ego through you know whatever or whatever it is of the day.
Dorsey,But that is the one thing i would want to work towards changing and that's how i would have it another way because if.
Interviewer,If we can't do that then how we're going to connect to all the other simulations because that's the next step is like.
Dorsey,What's happening in the other simulation escaping this one and yeah spanning across the multiple simulations and.
Interviewer,Sharing it and on the fun i don't think there's a better way to end it jack thank you so much for all the work you.
Dorsey,Do there's probably other ways that we've ended this and other simulations that may have been better well that's a.
Interviewer,Wait and see thanks so much for talking to thank you thanks for listening to this.
Dorsey,Conversation with jack dorsey and thank you to our sponsor masterclass please consider supporting this podcast by.
Interviewer,Signing up to master class at master class comm / flex if you enjoy this podcast subscribe on youtube review it.
Dorsey,With five stars an apple podcast supporting our patreon are simply connect with me on twitter at lex.
Interviewer,Friedman and now let me leave you some words about bitcoin from paul graham i'm very intrigued by bitcoin it has all the.
Dorsey,Signs of a paradigm shift hackers love it yet it is described as a toy just like microcomputers thank you.
Interviewer,For listening and hope to see you next time  .
Interviewer,I am so excited to be here with jim mckelvey and jack dorsey square's two co-founders to talk about.
Dorsey,Um all things square and how it started what the origination was.
Interviewer,And how we're thinking about the developer community so for those of you who don't know.
Dorsey,Square started because jim who owns a glassblowing factory uh was unable to process a payment and.
Interviewer,Was really bothered by that understandably about losing customers and started pairing up with his pal.
Dorsey,Jack and they came up with this solution um so i'd love to hear from the two of you.
Interviewer,Um how you first connected before square even was born so um jack came to work for me.
Dorsey,At a company that i actually still have um but at the time we were uh very poorly.
Interviewer,Managed and supplemented our bad management with his uh mother's product which was uh.
Dorsey,Chocolate covered coffee beans which we would chew up and uh keep the staff awake so marcia.
Interviewer,Dorsey was effectively our dealer um and we found one day that her son liked computers that's all we knew.
Dorsey,And so my partner invited john invited jack to come over to work with us and he happened to show.
Interviewer,Up in the middle of this chaotic mess and uh pulled an all-nighter with us the first night.
Dorsey,So we sent him home at five in the morning and i guess i'll let jack finish the story since i think it goes on from.
Interviewer,There well i got yelled at by my mom she um she hated jim um cursed his name.
Dorsey,To this day but has forgiven him for some things but no i might.
Interviewer,My parents always encouraged me to follow my own path and competing was one one big part of.
Dorsey,That and uh jim's company and that work was a great way for me to experience.
Interviewer,What i ultimately wanted to do which was programming and i was super early in the programming computers at that.
Dorsey,Point another story some of you may not know is square's very first customer.
Interviewer,Was a woman named sherry who owned lily bell flowers in san francisco and when jack and jim finally had a.
Dorsey,Prototype for their hardware they approached her at a market and asked her if she wanted to try it out.
Interviewer,Uh taking credit card payments she showed a little bit of hesitancy and wasn't quite sure but just as they were.
Dorsey,Having that conversation a customer a potential customer walked up to her um and said that he didn't.
Interviewer,Have any cash but he would go get someone come back and so they waited around and waited around and lo and.
Dorsey,Behold the customer never returned and so that really.
Interviewer,Helped just fuel even more so the need to create this hardware and provide this to.
Dorsey,Sellers who are trying to capture every type of payment um so i'd really love to hear how does.
Interviewer,This kind of customer centricity lead to innovation well i it wasn't one time that we did that like.
Dorsey,We went on a cherry multiple times um and asked her if she would try or work on and she.
Interviewer,Repeatedly said no um until the point when she lost the sale and that was the biggest insight we we.
Dorsey,Originally thought that we were building a credit card reader that plugged in the.
Interviewer,Phone and had an easy app that got you to the visa or mastercard or.
Dorsey,Acquiring gateway but ultimately what we learned in that moment and it we didn't i don't think we.
Interviewer,Realized it in that moment but what we learned over time was it wasn't about building.
Dorsey,The credit card reader is about making the sale helping installer make the sale if we.
Interviewer,Focused only on building a little plastic device that plugged into the headphone jack and built some.
Dorsey,Software around that would be a very very small not very impactful company but because we focused on a deeper.
Interviewer,Problem which was how do we help us all and make the sale in the first place.
Dorsey,We expanded our entire universe of solutions so a credit card reader is one solution that point of sale is another.
Interviewer,Solution because it allows someone to see their entire business and.
Dorsey,Get analytics around how they're doing and make better decisions lending is another solution.
Interviewer,Which came in the form of square capital and so on and so forth so by by going a little bit deeper into.
Dorsey,The observation what we're seeing we created something much more valuable than.
Interviewer,What we started with yeah it was also interesting when we got the first ipad uh.
Dorsey,Because instead of being restrained to you know this much screen area we had a full ipad's worth.
Interviewer,And so that naturally led us to thinking about all the other things that our customers had to do we had some.
Dorsey,Customers at that point but not very many um at least not compared to today and.
Interviewer,It's really interesting if you think of payments as this.
Dorsey,Wonderfully honest form of communication you know what you spend your money on are things you value.
Interviewer,What you think spend your money on is is almost as important as what you spend your time on in some ways.
Dorsey,And so it's a really interesting insight into what matters for a business and if you start connecting to that.
Interviewer,It naturally leads to a very rich ecosystem that's awesome uh talk to me about how.
Dorsey,You engage with the developer communities as you're building up square were there.
Interviewer,Certain forms that you all used or communities that you contributed to how do you think that's changed if.
Dorsey,Any uh to today when we first started we didn't i mean we consciously decided not to.
Interviewer,Engage with the developer community because we you know we had we had a bunch of.
Dorsey,Experience with apis in the past and like how much um they could potentially be abused.
Interviewer,And given that we were dealing with money and moving money around we want to make.
Dorsey,Sure we had a lot of control over how our system was working and we'd have enough people staff.
Interviewer,Engineering resources to make sure that we could build the right constraints um to start so we we didn't really start.
Dorsey,With the developer community until a few years in um and again it was a conscious choice our.
Interviewer,First focus was one specific customer which was a seller who otherwise would not be able to.
Dorsey,Accept a credit card and we just stayed focused until we had a much stronger base and a greater.
Interviewer,Understanding of where to go from there and then as we got the right engineering talent.
Dorsey,And we understood like what we were building and we understood like what the right.
Interviewer,Endpoints were we started building out the developer community.
Dorsey,And um a lot of it came from you know just making sure that anything we build internally.
Interviewer,Ultimately could we export it externally like we should be a client of our own platform.
Dorsey,Ideally and that's how we originally started building the the system and.
Interviewer,You know in many cases we succeeded in some cases we failed but we're up we're able to learn very fast.
Dorsey,And build a platform that i think you know not only exposes a bunch of.
Interviewer,New functionality to the world especially around commerce for sellers but also encourages entirely new ways of.
Dorsey,Doing commerce and doing business and that's just on the seller side we have much more work to do.
Interviewer,On the cash up side which is super exciting as well i'd also add that you know there's sort.
Dorsey,Of an inherent respect for the development community because both jack and i are engineers.
Interviewer,So it's sort of odd to have a company founded by two technical folks but um you know i remember back.
Dorsey,Even when jack was working with me almost 30 years ago he was contributing uh to the open source community he was.
Interviewer,Writing for linux i remember uh twiddler the uh corded input device that you wrote a driver for.
Dorsey,Um and uh you know that plus open source has been an area of you know sort of.
Interviewer,Deep respect and so i think although we kind of came to it late uh i think we came to it well and i.
Dorsey,Think you see that respect in the products that square offers and the way we treat developers.
Interviewer,I want to switch now to talking about uh support and and how we think about the interactions.
Dorsey,That our sellers have with us as lauren mentioned i have the privilege of leading the customer success team.
Interviewer,Here at square so my team knows definitely how critical it is that we are providing great.
Dorsey,Experiences to our sellers and helping them through really critical time sensitive initiatives.
Interviewer,Um that are really challenging to their business so i'd love to hear from you what connections does square enable for.
Dorsey,Its sellers so i i think the most important thing that square does for the sellers is it.
Interviewer,Makes much of the tedium invisible in other words if you use square if you're part.
Dorsey,Of our ecosystem and you're running your business you can spend just a little more time focused on.
Interviewer,Your business as opposed to worrying about accounting withholding and you know paying off this.
Dorsey,Loan and managing all these various connections and one of the great uh tragedies.
Interviewer,That people experience is they're good at something they've got this skill and they say oh i'm good enough i'm going to.
Dorsey,Open a business and then when they open that business they realize that they don't get to.
Interviewer,Actually do the thing they're good at because they're buried with all this other stuff and so.
Dorsey,What we've always tried to do with square is is just sort of make those problems go.
Interviewer,Away and uh you know jack and always jack and i always discussed in the early days.
Dorsey,How the ultimate success would not be famous but would to be invisible to actually be this utility layer that.
Interviewer,Didn't get noticed and i think we still aspire to that and to the extent that people use our products without even.
Dorsey,Realizing how much is going into those products it's a big win i have anything to add there no i mean.
Interviewer,Our the name of our company kind of indicates what we want to be which is plain um.
Dorsey,Out of sight foundational pouring we we didn't want to put our brand before.
Interviewer,Our customers ultimately whether the customer be our seller or a developer.
Dorsey,We we wanted to fade into the background as much as we could and we chose the name accordingly it's a.
Interviewer,Boring brand by design um and uh you know when we were first.
Dorsey,Talking to our designers and brand people they got so upset and insulted that we.
Interviewer,Wanted to build a boring brand because their work is anything but but it takes a lot of work to build.
Dorsey,Something that is so a brand that is so foundational and um nondescript and invisible.
Interviewer,That it is apparent we had a lot going for us and just our hardware the shape of our reader.
Dorsey,Was our name the the structure of our first ipad register indicated the same shape even though it.
Interviewer,Wasn't exactly that so we relied a lot upon what people put on top of their counter.
Dorsey,To reference our brand more so than having a flashy name or something that was truly in your.
Interviewer,Face yeah if you're excited about your payment system it's probably negative.
Dorsey,Energy that's true very true uh jim i'd love to hear how do the connections that square.
Interviewer,Creates uh fit into the notion of the innovation stack.
Dorsey,So i was confounded by something that happened at square which is that we survived an attack by amazon when we.
Interviewer,Were still a startup and i couldn't answer the question.
Dorsey,How did we survive and so what i did was i went on this it was basically a two year research.
Interviewer,Quest looking at other companies that had been in the same situation and i discovered something that was.
Dorsey,Really interesting which was that all the companies that had been in similarly.
Interviewer,Deadly situations and had survived and thrived were all focused on very very small.
Dorsey,Customers and enabling people who had essentially been excluded from the market.
Interviewer,And this was true in banking it was true and furniture was true and in transportation and i found hundreds.
Dorsey,Of examples of of this phenomenon and and when i sort of dove down into it what i saw.
Interviewer,Was that at the core with something i sort of had to come up with a name for i called it an innovation stack and it's.
Dorsey,It's the mess that you have to create when you're doing something new and that was sort of the big insight of.
Interviewer,The book which is that square because we were trying to serve customers who were basically excluded.
Dorsey,From normal rails of commerce as as i was you know as a small glassblower but you.
Interviewer,Know as my friends were like i know it was to be left out and then when we started to.
Dorsey,Build tools for these people what we discovered was that the entire payments ecosystem assumed.
Interviewer,That people like our customers weren't there it just drew the line it.
Dorsey,Said we're not going to serve anybody below this line um and so what square does we started.
Interviewer,Building new tools for ourselves first to make these connections and that collection of tools became an innovation.
Dorsey,Stack and i saw this pattern again and again and again so that's why i wrote the book.
Interviewer,Was because it's this very powerful message which is to say that.
Dorsey,By serving the underserved you can create something that's so powerful that it can you know withstand an attack.
Interviewer,From a company like amazon and ultimately grow it into something that's very very significant.
Dorsey,Thanks for that one of the reasons i personally love working here at square is that we're a mission driven.
Interviewer,Organization with a strong purpose believing that the communities we serve are our most important foundation.
Dorsey,So i'd love to hear from the two of you on um how do the connection square creates um connect with the communities.
Interviewer,We serve or how should they well i i don't think it's any different.
Dorsey,From our customer focus like we have to we have to be in tune with like who we're serving and those people.
Interviewer,Are in tune with a particular community and those communities might intersect with a bunch.
Dorsey,Of other communities that we're not aware of so i think the simplest answer to your.
Interviewer,Question it's just like to be very customer focused and one of the challenges in building.
Dorsey,Square early on was you know jim had a glass factory and would blow glass and sell it but it.
Interviewer,Wasn't his every single day like the people we were serving they were trying to.
Dorsey,Build coffee stores and they were flight instructors and there were flower carts they're going out every.
Interviewer,Single day and selling something so we weren't our customers and when you are building something.
Dorsey,Where you are your customer the next step is fairly obvious when you're not the customer.
Interviewer,The the next step isn't as much so you have to observe a lot more you have to talk with our.
Dorsey,Customers a lot more you have to understand what they're trying to do.
Interviewer,And not take direction from them because if you take direction from them you tend to get into.
Dorsey,A a situation where you're building something for a very specific.
Interviewer,Niche instead of something that's more broad-based so it's observing patterns listening.
Dorsey,Learning like what connects all the dots and then adding our own opinions on top of it and.
Interviewer,Then building ahead of our customers expectations so we to really build up a muscle of.
Dorsey,Getting better at talking with who we serve on a more regular basis and that's why we put.
Interviewer,An emphasis on customer service early on in the company jim was often found in the headphones.
Dorsey,He's wearing right now on the phone with people who are angry at us.
Interviewer,Or in rare cases thrilled with us and um in every one of those conversations we learn.
Dorsey,Something and enough of those conversations informed decisions going forward.
Interviewer,Yeah having seller dna at the core of the company was super helpful uh for instance square didn't hold any.
Dorsey,Focus groups yeah there were like no one-way mirrors um in our early days and i still think.
Interviewer,Today um we stay in touch by a very organic connection to people.
Dorsey,And what their lives are like and how they run their businesses and how intertwined those things are and.
Interviewer,You know one of the things that we saw during the pandemic which i was super proud of.
Dorsey,Was how quickly square responded to this outcry i mean companies were being shut down.
Interviewer,Little businesses were like wiped out um but the thing about little businesses is they're incredibly adaptable.
Dorsey,As long as you give them the tools they need and square was literally on a cadence.
Interviewer,Of releasing a new product on a daily basis sometimes partially you know partial releases in.
Dorsey,The middle of the day it was it was so wonderful in the you know time of the tragedy to.
Interviewer,See a company that was still connected that closely to its customers they couldn't respond that fast.
Dorsey,Uh well as we talked about at the beginning of this session square was born out of gym being unable to process.
Interviewer,A payment um so how is our developer platform an extension of that initial spark.
Dorsey,And what does it mean for square now to have third party developers helping ensure that sellers never miss a payment.
Interviewer,I think it's less about that and more about we realize it's a self-awareness that we're.
Dorsey,Not going to be able to build everything and our value is only as good as who chooses to use us and what how they.
Interviewer,Choose to own what we build in their own way so in some cases it's it's very much you.
Dorsey,Know consumer focus where i'm gonna use what you have and i'll customize it my own way.
Interviewer,Based on the tools that you give me as you go a level deeper developers come in the mix.
Dorsey,And it might be a small business that has four locations that hires an independent developer to.
Interviewer,Do something that the software doesn't do but um the functionality in the api allows.
Dorsey,Or you go a level deeper than that and you create an entire company based on.
Interviewer,The platform but it should scale to every you know every foundational level along.
Dorsey,That so uh it's you know how do we how do we build a platform that enables people to.
Interviewer,As they get more sophisticated with their understanding of what they want they can build.
Dorsey,With complete optionality with complete freedom without having to think about us at all.
Interviewer,And you know i think in both gemiini our cases like as we've learned about technology we've been able to go deeper.
Dorsey,And deeper and deeper and deeper and as the technology unfolds gracefully you can make it more powerful.
Interviewer,And as people make it more powerful square becomes more viable to those developers those customers and.
Dorsey,Also to the world so the more we can open up the more we can um.
Interviewer,We can we can give back uh in whatever way the the more people we're going to be.
Dorsey,Able to serve ultimately jim anything to add there only that you know the.
Interviewer,The humility that you have to have if you start dealing with massive numbers of customers um is is.
Dorsey,Not lost on me or this company um the the needs of the individual.
Interviewer,Businesses these are really very specific and um i love the fact that we've got a.
Dorsey,Developer community right now that's helping us meet those needs better because as jack said we can't build for.
Interviewer,Everybody but we can give an api and expose the things that we need to do uh to make.
Dorsey,Them work and i was literally in a place a couple of weeks ago where somebody had uh.
Interviewer,They were not in the united states but they bought the square hardware because our hardware was so awesome that.
Dorsey,They were using the hardware uh because it was the thing that served their need in a little community that.
Interviewer,Had been just like devastated by the pandemic and i was happy to see that.
Dorsey,You know in that case they were able to pick something from our stack and make it work.
Interviewer,That's great well we're down to our very last question and it's a big bold question.
Dorsey,I'd love to hear from the two of you what is the 5 10 and even 100 year plan for square.
Interviewer,Um well i believe that anyone who has a firm understanding of what.
Dorsey,The next five years or 10 years or 100 years looks like or how they might build is probably wrong.
Interviewer,I think the more important thing is to understand the trends and i think the trends that will affect.
Dorsey,Us the most will be artificial intelligence will be cryptocurrency and bitcoin.
Interviewer,Having a native currency for the internet will be regulatory um issues both defensive and.
Dorsey,Proactive by various governments around the world those are the things that will impact our company our business our.
Interviewer,Customers the most um and it's not a question of like having a perfect roadmap or a vision for.
Dorsey,The next five or ten years it's more about being agile enough to understand.
Interviewer,This is the trend it's obvious here's what we're going to do with it are we going to.
Dorsey,Utilize it to our advantage are we going to react it react to it and block it in a particular.
Interviewer,Way are we going to ignore it at whatever cost it's it's that understanding.
Dorsey,That i think is the most important and um for us over the next five ten years it's to me.
Interviewer,Those are the biggest trends ai cryptocurrency bitcoin and um regulatory.
Dorsey,Yeah i would just say that you know the core of this is humility the thing that you want to not do is.
Interviewer,Think you know what the future's gonna hold because if you do that you'll end up.
Dorsey,Making decisions and then you tend to cling to your decisions uh when evidence tells you otherwise.
Interviewer,Uh and we've seen that you know in the last year uh played out uh i i have to really.
Dorsey,Compliment jack because before it was trendy to do remote work uh jack was at the.
Interviewer,Board of directors saying we're gonna have remote board meetings and all of our board members were like no no no.
Dorsey,We'll miss the dinners and you know larry summers gives great hugs you know and we didn't want to have this.
Interviewer,Um you know we didn't want to have our party broken up but jack was adamant.
Dorsey,That we needed to to do this and then lo and behold we got a pandemic and we don't miss a beat um uh.
Interviewer,The other thing i think is important and it's something that i watch uh through you know these little proxies is.
Dorsey,Is what's our cadence of shipping product what's a cadence of getting solutions out to customers and i've seen.
Interviewer,That cadence you know sort of tick up continually over time and that's so exciting.
Dorsey,Because what companies typically do is they get comfortable and then they go oh yeah we're just.
Interviewer,Going to sit here and ride it you know like when we started square we really looked for innovation in payments.
Dorsey,And we found nothing like the preceding decade was this complete blank as far as stuff that was.
Interviewer,Done uh and i'd say since then um square and companies.
Dorsey,You know that have been inspired hopefully by square have have really taken that innovation up and i.
Interviewer,Just love the fact that we got a developer community because that's just so many more brains.
Dorsey,On the problem although i i will say like that the year the year we started was a very.
Interviewer,Auspicious year because um 2008 2009 is when the global banking system.
Dorsey,Collapsed and we emerged from that and also bitcoin.
Interviewer,And all of cryptocurrency emerged from that moment so there was something in the air where the.
Dorsey,Financial system was ready to be questioned and we had a few answers and satoshi had a few.
Interviewer,Answers and others had more answers as well but there was something special about that.
Dorsey,Time that i think we'll carry forth for the next few decades that you know we're gonna.
Interviewer,We're all gonna learn from and i think will uh impact the world in a positive way.
Dorsey,Couldn't agree more very excited to see what's come down the road uh well thank you so much jack and jim.
Interviewer,For participating in this session and for all of you that are viewing it from home we appreciate you taking out.
Dorsey,The time to hear from square and our co-founder you.
Interviewer,"It's a sign of how the stakes have changed for you and for twitter that no matter what you tweet, a fairly standard response is ""yeah, but get the nazis off twitter."""
Dorsey,"Yeah. so it used to be i would tweet about kendrick and people would be like, ""awesome, can you please increase the share price?"" and then it transitioned into demanding an edit button. the topics of abuse and our policies have been much more pronounced recently. and it comes in the form of categorizing people as nazis and wanting them removed. people are definitely not satisfied with our progress there. it's not as simple as what the reply would indicate, but it is work that needs to be done."
Interviewer,"Technically, being a professed white nationalist isn't grounds for removal, right? someone has to make specific threats?"
Dorsey,"It actually is. if they align themselves with a violent extremist group, like the american nazi party, we suspend their account. there are not self-professed nazis. if you can show them, i would love to see them, and figure out why we haven't taken action on them, but... "
Interviewer,I can confirm that there are nazis on twitter.
Dorsey,"A lot of the calls for ""remove the nazis"" are also due to the fact our enforcement operates on reporting. a lot of people don't report. they see things, but it's easier to tweet out ""get rid of the nazis"" than to report it. we need to be more proactive, but a lot of it has to do with the friction of everything relying on it being reported in the first place. two years ago, you could only report it if you were the direct recipient of either a reply or a threat, or some abusive behavior."
Interviewer,"Seth rogen, who was concerned about racists getting verified status on twitter, tweeted that you do ""not seem to give a fuck"" about this issue after some back-and-forth with you."
Dorsey,"That was heartbreaking. i dm'd him, and we got on the phone together. he said to me, ""i'm surprised at myself for not hanging up... but i think you have the right intent. but you all are terrible communicators."" i agree, we have been bad at communication, we haven't been as forthright as we need to, we certainly haven't been as transparent. we do care deeply. but we need to do it in scalable ways. this work doesn't happen overnight."
Interviewer,"The model in silicon valley for a long time was ""we are a neutral platform."" it's obviously not quite the case anymore. so if it's not a platform, what is it?"
Dorsey,"People see twitter as a public square, and therefore they have expectations that they would have of a public square. washington square park, for instance, i just had an hour and a half there, today. i sat, and i did my phone calls, and i watched people. there's a lot going on in washington square park. there's tourists, students, filmmakers, musicians, street hustlers, weed dealers, chess players. and there's people talking out in the open. the park itself is completely neutral to whatever happens on top of it."
Interviewer,"Dealing with harassment seems easy compared with grappling with the idea of false information. sometimes it seems like your approach is ""if there's false information, the nature of twitter is such that we count on the real information to overcome it."" is that correct?"
Dorsey,"Well, i think it happens, but it's not something that we should make a model. it can unfold that way, but that doesn't mean we can rely upon it. an example, there was this tweet, before the 2016 elections. someone tweeted out an image of a code that supposedly allowed you to register to vote. it was misinformation. so the way that this plays out on twitter is that the tweets calling it out as false got more impressions than the original. more people saw the tweets calling it out as false than saw the original tweet."
Interviewer,What do you conclude from that?
Dorsey,"We could just sit back and be neutral and passive, like, ""ok, we're good,"" because the thing self-corrects. but instead we should learn what that means and how we can make more of those things happen. we can't be arbiters of truth. i think that would be dangerous for anyone to want us to be. so what can we do? what we're deciding to do is focus on misleading information, which intends to lead someone in a particular direction, intends them to take a particular action."
Interviewer,"People talk about social media being designed for dopamine drips, intended to be addictive. to what extent is there truth in that for twitter?"
Dorsey,"We certainly didn't have that intent. we built twitter originally because we wanted to use it, and we fell in love with it. there is a general addiction, independent of twitter, to what's happening, what's new. news junkies are real, looking for headlines is real, looking for hot takes is real, providing hot takes is real. it might be fairly shallow. we never really designed the product to be, like, ""how do we make this more addictive?"" that's never a question i've asked, and never a question i've heard my team ask."
Interviewer,"People were really angry at that idea, actually."
Dorsey,"It's mainly removing the variables. when people open twitter today, what does the app inherently incentivize? i don't know the answer. that's the question we're asking, right now. the question is, if we take away the count from everyone but the author, what does that do?"
Interviewer,Do you yourself have any degree of twitter addiction? do you compulsively check twitter the way many of the rest of us do?
Dorsey,"In context, i do. during events, i do. during election night it was nonstop, during a basketball game it's nonstop. that's when i have the recent-tweets feature on; all the other time i have the most-relevant tweets on. i know this is gonna sound way out there, because we're nowhere near what i'm about to say, but when i close the app, i want to have learned something new. we're just so far off. if i asked anyone in this restaurant, ""after closing twitter, did you learn anything?"" most of them are gonna say no, or they learned something they already knew."
Interviewer,"There's obviously been an overall shift from a techno-optimism to a techno-pessimism. what's your case for twitter, in particular, as an overall force for good?"
Dorsey,I think it's a net positive that everyone has more potential to have a voice. because it benefits those who traditionally didn't the most. the thing i'm most proud of twitter for is that it has been a vehicle for historically marginalized groups to share their story.
Interviewer,"On the flip side, obviously twitter allows public figures, politicians included, to potentially tell lies to millions of followers, without a filter."
Dorsey,"An interesting case study is the sarah sanders video that may have been doctored to increase the severity of whatever jim acosta did. it speaks to where all these technologies are going. it's so easy, potentially, to create alternative narratives. the question we're now asking ourselves is, if that is indeed misleading, how do we stop its spread? we can amplify the counter-narrative. we do have a curation team that looks to find balance. a lot of times when our president tweets, a moment occurs, and we show completely different perspectives."
Interviewer,"By all accounts, square runs more smoothly than twitter."
Dorsey,"It has to, though. yeah, you're dealing with people's money. i mean, it's extremely emotional. if you lose 140 characters, people are like, ""eh."" if you lose $140 or even $1.40, it's important. we knew the severity, and we knew how emotional this was to people. we're impacting their livelihoods, so we had to get every single thing right. there's a lot of regulation around payments. if you do something wrong, you go to jail."
Interviewer,"Is there something inherently messy in the nature of twitter, the fact that it scaled up from code that wasn't written to be scaled up? then there's all the sociological implications and political implications...."
Dorsey,"Expression is messy. it has unpredicted outcomes. it has so many people coming in and adding their voice. the song just keeps going on and on. looking back, 50 years in the future when it's still here and i'm gone, my impact will be nothing compared to the impact that people using the platform in those 50 years will have on it. we all have time to add to the song. then we depart, and it continues to go on. that's why i think we have resonance with so many folks in hip-hop."
Interviewer,"Speaking of messiness, the right-wing provocateur laura loomer chained herself to your new york headquarters to protest her ban from twitter for alleged hate speech."
Dorsey,"I respect that. i think it's brave. i love activists. i love protest. i'm a punk. my music when i was growing up was punk. hackers are punk. it's questioning the system, not because you hate it but because you want to make it better. i respect her desire to make twitter better. i respect every mention that i get to make twitter better and to make me better. i hope i never lose that. i would not chain myself to a corporate office, but i respect that courage, and i respect what you have to do mentally to get to that state."
Interviewer,How do you counter the general distrust out there?
Dorsey,"There's a lot of distrust. there's a lot of fear. it's fear of companies like ours. it's fear of power, and it's completely 100 percent natural. people are afraid of what technology has become and what it can do. there's a good chapter in yuval noah harari's book 21 lessons for the 21st century: ""technology feels like it can make me irrelevant."" if we can't be transparent about our intentions and what our technology is doing, we're feeding into that fear of irrelevance."
Interviewer,"How are you not in a constant state of agitation that something terrible is going to trend, or that a war or some other calamity is going to start over a tweet?"
Dorsey,"We have a global team. and i trust them to make decisions. and i trust them to make decisions without me having to interject or oversee them at all. and i trust that we have a learning mindset. that we're gonna do retros on what we fucked up. and we're going to learn from that. and we're not going to repeat the same mistakes. so in terms of what happens in the platform, i am concerned. i am a citizen in this world. i feel the weight of how our tool is used in society and how it's been used for good and how it's used for stuff i'm not proud of."
Interviewer,For instance?
Dorsey,"Like creating bubbles and echo chambers. i'm not proud of that. like, we definitely help divide people. we definitely create isolation. we definitely make it easy for people to confirm their own bias. we've only given them one tool, which is follow an account that will 90 percent confirm whatever bias you have. and it doesn't allow them to seek other perspectives. it contributes to tribalism. it contributes to nationalism. and it's counter to what we need the world to consider, which is, how do we solve climate change? there's no country anywhere on the planet that's gonna solve it alone."
Interviewer,"When you tweeted your health stats, showing that you get eight and a half hours of sleep a night, people were like, literally, ""well, you shouldn't be sleeping well at night."" the implication, again, is that you don't care."
Dorsey,"We can only show that we care through how we change our product and fix things. nothing i say is going to do that. and, look, i have a lot of people who care about the world and society and our impacts reading my tweets, a lot of shareholders reading my tweets. but i also have a lot of entrepreneurs reading my tweets. and my mom reading my tweets. i don't want to model a behavior where i'm up 20 hours a day working nonstop to fix something, 'cause i don't think it's long-term healthy."
Interviewer,So you want to show it's possible to run two big companies and also get some sleep.
Dorsey,"Yeah, and i think it's possible, and i wanna show it to be possible. that being said, every hour i spend is really meaningful. so, like, spending an hour here means i'm not doing something else, and is that trade-off worth it? i need to consider that every single day. and so i end up not watching a lot of tv. but when i wanna get away, i do."
Interviewer,Let's talk about myanmar. critics said that you shouldn't have gone there because of alleged genocide perpetrated by the government.
Dorsey,"I disagree. i think we need to face the things that are unpleasant. i did talk to people about it. i went to ferguson missouri, and a bunch of people told me not to go there too. we have to face these things. the surprising thing i learned in myanmar, number one, was that the internet is facebook there. twitter is very small, if anything. the second thing is that every monk and nun i met has a cellphone. a lot of the monks i talked to said they believe anything that is on the phone, anything that comes through facebook is believed."
Interviewer,This is the second year in a row you've gone on a week of silent meditation. what does it do for you?
Dorsey,"What i was going there for was to practice focus. it's very physically painful. there's no talk of religion, there's no talk of spirituality. it's a physical-body practice. you sit down and what you're told to do is focus your entire consciousness on not the breath, but the feeling of your breath passing through. it's amazing how it made all the really small things in life really, really big. the first year, day six was the hardest for me 'cause i looked around during a meditation and i'm like, ""man, everyone looks like they're buddha right now."
Interviewer,Part of what the myanmar controversy shows is that same distrust of someone like you in 2018.
Dorsey,"Yeah, i think there's a lack of trust. i welcome that. if i were not in the circumstances i am now, if i was still 21 years old and looking at everything, i would be distrustful as well. that's just who i was. i know who i am. the people around me know who i am. i was not taken aback by the focus on meditation versus myanmar. i was taken aback by people being upset that i did a meditation in the first place. or saw it as bragging. yeah, i'm trying to learn."
Interviewer,"I guess it's the point of twitter, in some ways."
Dorsey,"Yeah. also, i think for a lot of people the point of the service is to feel outraged. and to express it."
Interviewer,"There's an idea out there you could be like a character out of silicon valley, the show. how does that affect the way you communicate with the world?"
Dorsey,I have to ignore it. how do i get in touch with anything? experience it. am i not supposed to do these things? are there experiences that i should not have in the world because i'm in technology? i've meditated for 20 years.
Interviewer,"If someone went back and told you when you were 12 that you're going to be a billionaire and run two companies, would that at any level have made sense to you?"
Dorsey,"It would have felt hard to achieve. i don't know about self-image, because i don't know if i had something very concrete about what i wanted to be. i didn't, actually."
Interviewer,"When you were young, did you see yourself as an artist?"
Dorsey,I loved drawing. i loved making music. i loved creating. it was more in that angle. i didn't really love business. i didn't want to be a ceo. i didn't want to be an entrepreneur. i wanted to create stuff.
Interviewer,I've read that you had a speech difficulty as a kid.
Dorsey,"Yeah, i had an impediment. i couldn't pronounce any of my words. i went to speech therapy for two years. it made me shy. i didn't want to talk with anyone, even my family. then i had this speech therapy, and they fixed most of it. i still am very mindful of it, in this conversation, i mispronounced at least four words. when i was in junior high, i was just deathly afraid of speaking. then i decided that it was ridiculous, and i needed to get out there, so i joined the speech team."
Interviewer,"Growing up in st. louis, when was the first time you became entranced by the possibility of coding?"
Dorsey,"Well, it was before the computer, because my dad had a heathkit, like a ham-radio heathkit. tinkering around with that in morse code was really interesting. then the pc junior, writing batch files. st. louis had a very active hacker culture, in the best sense of the word, hacker, like someone who's curious about technology, willing to pick it apart and go deep to understand how it works."
Interviewer,"It was pretty much the intellectual fascination of it, right? you didn't have any practical sense early on of what to do with this stuff, did you?"
Dorsey,Not at that time. i just wanted to build. i just wanted to make things. i was fascinated by operating systems. that's what i did in university.
Interviewer,"Back in the day, there were things that threatened to pull you away, other interests. you did 1,000 hours of massage-therapy training, and studied fashion design and botanical illustration?"
Dorsey,"Well, the thing that pushed me away wasn't an interest in massage therapy or botanical illustration or fashion. it was that programming is so abstract. i got lost in it constantly because you were so much in your head all the time. it affects your dreams. you start programming in your dreams. you can actually control your dreams. at least that was my experience. it's so abstract, and nothing feels real. every time i wanted to do something different, i wanted to do something with my hands."
Interviewer,Always something very concrete.
Dorsey,"I loved drawing since i was a kid. my mom painted, and i was good. botanical illustration had this amazing intersection between being art but also extremely precise and useful. then i realized i couldn't make a living this way. i went back to programming. then i start getting carpal tunnel. my friend told me to get a massage. i like to understand the theory behind it, and the practice. i don't like just going and receiving something. i want to understand why and how."
Interviewer,And fashion?
Dorsey,"I always had a fascination with architecture and construction. i got really heavily into jeans because i'm in san francisco, levi's is right down the street. it's all i wore as a kid. they get better every day. each one has a patina, you look at a pair of jeans after two years, you can see how the person lived. you can see the story. i went to a fashion school here in san francisco. it was like, ""man, i get to work with my hands again."" i never actually got to make pants because we started to work on twitter."
Interviewer,How did it all connect to twitter for you?
Dorsey,"One of the joys of twitter, actually, unlike most of my programming, was that i wrote a line of code, and it made biz stone's phone buzz. it was physical. that was my one joy within twitter in the first two weeks. i was programming something that made an object move. i would tweet something, and biz's pocket would buzz. then he would be thinking of me. that made it really tangible. that's when i was really hooked on this balance between the physical and the software world."
Interviewer,"The first germ of the idea of twitter was pretty definitely yours, but then it gets pretty messy. someone like noah glass, one of the co-founders, has said that he hasn't gotten enough credit. to what degree would you credit the other guys with helping develop the initial idea?"
Dorsey,Two years into it i thought stuff like that mattered. i don't feel it matters as much anymore. i think the real interestingness of twitter is not us. it was the fact that we were able to see what people are doing with it and made it more accessible. i think the true inventions were not the initial stuff. it was the @ symbol. it was the # symbol. it was the retweet.
Interviewer,Which came from the users. the users invented those things themselves.
Dorsey,"Our role there was observing that people were actually trying to communicate with one another. i think that is the greatest role we had. it was messy. creation is messy. we all had our role to play. some ideas were isolated to individuals. some ideas were not. some ideas came through conversation. noah and i would have conversations until four in the morning about this thing. i was really sad to see him go. i wish we still talked, but he was definitely my earliest thought partner."
Interviewer,"Like steve jobs, you were pushed out of the company you co-founded. after you were removed as twitter ceo in 2008, you came back in 2011, after founding another huge company, square. was it all a big, brilliant plan to make your way back?"
Dorsey,"I wasn't expecting to come back at all. i was out. i re-found my boss when i was 15 years old, jim mc-kelvey. i wanted to work with him again. we were considering ideas from electric cars to what square became. i felt it was as big in terms of potential, if not bigger. i was happy. i love twitter. i was always willing to do whatever it took to make it reach its potential. as long as i'm useful to the company, then i'll be here. if i become irrelevant, and at some point i will, then hopefully i've built other choices for the company in people."
Interviewer,At one point you were talking about wanting to be mayor of new york. is that still something that's on your dream list?
Dorsey,"I was always fascinated by cities. i couldn't think of a better way to observe and have an impact than a mayor. i realized at some point along the way that i could write a policy and the effect probably won't be felt for eight years, whereas i could write a simulation and some code in a model, and i could see it within eight seconds. i'm just now more and more convinced that building and creating can influence faster than what can happen in our current legislative system."
Interviewer,So now you have no interest in politics or ever running for office?
Dorsey,No.
Interviewer,Was there a moment that changed your mind?
Dorsey,I don't know if i could be me. i like being creative. i like joking around. i like pranking. i like creativity.
Interviewer,Do you think there's a lot of decorum required for high office in this country?
Dorsey,"I mean, i had an article written about me about wearing sandals in front of goldman sachs."
Interviewer,How much thought have you given to your ultimate philanthropic goals and where you want your money to go after you're gone?
Dorsey,"Well, i want to give it all away. one of the existential issues facing the world today is climate change. the other big one changing the world today is economic disparity. i don't think it's fair what i have access to. i started a foundation called start small foundation, which is intending to teach people how to build businesses in places like ferguson and stay in business, because i see a business as a fabric to an enduring community. i don't know if that's the right thing or if it's universal basic income or something scoped even tighter than that, but i intend to help address the wealth gap with my wealth."
Interviewer,"You may need to learn from hip-hop and just say, ""yes, i'm a billionaire."""
Dorsey,No. no. i'm not that cool. it could be gone tomorrow. i gave 10 percent of my equity in square back to the company. i gave a third of my equity in twitter back to the employee pool. i gave most of my square equity to this foundation.
Interviewer,"Twitter ceo jack dorsey prepares to testify during a senate intelligence committee hearing in washington, dc on september 5, 2018."
Dorsey,"Senate testimony: dorsey in washington in september: ""there's a lot of distrust. people are afraid of what technology has become."" photo credit: stephen voss/redux"
Interviewer,Stephen voss/redux
Dorsey,What do you make of elon musk?
Interviewer,"The folks who are leading the way are folks like elon. i don't know of another person on the planet who's leading us off the planet because of the damage that we're inflicting to this planet. also the ais coming up in the future, who else is leading humanity toward mars in order to save it? those are the conversations we used to have, but we're not having."
Dorsey,His critics paint him as ridiculous.
Interviewer,"He is ridiculous. you have to be. you have to be to think that big. i love him. i love what he's trying to do, and i want to help in whatever way. i have a friend who's a music producer. i asked him, ""what got you into music?"" he said, ""i've never been able to play music. i don't even really know if i have good taste. i love musicians, and all i want to do is help them."" i feel a similar kind of understanding of elon. i understand what he wants to do, and i want to help."
Dorsey,"When you look at your first tenure as ceo of twitter, would you have forced yourself out?"
Interviewer,I wouldn't have forced myself out. i would have helped.
Dorsey,"You could have succeeded with the proper help, is that what you're saying?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. you have to keep in mind, we had a company of 13 people. i had never been anyone's boss. that was all new. i had to fire someone that we were entirely dependent on to bring the service back up. we were under massive scrutiny. we had massive scale from day one. it resonated immediately. people were throwing money at us. we had facebook, who just copied the same thing that we did. there was a lot of stress. i was working nonstop. the service was going down all the time."
Dorsey,"Our office felt like a tomb. it was dark. there were no windows. there's a choice one can make: if you put someone in a situation like that, you have to help them or you just replace them, and i was replaced."
Interviewer,"Would it be fair to say that after you were forced out, you were determined to let the world know who you were and what your importance was?"
Dorsey,"Yeah. i saw myself being erased from everything, intentionally erased. that wasn't cool."
Interviewer,"I was part of the story. i shouldn't be erased from it. for two years i was considered the co-founder. then suddenly i'm not? changing history, i'll speak up about. i usually don't speak on behalf of myself. i don't fight for myself. that was the one time that i did. i don't know if it worked. no one really cared."
Dorsey,"You're sitting here now. clearly, something worked."
Interviewer,"No, no. i went off and did my thing. i learned what i needed to learn. i built a company. it's rock-solid and stable. had no blips. i think i proved to myself that when i put my mind to it and when i have the right access to tools, that will help me grow."
Dorsey,"Based on the time you spent with him, would you be able to lay out your philosophical differences with someone like mark zuckerberg? twitter and facebook have approached the world in different ways."
Interviewer,I would love to. i just don't know what his philosophies are. i don't know what their purpose is.
Dorsey,Facebook's purpose?
Interviewer,"Mm-hmm. i know what they say, but i don't know. i see mark as a very, very smart businessman. he will excel to gain as much market share as possible."
Dorsey,"If you were ceo of facebook instead, would you know what to do with them?"
Interviewer,"No. i've got enough on my plate. i think the intention of a lot of people at the company is right. if the philosophy is helping the world realize that we're all facing the same problems. we should end this distraction of nationalism. that is a promise of the internet. i would rather us be proactive around solving these problems together than reactive. if that's the goal and that's the stated intention, then i would know a few things to do."
Dorsey,What was your most memorable encounter with zuckerberg?
Interviewer,"Well, there was a year when he was only eating what he was killing. he made goat for me for dinner. he killed the goat."
Dorsey,In front of you?
Interviewer,No. he killed it before. i guess he kills it. he kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. then they send it to the butcher.
Dorsey,A ... laser gun?
Interviewer,"I don't know. a stun gun. they stun it, and then he knifed it. then they send it to a butcher. evidently in palo alto there's a rule or regulation that you can have six livestock on any lot of land, so he had six goats at the time. i go, ""we're eating the goat you killed?"" he said, ""yeah."" i said, ""have you eaten goat before?"" he's like, ""yeah, i love it."" i'm like, ""what else are we having?"" ""salad."" i said, ""where is the goat?"" ""it's in the oven."
Dorsey,It's hard to find a metaphor in that.
Interviewer,"I don't know what you're going to do with that, but hopefully that's not the headline. revenge is a dish best served warm. or cold."
Dorsey,Did you come away from twitter to square with a newfound world-conquering ambition?
Interviewer,"No, i don't want to conquer the world."
Dorsey,"Some people say you were motivated by revenge or, more pleasantly, to show them that they were wrong."
Interviewer,"Definitely, when i started square, i needed to prove a lot to myself. i was put in a position to do something, and i thought it was going quite well. i was surprised to learn that it wasn't. then i was out. i spent months trying to figure out what happened. the only way i know how to figure out what happened is just to do it again."
Dorsey,How do you balance your admiration of someone like steve jobs with our current knowledge of his darker side as a human and a boss?
Interviewer,"I don't know much about what he was like to work with. i've read the book, but there's some counter-arguments to that as well. he resonated with me because he wasn't just a technologist. he was an artist too. my dad was a technologist. my mom was an artist. that balance, you can't really find that anywhere. he was the only one doing anything interesting in that regard. he was just such an icon too. he really had a sense of who he was. he was very confident and curious and just a fascinating character."
Dorsey,What was your introduction to punk rock?
Interviewer,"A club in st. louis, and a lot of basements. my favorite band at the time was flipper. then they led me to operation ivy. then operation ivy led me to a bunch of the bay area folks. the ska-punk band common rider led me to the coup and hip-hop. one of the things i appreciate about punk is the activism."
Dorsey,"When i got here in '99, i immediately went to gilman. i worked the door as a bouncer, which is funny, because look at me. it turns out that most of the people that go to gilman are pretty harmless. there's no alcohol. i loved it. it was a co-op, collective. i would be dancing to all these punk bands. i would look to the right, and billie joe armstrong is there dancing too. he's tiny and jumping on the stage. i'm like, ""wow, that's really cool."" it doesn't matter who you are, they're all here."
Interviewer,"Earlier, you said, ""i'm a punk."" can you be punk rock and be who you are right now? is that really possible?"
Dorsey,"Can i be that today? yeah, i think so. i hope so. i think we need different takes on life. there's a number of people who might come from a similar background as i did and be a little bit weird or odd or whatnot and see me as being weird and odd and extra: ""yeah, if you can do it, i can do it."""
Interviewer,What did you initially respond to in punk?
Dorsey,"The fact that you would have these bands of three people get up onstage who were absolutely terrible. they would get booed. people would throw things at them. they would keep playing. then they came back in two weeks, and they were a little bit better. then they came back in two weeks, and they were much better. then they came back in four weeks, and they were amazing."
Interviewer,"I'm fascinated by this concept of working in public and allowing people to see you get better and better as time goes on. to me, it's what the world needs. to me, that's one of the greatest benefits twitter provides. elon does it so well. he works in public. he thinks in public. he ideates in public. i got that from punk. hip-hop has a little bit of it as well. kanye, life of pablo, was that in the streaming age. ""i'm gonna fix 'wolves.'"""
Dorsey,I wish he'd kept that going.
Interviewer,"Someday he's going to fix it. it was amazing. he was the one that, finally, someone got what's possible with streaming. you can change it at any point, and no one, to me, yet, has fully realized the medium of streaming."
Dorsey,How do you define your spirituality?
Interviewer,"Not to any particular religion. anything that builds self-awareness feels spiritual to me. i guess i feel a sense of spirituality when i feel a connection to, like, global consciousness. what i love about walking around new york is it just feels so electric and i feel connected to everything. even though i'm not talking to anyone, it feels like i'm in a moment that's super-dense and very, very connected. i think twitter has some of that potential to show at least the closest thing we have to a global consciousness."
Dorsey,Did you have any urge as a kid to be famous?
Interviewer,"I never wanted to be an entrepreneur. i never wanted to be ceo. i never wanted to be a public figure. i had this idea for a while, and i wanted it to work. that's all. and i became a ceo because i had to. but that was it. we raise money because we had to pay people. this was all out of necessity rather than desire. i love being behind the scenes. the character i loved most in the wizard of oz was the wizard. 'cause he was behind the curtain."
Dorsey,You're incredible.
Interviewer,"And i think there's 20,000 out there listening. we are happy to see this phenomenon grow. i wanted to start with the big question that most people are probably asking"
Dorsey,"Not for me. for me bitcoin changes absolutely everything. what i'm drawn to the most about it is the ethos, is what it represents, are the conditions that created it, which are so rare and so special and so precious. i don't think there's anything more important in my lifetime to work on and i don't think there's anything more enabling for people around the world."
Interviewer,"We often hear in our community this mantra that bitcoin is for everybody. that it's non-discriminatory, that it's open and opening for many people around the world who are walled off from transactions, saving, connecting with the world. what is your perspective on this idea that bitcoin is for everybody?"
Dorsey,"That's what i'm focused on making sure that i help with. whatever i can do, whatever my companies can do to make bitcoin accessible to everyone is how i'm going to spend the rest of my life. if i were not at square or twitter, i'd be working on bitcoin. if it needed more help than square and twitter, i would leave them for bitcoin. but i believe both companies have a role to play and i think anything we can do as companies to help find the right intersection between a corporate narrative and a community open narrative is for the best."
Interviewer,"The theme for today is banking the unbanked. as you all probably know, there are billions of people around the world who are completely unbanked, or they are underbanked. yet, the mobile phone is growing at a remarkable pace. even in countries like ethiopia and sudan, you now have 20 or 25% of the population with a mobile phone, and in the next five years that's going to pass 50%. so we are now in a position where the increase of technology is going to allow more people to come online and with bitcoin it doesn't matter what passport you have, or what nationality you are, or what ethnicity you are, or what you believe in, you can connect to this network."
Dorsey,"Well, we don't need the banks anymore. there's so much work to do around accessibility, there's so much work to do around education so that people can own the idea themselves. and i want to thank you by the way, i appreciate you so much for all the work you do to take away a bunch of the myths that people have in their head and give a strong case for why bitcoin can be used by everyone, but we don't need the financial institutions that we have today."
Interviewer,"You recently personally launched a new fund with jay-z, where you guys dedicated 500 btc to help the bitcoin ecosystem in africa and india. can you talk a little bit more about the vision for that fund and what you all hope to do over the coming years?"
Dorsey,"I spent november of 2019 roaming around the continent of africa, i went to nigeria, i went to ethiopia, i went to ghana. and i saw that the number one problem that entrepreneurs were working on there, and i only met the entrepreneurs, i didn't meet anyone in the government or the media, they are all working on payments and the most interesting of them were working on bitcoin. and when i saw the reports of nigeria considering banning bitcoin, when i saw the reports of india considering banning bitcoin, it was a reminder that we could use a lot more help developing around the world."
Interviewer,So jay might have 99 problems but being his own bank won't be one.
Dorsey,Laughs he's more than a bank.
Interviewer,Let's speak a little more about that. nigeria is a country of more than 200 million people. they have a 15% inflation rate. they are in many ways closed off from the outside world in terms of fintech and payments. how has traveling the world and going to different countries like this opened your eyes to the global impact of bitcoin that maybe people in wall street or in silicon valley or in london may not be seeing? what are people missing when they say there is no social value to bitcoin?
Dorsey,"I mean they are missing everything. they're not getting out of new york. go to nigeria for one day and see the struggle that people have to put up with, with their government and with their money. and go to ghana that has a bunch of transplants from all over the continent and you witness the same thing every single day. go to india and you see the same."
Interviewer,"My advice is that they should try living on the sudanese pound for six months and then come back and tell us that bitcoin is not useful. and i think they'll get a little reality check there. today we've got maybe, and estimates vary, anywhere from 150 million to 200 million people have used bitcoin in some way. so we're at maybe 2% or 2.5% of the world population. i believe we're going to a billion people by 2025, certainly by the end of the decade."
Dorsey,"That's why i'm committed to lightning, because this is going to be used by more and more people. my belief in bitcoin is that it's an amazing asset, but my belief is that the internet needs a native currency, and we need to be able to transact with this every single day. and everyone around the world needs to transact with it every single day. so the only reason square got into bitcoin is to that end. it's not just to be an exchange. and that's why we don't deal with any other ""currencies"" or ""coins"" because we're so focused on making bitcoin the native currency for the internet."
Interviewer,Why don't we just go right to that issue? we hear a lot about censorship. can social media be more like bitcoin? bitcoin is censorship resistant. nobody controls it. what's your thought on this? it's a thorny problem.
Dorsey,"Yes, i do believe it can. i know that there's a lot of you out there who disagree with a lot of actions that twitter has taken. i know there's a lot of you out there who disagree with our policies and the way we have evolved them. i appreciate that and recognize it. i also recognize the fact that there is an incentive and a corporate incentive and a business incentive that is different than what might be needed for global communication and for a public conversation."
Interviewer,"When you look at something like lightning, it's not just a payments network, it can also be a censorship-resistant social media platform. there's folks out there building stuff like sphinx."
Dorsey,Sphinx is amazing.
Interviewer,"Sphinx is really cool, basically what you can do is you can follow your favorite creators. maybe your favorite podcast. maybe you're following what marty and matt are doing, and you can go into a ""tribe"" on sphinx and you can stream them censorship-resistant private money on lightning and nobody can stop you. and that's happening. it's inevitable. it's coming. this vision to stream money to people that you care about, in a way that the government cannot stop, i know that's what laura wants, and that's what you all want where you are upset with twitter."
Dorsey,"Again it goes back to the currency. square crypto and steve and team and matt have been focused on making sure that any wallet can easily turn on lightning and to make this accessible to everyone. the more people we have considering using bitcoin for payments, for tips, for streaming money, the stronger this ecosystem is and the more we achieve our goal."
Interviewer,"We're really building out a parallel economy here that is not controlled by governments or corporations. and i just wanted to show you how this works and then jack and i can reflect on it. our friend jack mallers has created a company called strike, with a lot of help from a lot of other people, an amazing bitcoin company, and he started a campaign recently to help bitcoin development. so i'm on the strike page right here. and i'm going to go ahead and donate $2 of bitcoin to strike."
Dorsey,You should definitely do that.
Interviewer,"But this is not some magic fairy dust. this is real. lightning is real. and i just sent a bearer asset around the world and nobody could stop me. i didn't have to ask any permission, i didn't have to prove my identification. this is an actual revolution. so when we talk about bitcoin and lightning, if we're going to build it the right way, it has to be non-custodial. now, minutes before you walked on stage, you announced something pretty big that you are going to do at square."
Dorsey,Yeah we're considering building a non-custodial hardware wallet. the thing we want to do is make it completely in the open. from all of our software to all of our hardware design will be open source and will be on github. we want to build it in collaboration with the community. so we started a thread today asking some questions about our design principles. we don't want to compete with the hardware wallets out there. we just want to take it to the next level and take it to 100 million more people who have non-custodial solutions.
Interviewer,"I think that non-custodial use of bitcoin is so important. and satoshi, the creator of bitcoin, knew this. satoshi chose his or her birthday as april 5. this was the day that the u.s. government basically banned private ownership of gold in 1933. so when satoshi was designing bitcoin he or she was thinking about how the u.s. government centralized and confiscated gold away from the people and how they could make a system that could prevent that. they chose the year for their birthday of 1973 which is when gold was made available for the american people again."
Dorsey,As a custodial exchange we need to push more companies like us to make sure that more people have non-custodial solutions. and we're going to show up.
Interviewer,Earlier you brought up a point that you are bitcoin only. let's talk a little bit more about that. there's a lot of discussion about proof of stake and other coins. what are your thoughts on bitcoin and its proof of work and full nodes model versus other models?
Dorsey,"Again, the conditions that created bitcoin, everything that went into it from the proof-of-work model to the development model, no single points of failure, everything about it is why we're into it. there's nothing else that compares to it. and we have no interest other than making sure that we are building a native currency for the internet and helping in every way that we can. so all the other coins to me don't factor in at all."
Interviewer,"Bitcoin is about user control. users control the monetary policy. you control it, you control it, i control it. there's not a small group of people controlling the monetary policy. and that's really what we are here for. we're here to create an alternative to the fiat system where a small group of people can basically determine the rules. i was in a meeting yesterday with an amazing guy named fodé diop from senegal, and he's telling me this story from the late 1990s."
Dorsey,Until they don't. until they get corrupted in some other way.
Interviewer,"The track record for this globally is not so great. there's always this temptation to print more to fix the problems. well, you can't do that with bitcoin."
Dorsey,"I think all of the things that you mentioned in terms of what central banks are trying to do are just bumps in the road and they are bullshit. we have a much better alternative in bitcoin. we have designs for that privacy and that freedom within it. the more that we, and especially our governments, can realize that and get in the boat sooner, the better we all are."
Interviewer,"A lot of people say bitcoin is just for bad people. it's just for bad actors. what's your response to that, that it's just for criminals, the same sort of stuff that they said in the early '90s about encryption. right, they said it's going to be for bad people, we don't want americans to have privacy. well thankfully the cypherpunks make it possible for us to have tools like signal. what is your response when you talk to regulators or government officials and when they say this is just too risky or it's going to hurt people?"
Dorsey,"It feels like it's a cover for something else going on. i don't actually hear that a lot from regulators. square was one of the first companies that was public that talked to the sec u.s. securities and exchange commission about bitcoin and that never came up. so it feels like there's probably something a little bit deeper when you're hearing any of these excuses and it's just about trying to understand what that really is. i think it's just about losing power, effectively."
Interviewer,"One of the interesting things about bitcoin is how the incentives align. recently there was a little bit of a controversy with some of the companies that are doing bitcoin mining, and a software upgrade that's going to bring new privacy to bitcoin called taproot, which is in the process of activating right now, which is very exciting, but one of these companies, they weren't signaling for taproot. and then there was this huge community backlash and the company was actually forced to come out with a video message and say 'sorry, we're definitely going to signal."
Dorsey,It was awesome.
Interviewer,Where a corporation is virtue signaling for censorship-resistance and privacy? what do you see when you look at stuff like that?
Dorsey,It was awesome the community could change the path and the mindset. i think it's incredible. i don't know why it didn't happen sooner but it's just another lesson for any company trying to get into the space.
Interviewer,There's a lot of people who say wall street's just going to control bitcoin. they are just going to make it a tool for themselves. this is a nice example of how that's probably not the case.
Dorsey,"It can't and it never will, it never will. and the more companies, small, big, that try to demonstrate that and try to offset their corporateness by doing things that are more supportive of the community such as creating a square crypto-like thing, such as creating a cryptocurrency open patent alliance copa-like thing to give up bitcoin patents to protect the community, it becomes more and more resilient every single day."
Interviewer,"I often think about how the world is focused on the micro-movements of the bitcoin exchange rate versus the dollar. and meanwhile this incredible foundational upgrade has essentially been transformed into reality by the users and nobody is paying attention to this. it's kind of interesting, right, it's almost like running interference for the real revolution."
Dorsey,"It's working, it's incredible."
Interviewer,"I wanted to hit another topic. we hear a lot about bitcoin's energy use. and you all at square just put out a paper with ark that described how actually, bitcoin mining might incentivize the adoption of renewable energy and it may actually help unlock renewable sources that are stranded or otherwise unused around the world. can you talk to us a little bit about why you have this belief or philosophy that bitcoin mining is actually helpful for our species and our planet?"
Dorsey,"You just look at the economics of it and ultimately miners have to make a profit. and getting cheap renewable energy maximizes their potential for profit. it's really that simple. and i thought i had an agreement with some notable figures out there, and that seemed to change in a matter of weeks and now it's in a weird kind of place. but i believe fully that bitcoin over time and today does incentivize more renewable energy. and i think it does incentivize more awareness around how we're getting that power and gives people more freedom to convert unused, wasted power into something that provides value for billions of people around the world."
Interviewer,Just a couple facts i'd throw out to the audience. the u.s. government this year is decommissioning for political reasons more nuclear power than is necessary to essentially power the entire bitcoin network. we need to think carefully about energy and waste and the environment but there's more than meets the eye here and i'd encourage all of you to dig in and learn more about bitcoin mining.
Dorsey,"When i paired that with doing some writing or some reading over the weekend, i just found that i got so much more done during those fasting periods because i was so focused. it just felt like i had much more time to really think and to work in that moment. it's a psychological response but it was felt enough like i want to pull the thread on that a little bit more and see what's there."
Interviewer,"I have a master's degree in physiology, biomechanics, and human nutrition. i've spent the past two decades competing in some of the most masochistic events on the planet from sealfit kokoro, spartan agoge, and the world's toughest mudder, the 13 ironman triathlons, brutal bow hunts, adventure races, spearfishing, plant foraging, free diving, bodybuilding and beyond. i combine this intense time in the trenches with a blend of ancestral wisdom and modern science, search the globe for the world's top experts in performance, fat loss, recovery, hormones, brain, beauty, and brawn to deliver you this podcast."
Dorsey,"Thanks, ben. really excited to talk with you."
Interviewer,"Yeah. i actually had, i had no clue that you were interested in or really focused on health or fitness or nutrition. and so, i thought it would be fun to talk a little bit about what your habits are and how you keep yourself put together running in many directions as you do. of course, i know that, not that i want to focus on this, it seems from what i can tell, there are all sorts of controversy around you and your company right now and i'm curious."
Dorsey,"I mean, i have a bunch. i've learned a lot from your podcast and others that are similar. but i guess i start with, it took me some time to realize this but i learned best through experimentation. i want to experience something and i give myself a week or a month, depending on the practice to really figure out if it has some transformational capability for what i'm currently going through and then organize my life more around that. i'll say that my routine today is completely different than my routine three years ago but i feel like i have a lot of it dialed in based on what i'm currently experiencing in terms of stress and just what i have to do every day."
Interviewer,"Yeah. go ahead. i think it'd be fun to geek out on some of the stuff that you do. i would imagine that you, like a lot of people, don't really adopt a lot of stress mitigation tactics until things bite you in the ass and you realize that you actually have to begin to control some amount of cortisol and do things like sleep optimization and stress strategies. so, just fill me in. we can take as deep a dive as you want. what kind of things do you do?"
Dorsey,"Well, i guess i'd rank them by impact. one is around just mental health, and the biggest impact there has been meditation. number two has been around physical health, and the biggest impact there has been more exercise and sleep. and three has been around diet. so, just to go through all three, i've been meditating for about 20 years. i originally just started playing around with it because i heard it from someone. i read some things and it wasn't a practice; it was more, i would take five minutes, i would take ten minutes to try to figure out what to do."
Interviewer,You mean vipassana like the full 10-day getaway?
Dorsey,"Yeah. i did my first 10-day meditation last year just outside of dallas, texas. i wanted to do it during a time that was more down than my normal day. so, i did it in between the 21st of december and the 1st of the new year. so, i was actually coming out of silence on the day of the new year, which was amazing and symbolic to me, but it also allowed me to, during that time, things just go a little bit slower at work and it enabled me to be confident in, number one, like 00:10:59 _______ you're silent, and that means you're giving up all reading material."
Interviewer,Geez.
Dorsey,"It was intense and i love, in my experiments, i love going to the extreme and then walking back a bit just to find the balance for me, but that was my first time and i, day two was extremely challenging. day six was probably my hardest. at the middle of the day, i looked around at one point and everyone else looked like they were enlightened and there were all these buddhas and they were getting something i just was not able to understand and able to get or to feel."
Interviewer,What kind of things do you eat when you're on those retreats for those two meals a day protocol?
Dorsey,"It's all vegetarian. you have breakfast and you have lunch and you're not allowed to eat afternoon. you have tea at 5:00 p.m. newer students can also have like a small bit of fruit, but your meal is really a vegetarian meal at the start of the day. so, breakfast and lunch. every day, i wake up and i would look forward to two things; hot oatmeal and then honey nut cheerios. and there was one day, i remember, i think it was actually day seven when the oatmeal was cold and i'm like, ""oh man, this is my one thing."
Interviewer,Are you saying you were looking forward to honey nut cheerios after the retreat or they had honey nut cheerios during the vipassana?
Dorsey,"They had honey nut cheerios during the vipassana. this is a very, very western, "
Interviewer,I was going to say i didn't know that was an ancestral healing food.
Dorsey,"Completely different, completely different from when i did my second meditation which was the end of last year in myanmar. the food varies upon the surrounding locale. i was in the middle of texas, so one day, we had vegetarian chili for lunch, and that was an amazing day. it's a vegetarian meal. it's pretty light and you're encouraged to go towards healthier options, but at least in texas, they had honey nut cheerios."
Interviewer,"Yeah. so, when you finish up one of those, do you actually carry those meditation skills into life or do you just switch to using, whatever, calm or headspace or transcendental meditation or some other form of meditation?"
Dorsey,"Well, what the practice asks you to commit to is, number one, doing one of these 10-day retreats every year. and then, number two, every day, practice for two hours. you split it between morning and evening."
Interviewer,"Geez, i thought transcendental meditation was a lot because that's 2 by 20 minutes that you agree to during tm. i have no clue."
Dorsey,"Yeah. i practiced that for about a year as well, but then i found vipassana. ideally, as soon as you wake up, you meditate for an hour, and then before bed, you meditate for an hour. that's probably the hardest one for me. i have to get really strict around when i'm going to bed and shutting down all the devices and whatnot. but i've more or less kept up the practice of two hours, two hours a day. i miss it when i travel, but the point is any time you have to practice."
Interviewer,"So, if you're meditating an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening, are you still squeezing in other workout routines? because you mentioned exercise in addition to meditation, but that sounds like a chunk of time."
Dorsey,"Yeah. this is what i've been experimenting with a lot. for two years, i would wake up and i would meditate, and then i would walk into work, and my office is five miles away. so, through a combination of changing what i wore and specifically my shoes, and also my route, that allowed me to get that down to an hour and 15 minutes. every day, i was walking into work, and rain or shine, i would start at, i'd wake up at around 6:15. i would meditate for an hour."
Interviewer,"That's the actual name of the bike, a tabata bike, or you get on a bike and do a tabata set?"
Dorsey,"I get on the air, like a fan bike."
Interviewer,Okay.
Dorsey,I think it's called the xtreme. i just bought it off the amazon.
Interviewer,"You might have the same one as me. does it have a little button that takes you immediately into the 20 seconds hard, 10 seconds easy, 4-minute tabata set?"
Dorsey,"Yup. that's exactly what i do. it has a big green button. it has a big red button. it has a bunch of other buttons that go into the set. i love the tabata. i love the 7-minute workout just because of the flow of the exercises, resting some body parts and engaging others. and then, the thing i love about the 7-minute workout is i never have an excuse. i don't have a personal trainer. i don't go to a gym. i travel a lot and all i need in order to do a workout every single day is a chair and a wall and my body weight."
Interviewer,"Yeah. now, for the 7-minute workout, are you talking about the actual, the new york times 7-minute workout that was made popular a couple of years ago?"
Dorsey,Yeah. and the best step i found for it is an app called seven. it also allows you to work in some other variations of the 7-minute workout. you can add burpees or you can add more stretches or more core.
Interviewer,"Oh, really?"
Dorsey,"They have one which is the full body, and then i also do a lot of the core exercises, which is again just seven minutes. they have a stretch workout as well. it's very clean. it's very simple and it's always with me."
Interviewer,"I'll link to that one in the shownotes for people. shownotes, by the way, for those you listening in for anything jack and i talked about are going to be over at bengreenfieldfitness.com/jack. there's a couple of bodyweight workout apps i have on my phone, the aaptiv one. i know that's one popular app, but i have a really cheap app that's very simple. it sounds kind of similar to yours. i'll find the name of it and link to it in the shownotes, but basically, you're doing that 7-minute routine every day or just on certain days of the week?"
Dorsey,"Every day, every day."
Interviewer,Okay.
Dorsey,"I need to do at least that because i never have an excuse, even if it's raining outside or i couldn't make to the gym or my trainer is sick or whatnot, which i don't have. i never have an excuse not to workout. so, if i'm in a hotel in the middle of japan, i can still do it and i can still feel like i at least exercise my body in a way that i found to keep me fit. it doesn't build muscle but it does keep me fit, does keep me alert and gives me a jolt of energy."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. by the way, that app that i use is called the vt bodyweight app. i just checked on my phone, it just has probably about 20 different bodyweight workouts in it, kind of similar to that 7-minute routine. but the weighted vest can work really well because i do that 7-minute workout sometimes and i have a vest. it's hyperwear. it's like a really tight fitting weighted vest. you can get it in just like 20 pounds, and a lot of times, 20 pounds is enough to just jack your heart rate up for that 7-minute workout."
Dorsey,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,"Yeah. so, it's like super slow training. it's just a one single set to failure. it takes 15 to 18 minutes for the workout but it's one single set to failure for chest press, some kind of pulling motion like a pull-up or a pull-down, shoulder press, row, and then some kind of a leg press or a squat. but you just do one set, time under tension for like two to three minutes for each set to absolute failure. that works really well because the one thing i notice about that bodyweight workout, like the new york times or any of the rest, just from a peer strength or bone density standpoint, sometimes you got to load the muscle."
Dorsey,"Yeah. and even with us having our workout, you do squats, for instance, and a step-up on a chair. with that, i'll mix in the medicine ball or the kettlebells. i'm just at a little bit more resistance and weight to it. so, just experimenting a bunch, but where i want to get to eventually is more building strength, and that i think is the next iteration for me. the other thing on physical health that has had probably the largest impact just in terms of how i feel but also mental clarity is sauna and cold."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Dorsey,"So, i love that for the feeling. i recently discovered near-infrared. i recently purchased a saunaspace, which is a little company out of columbia, missouri that handmakes near-infrared saunas. it's a light array of four incandescent bulbs. the cool thing about it is it's actually in this little tent. so, it's really portable. i put it in my garage next to where i do my workouts and whatnot. and the tent itself is also emf shielded. so, if i were to bring my phone in there, for instance, there's no signal whatsoever."
Interviewer,"Yeah. saunaspace is one, they're one of the few saunas that actually does low emf, near-infrared. i mean, i use the clearlight. that's a mix of a bunch of different infrared spectrums. so, it's a little different but the saunaspace is more like a tent that you get inside, like a large tent that you get inside versus a wooden unit like the clearlight. but the saunaspace, they also sell their bulbs. y0u can just buy their near-infrared bulbs and outfit anything."
Dorsey,"Exactly. i have one of those separate solo bulbs right at my standing desk at home so when i do work, i just flip that on and i'm still going to benefit from the near-infrared. yes, there's a little tent and there's a stool, a freestanding stool in the middle of it. and on the far wall of it is an array of four lights and you flip them on and you sit in one position facing forward, for instance, facing the lights for five minutes, and then you can rotate every five minutes four times."
Interviewer,"It's more of a deep sweat like the photons actually penetrate a lot more deeply into tissue, which is why it's popular for, if you have high heavy metals and you're returning from travel or you've eaten a lot of crappy food, that's where those things come in incredibly handy."
Dorsey,"Yeah. it feels more restorative, whereas the dry sauna, the traditional finnish sauna feels a lot more relaxing. now i use the finnish sauna more for weekends when i just want to really relax, and then go in the ice tub. it's just like you going out of that cycle after it's finished, you just feel like an entirely new person. it's amazing, whereas the saunaspace feels more like daily restorative kind of clarifying and cleansing."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Dorsey,"So, today, my routine is a little bit different, and that i wake up a little bit earlier. i do my meditation. i do my 7-minute workout, and then i go into the saunaspace for about 23 minutes before i do my walk. on my tuesdays and thursdays, i think i heard this from your podcast but focusing more on the strength building exercises between the hours of 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. have a greater efficiency. so, i've been moving some of my workouts to that timeframe."
Interviewer,"It's kind of hard in my opinion because, for me, i'm wired up to eat the frog, like i want to get up and just get that hard thing that kind of sucks over in the morning, which is usually like the high-intensity weight training workout or the interval training workout. but yeah, i mean if you wait until the afternoon or the evening, your body temperature is peaked, your testosterone peaks, your post-workout protein synthesis, your grip strength, all these things happen that make that a more conducive time to do a hard workout."
Dorsey,"Exactly. and that's exactly what i found. i know that if i do it in the morning, it's done and i feel like i have a win for the day. but i'm not as focused as i might be in the afternoon. in the afternoon, i'm a lot more focused but it's all burdened by what happened in the day earlier. it might be in a lot of mental stress or whatnot and that kind of takes away and adds some excuse as to why not to go as hard. but i do feel more focused in the afternoon, but it leaves more room for not doing it than i like."
Interviewer,"Yeah, exactly. like it's just a little bit harder to get it started. i find an extra cup of coffee or chomping on a piece of nicotine gum usually gets my ass on the garage to do it, but i typically use some sort of chemical to get out there and do the hard thing in the afternoon or evening after a stressful day. by the way, you mentioned the chiller system that you use. i interviewed rick rubin last year and he has a pretty complex and very cool, pun intended, chiller system down his place in kauai and in malibu."
Dorsey,"Yeah. that is exactly what i have. it's not a steel tub; it's a cedar tub, but to turn it into a hot tub but it does take some time to do that. when i was doing it every day, i would do it in the morning and it would start chilling at like 4:00 in the morning to get down to about 37 degrees. it's also really cold here in san francisco in the morning so it doesn't need much help, but usually, when i would get in, it would be about 37 degrees, max 42."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Dorsey,"But yeah, the chiller is far away from it so you don't hear it and it just does its thing."
Interviewer,"Yeah. a lot of people who are on a budget, they'll get the chest freezers and do the same thing. i think it was luke storey in l.a. i actually published his cold pool setup as well. i'll link to that in the shownotes for folks, but he uses instead of chlorine, just like a little bit of food grade hydrogen peroxide in the water every now and again. each time that he bays, he gets out and puts a little bit of food grade hydrogen peroxide in there. and apparently, that does a pretty good job keeping it clean without the use of chlorine if you don't have something like an ozonator, which also helps it to stay clean without the use of chemicals."
Dorsey,"Yeah. i mean, nothing has given me more mental confidence than being able to go straight from room temperature into the cold."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Dorsey,"I mean, just making that switch, especially in the morning, going into an ice-cold tub from just being warm in bed is, it just unlocks this thing in my mind and i feel like if i can will myself to do that thing that seems so small but hurts so much, i can do nearly anything."
Interviewer,"Anything that tones the vagus nerve will do that. that activates the parasympathetic nervous system and there's nothing like cold, and especially cold with your face under to do that, if you can train yourself not to take that, like the mammalian dive reflex when you come up and just stay absolutely stone-faced breathing through your nose. that's a good sign you're able to control a lot of external stress."
Dorsey,"Exactly. and it took me some time to get there, but now all my showers are cold showers. i don't do hot anymore. even washing off, i try to do entirely cold. for me, it's been better than caffeine in terms of waking me up and focusing me. it's also like something i have to overcome every single day. do i really have to do this? yes, i'm going to do it."
Interviewer,"Yup, exactly. i mean, there are so many side benefits. you get a nitric oxide release. a lot of people will go cold hot, cold hot, which i actually like. one of my guests, ray cronise, actually uses that as kind of a fat loss tactic for a lot of his clients as they'll do a five-minute shower morning and evening with 20 seconds cold, 10 seconds hot, basically like a hot-cold contrast shower. that's pretty useful for recovery as well if you don't have a sauna chiller setup."
Dorsey,"Nope, not at all. the only supplements i take are daily multivitamin and vitamin c, a lot of vitamin c. i don't know why. i just haven't found the discipline yet to be on something consistently. i do the athletic greens every now and then, but if it's not part of my core diet, i haven't found myself really sticking with it with the exception of a multivitamin. but i do want to explore more of that. that goes into the third aspect around diet. that's where i do want to experiment a little bit more and play with."
Interviewer,"Yeah. so, you have a little bit more of like a tibetan monk approach. those guys do a lot of deep meditation and production of theta brain waves, et cetera, but they don't use any exogenous supplements. they make their own medicine, so to speak. my take on it is that i think anybody using, whatever, chinese adaptogenic herbs or phosphatidylserine or any of these supplements that seem to do a good job controlling stress have no business doing so until they have learned how to make their own medicine by doing things like meditation, breath work, yoga, good sleep cycles, et cetera."
Dorsey,Yeah. your podcast on more of the supplemental versus ancestral wisdom that you did not too long ago i think was just so on point and resonated with me so much. this concept of we're born with what we need and figuring out how to unlock it naturally.
Interviewer,"Right. and then, the biohacks are the icing on the cake. the near-infrared sauna is the icing on the cake to your walk where you're getting outside in the sunshine or using something like binaural beats or some meditation app is the icing on the cake for doing something like free meditation with just your own body."
Dorsey,"Yeah. or maybe better thought as mirrors or just kind of reflection of what is possible. i think a lot of technology, just my understanding of technology is, a lot of it is a crutch, and a crutch isn't a bad thing. it helps us get from one point to another. but i think in realizing the effectiveness of it and the tool, what it's really doing is ideally showing us what we're already capable of and how we might unpick the pieces and then pick the puzzle to unlock it ourselves."
Interviewer,"Who's that ray, ray cronise?"
Dorsey,"Cronise. he does it in the cold. when i'm doing my walk, i wear jeans, i wear my running sandals, and i wear a t-shirt, and it's 47 degrees out and the sun feels amazing but it's cold and i'm moving fast and it's just an amazing feeling. it's uncomfortable at times but it feels amazing when the day does warm up or when i do get to the office and i can feel the effects on my energy and i can also feel the effects on my sleep."
Interviewer,"Yeah. i look like a total wanker up here when i'm going on my winter walks because i've got my son's big harry potter gryffindor hat on and then my giant camouflage gloves and my boots, and then i'm wearing shorts. and so, i've found a relatively isolated farm road back behind my house where i don't need to freak too many people out. but yeah, once you get used to it, it's actually very refreshing. and admittedly, i'll often jump in my hot tub afterwards for dessert."
Dorsey,"Yeah. that is the word. it's refreshing. it feels like the crisp air in the morning is just, it's an amazing feeling. it makes you, it's just this one of those take-back moments where you're like, ""wow, i'm alive!"" and it's an exclamation point, you know."
Interviewer,"Plus, when you consider that walking increases your brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and so does cold. you're stacking two things that allow you to think better and kind of access that whole sage advice to either walk on it or sleep on it to solve problems. and that's what i'll do in many cases is just leave all the technology at home and go for a walk and often come back with the answer. and a lot of times, if you're walking in the cold, i find you're even more sharp when you return."
Dorsey,"Yeah. and without putting a lot of aggressive stress on my body where, like a lot of people have asked me, ""why don't you just run to work?"" i don't feel like, i want to have the same sense of joy because it would feel more as if i'm trying to get to point b as quickly as possible rather than enjoying the walk and enjoying what i'm listening to, like thinking deeply with which i get on the walk. but also, in my runs, it just feels like it's putting so much stress on various parts of my body, and walking is a lot more predictable and lowers stress."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. now to your diet, what's that look like right now?"
Dorsey,"This is where i've also experimented a ton both in terms of what i eat and when i eat. i was vegan for two years. when i get into something, i just go hard into it. i went cold turkey in the veganism. i didn't really understand anything about the diet. i thought i would have to supplement like crazy, which i did. having all these vitamins to make up for what i thought i was missing and at one point midway through, i went back to my parents for thanksgiving and my mom opened the door and she said, ""jack, you're orange."
Interviewer,"Carotenemia, there's the name for that."
Dorsey,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. it took my mom to really push me back. and then, she also said like, ""i don't know what to cook for you. you're not making it easy for me."" i come from st. louis missouri, and midway through, i moved back to st. louis. at the time, it's really hard to be a vegan in st. louis, missouri, at least the way that i approached it. i ended that and then went to more of a paleo diet and did the butter coffee in the morning and stuck with a very strict paleo diet and experimented with that for a year."
Interviewer,"Yeah. i've spoken to a surprising number of executives and busy people who do very well on the one meal a day routine. i feel like i could pull off that routine if i wasn't still competing professionally in things like obstacle course racing and as a fitness guy trying to maintain a certain amount of muscle and trying out new workouts all the time during the day, but just from a pure time standpoint, not having to stop to take a meal. and then, all the benefits that you get from what's typically and a 16 to 20-hour intermittent fast every single day."
Dorsey,"Well, i think the two things i noticed right away, like the first two weeks were really hard. but the two impacts i would point to is after i got over those first two weeks, during the day, i feel so much more focused. i think it's just this very ancestral looking for where the food is. you have this very focused point of mind in terms of this drive. certainly, the time back from breakfast and lunch allowed me to focus more on what my day is. but the 00:48:26 unin has actually been on my sleep."
Interviewer,"Do you track any of that, by the way? do you self-quantify? do you wear like a ring or a wristband, anything like that?"
Dorsey,"Recently, i got a new oura ring and i've been tracking it for the past four months. yeah, i can get a lot more predictive around like if i drink too much wine, i know my ram sleep is going to go down. i know my readiness score is going to go down. if i keep to a consistent schedule of sleep, i get higher scores on ram and i get much deeper sleep as well. so, that's been a new dynamic. it's just to check how i'm doing."
Interviewer,"Yeah. it's very interesting. a lot of your protocol is based around this idea of hormesis, which we know induces cellular programmed cell death and cell cleanup and longevity benefits, down-regulates a lot of anabolic pathways and up-regulates a lot of catabolic pathways. but a lot of the things you're doing would kill you if you did them in large amounts, like heat, cold, high-intensity exercise for short periods of time, fasting. even like plant intake is actually, it's technically a hormetic stress."
Dorsey,"Exactly, exactly. the fasting has been a new dimension. i've been doing the one meal a day for two years but the more prolonged fasting has been something i'm experimenting recently. the first time i did it like day three, i felt like i was hallucinating. it was a weird state to be in. but as i did it the next two times, it just became so apparent to me how much of our days are centered around meals and how, the experience i had was when i was fasting for much longer, how time really slowed down."
Interviewer,"Well, do you have a family?"
Dorsey,"I'm single, but i have, a lot of what i do to make up for that is trying to have dinners with my best friends as much as possible and try to enjoy each other's company over wine and a good meal."
Interviewer,"Yeah. i was going to say that the reason i ask is for me as a family man, it's like meals are almost like the gathering time, breakfast in the morning, and i don't really eat breakfast 'til midday because i do an intermittent fast, but i stand there with the kids and chat with them about the day and usually give them a little lecture out of some book i'm using to help build their character while they're having breakfast. and then, lunches are right now solo, although we're starting the kids basically into kind of like a homeschooling/unschooling scenario next year."
Dorsey,"Yeah, exactly. i do want to have family at some point. i feel like right now, i'm just taking advantage of the fact that i do have a lot of time that i can dictate to practices like this that don't impact someone else and how they're living. and i want to experiment as much as i can to figure out what is most impactful, what i can lock in, and then as that progresses, how to introduce them to more of a family life as well."
Interviewer,"Yeah. i seem to recall that i saw you, and correct me if i'm wrong, it was a few years ago. i briefly met you with joe de sena. i think it was you at a spartan race. am i remembering correctly?"
Dorsey,"No, that wasn't me. i haven't done a spartan race yet."
Interviewer,Okay. it was somebody else from twitter.
Dorsey,"I think i'm there yet, i think i'm there yet."
Interviewer,Okay. do you have your eyeball on anything like that?
Dorsey,"I would like to. i'd love to understand what's a good start, but i haven't gotten into a lot of the challenges like that just yet, but i'd like to start because i do appreciate how that immediate sense of near competition emboldens and focuses. i think that's what's lacking in my singular practice right now. a lot of what i do i do completely alone and in solitude, and it's really, it only benefits if i can raise the bar on myself versus someone else raising the bar on me."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Dorsey,"So, it's something i've recognized as a gap, but i haven't found the right way to get into it just yet."
Interviewer,"Yeah. i don't know. i don't know if it's a gap. for me, whenever i work out with people, if i drop into a crossfit box or i have a buddy over for a workout or occasionally people come up here to record a podcast and we go out to the garage and exercise, i just always push so much harder when i'm with people. i feel like i would get injured if i frequently worked out with people. i mean, 95% of the time i work out by myself and then i use, showing up to a spartan race or a triathlon or whatnot is kind of like the group fitness scenario."
Dorsey,"Yeah. i mean, there are trade-offs, but the benefit of doing with other people is that push, but also i think you have higher fidelity of learning in terms of what other people are doing or what tweaks they're making to a workout that has been more regimented or traditional for you. i think the gap in my current practice is that i don't have that balance where someone as an observer can observe what i'm doing and say, ""hey, you do this a little bit differently and you get a little bit more efficient or a little bit more productive or have a gain in this way."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. is there anything else you're doing in your routine that you think would be interesting for folks, anything that you've discovered and found to be incredibly helpful? i'd never heard, for example, that 7-minute app. i'll be downloading that. i think it's a good tip for people, that chiller system setup that you have. but anything else that you've discovered that you think people would benefit from?"
Dorsey,"I think the biggest thing for me is just like what's the new thing i can experiment with. i listen to your podcasting on freediving recently. i can swim but i'm not a great swimmer, and i think i've realized i do have some significant fear of the ocean and just like going deep into it. what's interesting to me about what was described on freediving is this perfect balance of breathing discipline, really stretching your mental capability in terms of what you think is possible."
Interviewer,Is that a blog or just from twitter?
Dorsey,It's mainly through twitter right now.
Interviewer,Okay.
Dorsey,"Since i was 14, i have journaled. so, i do keep a personal journal. i try to do that every single day, usually when i'm wrapping up the day. i need very simple things for me to continue them every day. so, i just use the notes app on the iphone. it's searchable. it's accessible all the time. it's in the cloud, so i can get to it even if i don't have my phone. it's secure. i try to make sure that for whatever practice i'm doing, i look at all the excuses i might have and i figure out how to do it to minimize those excuses, and that's hence 01:03:50 _______."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. assuming you're somewhere where there's a chair and a wall."
Dorsey,Exactly.
Interviewer,"Well, you're basically a human guinea pig for the good of humankind. i like it. i would imagine most people can probably find you on twitter. it's not that difficult. it's @jack. but i will link to everything that jack and i talked about, some of those workout apps, some of the sauna and cold pool setups, a few different podcasts i've done on some of this stuff like that ancestral wisdom versus modern science one he mentioned, and my interview with ray cronise."
Dorsey,I would love that. i would love that. i need to get over some fears but i'm going to do it.
Interviewer,"Yeah. just text me later. he's a good guy for that. anyways, i'll link to all this stuff. just go to bengreenfieldfitness.com/jack. that's bengreenfieldfitness.com/jack. jack, in the meantime, dude, thanks for coming on the show and sharing all this stuff with us."
Dorsey,"Thank you so much and thank you for your work. i appreciate you and all the effort you put out to share what you're experimenting with, and also though i've just amplified a bunch of the stuff that you're finding that would take me hours and months and years to access in the form of listening to you in the sauna."
Interviewer,"Yeah. well, like i say, i put coffee up my ass first to let everybody else know what it feels like. that's my gig. alright, folks. well, i'm ben greenfield along with jack dorsey signing out from bengreenfieldfitness.com. have an amazing week."
Dorsey,I am. can you hear me?
Interviewer,Thank you. the floor is yours.
Dorsey,Thank you to the members of the judiciary committee for the opportunity to speak with the american people about twitter and your concerns around censorship and suppression of a specific news article and generally what we saw in the 2020 us elections conversation. we were called here today because of an enforcement decision we made against the new york post based on a policy we created in 2018 to prevent twitter from being used to spread hacked materials.
Interviewer,"Thank you, mr. dorsey. mr. zuckerberg."
Dorsey,"Well, i think you pointed out that we are facing something that feels impossible. we are required to help increase the health of the public conversation while at the same time, ensuring that as many people as possible can participate. and in order to do so, we need to make policies so that people feel safe and they feel free to express themselves. to minimize threats of abuse, of harassment, of misleading information, of organized campaigns to artificially amplify or influence a particular conversation."
Interviewer,"Thank you. mr. zuckerberg, very quickly please. what did you hear?"
Dorsey,I don't believe so. i think that would be very challenging.
Interviewer,Okay. do you agree with that mr. zuckerberg?
Dorsey,"I think we need to align around the problem that we're trying to solve. and there are many solutions to solving those problems, but i think we also have to focus our efforts on what is going to have the greatest impact. and we believe that the greatest impact is going to be found in how we deal with algorithms, how we use those algorithms, because they are responsible for showing us what we see or what we don't see and there needs to be more choice in their use."
Interviewer,"Do you agree with that, mr. zuckerberg?"
Dorsey,"No, i have not."
Interviewer,"I would encourage both of you to see it. so here's what i think we're going to do on the committee over time. my hope is to ask the question more directly, are these social media sites addictive? do they have a public health component that needs to be addressed? for years we thought tobacco was a great thing. we found out tobacco was not such a great thing. the medical science around these websites are becoming very concerning to me, particularly among children and that you can manipulate how many times you watch and you can set these media sites up so that people will constantly interact."
Dorsey,Yes.
Interviewer,Thank you. senator blumenthal.
Dorsey,"Yes, we do. we intend to learn from all of our experience with this election and bring all that learning going forward to make it more robust."
Interviewer,"During the past election, there was rampant disinformation on social media in spanish speaking sites, repeating q anon conspiracies and false claims of election rigging. in my view, you need to do better. will you commit to taking steps to improve content modification for spanish speaking communities before the georgia runoff?"
Dorsey,"Yes, we will in partnership with inaudible 00:42:44 civil rights groups."
Interviewer,"I'd like to know, and perhaps you could submit to me within one week, what additional steps you're going to take because this georgia runoff is underway. as i've indicated, i've seen a backsliding and retrenchment that is very deeply troubling that has enabled the spread of this disinformation, the restarting of certain algorithms, for example, that promote or amplify misinformation is very, very troubling. i think i want to know within a week, what additional steps we are taking to enhance the efforts to stop this kind of amplification and spread."
Dorsey,"We did an under our terms of service, which as you know, everyone agrees to when they sign up for twitter. this was a policy around distribution of hacked materials. we did not want twitter to be a distribution point for hacked materials."
Interviewer,"Well, you do realize that by taking down that story, you probably gave it more prominence and more visibility than it ever would have gotten had you left it alone."
Dorsey,"We realize that and we recognize it as a mistake that we made both in terms of the intention of the policy and also the enforcement action of not allowing people to share it publicly or privately, which is why we corrected it within 24 hours."
Interviewer,"And mr. dorsey, why isn't justice brandeis' formulation in whitney versus california. why shouldn't that apply to the internet platforms like yours? in other words, the cure for bad speech is not censorship, it's more speech. why wouldn't that principle apply to twitter?"
Dorsey,"I think it does apply. all of our policies are focused on encouraging more speech. what we saw and what the market told us was that people would not put up with abuse, harassment, and misleading information that would cause offline harm, and they would leave our service because of it. so our intention is to create clear policy, clear enforcement that enables people to feel that they can express themselves on our service and ultimately trust it."
Interviewer,So it was a business decision.
Dorsey,It was a business decision.
Interviewer,Thank you.
Dorsey,"Yes, it does. we label those tweets when the election has not been called yet, or multiple sources have called it differently."
Interviewer,I'm sorry. i didn't understand that. did you say you have been able to tweet?
Dorsey,No. we have labeled the tweets that would indicate a different result in the election called by multiple sources.
Interviewer,I see. at what point was that done?
Dorsey,"Throughout the period, october 11th to up until today."
Interviewer,"So when the tweet initially came in, how long was it before you quote updated it?"
Dorsey,"We didn't update it. we put a label on it, pointing to the broader conversation. our goal is to connect people with more information around what's happening with the election. that occurred anywhere from five minutes to 30 minutes, but as quickly as we can."
Interviewer,"Thank you, is 30 minutes the maximum time?"
Dorsey,I don't know. we can get you that information crosstalk 00:59:48.
Interviewer,Would you? i'm interested in this. does misinformation about the results of an election and voter fraud relate to civic integrity? why or why not?
Dorsey,"Yes, it does. we also label those tweets that would indicate whether fraud was happening. again, we connect those to larger conversations on platform. so we want to provide context here. that is our goal, providing more context, providing more information."
Interviewer,"Okay. now a specific question, and i'm not sure actually what the answer to this should be, but on november 7, president trump tweeted and i quote, ""i won this election by a lot."" obviously, that's not true. president trump lost the election. the warning label that twitter is applied to the tweet says, and i quote, ""official sources may not have called the race when this was tweeted."" do you believe that label goes far enough to prevent the tweet's harms when the tweet is still visible and not accurate?"
Dorsey,I do because it's not just the surface level label. it points to a collection of news articles of information and conversation that gives you an expansion on what's happening with the election.
Interviewer,"I guess you see my concerns are that these tweets arouse people. it seems to me that the entity that runs this operation ought to have an understanding that when there is a major situation, that the tweets can play a unique role in either reassuring or stirring people up to unacceptable levels. could you comment on that?"
Dorsey,"Well, i agree in inaudible 00:26:54. i know our policy is focused on misleading information around the election and the civic process to provide greater context, to provide additive information so that people can make decisions around what's happening with the election. that is three phases. that's the run-up to the election, that's election day, and also the phase we're in right now. post-election. so our policies and enforcement are focused on providing more information and more context to people in those three phases."
Interviewer,"Well, let me give you a specific. on november 7, president trump tweeted this, ""i won this election by a lot."" that's obviously not true. president trump lost the election. the warning label that twitter has applied to the tweet says, and i quote, ""official sources may not have called the race when this was tweeted."" now, here's the question. does that label do enough to prevent the tweet's harms when the tweet is still visible and is not accurate?"
Dorsey,"I believe it's really important that we show people a broader context, and that is the intention of the label. it is not just text below a tweet. it is a link to connect to a much larger conversation and news articles across the spectrum."
Interviewer,"Well, give me an example of what would have to happen before the situation would warrant a stronger response?"
Dorsey,"Well, we did have stronger responses during election day and the week after where we did put an interstitial, meaning that you had to click through to see the content of the tweet and it limited spread for anything that went against our civic integrity policy, including premature calls to election results."
Interviewer,"Well, let me give you one more. on november 12, president trump tweeted a conspiracy theory that 2.7 million votes for him were deleted. the warning label that twitter has applied to that tweet said, ""this claim about election fraud is disputed."" now here's the question. i think it is a tough issue. do you believe this label does enough to prevent the tweet's harms when the tweet is still visible? it's a highly emotional situation, but the tweet has no factual basis."
Dorsey,"But the tweet has a link to more information, to more conversation and more context that informs the situation what's happening. so i do believe that connecting people to the larger conversation, giving them more context is the right path here."
Interviewer,"But they have to move to solicit that contact, right? it's not contained as an addendum to the original tweet."
Dorsey,"The label is an addendum to the original tweet. if you tap on it or click it, you will go to an expansion of the information."
Interviewer,I see. can i ask a question to mr. zuckerberg? is he...
Dorsey,"Well, we evaluated this treat again and we found that we were wrong. there was a mistake and it was due to the fact that we had heightened awareness around government accounts during this time. so that was a mistake. we reverted it."
Interviewer,"Thank you. i appreciate that, and we're going to get back to more of that in a minute and get back to the fact that i understand that mistakes happen, but what we're going to see today is that mistakes happen a whole lot more, almost entirely on one side of the political aisle rather than the other. now, commissioner morgan's statement in that tweet, as was initially taken down, is factual. there's nothing remotely hateful about it, and yet it was taken down."
Dorsey,"I'm not exactly sure what you're asking, but we certainly-"
Interviewer,"Simple question, do you have a list of people, your users or content creators who have had some adverse action taken against them, either being de-platformed or having their reach altered or something because of the content of their posts?"
Dorsey,"Well, certainly whenever we take an action, it's recorded somewhere in the database, but i'm not sure if that's your intent."
Interviewer,"No, that's helpful. so what i'm hearing from both of you is that while there may not be an actual list, and i'd like you both to check to see if such a list exists, but even if there isn't, there is a defacto list because you have within your databases, records of occasions when this has occurred, and so i'd like to ask both of you, if such a list exists, please send it to me. i'd like to see it. if such a list does not exist, you certainly do have the data necessary in order to generate some and i request as a member of this committee that you generate such a list and provide it to me."
Dorsey,"And we are doing the same, including opening up our apis to researchers to make sure that others are able to see what we may not see ourselves."
Interviewer,"Will that be made available to us? can other people see the results of that study you're going to do, both of you i would ask?"
Dorsey,"And we'll make our reports and findings public as well, so everyone can learn."
Interviewer,"I'll look forward to reading them. i'm actually one member of the senate who will actually read them, so thank you. because you look at some of the things that went on, i know senator blumenthal and others have raised this question about steve bannon putting on a video, think of what it did. it called for the murder, the beheading of dr. fauci and the director of the fbi, christopher ray. just think what that does. i mean the fbi director travels with security all the time, dr."
Dorsey,Is twitter a publisher?
Interviewer,Yes.
Dorsey,"No, we are not, we distribute information."
Interviewer,So what is a publisher?
Dorsey,An entity that is publishing under editorial guidelines and decisions.
Interviewer,"Well, your answer happens to be contrary to the text of federal statute, particular section 230, which defines an information content provider as, ""any person or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through the internet or any other interactive computer service."" let me ask you, was twitter being a publisher when it censored the new york post?"
Dorsey,"No. we have very clear policies on the conduct we enable on the platform and if there's a violation, we take enforcement action. and people choose to commit to those policies and to those terms of service."
Interviewer,"Except your policies are applied in a partisan and selective matter. you claim it was hacked materials and yet you didn't block the distribution of the new york times story that alleged to talk about president trump's tax returns, even though a federal statute makes it a crime to distribute someone's tax returns without their consent. you didn't block any of that discussion, did you?"
Dorsey,Our policy was focused on distribution of the actual hack materials and the new york times-
Interviewer,Did you block the discussion of the president's tax return material?
Dorsey,"And in the new york times case, we interpreted as reporting about the hacked materials, not distribution of inaudible 02:06:58."
Interviewer,Did you block edward snowden when he illegally released material?
Dorsey,I don't have the answer to that.
Interviewer,"The answer is no. you having used this in a selective matter, let me ask you were you being a publisher when you forced politico, another journalistic outlet, to take down their tweets on a topic that you had deemed impermissible?"
Dorsey,No. we were enforcing our policy and our terms of service.
Interviewer,"So on october 15th, jake sherman, a reporter at politico, tweeted the following, ""i tweeted a link to the new york post story right after it dropped yesterday morning, i immediately reached out to the biden campaign to see if they had any answer. i wish i'd given the story a closer read before tweeting it, twitter suspended me."" so you actually have a reporter reporting on a story, asking the other side for comment. and twitter says, ""hi jake sherman, your account @jakesherman has been locked for violating twitter rules."
Dorsey,"No. and that account is not suspended, it fell afoul of the hacked materials policy, we realized that there was an error in that policy and the enforcement and we corrected that within 24 hours."
Interviewer,"Hold on, i'm literally looking at the tweet from twitter that says, ""your account has been locked."" you're you're telling me that this is not an accurate... "
Dorsey,That's a lock and can be unlocked when you delete the offending tweet.
Interviewer,"I understand that you have the star chamber power, your answer is always, ""well, once we silence you, we can choose to allow you to speak,"" but you are engaged in publishing decisions. let me shift to a different topic, mr. dorsey, does voter fraud exist?"
Dorsey,I don't know for certain.
Interviewer,Are you an expert in voter fraud?
Dorsey,"No, i'm not."
Interviewer,"Well, why then is twitter right now putting purported warnings on virtually any statement about voter fraud?"
Dorsey,We're simply linking to a broader conversation so that people have more information.
Interviewer,"No, you're not. you put up a page that says, ""voter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the united states."" that's not linking to a broader conversation, that's taking a disputed policy position. and you're a publisher when you're doing that, you're entitled to take a policy position, but you don't get to pretend you're not a publisher and get a special benefit under section 230 as a result."
Dorsey,That link is pointing to a broader conversation with tweets from publishers and people all around the country.
Interviewer,"Mr. dorsey, would the following statement violate twitter's policies, ""absentee ballots remained the largest source of potential voter fraud.""?"
Dorsey,I imagine that we would label it so that people can have more context and read through.
Interviewer,"Okay. how about this quote, ""voter fraud is particularly possible where third-party organizations, candidates, and political party activists are involved in handling absentee ballots,"" would you flag that as potentially misleading?"
Dorsey,"I don't know the specifics of how we might enforce that, but i imagine a lot of these would have a label pointing people to a bigger conversation, a broader conversation."
Interviewer,"Well, you're right, you would label them because you've taken the political position right now that voter fraud doesn't exist. i would note both of those quotes come from the carter-baker commission on federal election reform. that is democratic president, jimmy carter and former secretary of state james baker and twitter's position is essentially voter fraud does not exist. are you aware that just two weeks ago in the state of texas, a woman was charged with 134 counts of election fraud? are you aware of that?"
Dorsey,I'm not aware of that.
Interviewer,"If i tweeted that statement with a link to the indictment, would you put a warning on it that says, ""well, the democratic party position right now is voter fraud doesn't exist.""?"
Dorsey,"I don't think it's useful to get into hypotheticals, but i don't believe so."
Interviewer,"You don't believe so. well, we're going to test that because i'm going to tweet that and we'll see what you put on it."
Dorsey,That's exactly what we want to do.
Interviewer,"I'm sorry, mr. dorsey, i didn't hear you."
Dorsey,"That's exactly what we're pushing for as we think about building upon 230, is transparency not just-"
Interviewer,Is that a yes that you'll answer those questions in writing?
Dorsey,"Transparency not just of outcomes, but also our process as well."
Interviewer,Is that a yes that you will answer those questions in writing?
Dorsey,We'll certainly look into it and see what we can do.
Interviewer,"And actually answered them and not give lawyerly doublespeak about why you're not going to give specifics, answer them. will you commit to this committee that you will answer those questions?"
Dorsey,We're going to work to answering broader transparency around outcomes?
Interviewer,"All right, that's a no. mr. zuckerberg, how about you? will you commit that facebook will answer those specific questions cataloging the number of instances in which democrats in '16, '18 and '20 had been silenced versus the number of instances in which republicans have been silenced on facebook?"
Dorsey,"From a historical perspective, 230 has created so much goodness and innovation and if we didn't have those protections when we started twitter 14 years ago, we could not start. and that's what we're most concerned with is making sure that we continue to enable new companies to contribute to the internet, to contribute to conversation. and we do have to be very careful and thoughtful about changes to 230 because going one direction might box out new competitors and new startups, going another might create a demand for an impossible amount of resources to handle it, and going at another might encourage even more blocking of voices or what's being raised here, which is censorship of voices and changing the internet dramatically."
Interviewer,So let's...  go ahead.
Dorsey,"So i believe that we can build upon 230. i think we can make sure that we're earning people's trust by encouraging more transparency around content moderation and our process of it, i think we need much more straightforward appeals. and i think the biggest point to really focus on going forward is algorithms and how they are managing and creating these experiences and being able to have choice in how to use those algorithms on platforms like ours."
Interviewer,"Let me get into a specific, mr. zuckerberg, october 10th, detroit free press reported, ""13 men charged thursday in a conspiracy to kidnap michigan governor gretchen whitmer used facebook and secure messaging apps to connect and plot their attack. the group's use of facebook spans almost a full year, members began-"""
Dorsey,"Yeah, this is obviously not something we interview for, and even have an understanding of when people are in the company. and with that understanding, we intend to make sure that both our policy and our enforcement is objective. and i realized that it looks rather opaque and certainly the outcomes might not always match up with our intention and the perception of those outcomes may not match up. but that's why i think it's so important that we're not just transparent around our policies, but the actual operations of our content moderation."
Interviewer,"Thank you. and i wish it were true, that these were all easy, objective questions. that the questions were, if somebody says, ""is the sky green?"" that's an objective question, that the sky is blue and white, not green. but most of the things we're talking about here and the places where you're applying content moderation labels are not really simply objective questions. they're mostly subjective questions. if we talked about medicare for all being easily paid for inside a ten-year budget window on assumptions, x, y, and z, that don't raise taxes, that's not true."
Dorsey,"Thank you. well, if we're considering three to five years out, i think the realization that a centralized global content moderation system does not scale and we need to rethink how we operate these services. and i would point to, we certainly need transparency around any process that we have and around the practice and the outcomes of those iterations. but i think having more control so that individuals can moderate themselves, pushing the power of moderation to the edges and to our customers and to the individuals using the service, is something we'll see more of."
Interviewer,"Thank you. i've appreciated my interaction with both of your companies in the run-up to this, and i think both of you said some meaty things there about ways we can move toward greater transparency. so i'll follow up again. thank you, mr. chairman."
Dorsey,"Well, to build off your previous question, i do think there is a difference, as mark said, and i do think there are many coordinated campaigns to manipulate the public conversation, to divide people all around the world, to confuse them and generally to distract. and we do have policies and enforcement to prevent as much of this as possible. it is a growing threat and it shows no signs of slowing down. bots are one way that entities do this. sometimes it may look like a bot, but it's actually a human that it is organized with other humans for a particular agenda."
Interviewer,"Let me just interject mr. dorsey real quick. as a baseline proposition, do you agree that a bot does not deserve a voice on your platform? that it should be actual people and organizations?"
Dorsey,I don't agree with that as a high-level. i think we should be labeling bots so that people have greater context for what they're interacting with.
Interviewer,Fair enough.
Dorsey,There are plenty of bots on our service that provide a valuable function and i wouldn't want to take that away.
Interviewer,"Let me ask both of you, and maybe you can supplement this with the answer in writing for the record because my time is getting short and this is a complicated question, but the question is when does it matter to twitter and when does it matter to facebook to know who the actual entity is who is using your platform? let me start with you, mr. dorsey, since mr. zuckerberg went first last time. and you can defer to a written answer if you'd like, because my time is running very short."
Dorsey,"We'll add to this conversation with a written answer, but i do believe that pseudonymity is important. we have seen its usefulness with activists and with whistle blowers, and i think that is critical. but certainly there are times, and it's charged by the severity of potential outcomes, where we need to dig into identity and take actions."
Interviewer,"We'll follow up with that. and let me just ask you, since my time has expired, mr. zuckerberg, to respond or have your organization respond in writing. thank you."
Dorsey,"I'm not aware of internal research, but we can follow up. but i do think, like anything else, these tools can be addictive and we should be aware of that, acknowledge it, and make sure that we are making our customers aware of better patterns of usage. so the more information the better here."
Interviewer,Thank you. senator hawley?
Dorsey,"Well, i don't know about the intent on the other side, but i know our own experience was we found it extremely challenging to compete with vine. and ultimately, decided that the ball moved past us and we shut it down. again, i don't know the specifics and the tactics and what was done, but we did find it very, very challenging market to enter even though we existed prior to some of our peers doing the same thing."
Interviewer,"Okay, i'm going to move to something else quickly, instagram and whatsapp. we have some released internal facebook emails in which you, mr. zuckerberg, wrote that instagram was nascent, and if they grow to a large scale, they could be very disruptive to us. and in a later email, you confirmed that one of the purposes of facebook acquiring instagram would be to neutralize a competitor. you wrote those emails that were mentioned in that house report."
Dorsey,"I do think it would be helpful, but it's technically very, very challenging to enforce that. i think a better option is providing more choice to be able to turn off the algorithms or choose a different algorithm so that people can see how it affects one's experience."
Interviewer,"Okay. thank you. and i ask that both of you look at the bill that senator kennedy and i have, the journalism competition and preservation act, to help the content providers negotiate with digital platforms. thank you."
Dorsey,"Absolutely. i mean, even the smallest companies use these tools. we use a tool called tierra 00:03:11:10."
Interviewer,"Yep. i was involved in implementing these in my time in technology sector so i could see why you have these platforms. but mr. zuckerberg, you mentioned you didn't think there was a systematic coordination between google and twitter, but you could conceive of how people in similar professions may have a discussion, have a relationship, maybe talk about it over a beer. so could you see how the skeptic could see how these platforms could be used across platforms to force certain outcomes? let's say you had 100 people at facebook, 100 people at twitter, and 100 people at google that all had a political bent."
Dorsey,We'll follow up with determining the best course of action there.
Interviewer,"Thank you. and then we'll be following up on a series of questions that i'd like to ask that let me get my head around some of the analytics information that i think you almost certainly have and hopefully be willing to share it, but we'll do that in a collaborative way in my office. thank you for being here today."
Dorsey,"So we work with civil rights groups all over the country and around the world to get feedback. we're in constant conversation with them, and we do believe that being more transparent and making our transparency report a lot more robust, which today we still have some gaps, is important for any entity to audit independently of us. we believe that's important, because an audit like that could take away from the work that we need to do. we'd rather provide the information in a raw format so that people can do that work."
Interviewer,"If i heard you right, you aren't going to pursue an independent civil rights audit, but you are going to continue to release data and to consult with civil rights groups. i'd welcome a more thorough answer as to in which way having an independent outside audit would actually harm your transparency efforts."
Dorsey,"I don't mean it would harm it. i mean that we want to provide enough information so that people can do this work independently of us on their own timelines, and that's where we need to make our transparency report more robust. and as i said, we have regular conversations with these groups and take feedback regularly."
Interviewer,"You do, mr. dorsey, have policies against deep fakes or manipulated media against covid-19 misinformation, against things that violate civic integrity, but you don't have a standalone climate change misinformation policy. why not?"
Dorsey,"Well, misleading information, as you are aware, is a large problem. it's hard to define it completely and cohesively. we wanted to scope our approach to start to focus on the highest severity of harm. we focused on three areas, manipulated media, which you mentioned, civic integrity around the election, specifically in public health, specifically around covid. we wanted to make sure that our resources that we have have the greatest impact on where we believe the greatest severity of harm is going to be."
Interviewer,"Well, mr. dorsey, i'll close with this. i cannot think of a greater harm than climate change, which is transforming literally our planet and causing harm to our entire world. i think we're experiencing significant harm as we speak. i recognize the pandemic and misinformation about covid-19, manipulated media also cause harm, but i'd urge you to reconsider that because helping to disseminate climate denialism, in my view, further facilitates and accelerates one of the greatest existential threats to our world."
Dorsey,"And i think the tools are in a state where we can do that more easily. we've obviously been forced to do it with covid, and i don't think it's a state that we will return from. the days of having one centralized massive corporate headquarter in any one particular city are certainly over for us at least, and i think many other entrepreneurs starting companies today."
Interviewer,"Yeah, very good. i really appreciate that, and i think that covid has taught us all a very important lesson. for those to be able to work remotely, i think you will find a greater diversity in thought, which is very important i think for the types of platforms that you both represent."
Dorsey,"Child exploitation is absolutely terrible, and we don't tolerate it on our service at all. we regularly work with law enforcement to address anything that we see, inclusive of the patterns that mark has mentioned. the majority of twitter is public, so we don't have as much activity in private channels, so it's a different approach, but we still see the same activity, and it's one of our highest priorities in terms of the severity of harm."
Interviewer,"Thank you both very much for being accessible to us today. i truly appreciate your input. mr. chairman, thank you."
Dorsey,"So i think mark mentioned this earlier as well. we are doing a retrospective on the effectiveness of all of our actions through the election. we believe the labels point to, as you said, a broader conversation that people can see what's happening with the election and with the results. we don't want to put ourselves in a position of calling an election. that is not our job, so we're pointing to sources and pillars that have traditionally done this in the past, and that is the intention of the policy."
Interviewer,Mr. zuckerberg?
Dorsey,"So we do have a goal around public interest where for global leaders, we do make exceptions in terms of whether, if a tweet violates our terms of service, we leave it up, but we leave it up behind an interstitial, and people are not allowed to share that more broadly, so a lot of the sharing is disabled with the exception of quoting it so that you can add your own conversation on top of it. so if an account suddenly is not a world leader anymore, that particular policy goes away."
Interviewer,Thank you.
Dorsey,No.
Interviewer,Why not?
Dorsey,I think it's healthy to have skepticism about everything and then have a mindset of verifying it and using as much information as possible to do so.
Interviewer,Do you have somebody on your staff who protects you from reading things that they think you shouldn't?
Dorsey,No.
Interviewer,"Mr. zuckerberg, do you believe everything you read?"
Dorsey,"Those are generally the rules that we have. i mean, our focus on these policies-"
Interviewer,"No, you don't, mr. dorsey. excuse me for interrupting, but you're censoring right and left trying to make both sides happy, and you're making neither side happy."
Dorsey,"No, that's not the intention. the intention is to-"
Interviewer,"I know it's not the intention, but it's the result."
Dorsey,"I can see why you might say that and why you might perceive that, and that's why we do think it's important that we add more transparency to how we moderate content, that we give more control to individuals to moderate their own content and focus on algorithms. but a lot of our policies are focused on making sure that people feel that they can express themselves in the first place and not driven away. everything that you mentioned about bullying, about harassment, around illegal content or violence, incitement to violence, that is what our policies are, and that is our intent."
Interviewer,"I know, and excuse me for interrupting, but my time's limited, and i want to hear from mr. zuckerberg. but you're not just doing that. you've started to sensor content. why not have both mr. biden and mr. trump able to say whatever they want to on your platform, so long as they don't threaten, bully, incite violence, commit a crime. i'm not justifying the use of either twitter or facebook to hurt the rohingyas. mr. zuckerberg, what are your thoughts on my suggestion? get out of the censorship business other than the exceptions i talked about?"
Dorsey,"Yes, so many of the labels did change how the algorithms amplify content."
Interviewer,"President trump right now is spreading dangerous misinformation about our electoral process. it's going on right now. and maybe if you guys, you gentlemen, would just cogently...  through this process, this ongoing process right now, are there steps you will be taking that you have not already delineated as we are going into what could be very dangerous waters, unprecedented waters, in this country? is there any additional steps that you will be taking right now in the coming days or weeks to stop the further amplification and undermining of our democracy?"
Dorsey,We're going to continue to remain vigilant around our enforcement of civil integrity. i think it's really important that we stay agile and that we learn. so we need to learn about the effectiveness of this work and how to carry it forward.
Interviewer,"If the chairman would indulge me in one more sort of question to mr. zuckerberg. i was really pleased that the group stop the steal, which was a group formed on facebook with disinformation trying to delegitimize the election. i was grateful that you all suspended that account after 24 hours. but i'm concerned about what lessons you've learned. because clearly outside groups like the center for countering digital hate flagged that groups posts containing calls to violence hours before facebook did."
Dorsey,"I don't believe so, but we can follow up."
Interviewer,"I can answer it for you, sir. you helped launch huawei's mate 30 pro 5g and it is featured on twitter's marketing page website. how about alibaba? you do business with jack ma's company with their links to the chinese communist party?"
Dorsey,"If by business, you mean allowing people to advertise on our platform-"
Interviewer,"Your answer is yes. mr. zuckerberg, are you aware that last year china's top internet regulator agreed to spend over $800,000 for the communist mouthpiece, the people's daily, and they did this so that they could advertise and promote china to the american people on facebook?"
Dorsey,Yes can you hear me?
Interviewer,"Yes. thank you for being with us, and you are now recognized for five minutes sir."
Dorsey,"Okay. well, thank you members of the commerce committee for the opportunity to speak with the american people about twitter and section 230. my remarks will be brief so we can get to questions. section 230 is the most important law protecting internet speech. removing section 230 will remove speech from the internet. section 230 gave internet services two important tools. the first provides immunity from liability for users content. the second provides good samaritan protections for content moderation and removal, even of constitutionally protected speech, as long as it's done in good faith."
Interviewer,Thank you very much mr dorsey. we now call on mr sundar pichai. you are recognized for five minutes sir.
Dorsey,"Well, first and foremost, we, as you mentioned, we did label that tweet. as we think about enforcement, we consider severity of potential offline harm, and we act as quickly as we can. we have taken action against tweets from world leaders all around the world, including the president, and we did take action on that tweet because we saw it, we saw the confusion it might encourage, and we labeled it accordingly, and the goal with our labeling-"
Interviewer,You're speaking of the president's tweet.
Dorsey,Yes.
Interviewer,Okay.
Dorsey,"The goal of our labeling is to provide more context to connect the dots so that people can have more information so they can make decisions for themselves. we've created these policies recently. we are enforcing them. there are certainly things that we can do much faster, but generally we believe that the policy was enforced in a timely manner and in the right regard."
Interviewer,And yet you seem to have no objection to a tweet by the chinese communist party saying the u.s. army brought the epidemic to wuhan.
Dorsey,"Well, we did, and we labeled that tweet providing more information."
Interviewer,"It took you two months to do so, is that correct?"
Dorsey,"I'm not sure of the exact timeframe, but we can get back to you on that."
Interviewer,"So you're going to get back to us as to how a tweet from the chinese communist party falsely accusing the u.s. military of causing the coronavirus epidemic was left up for two months with no comment from twitter, while the president of the united states making a statement about being careful about ballot security with the mail was labeled immediately."
Dorsey,"We believe it's important for everyone to hear from global leaders, and we have policies around world leaders. we want to make sure that we are respecting their right to speak and to publish what they need. but if there's a violation of our terms of service, we want to label it and-"
Interviewer,"They're still up. do they violate your terms of service, mr. dorsey?"
Dorsey,"We did not find those to violate our terms of service because we considered them saber rattling, which is part of the speech of world leaders in concert with other countries. speech against our own people or countries on citizens, we believe is different and can cause more immediate harm."
Interviewer,"Very telling information. mr. dorsey. thank you very much. senator cantwell, you are recognized."
Dorsey,Yes.
Interviewer,So you would agree that someone who says the holocaust may not have happened is spreading misinformation? yes or no.
Dorsey,Yes.
Interviewer,"I appreciate your answers on this, but they surprise me and probably a lot of other coloradans and americans, after all iran's ayatollah has done exactly this, questioning the holocaust, and yet his tweets remain unflagged on twitter's platform. you and i agree that moderating your platform makes sense in certain respects. we don't want the next terrorist finding inspiration on twitter, or any certain, any platform for that matter. but you've also decided to moderate certain content from influential world leaders."
Dorsey,"Not off the top of my head, but we have many examples across world leaders around the world."
Interviewer,Would you be willing to provide a list of those?
Dorsey,Absolutely.
Interviewer,"I know we've established and we agreed content moderation can have certain upsides like combating terrorism, but twitter has chosen to approach content moderation from the standpoint of combating misinformation as well. so it's strange to me that you've flagged the tweets from the president, but haven't hidden the ayatollah's tweets on holocaust denial or calls to wipe israel off the map. and that you can't recall off the top of your head hidden or deleted tweets from other world leaders, i would appreciate that list."
Dorsey,"No, and we don't have a policy against misinformation. we have a policy against misinformation in three categories, which are manipulated media, public health, specifically covid, and civic integrity in election interference and voter suppression. that is all we have policy on for misleading information. we do not have policy or enforcement for any other types of misleading information that you're mentioning."
Interviewer,So somebody denying the murder of millions of people or instigating violence against a country as a head of state is not categorically falling in any of those three misinformation or other categories twitter has?
Dorsey,"Not misinformation, but we do have other policies around incitement to violence, which may, some of the tweets that you mentioned, or the examples that you're mentioning, may fall a inaudible 00:19:49, but for misleading information, we're focused on those three categories only."
Interviewer,So somebody denies the holocaust has happened is not misinformation?
Dorsey,"It's misleading information, but we don't have a policy against that type of misleading information. we have-"
Interviewer,"Millions of people died and that's not a violation of twitter. again, i just don't understand how you can label a president of the united states. have you ever taken a tweet down from the ayatollah?"
Dorsey,"I believe we have, but we can get back to you on it. we've certainly labeled tweets and i believe we have taken one down as well."
Interviewer,"You know, you said you do not have a list. is that correct? you do not maintain a list."
Dorsey,"We don't maintain a list of accounts we watch. we look for reports and issues brought to us, and then we weigh it against our policy and enforce if needed."
Interviewer,You look for reports from your employees or from the broader news-
Dorsey,"No, from the people using the service."
Interviewer,"Right, and then they turned that over to your board of the review. is that correct?"
Dorsey,"So in some cases, algorithms take action. in other cases, teammates do, in some cases it's a pairing of the two."
Interviewer,"There are numerous examples of blue check marks, blue check marks that are spreading false information that aren't flagged. so twitter must have some kind of list of priority accounts that it maintains. you have the blue check mark list. how do you decide when to flag a tweet? you got into that a little bit. is there a formal threshold of retweets or likes that must be met before a tweet is flagged?"
Dorsey,No. inaudible 00:56:27
Interviewer,"With your answers on the ayatollah and others, i just don't understand how twitter can claim to want a world of less hate and misinformation while you simultaneously let the kind of content that the ayatollah has tweeted out flourish on the platform, including from other world leaders. it's no wonder that americans are concerned about politically motivated content moderation at twitter given what we have just said. i don't like the idea of a group of unelected elites in san francisco or silicon valley deciding whether my speech is permissible on their platforms, but i like the even less the idea of unelected washington, d."
Dorsey,It's reasonable as well.
Interviewer,"Mr. pichai, same question to you. yes or no, should google be liable for the specific content that it creates?"
Dorsey,No.
Interviewer,"Mr. pichai, are you the ref?"
Dorsey,Absolutely. we believe in a fair and straightforward appeals process.
Interviewer,Great. mr. pichai?
Dorsey,"We would absolutely be open to it. we are suggesting going a step further, which is aligned with what you're introducing in the pact act, which is much more transparency around our process, content moderation process, and also the results, the outcomes, and doing that on a regular basis. i do agree and think that builds more accountability, and ultimately that lends itself to more trust."
Interviewer,"Okay, great. thank you. all right, very quickly, i don't have a lot of time either, but i often hear from conservative and religious americans who look at the public statements of your companies, the geographic concentration of your companies, and the political donations of your employees, which often are in the 80% to 90% to democrat politicians. you can see why this lack of ideological diversity among the executives and employees of your company could be problematic and maybe contributing to some of the distrust among conservatives and republican users."
Dorsey,"Well, this is why i do believe that it's important to have more transparency around our process and our practices, and it's independent of the viewpoints that our employees told."
Interviewer,Mr. pichai?
Dorsey,We need to make sure that we're showing people that we have objective policies and enforcement.
Interviewer,Mr. pichai?
Dorsey,"Yes, we also have a plan. so, our plan and our enforcement around these issues is pointing to more information and specifically state election officials. so, we want to give the people using the service as much information as possible."
Interviewer,"Thank you, senator blumenthal. senator cruz."
Dorsey,No.
Interviewer,You don't believe twitter has any ability to influence elections?
Dorsey,"No, we are one part of spectrum of communication channels that people have."
Interviewer,"So, you are testified to this committee right now that twitter, when it silences people, when it censors people, when it blocks political speech, that it has no impact on elections?"
Dorsey,People have choice of other communication channels with crosstalk 01:26:11.
Interviewer,"Not if they don't hear information. if you don't think you have the power to influence elections, why do you block anything?"
Dorsey,"Well, we have policies that are focused on making sure that more voices on the platform are possible. we see a lot of abuse and harassment, which ends up silencing people and something i believe from the platform."
Interviewer,"All right, mr. dorsey, i find your opening questions, your opening answers absurd on their face, but let's talk about the last two weeks in particular. as you know, i have long been concerned about twitter's pattern of censoring and silencing individual americans with whom twitter disagrees. but two weeks ago, twitter, and to a lesser extent, facebook crossed a threshold that is fundamental in our country. two weeks ago, twitter made the unilateral decision to censor the new york post, and a series of two blockbuster articles, both alleging evidence of corruption against joe biden."
Dorsey,We had a hack materials policy that we-
Interviewer,When was that policy adopted?
Dorsey,"In 2018, i believe."
Interviewer,In 2018. go ahead. what was the policy?
Dorsey,"So, the policy is around limiting the spread of materials that are hacked, and we didn't want twitter to be a distributor for hack materials. we found that the new york post, because it showed the direct materials, screenshots of the direct materials, and it was unclear how those were attained, that it fell under this policy."
Interviewer,"So, in your view, if it's unclear, the source of a document, and in this instance, the new york post documented what it said the source was, which it said it was a laptop owned by hunter biden, that had been turned into a repair store. so, they weren't hiding what they claimed to be the source. is it your position that twitter, when you can't tell the source, blocks press stories?"
Dorsey,"No, not at all. our team made a fast decision. the enforcement action, however, of blocking urls, both in tweets and in dm, in direct messages, we believe was incorrect and we changed it within 24 hours."
Interviewer,"Today, right now, the new york post is still blocked from tweeting two weeks later."
Dorsey,"Yes, they have to log into their account, which they can do at this minute, delete the original tweet, which fell under our original enforcement actions, and they can tweet the exact same material from the exact same article and it would go through."
Interviewer,"So, mr. dorsey, your ability is you have the power to force a media outlet, and let's be clear, the new york post isn't just some random guy tweeting. the new york post is the fourth highest circulation of any newspaper in america. the new york post is over 200 years old. the new york post was founded by alexander hamilton, and your position is that you can sit in silicon valley and demand of the media that you can tell them what stories they can publish, and you can tell the american people what reporting they can hear, is that right?"
Dorsey,"No, every person, every account, every organization that signs up to twitter agrees to a terms of service, a terms of service is crosstalk 01:29:53-"
Interviewer,"So, media outlets must genuflect and obey your dictates if they wish to be able to communicate with readers, is that right?"
Dorsey,"No, not at all. we recognized an error in this policy and specifically the enforcement."
Interviewer,"You're still blocking their posts. you're still blocking their posts. right now, today, you're blocking their posts."
Dorsey,"We're not blocking the post. anyone can tweet, crosstalk 01:30:15."
Interviewer,Can the new york post post on their twitter account?
Dorsey,If they go into their account and delete the original crosstalk 01:30:21-
Interviewer,"No is your answer to that, unless they genuflect and agree with your dictates. so, let me ask you something. you claimed it was because of a hack materials policy. i find that facially highly dubious and clearly employed in a deeply partial way. did twitter block the distribution of the new york times' story a few weeks ago that purported to be based on copies of president trump's tax returns?"
Dorsey,"We didn't find that a violation of our terms of service and this policy in particular, because it is reporting about the material. it wasn't distributing the material."
Interviewer,"Okay, well, that's actually not true. they posted what they purported to be original source materials, and federal law, federal statute makes it a crime, a federal felony, to distribute someone's tax returns against their knowledge. so, that material was based on something that was distributed in violation of federal law, and yet twitter gleefully allowed people to circulate that. but when the article was critical of joe biden, twitter engaged in rampant censorship and silencing."
Dorsey,"Again, we recognized the errors in our policy and we changed it within 24 hours. so, this is one of-"
Interviewer,But you're still blocking the new york post. you haven't changed it.
Dorsey,We have changed it. they can log into their account and delete the original tweet that was crosstalk 01:31:47.
Interviewer,"You forced the political reporter to take down his post about the new york post as well, is that correct?"
Dorsey,"Within that 24 hour period? yes, but as the policy has changed, anyone can tweet this article crosstalk 01:31:58."
Interviewer,"So, crosstalk 01:31:58, you could censor the new york post, you can censor political, presumably you can censor the new york times or any other media outlet. mr. dorsey, who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the american people are allowed to hear, and why do you persist in behaving as a democratic super pac silencing views to the contrary of your political beliefs?"
Dorsey,"Well, we're not doing that. this is why i opened this hearing with calls for more transparency. we realized we need to earn trust more. we realized that more accountability is needed to show our intentions and to show the outcomes."
Interviewer,"Thank you, senator."
Dorsey,"So, i hear the concerns and acknowledge them, but we want to fix it with more transparency."
Interviewer,"Thank you, senator cruz. the ranking member has deferred now to senator schatz, who joins us remotely. sir, you are recognized."
Dorsey,"Well, the suggestions we're making around more transparency is how we want to build that trust. we do agree that we should be publishing more of our practice of content moderation. we've made decisions to moderate content. we've made decisions to moderate content to make sure that we are enabling as many voices on our platform as possible. i acknowledge and completely agree with the concerns that it feels like a black box. anything that we can do to bring transparency to it, including publishing our policies, our practices, answering very simple questions around how content is moderated, and then doing what we can around the growing trend of algorithms, moderating more of this content."
Interviewer,"Right, but you can understand the concerns that people have when they see that what many consider you're making value judgments on what's going to be on your platforms. you say users can report a content and then you take action, but certainly, you can understand that people are very concerned. they're very worried about what they see as manipulation on your part, and to say you're going to have more transparency and yeah, that's, sir, i would say with respect, i don't think that's enough just to say you're going to have that transparency there and you're not influencing people."
Dorsey,"I completely understand. i agree that it's not enough. i don't think transparency alone addresses these concerns. i think we have to continue to push for a more straightforward, and fast, and efficient appeals process. i do believe we need to look deeply at algorithms and how they're used and how people have choice on how to use those algorithms or whether they use them."
Interviewer,"But ultimately, somebody makes a decision. where does the buck stop with the algorithms? where does the buck stop? who's going to make a value judgment? because in my opinion, it is a value judgment."
Dorsey,"Well, ultimately, i'm accountable to all the decisions that the company makes, but we want to make sure that we're providing clear frameworks that are objective and that can be tested, and that we have multiple checkpoints associated with them so that we can learn quickly if we're doing something in there."
Interviewer,"When your company amplifies some content over others, is it fair for you to have legal protections for your actions?"
Dorsey,"We believe so. keep in mind, a lot of our algorithms recommending content is focused on saving people time. so, we're ranking things that the algorithms believe people would find most relevant and most valuable in the time crosstalk 01:44:57-"
Interviewer,But it's your value judgment on what those people would find most relevant?
Dorsey,"No, it's not about your judgment, it's based on-"
Interviewer,...  find most relevant?
Dorsey,"No. it's not about inaudible 01:45:03. it's based on engagement metrics, it's based on who you follow, it's based on activity you take on on the network."
Interviewer,"Mr. zuckerberg, with your ever-expanding content moderation policies, are you materially involved in that content?"
Dorsey,"I don't have the specific numbers, but we want to maintain agility between the people that we have working on this and also just building better technology to automate. so our goal is flexibility here."
Interviewer,Let me ask the question again about how much would you estimate that your company's currently spending on defending lawsuits related to user content.
Dorsey,I don't have those numbers.
Interviewer,"Let me use your answers to highlight something that i want to be a topic of our conversation as we debate this legislation. whatever the numbers are, you indicate that they are significant. it's an enormous amount of money and an enormous amount of employee time, contract labor time in dealing with modification of content. these efforts are expensive. and i would highlight for my colleagues on the committee that they will not be any less expensive, perhaps less in scale, but not less in cost, for startups and small businesses."
Dorsey,But we don't ask political ideology when we're hiring.
Interviewer,"Okay. you don't. okay, mr. zuckerberg."
Dorsey,I don't know.
Interviewer,"You don't know. okay. i think this is called a dictatorship. so are people in iran allowed to use twitter or does the country whose leader you claim deserves a platform, ban them from doing so?"
Dorsey,"Ideally, we would love for the people of iran to use twitter."
Interviewer,"Well, iran bans twitter. and mr. zuckerberg, i know you are aware, they ban facebook also. so, mr. dorsey is donald trump a world leader?"
Dorsey,Yes.
Interviewer,"Okay. so it would be important for world leaders to have access to your platform, correct?"
Dorsey,Correct.
Interviewer,And so why did you deny that platform via censorship to the us president?
Dorsey,We haven't censored the us president.
Interviewer,Oh yes you have. how many posts from iran's terrorist ayatollah have you censored? how many posts from vladimir putin have you censored?
Dorsey,"We have labeled tweets of world leaders. we have a policy around not taking down the content, but simply adding more context around it."
Interviewer,"Okay. and the us president, you have censored 65 times. you testified that you're worried about disinformation and election interference. that is something we all worry about. and of course, for about a hundred years, foreign sources have been trying to influence us policy and us elections. now, they're onto your platforms. they see this as a way to get access to the american people. so, given your refusal to sensor or ban foreign dictators while regularly censoring the president, aren't you, at this very moment, personally responsible for flooding the nation with foreign disinformation?"
Dorsey,"Just to be clear, we have not censored the president. we have not taken the tweets down that you're referencing. they have more context and a label applied to them and we do the same for leaders around the world."
Interviewer,Okay. let me ask you this. do you share any of your data mining? and this is to each of the three of you. do you share any of your data mining with the democrat national committee?
Dorsey,"I'm not sure what you mean by the question, but we have a data platform that we have a number of customers. i'm not sure of the customer list."
Interviewer,Okay. and you said you don't keep lists. i made that note. i found that crosstalk 02:27:32.
Dorsey,"Well, keep lists of accounts that we watch. we don't keep a list of accounts that we watch."
Interviewer,"Yeah. okay. all right. okay. mr. pichai, is blake lemoine, one of your engineers, still working with you?"
Dorsey,"Yes. so we do continue to see interference. we recently disclosed actions we took on both russia and actions originating out of iran. we've made those disclosures public. we can share those with your team. but this remains, as you've heard from others on the panel and as mark has detailed, one of our highest priorities and something we want to make sure that we are focused on eliminating as much platform manipulation as possible."
Interviewer,"Senator, we do continue to see coordinated influence operation at times. we've been very vigilant. we appreciate the cooperation we get from intelligence agencies. and as companies, we are sharing information. to give you an example, and we publish transparency reports, in june, we identified efforts, one from iran group apd 35 targeting the trump campaign. one from china, a group apd 31 targeting the biden campaign. most of these were phishing attempts but our spam filters were able to remove most of the emails out from reaching users."
Dorsey,Yes. and we will continue to work and push back on any manipulation of the platform.
Interviewer,"Thank you for those answers. mr. zuckerberg do facebook and other social media networks have an obligation to prevent disinformation and malicious actors spreading conspiracy theories, dangerous health disinformation, and hate speech, even if preventing its spread means less traffic and potentially less advertising revenue for facebook?"
Dorsey,"Well, our interpretation of objectionable is anything that is limiting potentially the speech of others. all of our policies are focused on making sure that people feel safe to express themselves. and when we see abuse, harassment, misleading information, these are all threats against that. and it makes people want to leave the internet, makes people want to leave these conversations online. so that is what we're trying to protect, is making sure that people feel safe enough and free enough to express themselves in whatever way they wish."
Interviewer,"So this a follow-up to that. much has been talked about the blocking of the new york post. do you have an instance, or for instance, of when you've actually blocked somebody that would be considered politically liberal on the other side, in the political realm and in this country? do you have an example of that to offset where the new york post criticism has come from?"
Dorsey,"Well, we don't have an understanding of the ideology of any one particular account, and that is also not how our policies are written or enforcement taken. so i'm sure there are a number of examples. but that is not our focus. we're looking purely at the violations of our policies, taking action against that."
Interviewer,"Yeah. mr. zuckerberg, how would you define otherwise objectionable, objectionable? not how would you define it, but how would you refine the definition of that to make it more objective than subjective?"
Dorsey,"I could be mistaken, but it looks like the tweet that you showed actually did have a label pointing to both of them, pointing to our covid resource hub in our interface. so in regards to misleading information, we have policies against manipulated media in support of public health and covid information and election interference and civic integrity. and we take action on it. in some cases it's labeling, in some cases it's removal."
Interviewer,What additional steps are you planning to take to address dangerously misleading tweets like the president rounding the turn tweet?
Dorsey,"We want to make sure that we are giving people as much information as possible and that ultimately we're connecting the dots when they see information like that, that they have an easy way to get an official resource or many more viewpoints on what they're seeing. so we'll continue to refine our policy. we'll continue to refine our enforcement around misleading information, and we're looking deeply at how we can evolve our product to do the same."
Interviewer,"Mr. zuckerberg, i want to turn to you to talk about the ongoing issue of right-wing militias using facebook as a platform to organize and promote violence. could the committee clerk please bring up my second slide? on august 25th, a self-described militia group called kenosha guard created a facebook event page entitled armed citizens to protect our lives and property, encouraging armed individuals to go to kenosha and quote defend the city during a period of civil unrest, following the police shooting of jacob blake."
Dorsey,"We can give a more exhaustive list, but again, we don't have an understanding of political inaudible 02:56:52 of our accounts, but-"
Interviewer,"I'm not asking for an exhaustive list, i'm asking for a single example, one, just one individual, one entity, anyone."
Dorsey,We've taken action on tweets from members of the house for election miss info.
Interviewer,Can you identify an example?
Dorsey,Yes. two democratic congresspeople-
Interviewer,What are their names?
Dorsey,I'll get those names to you.
Interviewer,"Great. great, mr. pichai, how about you?"
Dorsey,"Yes. so we operate our enforcement in our policy, without an understanding of political ideology. anytime we find examples of bias in how people operate our systems or our algorithms, we remove it. and as mark mentioned, there are checkpoints in these companies and in these frameworks and we do need more transparency around them and how they work. and we do need a much more straightforward and quick and efficient appeals process, to give us a further checkpoint from the public."
Interviewer,"Thank you, senator lee. senator duckworth."
Dorsey,We've made that commitment.
Interviewer,Mr. pichai.
Dorsey,"As you mentioned, i don't know the makeup of our employees, because it's not something we ask or focus on."
Interviewer,"Just what do you think off top of your head, based on your chat rooms and kind of the people you talk to?"
Dorsey,Not something i look for or look-
Interviewer,"Yeah, right. okay. mr. pichai?"
Dorsey,"Yeah. i mean, my answer was around peoples choice around other communication channels."
Interviewer,"No, the question was, does twitter have the ability to influence the elections? you said, no. do you still stand by that answer."
Dorsey,"Twitter as a company, no. no, we-"
Interviewer,"You don't think you have the ability by moderation policies, by, as senator lee and i would call it, censoring you what you do here at post. you don't think that censorship, that moderation policies, you don't think that influences the elections by withholding what i believe is true information from american public. you don't think that interferes in the elections?"
Dorsey,Not our current moderation policies. our current moderation policies are to protect the conversation and the integrity of the conversation around the elections.
Interviewer,"Okay. for both mr. zuckerberg and dorsey who censored new york post stories or throttled them back, did either one of you have any evidence that the new york post story is part of russian disinformation or that those emails aren't authentic? do any of you have any information whatsoever they're not authentic or that they are russian disinformation? mr. darcy."
Dorsey,We don't.
Interviewer,"So why would you censor it? why did you prevent that from being disseminated, on your platform that is supposed to be for the free expression of ideas and particularly true ideas?"
Dorsey,We believed it fell afoul of our hacking materials policy. we judged-
Interviewer,What evidence did you have that it was hacked? they weren't hacked.
Dorsey,We judged in the moment that it looked like it was hacked materials.
Interviewer,You were wrong.
Dorsey,And we updated our policy and our enforcement within 24 hours.
Interviewer,"Mr. zuckerman, zuckerberg."
Dorsey,"We'll have to look into our enforcement or not enforcement in this case, of the tweet and we can get back to you with more context."
Interviewer,"So mr. zuckerberg, in that same june hearing ...  real quick, mr. dorsey, you referred to that june hearing, stephan inaudible 03:14:09 had all kinds of good ideas. that's 16 months ago. why haven't you implemented any of those transparency ideas that you thought were pretty good 16 months ago?"
Dorsey,"Well, he was talking about algorithm choice and we have implemented one of them, which is we allow people to turn off the ranking over a timeline. the rest is work and it's going to take some time."
Interviewer,"I would get to it if i were you. thank you, mr. chairman"
Dorsey,"Yes, not that i'm aware of."
Interviewer,"And is that also your answer, mr. zuckerberg, that you have no information at all to indicate that russia was the source of this new york post article?"
Dorsey,"Yes, we're always happy to, myself or one of our teammates is always happy to talk to people."
Interviewer,Sundar.
Dorsey,"If we found violations of our policy, we would do the appropriate enforcement action."
Interviewer,Thank you.
Dorsey,"We're looking at ...  our policies are against platform integration, period, no matter where it comes from. so whether that's foreign or domestic, we see patterns of people or organizations that attempt to manipulate the platform and the conversation, artificially amplify information."
Interviewer,Mark.
Dorsey,"We have taken actions around leaders around the world and certainly with some dictators as well. we look at the tweets, we review them and we figure out if they violate our policy or not."
Interviewer,"Mr. dorsey, can you tell me one you did against iran? the ram the tile. can you tell me about one you've ever done against ayatollah or maduro?"
Dorsey,"I think we've done more than one actually, but we can send you that information on those actions. we want to make sure that we do have a global leader policy, that we believe it's important. people can see what these leaders are saying and those tweets remain up, but they are labeled that they violated our terms of service, just to show the integrity of our policy and our enforcement."
Interviewer,"When the communist china, which we all know has put a million people for years in camps, you did nothing about the tweet, when they say that they were just helping them lead a better life. i mean, anybody that follows the news knows what's happening to the uyghurs. i mean, it's genocide what they're doing to the uyghurs. i've never seen anything you've done on calling out a lie."
Dorsey,"We don't have a general policy around misleading information and misinformation, we don't. we rely upon people calling that speech out, calling those reports out and those ideas. and that's part of the conversation, if there is something found to be in contest, then people reply to it. people retweet it and say, ""this is wrong. this is obviously wrong."" you would be able to tweet that today and say, ""this is absolutely wrong.' and we benefit from one of those voices calling that up."
Interviewer,"But you blocked mitch mcconnell and trump's tweets and you just say ...  right? i mean, here's what i don't get, is you guys have set up policies that you don't enforce consistently and then what's the recourse to a user? i talked to a lady this week that she just got her facebook account just eliminated, there's no recourse. there's nothing she can do about it. so every one-"
Dorsey,"We inaudible 03:30:11 consistently. and as i said in my opening remarks, we believe it's critical that we have more transparency around our process. we have clear and straightforward and efficient appeals. so the woman that you talked to could actually appeal the decision that we made, and that we focused on algorithms and figuring out how to give people more choice around it."
Interviewer,"Thank you, senator scott. senator rosen?"
Dorsey,"As you know, algorithms, these algorithms, machine learning and deep learning are complex. they're complicated and they require testing and training. so as we learn about their effectiveness, we can shift them and we can iterate them. but it does require experience and it does require a little bit of time. so the most important thing that we need to build into the organization is a fast learning mindset and that agility around updating these algorithms."
Interviewer,I know you're having to jet over here to talk to us there's so much to talk to jack about both at twitter.
Dorsey,And at square i want to start on twitter but i want to move to square because i don't know if everybody here appreciates.
Interviewer,The square is on its way now to actually being bigger than then twitter and i want to understand how that even factors.
Dorsey,Into your thinking and where that company is going but given that it's in the news i do want to start with twitter.
Interviewer,I want to start with this as everybody saw the news last week you eliminated president trump's account on twitter and.
Dorsey,There's some people i know who are applauding and other people who may have other views but just take us inside the.
Interviewer,Room and help us understand what actually happened and why it was so easy for something like that to happen.
Dorsey,An employee who on this person's last day to kapaun themselves to deactivate the account and there are a number of.
Interviewer,Things that came out of this for us first should never be possible so we started looking into the controls that.
Dorsey,We have in place and what we could improve and where we have weaknesses and where we have gaps second just the you.
Interviewer,Know particular policies around what agents have control over and what they don't the account was not removed it was.
Dorsey,Not suspended it was deactivated which is a very different state than what you would assume so it was not deleted it.
Interviewer,Was put in a state waiting for the owner to come back to it and reactivate it did the owner yes otherwise the.
Dorsey,President yes he came back to it he came back to take him back to it and what had it and he reactivated it so and did they.
Interviewer,Call you we we have conversations we have conversations real quick you have no no you you have.
Dorsey,Policies and we're talking monica earlier facebook about policies about divisive hate speech things that can be.
Interviewer,Said and can be unsaid or not said on twitter and there was a moment at which you kicked rose mcgowan off briefly.
Dorsey,Things like that a couple people emailed in today actually a couple we even put it on twitter for me to ask you this.
Interviewer,What would the president have to say on twitter to be kicked off well so first and foremost we um we hold every single.
Dorsey,Account to the same standard to the same rules and to the same policies where we haven't been great is showing the.
Interviewer,Interpretations of our policies as it pertains to enforcement if an account were to publicly attack or harass a.
Dorsey,Private citizen for instance we would take action and we would of course have conversations with.
Interviewer,The party involved in the abuse or the harasser i think you said things about certain people so we do we do have a.
Dorsey,Clause in our terms of service that unfortunately we did not have publicly stated but we operated internally which.
Interviewer,Is one of those caps that i'm speaking to around newsworthiness and public interest and keeping content up because.
Dorsey,Of it because it is of public interests because there is reporting on it because it is a record of an action and this is.
Interviewer,A subject subjective evaluation by us and we work really hard to make sure that we are listening to voices and.
Dorsey,Specifically the journalists on our platform to determine news worthiness and to determine what is public interest.
Interviewer,And what's not public interest in some cases were going to get it wrong but as their peers have said like this is.
Dorsey,Something that is evolving this is something that's moving very very fast we're trying to learn as quickly as.
Interviewer,Possible and the only way we know how to help build trust in our process is to be transparent as possible around.
Dorsey,How we're thinking and i when it give us a high grade at the moment but we do have the intention internally in the.
Interviewer,Company to fix that and it's flexing a muscle that we haven't had to flex or weed in it flex in the past around being.
Dorsey,Very open and being very transparent now the company has been transparent in many degrees in other ways requests for.
Interviewer,Information from governments for instance we have established a transparency report which is.
Dorsey,Industry-leading but we haven't been consistent throughout all of our actions and and that doesn't inspire trust and.
Interviewer,And that causes people to make assumptions that are probably incorrect against our intentions so we're just.
Dorsey,Trying to make those intentions clear we're trying to close the gap between policy and interpretation of policy and.
Interviewer,Enforcement and it's real work and it's work that requires engineering it requires legal aspects and what one.
Dorsey,Policy question last last week there were the hearings and all the companies sent lawyers they didn't send the ceos.
Interviewer,Did you think about wanting to go was there was there a conversation about whether whether whether you or others.
Dorsey,Should go absolutely and i would i would be happy to stand up and represent our company at any point and we want to make.
Interviewer,Sure that we are sending our experts and people who are familiar deeply with the knowledge and can speak to that and.
Dorsey,Shawn or gc was that person if i was called specifically i would go and i would get prepared and make sure that i.
Interviewer,Understand every single aspect of what happened and what we're doing about it more importantly but we want to make.
Dorsey,Sure that we were showing not only you know the you know our understanding of what happened in our investigations and.
Interviewer,By the people who actually led them but also by the people who can run with the work and push it and make the changes.
Dorsey,Okay so i want to know a little bit about your life which is you are now the ceo of two companies and as i meant.
Interviewer,And square gets a lot less attention in all of this but how do you manage both of these things in a personal basis.
Dorsey,Daily basis yeah i mean it's um it's evolved as as things do i i am when i started i just took in as much as.
Interviewer,Possible and then i figured out what i need to focus on and what mattered and where i need to prioritize and both.
Dorsey,Companies are in very different phases square is something i built from day one and i know every single detail of that.
Interviewer,System and twitter i had to learn a few things in my absence and i had to understand why we made decisions and.
Dorsey,What the principles were and and how we might how we might change those or how we might evolve those so both required.
Interviewer,Very different answers both companies are right across the street from one another so it makes a little bit easier.
Dorsey,But i benefit from number one a lot of structure number two realizing that it's not about the amount of time i spend at.
Interviewer,One thing it's about how i spend the time and what we're focused on and are we focused on the thing that truly.
Dorsey,Matters the most and is it most important are we ignoring everything else at least for now and then three do.
Interviewer,We have the right team around to do the work and to make the decisions and move things forward and square had been.
Dorsey,Building that team for a long time and we we had to do some research to twitter throughout the company and it just it.
Interviewer,Takes time it takes time for a team to gel it takes time to understand how to collaborate with one another and.
Dorsey,Meanwhile we have a lot of other things that were not expected that i was coming into that we had to deal with and we had.
Interviewer,To we had director okay so here's what i'm going with this it feels to me like square is your baby really your baby.
Dorsey,Twitter's your baby too but square is appearing like it could really be on this remarkable ride is there ever a.
Interviewer,Moment at which you think you're going to have to choose your children i well i don't have children right now i.
Dorsey,Am part of two amazing companies and my goal is to make sure that we are building something that outlives me and.
Interviewer,That endorsed and that continues to serve generations beyond me and that means i need to build structures that.
Dorsey,Aren't dependent entirely upon me that need that means i need to recognize leaders who can succeed me that means we.
Interviewer,Need to get our decision-making rigor and process and understanding into the v-very dna of our companies and as i.
Dorsey,Said both companies are in different phases of that tell us about where square is going and the reason i reason.
Interviewer,I ask is i'm used to new we all know square you go to a go to a store or a coffee shop and and and either slide it.
Dorsey,In we had all sorts of taxi drivers are now using it as well or they've been using it for years but you recently.
Interviewer,Bought a bank and you you you mayn't you look like you're on the way to becoming a bank that it's gonna be a different.
Dorsey,Business am i wrong well we didn't buy a bank like we didn't buy a license either we applied applied.
Interviewer,For a license for an ilc which isn't a futon company and and that process takes about a year so we're not through it yet.
Dorsey,When nothing has been confirmed or or completed but the reason we did that is because we have this really amazing.
Interviewer,Business called square capital which gives out loans to sellers and owning a bank charter allows us to be more.
Dorsey,Efficient in that but it also allows us some freedom to make bigger moves or different moves in the financial space.
Interviewer,And you know more and more we've realized over time that now when we started the company we thought we were.
Dorsey,Building a credit card reader a lot of people to accept credit cards but then we realized that we were actually.
Interviewer,Building a tool that helped people participate in the economy because they were losing sales because they connect.
Dorsey,Up credit cards and as we thought about that more we looked more and more towards financial services instead of.
Interviewer,Just hardware or point-of-sale and square capital came out of that installment which is.
Dorsey,Humor product camera or that squirt cash came out of that and that is a big part of our future i believe is to continue.
Interviewer,To serve an underserved audience that's who we're serving in the early days of sellers and i believe we have a huge.
Dorsey,Opportunity to do that with individuals as well most of silicon valley though tries to run away from regulated.
Interviewer,Businesses so that's why i was curious about the banking piece of this and to the degree that if you get involved in.
Dorsey,The banking piece does it therefore affect the other pieces right regulation isn't always a negative and we also have.
Interviewer,To realize that regulation evolves and you know a big part of our role is to help educate the right way regulation.
Dorsey,Might evolve and what we've learned and what we can invent what we can do what we can build that can give access to.
Interviewer,More people and that is our focus is this word access access to the financial systems both from a seller and.
Dorsey,Individual standpoint so when we first started the company we were questioned by our banking partners and by their.
Interviewer,Regulators and and said no hundreds and hundreds of times until we could show the intent and we could show that we.
Dorsey,Could reach a broader audience and we could reach an audience that wasn't able to participate in the past and that was.
Interviewer,Good for everyone and we had to change some things to do that we didn't want to force people to go through a fico score.
Dorsey,A credit check to start accepting credit cards it didn't make sense to us it didn't make sense to them so we changed.
Interviewer,That model and we went from a merchant acquisition process that only accepted thirty to forty percent of those who.
Dorsey,Applied to 99 percent of those who applied so we constantly questioned the regulatory but we also realized the.
Interviewer,Benefits to it is that it does have protection not just for our customers but also for our industry and we need to.
Dorsey,Do our work to make sure that we're showing solutions that that of all thinking there's been a lot of folks in.
Interviewer,Silicon valley we've tried to think about how do you rewrite the fico score what is it how do you get the new.
Dorsey,Algorithm taking other new pieces of data to try to let the unbanked bengt what have you done on that meaning.
Interviewer,How does it work we've just questioned a bunch of the of the fundamentals i mean i think a lot of.
Dorsey,The reason why we found so many people left out of accepting credit cards in the first place is a lot of our banking.
Interviewer,Partners just had inertia around understanding identity and changing the system and these are very old legacy.
Dorsey,Systems that work and they're predictable and they don't fail and when you build something new there's an.
Interviewer,Element of failure there's an element of risk and you have to manage that and it creates a lack of momentum so we just.
Dorsey,Wanted to take that on and question that and make sure that we are understanding new forms of identity and and we're.
Interviewer,Agile around it so i think the what we brought to bear was not a specific solution but a mindset of agility to be.
Dorsey,Open to different forms of data whether that what's the data give us an example of what are you seeing that you're.
Interviewer,You're you're willing to give somebody a loan that a traditional bank would not even look at that person well i think.
Dorsey,First and foremost square is unique because our square capital is unique because we actually see their business.
Interviewer,So they use our register they use our payments they enter all their employees into our system we see all their.
Dorsey,Customers we see their competition we have a very deep understanding of how they're doing.
Interviewer,And who they are and we don't make a judgement until we have a pretty strong understanding to make that at risk risk.
Dorsey,Assessment so our own data is one thing we're seeing because we built our platform in such a way that we are the.
Interviewer,Tool that's being used to run the entire business so we have an advantage that others mostly do not but outside of our.
Dorsey,Walls we look at you know how sellers are engaging with yelp or facebook or instagram or twitter or all these.
Interviewer,Signals that people are sending around the world and of course other other aspects that that are available to us.
Dorsey,But a lot of our assessment comes from our own understanding our own data so you have a product called square square.
Interviewer,Cat competes with something called venmo some of you may know that but it's.
Dorsey,Recently the numbers have been off the charts with your business but there's been a.
Interviewer,Big question of how these type of transfer payments that are coming among each other whether there's actual money.
Dorsey,Meaning how are you gonna make money doing that yeah so i've been really really proud of square cashes progress.
Interviewer,It's consistently broken into the top 20 free apps in the ios app store which is a huge feat for a finance app it's.
Dorsey,Consistently been the number one above our competitors run though and paypal over the past few months and the way.
Interviewer,That we've done that is we haven't seen it just as peer-to-peer we've evolved past peer to peer and we've realized and.
Dorsey,We've observed that people are using it as a spending device and the more ability we add and the more capabilities.
Interviewer,We add to spend it in more places the more adoption we see in the more retention we see so what we've done it's.
Dorsey,Quite simple and intuitive we started with the most critical thing which was sending money between 10 people and then.
Interviewer,We moved on to issuing a card that could be used online and offline why the big banks haven't figured this out i mean.
Dorsey,Why is jp morgan chase not been able to do a square cache or a venmo they were trying but they haven't they haven't.
Interviewer,Gotten there i don't know but i know what has worked for us is focusing on our strengths simplicity is a strength.
Dorsey,Speed access to funds the strength building something that feels cohesive is a real strength building something.
Interviewer,That is self serve where you don't have to talk with anyone or or engage with any system outside of just downloading.
Dorsey,The app and getting getting going is a real strength so that's the formula that works for us in the suicide and the.
Interviewer,Individual side and we've just wanted to do it we've wanted to make it happen we didn't want it we don't want to wait for.
Dorsey,It happen we wanted to make it happen we took on that mindset and i think 80% of our success is just willing it into.
Interviewer,Existence and pushing through every barrier that we found in order to serve people in a different and unique way.
Dorsey,We've had a raging debate all day up here on the stage about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and since you're here.
Interviewer,And wishes a ken chenault was here earlier today also in the payment space of sorts what's your take both on.
Dorsey,Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is it is it is it a fraud is it the next enron or is it is it here to stay and very real i.
Interviewer,Think it's easy to get lost in the superficial aspects of it and the surface level and ignore all the amazing.
Dorsey,Technology underneath i think the bitcoin white paper is one of the most seminal works in the past 20.
Interviewer,Years in computer science i think it has impact far beyond currency i think as impact on trust as impact on identity.
Dorsey,But it's a continuation of decentralization we saw a decentralization work with the internet.
Interviewer,We saw a decentralization work with data in the cloud we saw a decentralization work with compute more and more with.
Dorsey,Platforms like aws and gcp and we continue to see it in one of the last fundamental utilities that we use as a.
Interviewer,Society which is the ledger it's a decentralized ledger and that has extreme power so i want to make sure as.
Dorsey,A company and this is not just square but also twitter that we're looking at technologies like the blockchain my.
Interviewer,Cryptocurrency and learning from it and learning how we can apply it to create new experiences or create new.
Dorsey,Efficiencies or to do things that we were always trying to do but were hampered in the past because of x or y.
Interviewer,Or z but now we suddenly have this amazing accelerator that we can apply in a very unique way so you expired but you.
Dorsey,Accept bitcoin we accepted bitcoin in 2014 and then 1/2 a lot of our sellers at the time we're selling things like.
Interviewer,Incense and candles and it turns out people in 2014 weren't using coined it by incense and candles so we.
Dorsey,Didn't see very many transactions but we learned a bunch from it and we've integrated that thinking and i iii think.
Interviewer,It's i think it's fascinating so i would not get caught up in the trap of writing it off because of the surface level.
Dorsey,Aspects of it i would look really deeply in the technology and how we can use it to improve things and and you know.
Interviewer,Improve another form of communication around the world which is how we transact and how we trade money there's.
Dorsey,The the traditional competitors to your business but i'm curious and i've always been curious why you're wearing an apple.
Interviewer,Watch - why do you think apple hasn't hasn't gone into this space and owned it and do you think an amazon where some of.
Dorsey,The companies and weren't probably not even thinking of will ultimately be where you are or try to be amazon did.
Interviewer,Try and we're very aggressive and competing with us through price and we saw some customers go over to them and.
Dorsey,Then we saw those same customers come back to us and you know i think we you have to focus on your strengths and our.
Interviewer,Strengths there was cohesiveness you were not just building a register we're not just building payments we're not.
Dorsey,Just building a loan product we're not just building payroll all of them work together and we've taken this approach.
Interviewer,Of what is the most critical need for a seller and just go after them line by line by line and make them work so that.
Dorsey,There are no seams and you know you don't have to think about connecting them at all so you download one up and.
Interviewer,You're done so we just haven't seen that approach but certainly apple and amazon could go after the same thing but this.
Dorsey,Is our focus this is our dna and you know when we get to partners with with companies like like apple who we've.
Interviewer,Learned so much from and square only exists today because of apple we're honored and and we learn and you.
Dorsey,Know we we hope to contribute to the ecosystem that they created that made us even possible in the first place i want.
Interviewer,To sneak in to questions from the audience before we have to say goodbye so let's bring up the lights.
Dorsey,If we could well while we're getting the microphone by the way 140 characters are 280 these days where you live in both.
Interviewer,Both yeah what are you gonna have read you think under 140 under 140 okay we have a couple people a couple hands.
Dorsey,Right here in this in the friend claudia rojas capital bringing it to the theme of playing for the long term can you.
Interviewer,Speak to the value of founder centric companies or founder run companies in the public markets and perhaps their.
Dorsey,Greater capacity to plan for the long term and so here i'm thinking about face book under mark zuckerberg tesla and.
Interviewer,Netflix and then of course your own experience as a founder i have a very great fortune of being on the board of.
Dorsey,The walt disney company which was also a very strongly founder led company and the founder has died and the company.
Interviewer,Thrives and what walt was able to do to imbue his values and his creativity and his direction into the company lives on.
Dorsey,And you feel it in every single thing the company does every single conversation at the board level all the.
Interviewer,Way down so i have the fortune of being on that board because i get to learn how to do that i as lorene said death is.
Dorsey,Life's greatest invention we are all going to die and that forces a bunch of considerations around how we prioritize.
Interviewer,Our work but more importantly it puts this this constraint upon us that if we want to leave something that actually.
Dorsey,Has impact we need to make sure that we're leaving something that isn't dependent upon us living and there's an.
Interviewer,Independent pulse upon us being there in the first place so that's what i aspire to every single day i don't i think it's.
Dorsey,A failure if i have to make a decision there's something wrong with the organization that we need to fix.
Interviewer,Whether it be the people the context the organization the the problem we're trying to go after.
Dorsey,The articulation the fact that we might be doing too much that's the criteria that i started looking at when i'm.
Interviewer,Forced to make a decision there god forbid our board has to make a decision so that's that's how i'm measuring.
Dorsey,Myself is are we building a structure that isn't dependent upon me is it a dependent upon our current leadership.
Interviewer,And ultimately isn't depend upon anyone in the company today and that forces a bunch of considerations that are really.
Dorsey,Hard to do but will allow us to ultimately thrive and that's that's what i want to build that's what i want to.
Interviewer,Leave behind you know what on that note i'm gonna say thank you thank you for the conversation so very much and let me.
Dorsey,Let me also say thank you to everybody here it has been a tremendous day i want to thank everybody for the questions for.
Interviewer,Sticking with us jack dorsey everybody thank you we hope to all see you next year right back here thanks thank you.
Dorsey,For joining us at the new york times deal book conference this concludes today's program please join us in the.
Interviewer,Atrium until 6 p.m. for cocktails sponsored by united coat-check we'll also be found on the atrium level have a.
Dorsey,Wonderful evening  .
Interviewer,So the format for today will be i'm gonna be doing a short interview with mr. dorsey before we then open it up to.
Dorsey,Your questions from the floor so my first question is one that i asked you just ten minutes ago before i.
Interviewer,Realized i don't want you to answer what is the best thing about your job probably the best thing about my job is.
Dorsey,Just being able to see like the feeling you get when you are when you help create something and you actually see.
Interviewer,People interact with it and you see people use it whether it be you know in my case a program or a piece of hardware.
Dorsey,Or art when you actually see it on someone else's face and you and you see that interaction it's just uh it feels.
Interviewer,Electric so being able to to see people use our technologies and and to see our customers has been really something my.
Dorsey,Favorite is always when my my mom independently discovers something that i didn't have to tell her about and and.
Interviewer,There are two moments when the first thing is my parents were some of the first people on twitter and we started.
Dorsey,With sms and my mom thought it was the it was the way to contact me and my family like she thought twitter was sms.
Interviewer,And she thought it was a private channel so she would and you can now search back to all of her first tweets and it's at.
Dorsey,Marsha dorsey you can search back to all of her first tweets and she was actually like yelling at my brothers and jack.
Interviewer,When he coming home and all these other things and then she realized oh wait a minute this is public and then the.
Dorsey,Second time with with square is she her favorite coffee store and st. louis missouri some coffee started using us.
Interviewer,And she she went in and she she texted me she's like jaka you know my favorite coffee store just.
Dorsey,Started using square and like i love when people just happen upon it rather than having to direct from my head go.
Interviewer,Look at what i made go look at what they did especially you know someone someone like my mom so it's always uh that's.
Dorsey,Probably the best part of the day is seeing how people seeing how people use it okay and with regards to kind of your.
Interviewer,Early career i read somewhere that one of the main inspirations for twitter was um.
Dorsey,Taxi systems and how they have very short you know messages to convey where they are is that true yeah yeah i really.
Interviewer,Missed the boat on creating goober but i was a huge huge into dispatch and the reason why is and playing again back to.
Dorsey,My parents my parents i'm from st. louis missouri st. louis missouri how many of you have been there st. louis so st..
Interviewer,Louis has has had a has had a tough history and so in the 40s 50s and 60s a lot of people left the city and moved.
Dorsey,Out to the suburbs and my parents are always stood by the city and the metropolitan area is about 4 million.
Interviewer,"People and the city has dwindled down to about 350,000 people and it's extremely segregated north and south lines its."
Dorsey,Highest highest homicide per capita in the country we switch with detroit and dc does those three usually but my.
Interviewer,Parents they grew up in the city they loved the city and you know for me it developed this obsession and fascination.
Dorsey,With cities as well and the way that really manifested for me for maps i was just obsessed with with maps and i would.
Interviewer,Get lost and i'm constantly just wondering what was happening at this particular intersection or what was you.
Dorsey,Know down the street whatnot and i had tons of maps of st. louis and tons of maps of my other favorite city they had.
Interviewer,Never been to which is new york city my parents also had a police scanner always in a cb radio so we lived right next to.
Dorsey,The highway and i would always listen to the trucks and the and the police and fire trucks and.
Interviewer,The ambulances and eventually my parents got a ibm pc jr. and a macintosh and i would actually take the information from.
Dorsey,The police scanner and plot it out on my paper maps i could actually watch the police cars move because there is.
Interviewer,Reporting where they are and where they're going or what they're doing but little by little the computer became.
Dorsey,This thing that was uh was amazing because they could actually build a map on it and i can make those i could put.
Interviewer,Dots on that map and i can make those dots move and i taught myself just enough programming to make that happen.
Dorsey,And and that's always been my approach in my life as i've never really had a desire to become an engineer i never had.
Interviewer,A desire to become a ceo or start a company or be an entrepreneur i learned whatever it took to move me to the next.
Dorsey,Step to unblock whatever i wanted to do and for me i wanted to see the city in any way and the computer was was the way.
Interviewer,To get there so taught myself had a program in c and eventually i had these maps of police cars and ambulances that.
Dorsey,Were riding around st. louis all from the police scanner and then i little by little found public databases that were.
Interviewer,Accessible on the internet of of historical movements that i could program in and then i learned to when i.
Dorsey,Was about 17 or 18 that this whole thing i was doing had a name and it was called dispatch so i found the biggest ditz.
Interviewer,Dispatch firm in the world which just happened to be in new york city and it was called dms and i found i found their.
Dorsey,Website but they had no contact information no way to get in so i was pretty good at computers at this time.
Interviewer,And st. louis had a pretty strong underground hacking culture and i learned a lot from it and i figured out.
Dorsey,A hole in their website and i found their corporate email list and found the name of the ceo and the email.
Interviewer,Of the ceo and the chairman and they sent too many mails saying your website has a hole in it here's how you fix it.
Dorsey,And by the way i write dispatch software and they flew me out and i i joined ems and suddenly i was working on dispatch.
Interviewer,For all of new york city which was amazing because the thing about dispatch for me is you could actually see how the.
Dorsey,City is working living breathing how it moves but unfortunately in that case was from a very vertical standpoint in terms.
Interviewer,Of city services and and twitter really was born out of a desire to see it from a personal level if if an individual.
Dorsey,Could report what they're doing and where they're going and what they're doing next and we could see that all in.
Interviewer,Real time what would that look like and so yeah in my my uh what's my fascination and and career really.
Dorsey,Started in dispatch was just high transactional always available low latency systems over deep deep deep deep.
Interviewer,And in the background in many places that people just didn't consider asiya and with regards to twitter when you set.
Dorsey,It up alongside you know the other co-founders did you have any idea where did he want it to get where do you think.
Interviewer,It might go were you hoping it would end up we are i mean we didn't really have any any idea and and that's not why we.
Dorsey,Were building it we were building it because we wanted to it was it was fun and and it was something that we we.
Interviewer,Wanted to see and i had my dispatch background and i've had a blogging background and biz joined up at blogger.
Dorsey,For a little while when he was at google and we all somehow ended up at ou do have joined oh do and became ceo i.
Interviewer,Joined about two months after that and then biz joins two months after that and the funny thing about that was no one.
Dorsey,There really cared about what we were building which was podcast and we just had no passion for it and.
Interviewer,That the business was not doing well the direction was was fairly weak so we we often went out and just thought about.
Dorsey,You know what what would we do and what would we want to work on and we had these these hack days where we would.
Interviewer,Actually try to implement some of these ideas and and twitter was born out of born out or one of those but the.
Dorsey,Important thing about this we just had this amazing team but the wrong initial idea and when you have amazing people.
Interviewer,And really creative people you'll come up with something and and and really the desire was just to build something that.
Dorsey,We wanted to use on a on a daily basis and it resonated with us every day and and we were fortunate and that it.
Interviewer,Resonated with others too but there was no particular design or desire or goal around its success and i think it's very.
Dorsey,Hard to start with that as a as a barrier because it it ends up blocking the creativity ultimately from mine.
Interviewer,Stunning you went to college for a little bit then dropped out obviously to pursue your other girls did your time at.
Dorsey,College have any impact on the where you are today or was it just something that got in the way of your real passion i.
Interviewer,Think everyone learns in a different way and i was i was deciding because of this fascinates from city heights cities i.
Dorsey,Also had a fascination with with leaders of cities and and mayors and i was deciding actually when i was entering in.
Interviewer,University should i go with a political science program or should i go with the computer science program i know most.
Dorsey,People don't compare the two but i did and i decided ultimately go down the computer science route because i imagine.
Interviewer,That if i went down political science and i went down the route of of trying to be a marin to get into politics that.
Dorsey,I could write a law or a rule and i could probably see the effects of it within two to four to maybe eight years.
Interviewer,Whereas i could write rules and laws in a program and model it and see it within see the result of it within eight.
Dorsey,Seconds so the speed was quite attractive and and just this unbounded creativity and potential that's in front.
Interviewer,Of you when you when you program it's it's a weird feeling because um you you have this ability to just create.
Dorsey,Something from absolutely nothing and whatever you imagine you you can you can probably do and there's a real there's a.
Interviewer,Real electricity to that so in school i found that it was more driven towards an academic outcome than it was a practical.
Dorsey,Outcome in my particular program so i was learning a lot more i was at dms when i was at nyu i was learning a lot.
Interviewer,More and moving faster than outside of the university then i was inside so i just decided that i'm going to i'm going.
Dorsey,To and the university part and just work on that on the external and get working on on what i want to build right away.
Interviewer,And i you know my my mom reminds me every week that i'd still have an opportunity to go back to school but i'm.
Dorsey,Learning a lot right now and i think it's a different answer for every single every single person and you have to.
Interviewer,Answer it only for yourself on that kind of point was it a really tough decision so you mentioned your mom and not.
Dorsey,Necessarily i don't know she still wants you to go back to university and was there a lot of pressure from your.
Interviewer,Parents when taking that decision or do you just go ahead and i'm more or less just went ahead and did it but they they.
Dorsey,Were not happy about i mean they come from a catholic upbringing in st. louis missouri so my parents didn't finish.
Interviewer,High school and i was the first to even attempt going to college parents weren't all that well off so you know they.
Dorsey,Definitely had a lot of aspirations for me in that particular vein so there was you know there's a lot of.
Interviewer,Standard catholic guilt they couldn't went along with that decision but i got over it and i don't know if my parents.
Dorsey,Have and and he talked a little bit about politics as well and i read somewhere that your dream job was to be.
Interviewer,Mayor of new york city well aspirationally it was but i've realized that i feel like can probably.
Dorsey,Influence more with with these companies and i then i could actually being a mayor and i think that's generally been.
Interviewer,More and more the case these groups of individuals who are creating these technologies and creating these.
Dorsey,Movements and have just so much influence right now and it's not limited to any particular geographic or.
Interviewer,Political boundary and it's really it's really really exciting in that and that comes with a responsibility that forces.
Dorsey,You to mature very very quickly and again it goes back to like where are you learning the fastest and i just felt my.
Interviewer,My maturity and going down one particular route of life was was so much more accelerated than than another one.
Dorsey,And i think going down the political route and more of a mayor route i still love i i just don't think i'd be able to.
Interviewer,Do as much as i like and i i love my i love my freedoms and my my independence that would also be cut off so yes yeah.
Dorsey,Coming back to the companies you're involved with both with twitter still as well as you'll see a square how do you.
Interviewer,Balance that is there ever a conflict of interest or just in terms of tying me how do you decide where the priorities.
Dorsey,Are well i am i spent a year where i'd actually did half and half and the intention was just to keep that to a.
Interviewer,Year and kept it to a year and that was really hard i started the week at square and on monday and i would go to twitter.
Dorsey,In the afternoon and then i would start tuesday at twitter and then there would go to square and that.
Interviewer,Junoon so i'd have this like snake through that felt like these you know 24-hour days at one company so i made it.
Dorsey,I made it work but it wasn't it wasn't the healthiest thing and now we we just have such an amazing leadership team in.
Interviewer,Place and and the potential is really in front of the company so i concentrate my time a lot more now on with our ceo dick.
Dorsey,So we have dinner every every tuesday night same restaurant same table usually the same food never the same.
Interviewer,Conversation which is always a good thing and then the food is good what is it it's a restaurant called zuni yeah i.
Dorsey,Probably should not have given that name out but i did probably gonna have to find a new place now i'm sorry no that's.
Interviewer,My fault so i yeah and then i i just meet with members of the management team on tuesday so i think there's actually a.
Dorsey,Lot of parallels between the two companies i think they're both working on something fundamental something.
Interviewer,Essential to a civilization and to humanity twitter obviously working on communication and square working on.
Dorsey,Commerce both have been with us forever we commerce i believe actually was it was a predecessor we were trading goods.
Interviewer,And services before we're using language to trade stories and what's what's inching to me about both is if you if.
Dorsey,You simplify either one of them there's so much that's built on top of each that actually benefit and get easier for.
Interviewer,People and get better for people so i'd rather spend all of my time and my effort focused on the the lowest layer.
Dorsey,Of of what we have to deal with on a daily basis and i can't think of of anything more fundamental than.
Interviewer,Communication and commerce apart from health and education and obviously governance so i think all of those are.
Dorsey,On the i would always i would always choose to work in some dimension and in.
Interviewer,Simplifying those and so i see a lot of parallels between the two companies in that sense and that their fundamental.
Dorsey,And i also see that they both they both stand for a very clear purpose and they both stand for a leveling of the playing.
Interviewer,Field what was most amazing about twitter was that we we designed it for for sms so anyone in the world that had.
Dorsey,Access to you know just a shared or a five dollar cellphone could actually have a conversation with the entire.
Interviewer,World and you know someone with a with a five dollar nokia could actually have a conversation with someone the $900 ipad.
Dorsey,And we see that almost every single day and it really makes the world feel small and we have we have some of the you know.
Interviewer,These really powerful individuals using the service and then we have we have the largest governments in the world using.
Dorsey,The service so you know they're both the important thing is they're both using the same tool and that means you know.
Interviewer,You're only limited by the are the quality and the influence of of your idea and and your ambition ultimately.
Dorsey,And it can scale back and forth quite quickly and we see the same thing with square where we have we have people who.
Interviewer,Are piano teachers or golf instructors or doing something on the side using the exact same tool that we supply to to.
Dorsey,Starbucks and you know glow and and to whole foods and if we can handle the transactional capacity of a starbucks.
Interviewer,That means that anyone who has that aspiration in the same way that howard did could also use us to get there and.
Dorsey,And that means that because it's the same tool it truly loves lovis a playing field my mother my mother owned a coffee.
Interviewer,Store when i was uh when i was 12 and you know she had a very very different ambition than howard schultz her.
Dorsey,Ambition was to provide a venue for the neighborhood to provide a sense of community in the neighborhood to sell.
Interviewer,Beans but tell me have three employees and those three employees happen to be me.
Dorsey,And my two younger brothers and she didn't want to have multiple locations she don't want to grow beyond that and i.
Interviewer,Find that to be very admirable and i think there's a there's generally a trend today where more and more.
Dorsey,Companies and more and more groups of people can actually choose to stay small and still have massive impact whether.
Interviewer,It's a deep impact like my mother in a community or a global impact like teams of six who can actually create something.
Dorsey,And and really everyone around the world can can participate in and then use it howard schultz had a very different.
Interviewer,Ambition which is he had a similar coffee store and he wanted that coffee store in every city around the world and.
Dorsey,I admire both approaches but it's a difference in an ambition and and what they want to do and i believe that.
Interviewer,Fundamentally the tools should remain consistent and and really get out of the way so that people can can meet that.
Dorsey,Okay just so you kind of continue on that so you talked a little bit about how twitter is a great leveler and.
Interviewer,Indeed you can make it happen that they've been amazing things happening on twitter and twitter being useful things.
Dorsey,Like the arab spring the uprising coordinating the protest and then more recently there's been a lot of focus on.
Interviewer,Twitter trolls and some some of the negative abuse that can happen on twitter do you see the company is having.
Dorsey,A social responsibility to promote a certain view or promote certain ideals or is it very much as you said just a.
Interviewer,Tool to allow people to interact i mean i think the main purpose of twitter is to make sure that we let every voice.
Dorsey,Flow and i think it's really important for us to see every opinion and i think ultimately like every technology is just.
Interviewer,A reflection of of the world and what we want in civilization both the present and the future state so what we we have.
Dorsey,To make sure of though is that everyone who participates in lending their voice to twitter and using twitter to amplify.
Interviewer,That voice they feel safe doing so and you know abuse has has no has no part on on the service and we have a staff of.
Dorsey,Many that are dedicated to making sure that people feel safe and they can continue to trust the brand and the.
Interviewer,Service to make sure that their voices is heard everywhere in a way they want to be heard and also that they don't.
Dorsey,Feel threatened in any way but you know i i wanna i want to live in though i want to live in a world where i can.
Interviewer,Actually see all opinions because i think i think there's there's value in every opinion it's up to me to decide.
Dorsey,Which one is truly valuable on which ones or which ones i act on but if we were to take that away and and live and.
Interviewer,Very very sheltered ways i think we would we would take away a massive learning opportunity as well so i think.
Dorsey,The most important thing is to give people controls you turn it off you turn it on and i think as long as those and.
Interviewer,Those controls are intuitive and people know how to use them immediately people people feel great and trust and.
Dorsey,Trust the service and and when that fails or when it's confusing or when people are frustrated we've failed as a.
Interviewer,Company as well okay my final question on twitter before we move on to square so then based on that do you have a.
Dorsey,Problem with things like isil using twitter to promote the latest their video do you see that as being something.
Interviewer,That maybe twitter should draw a line on and you know close the site close that particular account down or do you feel.
Dorsey,That it would get a lot of retweets is it something that people deserve to hear about i think it goes again back to the.
Interviewer,Controls and i think um i think people should have the freedom to choose what they what they see and what they choose.
Dorsey,Not to i don't think it should be forced upon them i don't think it should be you know an unexpected surprise in any way.
Interviewer,I think they fully have to opt into it but the more we start adding bias or editorial to the service the less people.
Dorsey,All over the world trusted and i think that that trust is something that we've really worked hard to earn and and.
Interviewer,We'll continue to do more of that and be very transparent around those policies i mean i think the most important thing is.
Dorsey,Is to explain why something like that may still be on the service and and to also work with our peers to make sure.
Interviewer,That we have a consistent point of view around that but this is a reflection of the world today and this is happening.
Dorsey,And i would rather live in a world where at least we're having a conversation about it and we and we're talking about.
Interviewer,It because i think ultimately it allows us to move faster and in solving it and fixing it and addressing it if that's.
Dorsey,What we need to do okay now moving on you left witter or i mean you left a ceo and most people would.
Interviewer,Have said that you know creating and founding one life-changing business is enough but you moved on to set up square.
Dorsey,Which has just been launched in the uk yesterday was it launched around the world yesterday around the world yes not.
Interviewer,Sure our cash register product around the world for free yesterday so those of people people in the audience who might.
Dorsey,Not necessarily know that a huge amount about square do you want to very briefly explain what it is that you do what's.
Interviewer,Your vision for the business yeah so five how many of you have have seen square good amount we have a lot of work.
Dorsey,To do but we have a lot of work to do with twitter tear so i mean that that's one.
Interviewer,Of the reasons why you you keep keep working at this as a if it feels over just i don't think it's it's truly as.
Dorsey,Big as it as it could be so i think so five years ago i switched roles with my co-founder ev and he was chairman and.
Interviewer,Our ceo and i became chairman he became ceo and i reconnected with my second boss after my mother at the coffee store.
Dorsey,Which is a guy named jim mckelvey in san louis missouri and he became a glass artist and we we really loved working.
Interviewer,Together when i was about 15 16 years old and he was an engineer as well and we were talking about you know just.
Dorsey,Wanting to work together again and we didn't really know on what and then one day he called me in desperation and said.
Interviewer,I lost i lost i lost the sale of my glass art and he says you know two thousand dollar pieces of glass art and.
Dorsey,The reason he lost that cell is because he couldn't accept a credit card and the funny thing was we were both talking to.
Interviewer,Each other on an iphone so we have these like effectively super computers next to our ears and the guy can't close the.
Dorsey,Sale because he can't accept a credit card so why why is that and and we started asking why and we started.
Interviewer,Realizing while this industry is extremely complicated so it seemed like a very interesting challenge can we.
Dorsey,Build something that allows jim to accept a credit card and we we set aside a month to build it and we knew nothing.
Interviewer,About the credit card industry both of us were actually in credit card debt at the time we you know we we saw what the.
Dorsey,Credit card industry actually did to st. louis and families in st. louis we didn't really like the credit card.
Interviewer,Industry in many ways we didn't think it was fair but we recognized that buyers were using them all the time and in the.
Dorsey,United states and all these independent sellers and and the smaller folks really just had no opportunity to even accept.
Interviewer,Them so what it meant is they they ultimately missed a sale and they they missed an opportunity to grow or.
Dorsey,Opportunity for revenue and so we we searched on google for how to accept credit cards we found rock-bottom.
Interviewer,Merchant accounts calm we signed up for rock-bottom merchant accounts calm and we started learning about well how do we.
Dorsey,Actually accept the credit card do we take a picture with the phone no that seems like a weird experience if i'm.
Interviewer,Handing over my credit card and you're taking a picture of it we looked at the 30 pin on the bottom of the iphone and.
Dorsey,Turns out that has a huge license fee and we just didn't want to pay that and and then the interesting thing was.
Interviewer,Uh all these phones have a headphone jack on it and the headphone jack is also a microphone and if you probably.
Dorsey,Not for a lot of your cards but if you take out your credit card and you look on the back there's a magnetic strip and.
Interviewer,That made magnetic strip is actually the same technology that you would use in a cassette tape to play music in fact that.
Dorsey,Is an audio track and that audio track can be decoded into numbers and those numbers are your credit card number and.
Interviewer,Your expiration and if you actually play this audio track it sounds like a squirrel screeching like i don't know if.
Dorsey,You've heard a squirrel screaming but it's not a it's not a pleasant sound at all.
Interviewer,But if you if you swipe it through you actually hear that sound and you can write some software to decode that into.
Dorsey,A number and then you can send that number up to visa and mastercard you can check to see if there's funds available.
Interviewer,On it and if there are you capture them and then that goes into a bank account so we ultimately made a cassette tape.
Dorsey,Reader that plugged into the microphone jack of the iphone and we swiped the cards through and that and the damn.
Interviewer,Thing worked and and we swiped this is my favorite company to pitch ever because i would go around to people and.
Dorsey,I would say do you want to see my new my new project and they would say yeah and i would say and give me your credit card.
Interviewer,And and they would say no i said well he and i can see what i'm working on and and then they would hand it over and i.
Dorsey,Would take anywhere from five to five hundred dollars or take $500 for the from the people who.
Interviewer,Gave me like black amex doesn't what not so and and the way we we pitched it to tv sees when we actually decided to.
Dorsey,Build a company and raise money was to see the pitch they would have to give me their credit card as well and we we did.
Interviewer,Something interesting i put all the b c's that i didn't want to work with in the first week and i met ten during the.
Dorsey,First week and all the vcs that i really wanted to work with in the second week and and the reason why is i wanted to.
Interviewer,Make all my mistakes in the first week and then just nail it in the second week in the last the last we see that we matt.
Dorsey,Is the one i wanted to work with most which which was vinod khosla of khosla ventures and the price started very high.
Interviewer,With a hundred dollars and it went down to $1.00 with vinod but it was um it was just uh there's a lot of fun we learned.
Dorsey,So much about the credit card industry and risk and fraud and we knew nothing about building hardware and we we.
Interviewer,Learned everything that we needed to to make it work in a month and it just started resonating with with everyone we.
Dorsey,Showed and and little by little we figured out how to actually build the readers and send them out for free and.
Interviewer,And then a funny thing happened in that we realized hey we weren't just building a credit card terminal but actually were.
Dorsey,Building a full point-of-sale and these points of sales around the world and it's a there's a reason that the acronym.
Interviewer,Is pos they are not the best systems in the world and people don't have a hold you know very high regard for for a.
Dorsey,Point of sale it's usually a effectively a calculator on on top of a cash box but what's what's interesting in the.
Interviewer,Opportunity is that there's all this potential data and insights that you can have around a business you can actually.
Dorsey,Bring back up to the seller to help them make better decisions around how to grow their business and some people decide i.
Interviewer,Don't want to grow my business i'm happy like my mom with what i have but a lot of people do want to grow the business.
Dorsey,And they just no access to any analytics around how they're doing most places that we.
Interviewer,That we found in america like coffee places you go in and you ask them a very simple question how many cappuccinos did.
Dorsey,You sell today and they'll have no idea and if they do know they were usually counting cups coming out of the.
Interviewer,Dishwasher or waiting for you know their paper cup inventory to diminish and it just seemed so simple to solve but no.
Dorsey,One's spent the time to do it so we ultimately have been working on for the past five years a really sophisticated.
Interviewer,Register that is in many ways on par or better with what a walmart has in terms of running and understanding their.
Dorsey,Business and we give it away for free to all these sellers and that's what we we launched yesterday and made available.
Interviewer,To the whole world so anyone around the world can download this piece of software for their android or their or.
Dorsey,Their iphone and and really see and understand their business and and you know hopefully hopefully grow that.
Interviewer,Business from it because we just believe so much in the power of the independent business and the small business to to.
Dorsey,Drive the global economy do you see this being particular focus you talked a lot about for example coffee shops in.
Interviewer,America but off the top of my head i can just think of for example in india we it's a place where there are there.
Dorsey,Aren't that many huge supermarket chains and loads of small businesses and nowadays there are so many smartphones.
Interviewer,Out there do you see this has been particularly helpful in places like the developing world or it's not really.
Dorsey,Something that you know yeah i mean i think it's less about we're definitely seen as a as a mobile payments company.
Interviewer,And mobile payments is one of those phrases that just means kind of everything and and therefore it means.
Dorsey,Nothing and and i think ultimately what it's about is is around commerce which is a very very simple activity it's a.
Interviewer,Exchange between a buyer and a seller and it has nothing to do with the payment device that's used to do that it.
Dorsey,Could be a barter it could be a digital currency it could be a credit card it could be it could be a paper currency.
Interviewer,But what's important is really accounting for that transaction that exchanger buyer because if you can.
Dorsey,Account for you can learn from it and then you can grow so i think that applies in in every.
Interviewer,Every market not just not just a market like the united states or in europe but but everywhere because i think everyone.
Dorsey,Can make use of of insights and and the stata and if they have access to it in an easy way where they can just flip it.
Interviewer,On and wow like i you know why am i getting all these sales at 3:40 p.m. and what if i.
Dorsey,Open you know an hour what if i stay open an hour later for the next two weeks what does that.
Interviewer,Actually do to my to my business turns out and increases my business by 20% we've had we've had sellers you know.
Dorsey,Look at that and and and and actually perform those action so now our job is to answer that question and direct them.
Interviewer,In that way before they even ask the question right and and that's a that's really exciting and and then we can also.
Dorsey,Build pretty interesting services like we we have we've we launched a service called square capital six months ago and.
Interviewer,What it does is we have this deep because we're building the register our merchants these companies are putting.
Dorsey,Their full inventory their full menu a list of all their employees their full business all their sales into this one.
Interviewer,System so we have this really deep understanding of how they're doing right we know their industry we know we know a.
Dorsey,Lot about where that industry is going so what we can do is after after a few a few months of them just using the.
Interviewer,Register which is free to download and free to use we can actually send them an email saying you know here are three.
Dorsey,Options were we're happy to announce that you know we we can extend you advance you capital and from these three.
Interviewer,Options it could be a thousand dollars it could be five thousand dollars it could be ten thousand dollars would you.
Dorsey,Like to you know get this advance of capital here's the price it's all fair it's all upfront you know exactly what.
Interviewer,You're paying for the capital and you can choose one of those and it goes into your bank account the very next business.
Dorsey,Morning and typically you have to go to a bank and get small business loan and that processes.
Interviewer,Six months to even a year in some cases and the way that this advance is paid is is paid and returned is actually just by.
Dorsey,Swiping their customers card a fee is extracted so just in the course of doing their business they're actually paying.
Interviewer,That advance back and and we've lent and we've advanced over seventy five million dollars in just six months to 15.
Dorsey,Thousand sellers and 85% of sellers who have taken in vance once take another one so there's an opportunity not just.
Interviewer,To build something that accepts a payment not just to build something that allows you to see your business but.
Dorsey,Actually can give businesses capital to grow their business in a very fair and up front and in a very rich rich way.
Interviewer,Okay my final question before we open it up to the audience how do you see square working with things like apple pay the.
Dorsey,Introduction of nfc chips and phones or is it a competitor and things that even like bitcoin i guess yeah i think our.
Interviewer,Philosophy has always been you know we're building this register right and we need to empower our sellers to accept.
Dorsey,Every form of payment that comes across the counter and whether that's cash cheque emv nfc bitcoin any other digital.
Interviewer,Currency that comes their way our sellers should never have to think about that they should always think about.
Dorsey,Making only think about making the sale and buyers should just have the the freedom to use whatever they want to use.
Interviewer,So if they want to use bitcoin they should be able to use bitcoin and they should not the seller should not have to.
Dorsey,Think about what currency or what payment method they're they're using so we we started in the us we opened in.
Interviewer,Canada and japan and nfc has just never been large in those in those markets and i know that it seems counter to what you.
Dorsey,All experience because nfc is is growing quite quickly in the rest of the world but i always found the u.s. is really.
Interviewer,Behind and technology adoption masek adoption like even with twitter it took us 10 years to really adopt sms and mass.
Dorsey,You all had it for 10 years prior to to the united states and and we didn't really get it until 2005-2006 and the.
Interviewer,Reason why is it was the first time when you could send a message between the two largest carriers a text message between.
Dorsey,Two large cares which were verizon and singular because they both had different technologies sms as you know as a g8 gsm.
Interviewer,Technology and verizon is cdma so we we never really invested in building an nfc reader because we're in markets that had.
Dorsey,No buyer adoption whatsoever of nfc so apple could change that but what they've done is they've created a convenience.
Interviewer,Which is a chip that proxies a physical card and allows it to be read by an nfc terminal so we we certainly don't see it.
Dorsey,As as competition in any way because we're not building a phone and we're not building a payment payment device we're.
Interviewer,Building a register that accepts payments and and what that means is we need to build nfc terminal that that.
Dorsey,Accepts it and back to that philosophy of of making sure that ourselves can accept every form payment it's something.
Interviewer,We have to do we have a we have a product called square market that allows anyone who's using the register to flip.
Dorsey,A switch on any of the items in the register and it builds a web page for them that they can tweet out or put on.
Interviewer,Facebook or put it on their own their web page and people can actually buyers can actually use bitcoin to pay with.
Dorsey,That so if if they've turned on the the ecommerce id for any of those items bitcoin is an option for a buyer and we.
Interviewer,Get a small amount of orders from that but it was important for us to make sure that we're we're constantly testing.
Dorsey,Testing these new technologies and and you know our sellers are paying us to do that work and to be ahead of it.
Interviewer,Brilliant so that's it from me i'm now gonna move on to some questions from the audience hi why 140 characters.
Dorsey,It's a great question so there's two reasons one practical and one conceptual so the practical one first is that we we.
Interviewer,Originally focused on sms and and the web was really just a way to kind of archive and and see the tweets later on.
Dorsey,The web was really not a big part of the original vision because we wanted something noah's there was real time in.
Interviewer,Life and you could actually feel and and it would buzz your pocket right you could actually physically feel it so the.
Dorsey,Other thing that was really important to us in working with sms was making sure that we had a very simple approach and.
Interviewer,Simple experience and that simplicity met in that case that we would send one message that a message would not break.
Dorsey,Up and there was a limitation in sms at the time which was a hundred and sixty characters so i had a really really.
Interviewer,Cheap little nokia device and i loved the thing it was from a virgin and there's a prepaid phone and i wanted to.
Dorsey,Make sure that it worked on this thing and i had a great experience on it and you know that was a t9 keyboard and a.
Interviewer,Lot of you probably haven't used the t9 keyboards but i used them and i loved them is super fast and so we we took.
Dorsey,Those 160 characters and you know i also paid for every text message so we didn't want to we don't want to break it up and.
Interviewer,And and require you know to receive a text message to get charged twice for one for one tweet this was important to.
Dorsey,Me but it was also important to if we wanted to go around the world we could actually reach everyone in a in a.
Interviewer,Cost-effective way as well so the 160 characters we took 20 characters out for the username and we arrived at 140 and.
Dorsey,That was that but the conceptual side of it was we believed that you know this constraint inspires a creativity and if.
Interviewer,We really constrain the size of the canvas people might be more off-the-cuff and.
Dorsey,They might be more in the moment and that's really what we wanted because we wanted this to feel again very live and.
Interviewer,Just very very human and very of the moment and and the metaphor you know we use is like if i were to give you a red.
Dorsey,Paintbrush and this huge canvas that that just took up this entire wall and i asked you to go paint that canvas you.
Interviewer,Compose yourself naturally right because this is a huge canvas and you want to you you want to you want to do the right.
Dorsey,Thing you know that that's what it kind of goes through your mind but if i were to give you that same paintbrush and.
Interviewer,That same red paint and i'd give you a business card and i say make a mark just very quick to make the mark and and.
Dorsey,That's kind of the feeling we wanted was that everything you everything you write everything you tweet is a value to.
Interviewer,Someone and we wanted to make sure that it feels like you can just fire these things off very very quickly as if you.
Dorsey,Were you're speaking and and and someone the interpreter is going to devalue it and that's always been really important.
Interviewer,To us and you know in the in the early days of the service we we got a lot of we got a lot of heat for 140 characters.
Dorsey,And just how useless twitter was right and and people would would explain in a way that wow this is just a since it's.
Interviewer,Only only 140 characters you know all people are gonna end up doing is just talk about what they have for breakfast.
Dorsey,And we would share that so much like theirs and twitter is just about what you have for breakfast and you know my.
Interviewer,Answer to that is well you know sometimes i do tweet about what i have for breakfast and most of the world.
Dorsey,Could care less and was probably offended because it's so not valuable to them but there was one person in the.
Interviewer,World that really cares and that's my mom and when she gets the tweet that i just stayed breakfast and one day for.
Dorsey,Breakfast and she's really happy because she knows that i'm still eating i'm alive and yeah and i had breakfast and.
Interviewer,She loves it so what i mean what's in thing about that is it's all up to who receives a message and who interprets.
Dorsey,The message and we can't we can't judge the value as it goes out we you know we have to leave it up to the individual to.
Interviewer,Really bring value to that message into that tweet and that's always been an important part of our philosophy thanks.
Dorsey,What are some of the key lessons from your time at twitter which helped and influenced the way you set up and.
Interviewer,Launched swear there were many i you know again i really had no aspiration to be a ceo or to be a leader in the.
Dorsey,Company or even create a company i just wanted i wanted to to build and use this thing and i was so excited about that.
Interviewer,And and and really you just learn whatever you have to you learn whatever you have to learn to make that work and.
Dorsey,And right now a company is just a great vehicle to spread an idea around the world and it allows an idea to to thrive.
Interviewer,But the idea and the purpose of our work always leads not not the company the company is support and that and the.
Dorsey,Businesses is oxygen not a to that idea so i think you when when you are tasked with then creating a company you kind of.
Interviewer,Want to you you you tend to or at least i did you grow up a little bit too fast sometimes and you try to put too much.
Dorsey,Structure in place or the wrong structure in place and that distracts you from you know really the work that.
Interviewer,You absolutely need to do and one of the interesting thing i did two big lessons from from that time number one was the.
Dorsey,Power of instrumentation the power of knowing exactly what's happening within the system and the power of transparency.
Interviewer,Within the system but also within the company so we would go down a lot in the early days of the company because we.
Dorsey,Just had no instrumentation at all it's like driving the car flying a plane and not having any sense of how fast.
Interviewer,You're going right it's extremely dangerous so we we just didn't know what people were doing.
Dorsey,With it how how the resources were being used and and ultimately it just crashed to a.
Interviewer,Halt multiple times and little by little we started instrumenting the system and we we built simple things that would.
Dorsey,Tell us what the system is doing or how people are using it and these seem like of course you build dashboards and of.
Interviewer,Course you you know you look at the data but you know in the in a moment when you're creating these things that's not.
Dorsey,What you put first it's it's often an afterthought and the biggest thing that that solved was we stop speculating.
Interviewer,About what was going on and we could actually point to what was going on and then since we could point to it we could.
Dorsey,Fix it and we had a ton of communication issues in the company at that time just that we wouldn't talk to each other for.
Interviewer,In some cases and and in like engineering sometimes we want to talk to operations and when you have those.
Dorsey,Divisions in the in the company the people using the service actually see the results of it right so any.
Interviewer,Organizational difficulty actually manifests in the service itself and that's just ultimately rude and selfish.
Dorsey,And you're putting your own your own mess in front of the people that are using your service or the customer so as.
Interviewer,We started instrumenting the system we had a lot healthier communication this is a funny thing because we're building.
Dorsey,A communication company and we couldn't communicate internally so that was number one and the first bit of code i.
Interviewer,Wrote for square was an admin dashboard so we could actually see everything that's happening constantly and then.
Dorsey,Number two is just how important it is to to really make sure that you're building the right team dynamic and and.
Interviewer,That means hiring great people who share your you know who share the purpose and share the vision but it also means that.
Dorsey,We're parting ways with people who who don't and and we had some people in the is a twitter who were just you know not.
Interviewer,Not not not folks who really worked well together with others and and this was probably the hardest thing for me to do.
Dorsey,As a ceo in the early days i had to i to fire someone who had the entire system in their head and when you're faced with.
Interviewer,That you're like well i can't i can't fire this person because if i fire this person then the whole system is going.
Dorsey,Down and we can never get it back up and it took me a long time to do it about six months and that's you know a regret.
Interviewer,Actually but ultimately when i when i did it and i did it and you know when i when i was when i was when we were.
Dorsey,Parting ways i was crying and he was crying and then i went back to tell the company and we're only about seven.
Interviewer,People and i was crying and the company was crying and like it was at a very emotional period because we were also.
Dorsey,Under a lot of stress because we're constantly going down and now we just parted ways with the guy who knew how to.
Interviewer,Bring the system back up but something really interesting happened immediately after that all these new leaders and the.
Dorsey,Company emerged and actually we didn't go down and and we built we built a lot of great practices to stay up more and.
Interviewer,More so i think when you're just getting started whether it's a company or organization you try to get people.
Dorsey,Really quickly but you don't you don't edit as much and you don't really make sure that there's a great team dynamic.
Interviewer,And if you don't it can be really really poisonous to the culture and and ultimately will will block new ideas and.
Dorsey,New leadership from from emerging so constantly looking at the team and making sure that we have the right team.
Interviewer,In place is something i applied to square as well hi my name is christian r once and thank you for coming to oxford.
Dorsey,Today my question to you is what do you think more people in your position within the tech industry can do to.
Interviewer,Encourage women in tech so in your case you've invested in peak and you've also am set up a female coding program at.
Dorsey,Square what do you think others in your position can do to follow suit well i mean i think.
Interviewer,I think doing it i i don't i don't think it's just women in tech but really established establishing more leadership.
Dorsey,In in our in our women and i'm really proud to say that like over over 54% of squares led by by women on my team so.
Interviewer,Our cfo our head of business and our head of engineering are all women leaders and they you know i think the.
Dorsey,Most important thing is to always establish a role model for who you're who you're really looking to become in.
Interviewer,Terms of your own leadership aspirations and and your own aspirations around impact so making sure that we're we're.
Dorsey,Really hiring for that and and we're hiring really great people to put them in those positions of leadership and.
Interviewer,We're and we're establishing that in the company as a majority of the company not a minority of the company is really.
Dorsey,Critical and and then and then talking about it all the time this is this is what we've done and and we're really.
Interviewer,Proud of it and we're doing more and this is what that looks like and we've invested a lot of time and effort and.
Dorsey,Resources into programs like girls who code who does an intensive seven-week program teaching girls how to engineer.
Interviewer,And program and we have our own program called code camp which we do three four day intensive for college girls and also.
Dorsey,High school women as well so i think it's you know just just doing it and making the time investing in it and and.
Interviewer,Setting the intent and and you know making sure the whole company knows that this is our intent and this is something.
Dorsey,That we believe in it'll just spread because everyone in the company will constantly talk about it as well and.
Interviewer,That'll spread around around the industry so we try to talk about it in in there's many ways and channels as.
Dorsey,We can with square you seem to have got lots of funding on board and it seemed sort of from the face of it that you're.
Interviewer,Very much in charge still in my experience that's quite hard small startup but big funds on board how do.
Dorsey,You go about attracting funding and then managing your investors after you've secured it i think the the thing that's.
Interviewer,Always worked for me is realizing that your your investors are first and foremost i always want to go to anyone.
Dorsey,That i want to work with with something to show and it was really important to us before we talked to any investors on.
Interviewer,The twitter side that we actually had people using the service and in in in some at some scale and on the square.
Dorsey,Side that we actually had a working prototype square we had really seven merchants when we actually went to raise.
Interviewer,Money but we had a working prototype that people are actually using and if people can't see it and feel it's very.
Dorsey,Very hard to sell and i don't want to just go and tell people this is gonna be the biggest thing ever.
Interviewer,I want to i want to be able to show that and have them feel it and walk away feeling that as well so that's first and.
Dorsey,Foremost is have something to show and so that they can actually feel and start making it a part of their story as well.
Interviewer,And feel like they have ownership over it and then second is the realization like i always kind of approach this is.
Dorsey,Like this is a this is a if if we take money from someone this is kind of like hiring someone that we can never fire we.
Interviewer,Can never get rid of right so that means do we really want to work with this person is this person going to be.
Dorsey,Someone that really pushes us pushes us in a way that we need to be pushed and and you can tell that very fairly.
Interviewer,Quickly in that first week of pitching square got a lot of people who said you know okay great we don't have any.
Dorsey,Questions we'll get back to you in about 30 minutes probably with with the term sheet and i said i don't want a term.
Interviewer,Sheet especially if you're not asking any questions because they asked no questions.
Dorsey,During doing the pitch and that means if if they're on our board that they're actually not going to be all that.
Interviewer,Constructive in terms of really asking the tough questions and making sure that we're you know we're not just in our own.
Dorsey,Bubble but they're looking outside that is the role of the board is to is to look outside and bring all their insight.
Interviewer,And wisdom to us so that we can help guide to guide the company and and that second week we got a lot of tough.
Dorsey,Questions and and that's what i love because i know if i'm getting tough questions in the pitch i'm going to get.
Interviewer,Tough questions in the boardroom as well and not just the boardroom but every week i mean if a node emails me once a.
Dorsey,Week about have you thought about this are you doing this and you know i know this person can i make an introduction.
Interviewer,Here and it's just very very useful so i'm looking for someone who i just love working with and i think you you have to.
Dorsey,Set a very very high bar it's not just about money or the firm it's about the individual that you're ultimately going.
Interviewer,To work with and people ask me all the time like you know what firms would would you suggest i go pitch and like.
Dorsey,Fine find the people that you really want to work with in those firms and if there's someone that really you know.
Interviewer,Just really resonates with you and you love and you love the idea of working with them focus on them and if it if it.
Dorsey,Test out to be to be the case great but i think you have to kind of treat it as like i'm adding this person to my team.
Interviewer,And square was um was a little bit different because one of the things that i stated to all the investors in the.
Dorsey,Board meeting and and and folks who might join the board is like look this is not going to be a stress-free company.
Interviewer,Like there are so much interest in in commerce and payments and there's gonna be a ton of competition in the future.
Dorsey,We're very early right now but this for me a ton of competition in the future and not a lot of people want to work in.
Interviewer,Payments because it's perceived as being slow and you have to work with these banking partners which aren't the.
Dorsey,Fastest moving organizations in the world and people are trying to steal money from me all the time.
Interviewer,So this is not a place that you know it's going to be stress-free so i need to know that you will actually have a.
Dorsey,Level head in times of in times of crisis because it's going to be very easy for us to see something and then.
Interviewer,React quickly and if we constantly react to something then we're actually building someone else's roadmap and.
Dorsey,We're not fulfilling our own vision and i want to make sure that we stay calm cool collected in that as a board and as.
Interviewer,An investor group and that you trust the folks with the most context to do the work and that is the folks in the.
Dorsey,Company and i just made sure that everyone everyone knew that and if they didn't like that then don't invest and.
Interviewer,And some people some people walked because that and that was great great for me because that meant i didn't have.
Dorsey,To deal with that later on you know i think social networking platforms have had the dual effect of attracting.
Interviewer,Hundreds of millions of people but also alienating many those who've used it and also those like me who never joined them.
Dorsey,Not because i never wanted to sort of enjoy the benefits that they offered but because of my sort of fears over privacy.
Interviewer,And you know my fundamental skepticism of sort of where technology is headed so what do you say to that and how do you.
Dorsey,Try to coax those people that the unconverted the the fearful but the ones who are equally as enthusiastic as you.
Interviewer,To to join sort of the global community whether online or personally thank you i think it's a i think it's a great.
Dorsey,Question and it's definitely a concern shared by by many i think the first and foremost we we say the word technology.
Interviewer,And we tend to put it on a pedestal and that pedestal makes it very abstract and then that abstraction makes it very.
Dorsey,Scary and we have to keep in mind that technology is ultimately just a tool and these are tools and we pick up the tools.
Interviewer,And we give power to the tools and and we can also take that power away from the tools fundamentally i believe.
Dorsey,That all tools and all technologies are really just reflections and mirrors of our desires as civilization our desires.
Interviewer,Is as a humanity and and ultimately i think a reminder and potentially even a crutch that we're already born with.
Dorsey,Everything that we need and i truly i truly believe that you know and you see this trend where we're moving from these.
Interviewer,Abstractions where you know before a computer would fill this room and now it fits in my pocket and maybe very soon.
Dorsey,Around my wrist and just 10 years ago the only way to input something was a keyboard and a mouse and now we're using.
Interviewer,Our fingers and potentially very very soon we'll be using our voice and and and and more of these these very human.
Dorsey,Aspects so the interfaces keep becoming more and more human and and and utilizing more of what we're born with.
Interviewer,And i think what what's important to me about about twitter is that i think it's a closest thing that we have to right.
Dorsey,Now that we have to like a global consciousness where you can actually see the world in real-time and not only can.
Interviewer,You see what's happening from from a news level and from an event level but you can actually see how people think.
Dorsey,And feel about it and ultimately if we have more of that sort of activity and and the nice thing about twitter is you.
Interviewer,Share as much as you want or you can just stop if we have more of that activity though we actually see how.
Dorsey,People live and what they desire and you know how they want to how they want to see the world how they want to change.
Interviewer,The world how they want to live in the world and ultimately i believe that that creates a potential for empathy and if.
Dorsey,We have more empathy in the world we have more opportunity to remove a lot of a lot of conflict so i think broadly we.
Interviewer,Can use these tools in a way to build more empathy around the world and that empathy can actually actually.
Dorsey,Has a chance to to diminish a lot of the conflict that we see in you know where we've also internalized but i i believe.
Interviewer,That we have the tools necessary to do it without these technologies as well and i think these technologies really.
Dorsey,Serve a purpose of reminding us of that and you know maybe in 20 years 50 years we will understand how to lock more of.
Interviewer,The powers of the mind in order that in order to do that when we're busy exploring space and we're busy exploring.
Dorsey,The the physical universe but but what really interests me is are the folks that are really exploring that the.
Interviewer,Depths of the of consciousness and how the consciousness actually interconnects and how it relates and i think.
Dorsey,Technology provides a model for that that might teach us in different ways so i think it's something to be excited.
Interviewer,About but it again goes back to these controls of how do i turn it off and how do i turn and turn it on and if that's.
Dorsey,Not intuitive or if it's not apparent then it's going to feel scary and if we continue to use these words like.
Interviewer,Technology or disruption or we don't explain that the why of what we're doing with these things these these are things.
Dorsey,To increase the amount of people who can participate and these are things that increased velocity of communication or.
Interviewer,Effort and if you increase velocity and the increase participation you get time back for more meaningful pursuits and i.
Dorsey,Think that's enough positive but we can also use the tools in a very negative way and we just we have to make that.
Interviewer,Decision it's ours and ours alone it's not the tools greatest inspiration i that that varies.
Dorsey,That varies a lot i think i think you always find role models for phases of your life and right now i'm i'm really.
Interviewer,Obsessed with this artist named robert irwin i mean how many of you know robert irwin okay well he has a he isn't.
Dorsey,There's a book out about him which is an interview of his life and he's an artist and he he started as a as a painter and.
Interviewer,Then he started questioning well do i really need the boundaries of the canvas and then he moved to to light and then.
Dorsey,You know he made these these light sculptures upon walls and he's like well do i really need the the wall and then.
Interviewer,He started using you know just these massive rooms and he's just constantly questioned every single thing and i love.
Dorsey,People who who really are comfortable exploring this this this ultimate question of why right so you know why is.
Interviewer,The question that is just it's the easiest question to ask but it's the hardest question to answer right and.
Dorsey,That to me is is really you know the driving force and and and what how curiosity manifests is being able to.
Interviewer,Constantly ask the question why and doing the work to answer the question why and this is a this is a you know.
Dorsey,Sometimes a fun little exercises you take a your friend or your parents or or your nephew or nieces or brothers or.
Interviewer,Sisters and i would do this to my parents all the time like dad why is the sky blue as i well you know.
Dorsey,Such-and-such recession like well why like well you know because this and why and he's like that's just how god made.
Interviewer,It and it's just it's it's interesting how quickly people kind of go to authority and then there's another route.
Dorsey,Where instead of going to authorities look well that's that's what we prove to science or you know that that is uh.
Interviewer,That's how the universe works or that's what you know this person said or that's what you know my boss said or whatever.
Dorsey,It is there's another course where we can say i don't know and if you're saying i don't know then that means that.
Interviewer,You're going to find out and and robert irwin is someone who just constantly questions every single thing that he.
Dorsey,Does in terms of this that's why what like why am i painting in a canvas why is that i don't know and and then he.
Interviewer,Explores a completely different meaning so he's a he's definitely a current role model but i've i've had i've had many.
Dorsey,Many throughout my throughout my life virginia woolf is another one to whom i love and in terms of just her her prose.
Interviewer,And her writing style and just her strength and confidence and comfort with being isolated and in her work and her.
Dorsey,Art and you know just how how she lived thanks very much for coming today jack i really enjoyed your talk my question.
Interviewer,Relates primarily to the branding of twitter and you touched briefly on on some branding issues could you talk.
Dorsey,About a little bit how about how you came up with named twitter and also the verb to tweet i mean it's something that.
Interviewer,Everybody knows regardless of whether they're a twitter fan or user or not and to me it's very iconic and i think you.
Dorsey,Really nailed it i'd really like to know the thought process about how you got there yeah i i would agree with you i.
Interviewer,Mean i think um i think twitter is a is one of those brands now that has so much awareness around the world i think it.
Dorsey,Actually has more awareness or equal awareness to to coca-cola but unlike coca-cola it actually stands for.
Interviewer,Something it's not just a beverage no offense to coca-cola but i don't drink it.
Dorsey,But it actually stands for something to people because people bring the meaning to people bring their own purpose to it.
Interviewer,And people bring their own ideas to it and and they feel ownership over it as well so we uh when we were starting the.
Dorsey,Company we wanted something that really kind of expressed or had a physical manifestation you know because when you.
Interviewer,Received one of these messages and they were called updates at the time we didn't have the word tweet when you.
Dorsey,Received an update your phone would would buzz and we we just thought that was so cool that like you know you do.
Interviewer,Something virtually and it actually affects something physically that was amazing and it was just so cool for me.
Dorsey,As a programmer i could write one line of code and i could actually make business pocket buzz which is hard to.
Interviewer,Say and he's like whoa and takes out his phone and it's a message and i just thought that was so cool so we wanted a.
Dorsey,Name that really celebrated that and we came up with the word jitter and twitch and both of those words don't really.
Interviewer,Bring up the best sort of imagery right it's something you actually want to avoid so noah noah glass who started oto.
Dorsey,And and and and and was formative in the early early twitter days went to the dictionary and he found the word twitter.
Interviewer,And it's actually in the dictionary and it was in the dictionary before the company and it means a short.
Dorsey,Inconsequential bursts of information and chirps from birds and we saw the definition were like of course i mean.
Interviewer,This is it this is what we do so we took that name and then like a standard web 2.0 company we removed the vowels and we.
Dorsey,Started with the name twt tr but we didn't do it just to copy like a flickr or the you know the the web 2.0 trends.
Interviewer,We did it because we were text-based and in the united states a short code was was five digits and we wanted.
Dorsey,We wanted our shortcode to be twt tr so we applied for it and then we found out that this magazine team people had that.
Interviewer,Shortcode so then we added the vowels back in and we came up with shortcode four zero four zero four which had.
Dorsey,Nothing to do with what we did but it was available so so then our name was our name was twitter and because it was.
Interviewer,Chirps from birds we we we took a bird illustration that we found on the web and that became our logo and and then.
Dorsey,The people using the service actually came up with the word tweet and you know we a lot of our history is really around.
Interviewer,People using the service inventing ways of doing things on the surface the at user name the hashtag the retweet i.
Dorsey,Think one of the one of the new kind of models and and interesting behaviors is this concept of the tweet storm which is.
Interviewer,You know number one number two number three number four number five number six it's a series of tweets that's meant to.
Dorsey,Be won all these things have been invented by the people using the service and the word tweet was coined by the.
Interviewer,People using the service so it's it's really meaningful when you build a brand so that people can bring their own.
Dorsey,Personality and their their own invention and and product too because that means you haven't just built a.
Interviewer,Product you've actually built a platform and people can build upon that platform and make their own thing upon that.
Dorsey,Platform and then if they feel ownership over that they continue to just use it and in really interesting ways so we've.
Interviewer,Been very very fortunate in in the name and and the bird as our logo and and the current bird just you know when you see.
Dorsey,It it really stands for something it doesn't just stand for something for the people in the company but stands for.
Interviewer,Something for the four people in the world and and and and that's something i'm really really proud of but naming is.
Dorsey,So difficult and something that i i-i've always had trouble with because my name people always thought my name.
Interviewer,Was actually john they thought jack was a nickname and no i said you know my name is actually jack believe me and my.
Dorsey,Name actually has 14 different definitions and in the dictionary jack and thirteen of them are derogatory so i.
Interviewer,Always had i always had issues with my name and a naming in general and but but having the right name just just really.
Dorsey,Makes makes everything really magical so yeah pretty well unfortunately that's all we have time for today thank you all.
Interviewer,For coming and i would like you all to join me in thanking mr. dorsey thank you.
Interviewer,What worries you right now?
Dorsey,You've been very open.
Interviewer,About lots of issues on twitter.
Dorsey,What would be your top worry.
Interviewer,About where things are right now?
Dorsey,Right now.
Interviewer,The health of the conversation.
Dorsey,"So, our purpose is to serve."
Interviewer,The public conversation.
Dorsey,And we have seen.
Interviewer,A number of attacks on it.
Dorsey,"We've seen abuse, we've seen harassment."
Interviewer,We've seen manipulation.
Dorsey,"Automation, human coordination."
Interviewer,Misinformation.
Dorsey,So these are all dynamics.
Interviewer,That we were not expecting.
Dorsey,13 years ago when we were.
Interviewer,Starting the company.
Dorsey,But we do now see them at scale.
Interviewer,And what worries me most.
Dorsey,Is just our ability to address it.
Interviewer,In a systemic way that is scalable.
Dorsey,That has a rigorous understanding.
Interviewer,Of how we're taking action.
Dorsey,A transparent understanding.
Interviewer,Of how we're taking action.
Dorsey,And a rigorous appeals process.
Interviewer,For when we're wrong.
Dorsey,Because we will be wrong.
Interviewer,Whitney pennington rodgers:.
Dorsey,I'm really glad to hear.
Interviewer,That that's something that concerns you.
Dorsey,Because i think there's been.
Interviewer,A lot written about people.
Dorsey,Who feel they've been abused.
Interviewer,And harassed on twitter.
Dorsey,And i think no one more so.
Interviewer,Than women and women of color.
Dorsey,And black women.
Interviewer,And there's been data that's come out.
Dorsey,Amnesty international put out.
Interviewer,A report a few months ago.
Dorsey,Where they showed that a subset.
Interviewer,Of active black female twitter users.
Dorsey,"Were receiving, on average."
Interviewer,One in 10 of their tweets.
Dorsey,Were some form of harassment.
Interviewer,And so when you think about health.
Dorsey,For the community on twitter.
Interviewer,I'm interested to hear.
Dorsey,Health for everyone.
Interviewer,But specificalhow are you looking.
Dorsey,To make twitter a safe space.
Interviewer,"For that subset, for women."
Dorsey,For women of color and black women?
Interviewer,Yeah.
Dorsey,So it's a pretty terrible situation.
Interviewer,When you're coming to a service.
Dorsey,"That, ideally, you want to learn."
Interviewer,Something about the world.
Dorsey,And you spend the majority of your time.
Interviewer,"Reporting abuse, receiving abuse."
Dorsey,Receiving harassment.
Interviewer,So what we're looking most deeply at.
Dorsey,Is just the incentives.
Interviewer,That the platform naturally provides.
Dorsey,And the service provides.
Interviewer,"Right now, the dynamic of the system."
Dorsey,Makes it super-easy to harass.
Interviewer,And to abuse others through the service.
Dorsey,"And unfortunately, the majority."
Interviewer,Of our system in the past.
Dorsey,Worked entirely based on people.
Interviewer,Reporting harassment and abuse.
Dorsey,So about midway last year.
Interviewer,We decided that we were going to apply.
Dorsey,A lot more machine learning.
Interviewer,A lot more deep learning to the problem.
Dorsey,And try to be a lot more proactive.
Interviewer,Around where abuse is happening.
Dorsey,So that we can take the burden.
Interviewer,Off the victim completely.
Dorsey,And we've made some progress recently.
Interviewer,About 38 percent of abusive tweets.
Dorsey,Are now proactively identified.
Interviewer,By machine learning algorithms.
Dorsey,So that people don't actually.
Interviewer,Have to report them.
Dorsey,But those that are identified.
Interviewer,Are still reviewed by humans.
Dorsey,So we do not take down content or accounts.
Interviewer,Without a human actually reviewing it.
Dorsey,But that was from zero percent.
Interviewer,Just a year ago.
Dorsey,"So that meant, at that zero percent."
Interviewer,Every single person who received abuse.
Dorsey,Had to actually report it.
Interviewer,Which was a lot of work for them.
Dorsey,A lot of work for us.
Interviewer,And just ultimately unfair.
Dorsey,The other thing that we're doing.
Interviewer,"Is making sure that we, as a company."
Dorsey,Have representation of all the communities.
Interviewer,That we're trying to serve.
Dorsey,We can't build a business.
Interviewer,That is successful.
Dorsey,Unless we have a diversity.
Interviewer,Of perspective inside of our walls.
Dorsey,That actually feel these issues.
Interviewer,Every single day.
Dorsey,And that's not just with the team.
Interviewer,That's doing the work.
Dorsey,It's also within our leadership as well.
Interviewer,So we need to continue to build empathy.
Dorsey,For what people are experiencing.
Interviewer,And give them better tools to act on it.
Dorsey,And also give our customers.
Interviewer,A much better and easier approach.
Dorsey,To handle some of the things.
Interviewer,That they're seeing.
Dorsey,So a lot of what we're doing.
Interviewer,Is around technology.
Dorsey,But we're also looking at.
Interviewer,The incentives on the service:.
Dorsey,What does twitter incentivize you to do.
Interviewer,When you first open it up?
Dorsey,And in the past.
Interviewer,It's incented a lot of outrage.
Dorsey,It's incented a lot of mob behavior.
Interviewer,It's incented a lot of group harassment.
Dorsey,And we have to look a lot deeper.
Interviewer,At some of the fundamentals.
Dorsey,Of what the service is doing.
Interviewer,To make the bigger shifts.
Dorsey,We can make a bunch of small shifts.
Interviewer,"Around technology, as i just described."
Dorsey,"But ultimately, we have to look deeply."
Interviewer,At the dynamics in the network itself.
Dorsey,And that's what we're doing.
Interviewer,But what's your sense.
Dorsey,What is the kind of thing.
Interviewer,That you might be able to change.
Dorsey,That would actually.
Interviewer,Fundamentally shift behavior?
Dorsey,"Well, one of the things."
Interviewer,We started the service.
Dorsey,With this concept of following an account.
Interviewer,As an example.
Dorsey,And i don't believe that's why.
Interviewer,People actually come to twitter.
Dorsey,I believe twitter is best.
Interviewer,As an interest-based network.
Dorsey,People come with a particular interest.
Interviewer,They have to do a ton of work.
Dorsey,To find and follow the related accounts.
Interviewer,Around those interests.
Dorsey,What we could do instead.
Interviewer,Is allow you to follow an interest.
Dorsey,"Follow a hashtag, follow a trend."
Interviewer,Follow a community.
Dorsey,Which gives us the opportunity.
Interviewer,To show all of the accounts.
Dorsey,"All the topics, all the moments."
Interviewer,All the hashtags.
Dorsey,That are associated with that.
Interviewer,Particular topic and interest.
Dorsey,Which really opens up.
Interviewer,The perspective that you see.
Dorsey,But that is a huge fundamental shift.
Interviewer,To bias the entire network.
Dorsey,Away from just an account bias.
Interviewer,Towards a topics and interest bias.
Dorsey,Because isn't it the case.
Interviewer,That one reason why you have.
Dorsey,So much content on there.
Interviewer,Is a result of putting millions.
Dorsey,Of people around the world.
Interviewer,In this kind of gladiatorial.
Dorsey,Contest with each other.
Interviewer,"For followers, for attention?"
Dorsey,"Like, from the point of view."
Interviewer,Of people who just read twitter.
Dorsey,That's not an issue.
Interviewer,But for the people who actually create it.
Dorsey,Everyone's out there saying.
Interviewer,"You know, i wish i had."
Dorsey,"A few more 'likes,' followers, retweets."
Interviewer,And so they're constantly experimenting.
Dorsey,Trying to find the path to do that.
Interviewer,And what we've all discovered.
Dorsey,Is that the number one path to do that.
Interviewer,Is to be some form of provocative.
Dorsey,"Obnoxious, eloquently obnoxious."
Interviewer,"Like, eloquent insults."
Dorsey,Are a dream on twitter.
Interviewer,Where you rapidly pile up.
Dorsey,And it becomes this self-fueling.
Interviewer,Process of driving outrage.
Dorsey,How do you defuse that?
Interviewer,"Yeah, i mean, i think you're spot on."
Dorsey,But that goes back to the incentives.
Interviewer,"Like, one of the choices."
Dorsey,We made in the early days was.
Interviewer,We had this number that showed.
Dorsey,How many people follow you.
Interviewer,We decided that number.
Dorsey,Should be big and bold.
Interviewer,And anything that's on the page.
Dorsey,That's big and bold has importance.
Interviewer,And those are the things.
Dorsey,That you want to drive.
Interviewer,Was that the right decision at the time?
Dorsey,Probably not.
Interviewer,If i had to start the service again.
Dorsey,I would not emphasize.
Interviewer,The follower count as much.
Dorsey,I would not emphasize.
Interviewer,The like count as much.
Dorsey,I don't think i would even.
Interviewer,Create like in the first place.
Dorsey,Because it doesn't actually push.
Interviewer,What we believe now.
Dorsey,To be the most important thing.
Interviewer,Which is healthy contribution.
Dorsey,Back to the network.
Interviewer,And conversation to the network.
Dorsey,Participation within conversation.
Interviewer,Learning something from the conversation.
Dorsey,Those are not things.
Interviewer,That we thought of 13 years ago.
Dorsey,And we believe are extremely.
Interviewer,Important right now.
Dorsey,So we have to look at.
Interviewer,How we display the follower count.
Dorsey,How we display retweet count.
Interviewer,How we display likes.
Dorsey,And just ask the deep question:.
Interviewer,Is this really the number.
Dorsey,That we want people to drive up?
Interviewer,Is this the thing that.
Dorsey,When you open twitter.
Interviewer,"You see, that's the thing."
Dorsey,I need to increase?
Interviewer,And i don't believe.
Dorsey,That's the case right now.
Interviewer,(applause).
Dorsey,Wi think we should look at.
Interviewer,Some of the tweets.
Dorsey,That are coming.
Interviewer,In from the audience as well.
Dorsey,Let's see what you guys are asking.
Interviewer,"I mean, this is generally, one."
Dorsey,Of the amazing things about twitter.
Interviewer,Is how you can use it for crowd wisdom.
Dorsey,"You know, that more knowledge."
Interviewer,"More questions, more points of view."
Dorsey,Than you can imagine.
Interviewer,"And sometimes, many of them."
Dorsey,Are really healthy.
Interviewer,Wi think one i saw that.
Dorsey,Passed already quickly down here.
Interviewer,What's twitter's plan to combat.
Dorsey,Foreign meddling in the 2020 us election?
Interviewer,I think that's something.
Dorsey,That's an issue we're seeing.
Interviewer,On the internet in general.
Dorsey,That we have a lot of malicious.
Interviewer,Automated activity happening.
Dorsey,"And on twitter, for example."
Interviewer,"In fact, we have some work."
Dorsey,That's come from our friends.
Interviewer,At zignal labs.
Dorsey,And maybe we can even see that.
Interviewer,To give us an example.
Dorsey,Of what exactly i'm talking about.
Interviewer,"Where you have these bots, if you will."
Dorsey,Or coordinated automated.
Interviewer,Malicious account activity.
Dorsey,That is being used to influence.
Interviewer,Things like elections.
Dorsey,And in this example we have.
Interviewer,From zignal which they've shared with us.
Dorsey,Using the data that.
Interviewer,They have from twitter.
Dorsey,You actually see that in this case.
Interviewer,White represents the humans.
Dorsey,"Human accounts, each dot is an account."
Interviewer,The pinker it is.
Dorsey,The more automated the activity is.
Interviewer,And you can see how you have.
Dorsey,A few humans interacting with bots.
Interviewer,"In this case, it's related."
Dorsey,To the election in israel.
Interviewer,And spreading misinformation.
Dorsey,About benny gantz.
Interviewer,"And as we know, in the end."
Dorsey,That was an election.
Interviewer,That netanyahu won by a slim margin.
Dorsey,And that may have been.
Interviewer,In some case influenced by this.
Dorsey,And when you think about.
Interviewer,That happening on twitter.
Dorsey,What are the things.
Interviewer,"That you're doing, specifically."
Dorsey,To ensure you don't have misinformation.
Interviewer,Like this spreading in this way.
Dorsey,Influencing people in ways.
Interviewer,That could affect democracy?
Dorsey,Just to back up a bit.
Interviewer,We asked ourselves a question:.
Dorsey,Can we actually measure.
Interviewer,The health of a conversation.
Dorsey,And what does that mean?
Interviewer,And in the same way.
Dorsey,That you have indicators.
Interviewer,And we have indicators as humans.
Dorsey,In terms of are we healthy or not.
Interviewer,Such as temperature.
Dorsey,The flushness of your face.
Interviewer,We believe that we could find.
Dorsey,The indicators of conversational health.
Interviewer,And we worked with a lab.
Dorsey,Called cortico at mit.
Interviewer,To propose four starter indicators.
Dorsey,That we believe we could ultimately.
Interviewer,Measure on the system.
Dorsey,And the first one is.
Interviewer,What we're calling shared attention.
Dorsey,It's a measure of how much.
Interviewer,Of the conversation is attentive.
Dorsey,On the same topic versus disparate.
Interviewer,The second one is called shared reality.
Dorsey,And this is what percentage.
Interviewer,Of the conversation.
Dorsey,Shares the same facts.
Interviewer,Not whether those facts.
Dorsey,Are truthful or not.
Interviewer,But are we sharing.
Dorsey,The same facts as we converse?
Interviewer,The third is receptivity:.
Dorsey,How much of the conversation.
Interviewer,Is receptive or civil.
Dorsey,"Or the inverse, toxic?"
Interviewer,And then the fourth.
Dorsey,Is variety of perspective.
Interviewer,"So, are we seeing filter bubbles."
Dorsey,Or echo chambers.
Interviewer,Or are we actually getting.
Dorsey,A variety of opinions.
Interviewer,Within the conversation?
Dorsey,And implicit in all four of these.
Interviewer,Is the understanding that.
Dorsey,"As they increase, the conversation."
Interviewer,Gets healthier and healthier.
Dorsey,So our first step is to see.
Interviewer,If we can measure these online.
Dorsey,Which we believe we can.
Interviewer,We have the most momentum.
Dorsey,Around receptivity.
Interviewer,We have a toxicity score.
Dorsey,"A toxicity model, on our system."
Interviewer,That can actually measure.
Dorsey,Whether you are likely to walk away.
Interviewer,From a conversation.
Dorsey,That you're having on twitter.
Interviewer,Because you feel it's toxic.
Dorsey,With some pretty high degree.
Interviewer,We're working to measure the rest.
Dorsey,And the next step is.
Interviewer,As we build up solutions.
Dorsey,To watch how these measurements.
Interviewer,Trend over time.
Dorsey,And continue to experiment.
Interviewer,And our goal is to make sure.
Dorsey,That these are balanced.
Interviewer,Because if you increase one.
Dorsey,You might decrease another.
Interviewer,If you increase variety of perspective.
Dorsey,You might actually decrease.
Interviewer,Shared reality.
Dorsey,Just picking up on some.
Interviewer,Of the questions flooding in here.
Dorsey,Constant questioning.
Interviewer,A lot of people are puzzled why.
Dorsey,"Like, how hard is it to get rid."
Interviewer,Of nazis from twitter?
Dorsey,(laughs).
Interviewer,So we have policies.
Dorsey,Around violent extremist groups.
Interviewer,And the majority of our work.
Dorsey,And our terms of service.
Interviewer,"Works on conduct, not content."
Dorsey,So we're actually looking for conduct.
Interviewer,Conduct being using the service.
Dorsey,To repeatedly or episodically.
Interviewer,Harass someone.
Dorsey,Using hateful imagery.
Interviewer,That might be associated with the kkk.
Dorsey,Or the american nazi party.
Interviewer,Those are all things.
Dorsey,That we act on immediately.
Interviewer,We're in a situation right now.
Dorsey,Where that term is used fairly loosely.
Interviewer,And we just cannot take.
Dorsey,Any one mention of that word.
Interviewer,Accusing someone else.
Dorsey,As a factual indication that they.
Interviewer,Should be removed from the platform.
Dorsey,So a lot of our models.
Interviewer,"Are based around, number one:."
Dorsey,Is this account associated.
Interviewer,With a violent extremist group?
Dorsey,"And if so, we can take action."
Interviewer,And we have done so on the kkk.
Dorsey,And the american nazi party and others.
Interviewer,And number tare they using.
Dorsey,Imagery or conduct.
Interviewer,That would associate them as such as well?
Dorsey,How many people do you have.
Interviewer,Working on content moderation.
Dorsey,To look at this?
Interviewer,It varies.
Dorsey,We want to be flexible on this.
Interviewer,Because we want to make sure.
Dorsey,"That we're, number one."
Interviewer,Building algorithms instead of just.
Dorsey,Hiring massive amounts of people.
Interviewer,Because we need to make sure.
Dorsey,That this is scalable.
Interviewer,And there are no amount of people.
Dorsey,That can actually scale this.
Interviewer,So this is why we've done so much work.
Dorsey,Around proactive detection of abuse.
Interviewer,That humans can then review.
Dorsey,We want to have a situation.
Interviewer,Where algorithms are constantly.
Dorsey,Scouring every single tweet.
Interviewer,And bringing the most.
Dorsey,Interesting ones to the top.
Interviewer,So that humans can bring their judgment.
Dorsey,To whether we should take action or not.
Interviewer,Based on our terms of service.
Dorsey,Wbut there's not an amount.
Interviewer,Of people that are scalable.
Dorsey,But how many people do you currently have.
Interviewer,Monitoring these accounts.
Dorsey,And how do you figure out what's enough?
Interviewer,They're completely flexible.
Dorsey,Sometimes we associate folks with spam.
Interviewer,Sometimes we associate folks.
Dorsey,With abuse and harassment.
Interviewer,We're going to make sure that.
Dorsey,We have flexibility in our people.
Interviewer,So that we can direct them.
Dorsey,At what is most needed.
Interviewer,"Sometimes, the elections."
Dorsey,We've had a string of elections.
Interviewer,"In mexico, one coming up in india."
Dorsey,"Obviously, the election last year."
Interviewer,The midterm election.
Dorsey,So we just want to be flexible.
Interviewer,With our resources.
Dorsey,So when people.
Interviewer,"Just as an example, if you go."
Dorsey,To our current terms of service.
Interviewer,And you bring the page up.
Dorsey,And you're wondering about abuse.
Interviewer,And harassment that you just received.
Dorsey,And whether it was against.
Interviewer,Our terms of service to report it.
Dorsey,The first thing you see.
Interviewer,When you open that page.
Dorsey,Is around intellectual.
Interviewer,Property protection.
Dorsey,You scroll down and you get to.
Interviewer,"Abuse, harassment."
Dorsey,And everything else.
Interviewer,That you might be experiencing.
Dorsey,So i don't know how that happened.
Interviewer,Over the company's history.
Dorsey,But we put that above.
Interviewer,The thing that people want.
Dorsey,The most information on.
Interviewer,And to actually act on.
Dorsey,And just our ordering shows the world.
Interviewer,What we believed was important.
Dorsey,So we're changing all that.
Interviewer,We're ordering it the right way.
Dorsey,But we're also simplifying the rules.
Interviewer,So that they're human-readable.
Dorsey,So that people can actually.
Interviewer,Understand themselves.
Dorsey,When something is against our terms.
Interviewer,And when something is not.
Dorsey,And then we're making.
Interviewer,"Again, our big focus is on removing."
Dorsey,The burden of work from the victims.
Interviewer,So that means push more.
Dorsey,Towards technology.
Interviewer,Rather than humans doing the work.
Dorsey,That means the humans receiving the abuse.
Interviewer,And also the humans.
Dorsey,Having to review that work.
Interviewer,So we want to make sure.
Dorsey,That we're not just encouraging more work.
Interviewer,Around something.
Dorsey,"That's super, super negative."
Interviewer,And we want to have a good balance.
Dorsey,Between the technology.
Interviewer,And where humans can actually be creative.
Dorsey,Which is the judgment of the rules.
Interviewer,And not just all the mechanical stuff.
Dorsey,Of finding and reporting them.
Interviewer,So that's how we think about it.
Dorsey,I'm curious to dig in more.
Interviewer,About what you said.
Dorsey,"I mean, i love that you said."
Interviewer,You are looking for ways.
Dorsey,To re-tweak the fundamental.
Interviewer,Design of the system.
Dorsey,To discourage some of the reactive.
Interviewer,"Behavior, and perhaps."
Dorsey,To use tristan harris-type language.
Interviewer,Engage people's more reflective thinking.
Dorsey,How far advanced is that?
Interviewer,What would alternatives.
Dorsey,To that like button be?
Interviewer,"Well, first and foremost."
Dorsey,My personal goal with the service.
Interviewer,Is that i believe fundamentally.
Dorsey,That public conversation is critical.
Interviewer,There are existential problems.
Dorsey,Facing the world.
Interviewer,That are facing the entire world.
Dorsey,Not any one particular nation-state.
Interviewer,That global public conversation benefits.
Dorsey,And that is one of the unique.
Interviewer,Dynamics of twitter.
Dorsey,That it is completely open.
Interviewer,It is completely public.
Dorsey,It is completely fluid.
Interviewer,And anyone can see any other conversation.
Dorsey,And participate in it.
Interviewer,So there are conversations.
Dorsey,Like climate change.
Interviewer,There are conversations.
Dorsey,Like the displacement in the work.
Interviewer,Through artificial intelligence.
Dorsey,There are conversations.
Interviewer,Like economic disparity.
Dorsey,No matter what any one nation-state does.
Interviewer,They will not be able.
Dorsey,To solve the problem alone.
Interviewer,It takes coordination around the world.
Dorsey,And that's where i think.
Interviewer,Twitter can play a part.
Dorsey,The second thing is that twitter.
Interviewer,"Right now, when you go to it."
Dorsey,You don't necessarily walk away.
Interviewer,Feeling like you learned something.
Dorsey,Some people do.
Interviewer,Some people have.
Dorsey,"A very, very rich network."
Interviewer,A very rich community.
Dorsey,That they learn from every single day.
Interviewer,But it takes a lot of work.
Dorsey,And a lot of time to build up to that.
Interviewer,So we want to get people.
Dorsey,To those topics and those interests.
Interviewer,"Much, much faster."
Dorsey,And make sure that.
Interviewer,They're finding something that.
Dorsey,No matter how much time.
Interviewer,They spend on twitter.
Dorsey,And i don't want to maximize.
Interviewer,The time on twitter.
Dorsey,I want to maximize.
Interviewer,What they actually take away from it.
Dorsey,"And what they learn from it, and."
Interviewer,"Well, do you, though?"
Dorsey,Because that's the core question.
Interviewer,That a lot of people want to know.
Dorsey,"Surely, jack, you're constrained."
Interviewer,To a huge extent.
Dorsey,By the fact that you're a public company.
Interviewer,You've got investors pressing on you.
Dorsey,The number one way you make your money.
Interviewer,Is from advertising.
Dorsey,That depends on user engagement.
Interviewer,Are you willing to sacrifice.
Dorsey,"User time, if need be."
Interviewer,To go for a more reflective conversation?
Dorsey,Yeah; more relevance means.
Interviewer,Less time on the service.
Dorsey,And that's perfectly fine.
Interviewer,Because we want to make sure.
Dorsey,"That, like, you're coming to twitter."
Interviewer,And you see something immediately.
Dorsey,That you learn from and that you push.
Interviewer,We can still serve an ad against that.
Dorsey,That doesn't mean you need to spend.
Interviewer,Any more time to see more.
Dorsey,The second thing we're looking at.
Interviewer,But just on that goal.
Dorsey,Daily active usage.
Interviewer,If you're measuring that.
Dorsey,That doesn't necessarily mean things.
Interviewer,That people value every day.
Dorsey,It may well mean.
Interviewer,Things that people are drawn to.
Dorsey,"Like a moth to the flame, every day."
Interviewer,"We are addicted, because we see."
Dorsey,Something that pisses us off.
Interviewer,So we go in and add fuel to the fire.
Dorsey,And the daily active usage goes up.
Interviewer,And there's more ad revenue there.
Dorsey,But we all get angrier with each other.
Interviewer,How do you define ...
Dorsey,Daily active usage seems like a really.
Interviewer,Dangerous term to be optimizing.
Dorsey,(applause).
Interviewer,"Taken alone, it is."
Dorsey,But you didn't let me.
Interviewer,Finish the other metric.
Dorsey,"Which is, we're watching for conversations."
Interviewer,And conversation chains.
Dorsey,So we want to incentivize.
Interviewer,Healthy contribution back to the network.
Dorsey,And what we believe that is.
Interviewer,Is actually participating in conversation.
Dorsey,That is healthy.
Interviewer,As defined by those four indicators.
Dorsey,I articulated earlier.
Interviewer,So you can't just optimize.
Dorsey,Around one metric.
Interviewer,You have to balance and look constantly.
Dorsey,At what is actually going to create.
Interviewer,A healthy contribution to the network.
Dorsey,And a healthy experience for people.
Interviewer,"Ultimately, we want to get to a metric."
Dorsey,Where people can tell us.
Interviewer,"Hey, i learned something from twitter."
Dorsey,And i'm walking away.
Interviewer,With something valuable.
Dorsey,That is our goal ultimately over time.
Interviewer,But that's going to take some time.
Dorsey,You come over to many.
Interviewer,"I think to me, as this enigma."
Dorsey,This is possibly unfair.
Interviewer,But i woke up the other night.
Dorsey,With this picture of how i found i was.
Interviewer,Thinking about you and the situation.
Dorsey,That we're on this great voyage with you.
Interviewer,On this ship called the twittanic.
Dorsey,(laughter).
Interviewer,And there are people on board in steerage.
Dorsey,Who are expressing discomfort.
Interviewer,"And you, unlike many other captains."
Dorsey,"Are saying, well, tell me, talk to me."
Interviewer,"Listen to me, i want to hear."
Dorsey,"And they talk to you, and they say."
Interviewer,We're worried about the iceberg ahead.
Dorsey,"And you go, you know."
Interviewer,That is a powerful point.
Dorsey,"And our ship, frankly."
Interviewer,Hasn't been built properly.
Dorsey,For steering as well as it might.
Interviewer,"And we say, please do something."
Dorsey,And you go to the bridge.
Interviewer,And we're waiting.
Dorsey,"And we look, and then you're showing."
Interviewer,This extraordinary calm.
Dorsey,But we're all standing outside.
Interviewer,"Saying, jack, turn the fucking wheel!"
Dorsey,You know?
Interviewer,(laughter).
Dorsey,(applause).
Interviewer,I mean.
Dorsey,(applause).
Interviewer,It's democracy at stake.
Dorsey,It's our culture at stake.
Interviewer,It's our world at stake.
Dorsey,And twitter is amazing and shapes so much.
Interviewer,It's not as big as some.
Dorsey,Of the other platforms.
Interviewer,But the people of influence use it.
Dorsey,To set the agenda.
Interviewer,And it's just hard to imagine a more.
Dorsey,Important role in the world than to ...
Interviewer,"I mean, you're doing a brilliant job."
Dorsey,"Of listening, jack, and hearing people."
Interviewer,But to actually dial up the urgency.
Dorsey,And move on this stuff.
Interviewer,Will you do that?
Dorsey,"Yes, and we have been."
Interviewer,Moving substantially.
Dorsey,"I mean, there's been."
Interviewer,A few dynamics in twitter's history.
Dorsey,"One, when i came back to the company."
Interviewer,We were in a pretty dire state.
Dorsey,In terms of our future.
Interviewer,And not just from how people.
Dorsey,Were using the platform.
Interviewer,But from a corporate narrative as well.
Dorsey,So we had to fix.
Interviewer,A bunch of the foundation.
Dorsey,Turn the company around.
Interviewer,Go through two crazy layoffs.
Dorsey,Because we just got too big.
Interviewer,For what we were doing.
Dorsey,And we focused all of our energy.
Interviewer,On this concept of serving.
Dorsey,The public conversation.
Interviewer,And that took some work.
Dorsey,And as we dived into that.
Interviewer,We realized some of the issues.
Dorsey,With the fundamentals.
Interviewer,We could do a bunch of superficial things.
Dorsey,To address what you're talking about.
Interviewer,But we need the changes to last.
Dorsey,"And that means going really, really deep."
Interviewer,And paying attention.
Dorsey,To what we started 13 years ago.
Interviewer,And really questioning.
Dorsey,How the system works.
Interviewer,And how the framework works.
Dorsey,And what is needed for the world today.
Interviewer,Given how quickly everything is moving.
Dorsey,And how people are using it.
Interviewer,So we are working as quickly as we can.
Dorsey,But quickness will not get the job done.
Interviewer,"It's focus, it's prioritization."
Dorsey,It's understanding.
Interviewer,The fundamentals of the network.
Dorsey,And building a framework that scales.
Interviewer,And that is resilient to change.
Dorsey,And being open about where we are.
Interviewer,And being transparent about where are.
Dorsey,So that we can continue to earn trust.
Interviewer,So i'm proud of all the frameworks.
Dorsey,That we've put in place.
Interviewer,I'm proud of our direction.
Dorsey,We obviously can move faster.
Interviewer,But that required just stopping a bunch.
Dorsey,Of stupid stuff we were doing in the past.
Interviewer,All right.
Dorsey,"Well, i suspect there are many people here."
Interviewer,"Who, if given the chance."
Dorsey,Would love to help you.
Interviewer,On this change-making agenda you're on.
Dorsey,And i don't know if whitney.
Interviewer,"Jack, thank you for coming here."
Dorsey,And speaking so openly.
Interviewer,It took courage.
Dorsey,I really appreciate what you said.
Interviewer,And good luck with your mission.
Dorsey,Thank you so much.
Interviewer,Thanks for having me.
Dorsey,Thank you.
Interviewer,I get my sense of spirituality through connection and what twitter represents is spiritual to me tapping into the.
Dorsey,Consciousness the larger organism whether it be the plan at the universe the social consciousness is what drives.
Interviewer,Me there's a lot of power to seeing you know how people think in ways that make us feel great and also things that are.
Dorsey,Super uncomfortable because we need to be able to ignore in person or have a conversation about it and there is no.
Interviewer,Other path towards evolution and making something better unless we can talk about it that's jack dorsey and this is.
Dorsey,The retro podcast the rich roll podcast hey everybody how you guys doing what's happening my name.
Interviewer,Is rich roll i am your host this is my podcast and today my guest is jack dorsey jack is the co-founder and ceo of.
Dorsey,Both twitter and square and somebody who i think it's fair to say quite incontrovertibly has become one of the.
Interviewer,Most influential figures of the modern age somebody who has made this crazy indelible impact on the cultural.
Dorsey,Landscape by really helping shape the way that we communicate as a culture jack has been doing the podcast rounds.
Interviewer,Lately he's had recent appearances on a wide variety of shows including sam harris two appearances on joe rogan ben.
Dorsey,Greenfield the other day and several more and i listened to all of them and i realized that jack is a polarizing.
Interviewer,Figure for many but on a personal level i have to say i found him to be quite transparent somebody who has been open.
Dorsey,About twitter's failures the challenges that he and his organization have faced continue to face as well as incredibly.
Interviewer,Composed under the pressure of being held accountable for his platforms shortcomings and my sense is that his.
Dorsey,Response to many of the hard questions that are being posed to him that have been being posed to him on all of these.
Interviewer,Podcasts and interviews have left a lot of critics feeling unsatisfied and i guess what i want to say is that if you.
Dorsey,Are such a person one of these people then i'm not sure this podcast is gonna change that view because my interest was.
Interviewer,Less on retreading the territory that was explored at length on rogen nor was it an attempt to hold him to account in.
Dorsey,The way that tim poole did on joe show instead or rather my intention for this conversation was simply to better.
Interviewer,Understand this human behind the curtain in other words what does it actually feel like to be.
Dorsey,At the helm of one of the largest and most powerful social media platforms on the planet what is a day in the life of.
Interviewer,Jack dorsey looked like and what daily self-care practises does he employed a mitigate the stress of his.
Dorsey,Responsibilities and just how did this young man blaze such an incredible extraordinary entrepreneurial path it's.
Interviewer,These kind of questions that inform how i approached this conversation i first met jack about two years ago and because.
Dorsey,He had tweeted out a few episodes of the podcast i knew he was at least an occasional listener of this show so when.
Interviewer,I found myself in san francisco i deemed him to see if he wanted to meet up and he invited me to square the square.
Dorsey,Headquarters and what i discovered when i met him was a person quite different than what you might imagine he was.
Interviewer,Sitting on an open staircase by himself with a cup of tea at the far end of this giant open floor plan office space he.
Dorsey,Told me he doesn't even have a proper office and i just found this person to be very soft-spoken kind curious and i.
Interviewer,Guess i realized that that this is somebody who is an animal altogether different from the typical alpha startup.
Dorsey,Ceo mold and i liked him instantly and although our encounter was brief jack left me kind of intrigued i wanted to.
Interviewer,Better understand who he is and what led him to this rarefied air and really what makes him tick so when he began showing.
Dorsey,Up on all these podcasts i reached out to him he invited me to his home in san francisco and and this is where it got.
Interviewer,Really interesting unsurprisingly he has a beautiful home it's very well appointed but what was surprising was.
Dorsey,Its modesty considering his essentially unlimited resources it's very minimal almost spartan there's no entourage it's.
Interviewer,No private chef he cooks his own meals no you know there's no lamborghini collection there wasn't even an.
Dorsey,Assistant there was just jack completely unpretentious barefoot excited to show me his inn.
Interviewer,At sauna is cold plunge the kitchen counter where he works from a tunnel a couple days a week you know all in all a.
Dorsey,Man who is very intentionally and mindfully stripped excess materialism and distraction away from his life.
Interviewer,Somebody who prioritizes solitude contemplation meditation he meditates at least an hour a day and a whole wide.
Dorsey,Variety of self-care practices all designed to optimize deep thinking and equanimity including the fact that he.
Interviewer,Walks five miles to work every single day and i guess what i'm trying to say is i found his intentionality that he.
Dorsey,Brings to his life is discipline his curiosity his presence of mine i found it all admirable he's a truly truly.
Interviewer,Fascinating guy living a very unusual life so this conversation is really an exploration of that life we do cover how.
Dorsey,Twitter was conceived the responsibilities of logistics the challenges involved in shaping and.
Interviewer,Policing the behemoth platform that sees about 500 million tweets every day and how he envisions the evolution of this.
Dorsey,Platform the impact of twitter on culture and how he would ultimately kind of close a conversation with how he.
Interviewer,Would disrupt and innovate the podcast space and his answer is very interesting on that point but mostly this was just.
Dorsey,My attempt to understand jack and some of the habits practices and strategies that he employs including the opposite.
Interviewer,Of meditation intermittent fasting so many more things to navigate his most uncommon life as one of the most.
Dorsey,Influential figures of our time final note because it took place at jack's home we did not video this program and.
Interviewer,You might hear a little crackling in the background it's because we were sitting at the forefront like next to his.
Dorsey,Fireplace so we had a live fire as we discussed it it was all very nice so this is me and jack dorsey.
Interviewer,Thank you for inviting me to your home thanks for taking time on a saturday saturday afternoon it's raining outside.
Dorsey,We're sitting by a crackling fire in a code who we are in the cloud i feel like i'm in big sur overlooking the ocean.
Interviewer,Here so if you hear waves crashing or seagulls or the crackling of the fire over here that kind of just should.
Dorsey,Create a visual palette so where we are right now and we just did a little meditation five-minute meditation to set.
Interviewer,The stage which was great i feel good feel good me too so i think that's a natural segue into talking a.
Dorsey,Little bit about meditation in your life i know you've been meditating for like twenty years and it's something that is.
Interviewer,Important to you so what is what is the practice look like for you yeah i um i started playing with meditation about 20.
Dorsey,Years ago it wasn't that serious and i think the the the most i you know i actually practiced within that time.
Interviewer,Frame was you know probably 20-30 minutes and wasn't really aware of a lot of the theories and some of the the.
Dorsey,Focus that i needed until about two years ago when i went to my first event possum of course i went to this little.
Interviewer,Town just south of dallas and did a ten day silent meditation retreat and it was one of the hardest but also one of the.
Dorsey,Most rewarding things i've ever done and one of the practices of impasto is to do one of these retreats every year but.
Interviewer,Also to carry through with your practice you do two hours a day one hour in the morning one hour in the evening before.
Dorsey,Before bed and the i mean what it's what it's done for me is is really just a sense of clarity certainly certainly.
Interviewer,Want to focus certainly one of recognizing when i'm reacting to some which has this you know momentum of not.
Dorsey,Feeling necessarily in control but as i did it you know at the end of last year i just went even deeper into that.
Interviewer,Clarity and was you know instantly reminded of the year prior and you you i had this experience where i just felt.
Dorsey,Like i was picking up where i where he left off and that was really powerful to me so for me every single day it's a.
Interviewer,Time to build self-awareness and that's what it comes down to yeah it's something i've been interested in doing.
Dorsey,For some time yet i have yet to go - yeah attending one of those retreats they're scary yeah well i know it i have.
Interviewer,Plenty of friends who have done it and from what i understand it's it's around that day five day six area that you get.
Dorsey,Into you know that make-or-break period where you start to freak out dave for is really hard because you go into this.
Interviewer,Mode called strong determination and up until day four you're basically focusing on your breath and it's not just the.
Dorsey,Concept of the breath it's actually the physical sensation of the breath it's a physical sensation of the breath on your.
Interviewer,Upper lip and through your nostrils and that was a huge unlock for me but on day four you go into the impasto training.
Dorsey,And strong determination which means that you are encouraged not to move at all.
Interviewer,You you you know you're sitting in a lotus or a half lotus position and you shouldn't be shifting around or moving.
Dorsey,Your posture and then your way whatsoever and that becomes extremely challenging but also a good reflection.
Interviewer,Into what the practice actually is because you'll at least for me my experience was you know my legs were.
Dorsey,Just killing me i the the urge to move is is almost unbearable and through that through observing that pain and choosing.
Interviewer,Deciding not to react to it you apply that concept in that methodology to everything to emotions to physical pain.
Dorsey,To mental hardships and and being able to recognize it i'm on it and train it you know for those next few days is uh.
Interviewer,Is is really powerful but day six was my worst day the morning i was a you know i looked i you meditate with other people.
Dorsey,But you know you're not allowed to talk you're not allowed to read to write to do any physical exercise to look anyone.
Interviewer,In the eye it's the conditions are such that you feel like you're on a retreat by.
Dorsey,Yourself and on day six i cannot kind of looked around in the hall and everyone just looked like a buddha base they all.
Interviewer,They all look like they were they were already enlightened it i got it i heard out i don't get this i like i i'm not.
Dorsey,I'm not getting it but at the end of day six you do these discourses at the end where there's some insight into the.
Interviewer,Theory and and a little bit into the practice and something the teacher said just unlock something for me so the last.
Dorsey,Meditation of the day at 9:00 p.m. or 8:30 was um was one of my best and i walked out and i just felt so much peace.
Interviewer,And so much joy and i cried and then i fell asleep and i walked back up at four in the morning and was back into the.
Dorsey,Pain back into not understanding what i was doing which again is part of the practice where you you you can't hang on.
Interviewer,Something you can't react overly to something that's negative and you can't react overly to something that's.
Dorsey,Positive either you want have a calamity between in in in in the entire spectrum right and something about becoming an.
Interviewer,Observer of that pain or that discomfort or that jubilation creating some distance between yourself and that.
Dorsey,Experience i think is where the teachable moment where you can kind of mind that equanimity absolutely right.
Interviewer,Yeah absolutely and you know it's just ten days of working from 4:00 in the morning until 9:30 mm-hmm focused.
Dorsey,Entirely on that in real you you won't get it right away and it's just this that the most important thing.
Interviewer,Is is the is the practice of it not reaching any particular milestone or state it's just that constant practice.
Dorsey,So you stepped it up this year and you went to myanmar you know to do as opposed to texas for another silent.
Interviewer,Meditation retreat and on your return from that experience you decided to share this and in a threaded tweet what.
Dorsey,Your experience was and that like became like a thing there were a lot of people that jumped on you for not addressing.
Interviewer,The atrocities of the government when you know i it was interesting because i read it and i i felt like you were just.
Dorsey,Sharing this experience that you had it was it was certainly in a political you know motivation behind that but i guess.
Interviewer,When you're jack you have to be much more mindful about yeah you choose your words and and how you decide to describe.
Dorsey,These experiences yeah i am so after my first meditation in texas first i met you know this amazing teacher there and.
Interviewer,That goenka know not going to go inca passed away i ever maybe maybe even ten years ago and so he has all these.
Dorsey,Assistant teachers that lead you through the the courses and i met one of the assistant teachers and became friends.
Interviewer,With him and you know i was talking about going you know doing where should i do my next meditation and we discussed.
Dorsey,Myanmar burma because that is where kalinka is from that is where a lot of the practice that i was practicing has.
Interviewer,Been kept in a very pure form in terms of the the writings but also the the physical practice and after my first.
Dorsey,Meditation in texas i had one tweet and i just i didn't feel i was ready to to talk about it i didn't feel it was.
Interviewer,Appropriate because i don't i didn't feel i had experienced enough to the depth that i i could communicate in a.
Dorsey,Way that resonated with people mm-hmm but after this after the second retreat in myanmar i felt i felt more.
Interviewer,Ready it was um it was completely different i mean it was i went in a day before into into myanmar i immediately.
Dorsey,Went to the center and we started meditating and i i left two days after and i i was there as jack not.
Interviewer,Representing square or twitter i was there to focus on myself because i think one of the most important things i.
Dorsey,Believe that i have a responsibility to both our employees and also the people that we we serve on on the on the.
Interviewer,Platforms is self-improvement constant self-improvement i've identified this as at least this practice is something that.
Dorsey,Makes me a lot stronger a lot more resilient a lot more aware and able to approach my work with a lot more clarity.
Interviewer,And discipline so i went because of the you know the the practice is lineage within within that within that country.
Dorsey,And within that people and within the culture and wasn't really thinking enough about the surrounding.
Interviewer,Circumstances of the country and the people and you know i think the the misstep was not even addressing that.
Dorsey,Focusing entirely on meditation that was my intent which was to focus this entirely on my my experience and if it.
Interviewer,Resonates with people it does if it doesn't it doesn't and you know i think it it did resonate with folks but there.
Dorsey,Was there was an ask to just be more aware of the surroundings shine more light on that and and i i get all that.
Interviewer,That the benefit is i did have a lot of social groups reach out to me immediately after and folks come to me.
Dorsey,To at least converse about you know what is happening and what has changed and there.
Interviewer,Are multiple atrocities within the country not not just the one that it's tend to be focused on yeah yeah so i've.
Dorsey,Learned since you know a bunch of the dynamics and and and you know some other ways i might be able to help but i'm.
Interviewer,Still i'm still and uh i'm still in the learning phase where you know just where can i actually apply myself and and and.
Dorsey,Help and and drive more the conversation within the within the country so it touched me and it it's something that i.
Interviewer,Will definitely be top of mind for for quite some time but i think it was but it was important for next time yeah it.
Dorsey,Was important for me to also see that in person and experience in person rather than read it through text sarita through.
Interviewer,The the major media channels and see the people and one of the biggest surprises i had was every single monk i saw every.
Dorsey,Every nun i ran into had a had a cell phone and facebook is the internet it's similar to you know when back in.
Interviewer,The day when aol was the internet for many people it wasn't about a web browser it was you know the way in was.
Dorsey,Was aol and and facebook was that for for nearly everyone in the in the country you didn't you don't see urls.
Interviewer,You don't see website addresses you see facebook pages and it's just so dominant and i didn't have that understanding and.
Dorsey,I don't think i would have the depth of understanding unless i actually went there and experienced it myself.
Interviewer,And what do you extract from that the fact that you know facebook is the internet they're like what you know what.
Dorsey,Is that vote for the future what does that mean having um having grown up with the internet in st. louis missouri i was.
Interviewer,A hacker early on and in my life you know 12 13 14 and save us had this thriving.
Dorsey,Hacker community and it was a you know it had a lot of the punk ethos had a lot of the technology through later had a.
Interviewer,Bunch of the hip-hop ethos in terms of just questioning everything working in public sharing everything sharing all.
Dorsey,The mistakes not being centralized at all i think there's elements that are that.
Interviewer,Are certainly dangerous to that i am definitely skeptical of centralized organizations even my own even twitter.
Dorsey,And square you know i think the internet more than anything else has allowed us to remove so many barriers and.
Interviewer,Boundaries that can tend to be artificial and and and this promise of at least providing the framework and the.
Dorsey,Infrastructure towards a understanding of a of one humanity like we have the technology to.
Interviewer,Do this and it started in 1979 and the ideals just get stronger and stronger and stronger so starting with a more.
Dorsey,Decentralized medium and and you know the recent flow towards more centralization such as google and.
Interviewer,Youtube and facebook and twitter and square is something i'm very very cognizant of and also i i don't discount.
Dorsey,The the power and and also the skepticism and lack of trust that people have in organizations like ours so i.
Interviewer,Think on the positive it does breed a healthy skepticism and distrust which i think is useful to push companies like.
Dorsey,Ours to be a lot more open and pushed towards more towards more internet ideals but there's certainly a hard road.
Interviewer,To get there but i i would want to see a place like mia mar to have more entry points.
Dorsey,Than just facebook obviously right at the same time they've gotten a lot of people on who were not on before and and.
Interviewer,On the network and i think we have to weigh the trade-offs of you know that getting people on the on-ramp into this.
Dorsey,Global network and and the custodian that does it and then hopefully hold organizations like my own to account in.
Interviewer,Terms of making sure that they see all the pathways in and out and and have optionality right.
Dorsey,I feel like this you know desire to hold yourself and and your companies to to account for this is sort of part and.
Interviewer,Parcel of this you know for lack of a better phrase like podcast or that you've been on lately.
Dorsey,You know out of the blue all of a sudden you've made yourself available to talk to all manner of people you've been on.
Interviewer,Tons of shows no no no i don't know a lot i mean you did one yesterday crypto one yesterday i know you've done sam.
Dorsey,Harris joe rogan i think you're going back to talk to joe you did bill simmons clearly there's a conscious decision.
Interviewer,Here too to step out and share your perspective in a transparent way and my sense of this is that you've done that.
Dorsey,With a large degree of equanimity i think the equanimity was seen in that exchange with kara swisher where you did.
Interviewer,That experiment and conversation by doing it on twitter you maintained your cool under fire like i in that i saw.
Dorsey,Meditation coming to the front in the way that you managed all of that but just the fact that you're making.
Interviewer,Yourself available for these conversations i find interesting and so i think the first i have two questions.
Dorsey,On that the first is you know what is you know what was behind this decision to do this and and you know right now.
Interviewer,Yeah i i mean i have a i've had a few goals with us one i'm a student of conversation and twitter's purpose in.
Dorsey,The world is to serve the public conversation and in the light i am aware that i'm absolutely.
Interviewer,Terrible at at it and i am vibrator that why do you say that well i you know i was um when i was a kid i had a speech.
Dorsey,Impediment and i went through a lot of speech therapy i couldn't pronounce most words i just sound like gibberish was.
Interviewer,Coming out of my mouth and to some people that still may be the case but i i really hold back because of that.
Dorsey,Awareness that i was dysfunctional in some way in communicating with people and i became extremely shy i've always.
Interviewer,Been an introvert meaning that i get most of my energy from solitude versus actually works getting a lot of their.
Dorsey,Energy from being around people so i die naturally at that predisposition towards being more quiet and being more in.
Interviewer,Solitude but that really pushed me into a very very shy place where you know even conversations my parents and.
Dorsey,Brothers were were somewhat limited and eventually i realized it in fifth or sixth grade and i just said like i can't.
Interviewer,Function like this and they joined the speech club and i joined the debate club and i did the things i just freak to.
Dorsey,Freak me out but that's still that's still lingers you know i still am hyper aware of how i'm talking and you know.
Interviewer,Just a little bit of uncomfort in my own skin and conversation but i wanna i think i think my the characteristics.
Dorsey,That have made me realize some of the milestones i want in my life and some of the excess success i've realized is that.
Interviewer,I will put myself in very uncomfortable situations i will be patient with myself and i will learn super fast so i i felt.
Dorsey,Number one that podcasting was a great way to do that it's something i'm a huge consumer of i you know my walks in the.
Interviewer,Morning it's what i listen to it's it's when i take the most joy in and in the morning and i.
Dorsey,Just get so much so much out of them that i also wanted to understand the format much more directly and then.
Interviewer,Second we we don't talk enough out in the open about what we're seeing how we're thinking why and we do that in you.
Dorsey,Know articles and and the traditional press but there's something about podcasting to me that just allows much.
Interviewer,Much more nuance and just some time to breathe and and i think the thing i enjoy certainly compared to twitter.
Dorsey,We'll talk about the irony that that that you're gun-shy about conversation when you know facilitating conversation.
Interviewer,Is the core you know foundational goal of twitter itself i yeah i don't know if it's the gun shy that i feel i just i.
Dorsey,Know that um i know i want to master it and i i wanna i want to get really great at it and i know i have a long way to go.
Interviewer,Not just in conversations like this but also personally as well if i could study one thing that also serves my company.
Dorsey,Given our role than amazing so i you know i i think the the thing i love most about podcasts going back to.
Interviewer,My introvert misses conversations like this where you can actually hear the silence between thoughts and like just.
Dorsey,The the amount of time that people take to think and there's just so much fatality within that silence that i find.
Interviewer,Intriguing and interesting and there's just a rhythm that i'm trying to understand and and in a master as well.
Dorsey,So so that's a big part of it a lot of it this year has has you know honestly been you know somewhat reactive people.
Interviewer,We've we've we don't have a strategist in terms of like who we've been talking to who i've been talking to.
Dorsey,A lot of folks have been asking me for quite some time and i pushed it off and just been kind of going down the queue.
Interviewer,And and and i'm also you know happy to meet a bunch of the folks that i listen to all the time like i'm i'm going to be.
Dorsey,Going on ben green fields pretty soon and i listen to every single one of its podcasts and and i think i learned so.
Interviewer,Much from him and i so i'm excited personally just to just get into it with him i have no idea what we'll talk about.
Dorsey,Because he is so health health focused it's gonna be so i would imagine be really granular on like your date you.
Interviewer,Know daily practices yeah which i'm also excited to talk about because i don't i don't get to talk about that a lot with.
Dorsey,The exception of my friends and some of my co-workers who just think i'm the weirdest person in the world well we're.
Interviewer,Gonna get into it a little bit probably not to the extent that ben well but i think that that you know your.
Dorsey,Observations are correct i mean in many ways i see podcasts as an antidote to what ails twitter because it provides.
Interviewer,That space for nuance and i think anybody is hard pressed to walk away from a conscientious mature mindful.
Dorsey,Long-form podcast between two people even if you completely disagree with that person's worldview it's almost like.
Interviewer,Because we're empathetic creatures were able to see the shared humanity and i think that's something that that that.
Dorsey,Twitter just isn't built for yeah ways i want to you know i want us to figure this out cuz i i think i don't think.
Interviewer,It's just voice or video that creates empathy i'd text certainly can create the same i think we have not unlocked.
Dorsey,That from an experience standpoint from a pacing standpoint i think we've provided exactly the wrong incentives on.
Interviewer,The on the service and what i mean by that is when you open up the app what are we inherently telling you to do.
Dorsey,Implicitly you know what what are you what are we getting you through the arrangement.
Interviewer,Of the buttons through the numbers and the metrics that we provide we're giving people guidelines in terms of what they.
Dorsey,Should optimize for and i think right now they're completely wrong like you know we we made a decision quite some.
Interviewer,Time ago to make the size of your your follower count bold and big on your profile page and we have this like.
Dorsey,Button we have retweet we haven't really opined on the ordering of those of those.
Interviewer,Actions and and what what that means so when we when we built this you know we we discovered these features and these.
Dorsey,Gaps and then we put them on the interface and i don't think we gave it enough consideration because we didn't.
Interviewer,Have we didn't have this focus on this on this purpose of conversation there was some of it was reactive to our peers.
Dorsey,Some of it was looking at good ideas over there and putting it in in our service but we're taking time now to.
Interviewer,Step back and say like how do we truly serve a public conversation not just people posting not people posting quick.
Dorsey,Takes or hot takes or outrage but like how do we how do we incentivize more contribution that is healthy to the.
Interviewer,Network and and and this is a concept that we're really spending a lot of time thinking about is this concept of.
Dorsey,Conversational health and what that means and it's one of the reasons i'm i'm fascinated for my own personal.
Interviewer,Health and why i get into all the practices like meditation that i do is because i feel that there is something.
Dorsey,To being able to understand when a conversation is healthy or not and i know it because like we've all had we've.
Interviewer,All had conversations that feel toxic and you just want to walk away from it we've had conversations that feel really.
Dorsey,Empowering and inspiring and you you wish they lasted for hours and hours and hours and if if we can if we can feel.
Interviewer,That i feel we can also quantify it enough that we can understand at scale what.
Dorsey,These things look like and and what what actions have the greatest potential to create more of them and so right now.
Interviewer,We're just you know we're in this phase where we're trying to understand what it means to measure whether an online.
Dorsey,Digital conversation is healthy or not and so what are the technological parameters by which you would adjudicate.
Interviewer,The health of a conversation we're we started with probably the best way to articulate this is is the body metaphor.
Dorsey,And you know we we have all these indicators of health on our body one is you know just the flush nests of your.
Interviewer,Face the other is your body temperature and you know this internal body temperature should be a should be 98.6.
Dorsey,Fahrenheit and if it's above that or below that it indicates that something is out of balance it doesn't say what.
Interviewer,But it indicates that probably something is in out of out of imbalance and we built this tool called a thermometer to.
Dorsey,Measure that indicator and then based on that reading we can start diagnosing solutions and you know i i could read.
Interviewer,That your your temperature is really high and i can give you a glass of water hot water with lemon in it and say based.
Dorsey,On all of our experience i don't know all of our research if you drink this there's a higher probability that it.
Interviewer,Will bring your system back into balance at least this particular indicate indicator faster than this red wine that.
Dorsey,I'm about to andrew and then you have a choice do i do i take this or this red wine which.
Interviewer,Based on all of our evidence all of our research all of our experiences creates a probability that probably extends the.
Dorsey,Amount of time that your system is in balance so you can you can push that to the digital and then it's you know it's.
Interviewer,What are the indicators of conversational health so we have four stakeholder indicators that we've shared.
Dorsey,With the world that we're we're working to understand how to measure right now like we're.
Interviewer,Working to build the thermometers for these indicators number one is shared attention how much of the conversation.
Dorsey,Is attentive to the same things versus on disparate things number two is shared reality are we is.
Interviewer,This you know is this conversation sharing the same facts or are they different facts like an example as a way.
Dorsey,Of judging how siloed a certain conversation exactly like so it's not to find truth it's not to find what is.
Interviewer,Factual or what is not factual but just like what facts are people using and what percentage of the conversation is.
Dorsey,Using this fact basis versus another one so a recent example is you know the round earth versus the flat earth right.
Interviewer,Conversation so 99.999% of this conversation is using a fact that the earth is round whereas where as a small.
Dorsey,Percentage he's using a fact that the world is flat so healthier conversation will be sharing more facts mmm so that's.
Interviewer,Number two number three is receptivity so how receptive are the participants to engaging in a civil way and debate and.
Dorsey,Dialogue and finally is variety of perspective is it a high variety of perspective or is it a filter bubble or.
Interviewer,Echo chamber and these four ideally as they go higher conversation is very healthy so you want you know presence.
Dorsey,And attention you want to be sharing the same facts to have a debate around them you want both to be receptive if you.
Interviewer,Want a variety of a opinion and perspective so that we can build off each other and and and so that we can.
Dorsey,Iterate but we also realize that if you do something to increase one it might have a negative impact on another so you.
Interviewer,Know you might increase variety of perspective by bringing more perspectives into the conversation and.
Dorsey,By doing so you might decrease shared reality or you might decrease shared attention so just like the temperature.
Interviewer,Of your there are other indicators of health that have some sort of connection and.
Dorsey,While your your body temperature might go into balance other indicators like the flushing that your skin might get.
Interviewer,Aggravated more so then how do you take that information that you aggregate and build tools that facilitate conversation.
Dorsey,To move in that direction i mean that's that's the you know the hard part yeah so so so an example is you know one we.
Interviewer,Need to identify if these are the right indicators we do so by actually building the measurement tools to get it somewhat.
Dorsey,Of a baseline measurement and we're not doing this alone we're doing it with external parties as well.
Interviewer,Researchers mit cortical labs define the first four indicators and they're actually doing it not just for twitter.
Dorsey,But for talk radio podcasting as well to measure that the percentage of conversations there and as we build in.
Interviewer,Understanding baseline of the other measurement then we can start deploying solutions and we can watch how it.
Dorsey,Deviates from the baseline so an example of a solution might be we have all these people sharing links sharing articles.
Interviewer,And i might share an article from fox news or new york times and i might share that article and have my own kind of.
Dorsey,View on this like saying a tweet of this article is spot-on or this is completely off the mark and this all the reasons.
Interviewer,Why one of the things we experimented with is when we see those articles shared to bring up other tweets that.
Dorsey,Might have different perspectives as indicated by the text that they're sharing on top of the url and you know.
Interviewer,You you might you might then see for the same article for the same link to different perspectives on it and there's.
Dorsey,Some research to indicate that that emboldened people into their views there's other research to indicate that.
Interviewer,That elites gets people thinking about what their viewpoint means and and how that evolved.
Dorsey,So that that's just one experiment and the way we can run that and then we can look at how it affects some of those.
Interviewer,Metrics at scale we're super early on in this another one is a the brexit conversation you know the only tool that.
Dorsey,And this kind of gets to the core fundamentals of the service we only give you the ability to follow an account so.
Interviewer,If you were a vote lever you're probably following folks like boris and and nigel and and related accounts very very few.
Dorsey,People and they're mainly journalists follow accounts that have a completely different perspective than themselves.
Interviewer,Very few people watch cnn and then immediately flip to fox news mm-hmm just to get the other other.
Dorsey,Theater and and the other movie that's that's playing on this on that on the same reality so if you follow only those.
Interviewer,People you're probably only getting reasons to leave but if you were to do a little bit more work and you saw the.
Dorsey,Vote leave hash tag vote leave trending and you tap into that you'll see 99% on conversation reasons to leave but you.
Interviewer,Might see 1% of reasons to stay and in that key in that case at least there is some potential to see a different.
Dorsey,Perspective and sees diversity of opinion but we make that so hard for people you can't follow a hashtag today.
Interviewer,You can't even get into that conversation where there is even an element of variety of perspective so.
Dorsey,Those are the things we're looking at if we allow someone to follow a hashtag or follow a topic does that increase.
Interviewer,Variety of perspective does it increase shared reality does it increase shared attention or does it diminish those.
Dorsey,Things yeah it's that extra step that you have to do right now i mean if you go to.
Interviewer,What's trending and you click on a hashtag you're gonna see in general my experiences you'll see a smattering of.
Dorsey,Different perspectives on that issue but if you could follow an issue with an ad like at you know issue x and then your.
Interviewer,Feed would be propagated with different person actives on that issue it would break the.
Dorsey,Chains of the silo effect that's creating so much toxicity but i think it also it it means that you have an.
Interviewer,Optimistic perspective on the malleability of a human of a human psychology oh yeah i mean that because.
Dorsey,People are bringing in a lifetime of experience that has formed a certain perspective and just because you're.
Interviewer,Gonna pepper that feed with a smattering of different views doesn't mean that it's gonna change that person's.
Dorsey,Worldview totally maybe it shouldn't i don't know and i don't know if that's your responsibility but certainly there.
Interviewer,Is a you know a level of toxicity right now on on your platform that i know you're endeavoring to address but these.
Dorsey,Are very difficult problems to overcome yeah and i i don't think it's our responsibility to change their view i do.
Interviewer,Think it's our responsibility set up the circumstances where if they choose to look outside their own view or to add to.
Dorsey,Their view or challenge their own view that it's easy to do so right now it's extremely difficult and and and we saw.
Interviewer,This in 2016 2015 leading up to the election this you know this mit cortical lab put.
Dorsey,Out a put out of a infographic that showed you know a number of the journalists on the left.
Interviewer,Left end of the spectrum we're not following folks on the right whereas folks on the right were following folks.
Dorsey,On the left and you see these huge siloed concentrations of people on the left who are just feeding themselves.
Interviewer,With stories around what's going to happen whereas folks on the right and the spectrum work we're seeing.
Dorsey,Everything and these are just journalists these are journalists right and journalists by and large are gonna.
Interviewer,Be people that are more likely to follow a difference of opinion typically but in leading up to the u.s. election.
Dorsey,According to the graph they were not right they were certainly not enough and i mean to me the most dangerous thing.
Interviewer,About what we've done as a service is to incentivize more of these echo chambers and filter bubbles and not give people.
Dorsey,Tools to at least change the probability that they would see more right and and that i think you know can embolden a lot.
Interviewer,More toxicity can embolden a lot more of the bad faith actors who intend to disrupt which we saw certainly leading.
Dorsey,Up but but you know twitter will be 13 years old in march and we've we've probably seen this throughout our.
Interviewer,Lifetime and a lot of it has to do with you know we've we made a system that people have figured out how to how to.
Dorsey,Game and and we we haven't had enough punitive actions with the exception of this very binary decision of leave up or.
Interviewer,Take down and and that that very binary action is just not enough it's not nuanced enough especially if you take a.
Dorsey,Broader view on humanity and you believe in the concepts of rehabilitation or redemption or you know at least showing.
Interviewer,People you know the path towards health and greater participation in the in the same sense of like giving people the.
Dorsey,Choice of drinking the water or the wine when they're sick we we don't do that we you know we have this very very blunt.
Interviewer,Tool of leave up or or remove mm-hmm at the same time the acceleration with which you know sophisticated well.
Dorsey,Financed entities are weaponizing the platform is only going to increase and you know i think there's an analogy to.
Interviewer,Doping in sports in the sense that you know the doping the sophistication of the doping is always a step or two ahead.
Dorsey,Of the policing body's ability to detect right so the entity is always playing catch-up to what's ahead.
Interviewer,And it seems like that's a similar game that's afoot here totally in in the technology world the metaphor would be.
Dorsey,Security so right now i forget the exact quote but edgar allen poe brought this up quite some time ago where you know he.
Interviewer,He believed he was able to build a cryptographic puzzle that no one could crack and quickly learn that anything.
Dorsey,That one person can design another person can break down right and security probably at a surface level is.
Interviewer,Considered to you know your your goal might be one of perfection a cure a purely perfect system that no one can.
Dorsey,Break into but the reality of it is the mindset should be one of constant observation learning and improving you.
Interviewer,You want to taste stay ten steps ahead of your of your attackers and the way you do so is by really looking at.
Dorsey,Patterns of how they are testing the system and attacking the system and when you find them iterate a few steps ahead.
Interviewer,And then share all your findings so the whole community can get much better and you you just take out that that one.
Dorsey,Potential potential vector so so on that rubric how would you grade twitter's performance on that very human very poor.
Interviewer,Because i think for the majority of our lifetime you know we were fairly mechanical and our approach to.
Dorsey,Technology we were not utilizing machine learning and deep learning to lift some of the burden certainly from our own.
Interviewer,Folks who have to enforce all of our rules but also lifting the burden from the victims like our our system right.
Dorsey,Now it's just not fair you know our our system works entirely on if i'm a victim of abuse i report that someone just.
Interviewer,Harass me or docks me or whatnot and then we entirely dependent upon reporting yeah we do not scalable it's.
Dorsey,Impossible to monitor that not scalable but ultimately not fair why should the.
Interviewer,Victim have that burden and so we we weren't able to even consider removing that because we just weren't as.
Dorsey,Sophisticated with machine learning and deep learning as we are now so now our number one goal along this health factor.
Interviewer,Is proactive monitoring of our systems so that we can catch some of these things before someone even has to report.
Dorsey,It and there's a variety of tools that we can use to enforce whether it be asking people to remove tweets temporary.
Interviewer,Suspensions all the way to the to the worst option which is you know a permanent suspension which ultimately.
Dorsey,You know over time we we shouldn't feel great about like we we weren't able to rehabilitate we weren't able to.
Interviewer,Incentivize and show people why healthy approaches and behaviors and participation would increase their reach.
Dorsey,Or increase the value they got out of the service so so that ultimately is where we want to get to but we're right.
Interviewer,Now we're focused on number one like how do we this is another thing i don't think our industry does enough of is we.
Dorsey,Haven't really admitted the connection between the digital world and the physical world and there's a lot that.
Interviewer,Happens on twitter that i think we could scope entirely to online and we'd miss everything else that's happening offline.
Dorsey,Or wedded those offline ramifications so meaning things like daxing or we're talking digital harm really becomes yeah.
Interviewer,Helpful reality so that so the number one thing we want to protect now is someone's physical safety so it sounds a.
Dorsey,Little bit odd for a predominantly digital company to say that we should be focused on protecting.
Interviewer,Equal safety but it has real manifestations someone daxing which is sharing private information about.
Dorsey,Someone's physical location or phone number or email address puts a person in you know of some physical jeopardy.
Interviewer,Safety jeopardy and at least raises the potential so could we can can we recognize when those when those.
Dorsey,Occurrences happen in real time and and prevent it and if we can do that and that's a tightly scoped problem then we.
Interviewer,Can extend it to more and more of the cases that we see every single day especially what women on our platform.
Dorsey,Experience on a daily basis and so we want to get to a something that is really measurable that has impact on you.
Interviewer,Know someone's real-world physical life and then tie it back to what we're doing online and i just think as an industry.
Dorsey,We need to focus more on that connection between the physical and the and the online and and and and show the show the.
Interviewer,Progress we you know we we talk a lot about this but we we we really have to show it so now that we have a lot more.
Dorsey,Sophistication around machine learning and artificial intelligence we can automate a lot more of this but a big.
Interviewer,Part of us progressing in the right way is scoping it so that we can really make the problem very very small get some.
Dorsey,Sort of success or at least a path to our success there and then and then brought it out right so you've been.
Interviewer,Going on all these podcasts and talking a lot of people about these problems and and and how you're attempting to you.
Dorsey,Know wrap your brain trust around how to solve them and the early stages of actually solving them do you think that.
Interviewer,Like like what's your sense of how this campaign is going like is this working i i mean i don't know i don't know that it.
Dorsey,Is and yet let me just say this and then i'll let you talk i have this sense that you're in an impossible situation.
Interviewer,Because you're coming on or you're coming on line and you're talking about these.
Dorsey,Things and i feel like you're being very transparent and very earnest about it and very thoughtful but you're not.
Interviewer,Giving people that answers that they like the answers are just not inherently satisfying right or or the time line is.
Dorsey,Off or something and so people are left feeling like they're not getting a direct response like you've been accused.
Interviewer,Of being evasive i don't think you're being evasive but perhaps people are just wanting to.
Dorsey,See the results more quickly like how are you thinking about this or what's your sense well this is going first and.
Interviewer,Foremost we have to realize that we have to we have to show not tell and my goal here is not to my goal here is not to.
Dorsey,First of all i don't consider this a campaign you know i yeah i i think it's important that we have conversations in.
Interviewer,Public and that we we show our thinking and we i i want to i want to bring up ideas in public that people can push.
Dorsey,Against and i want to hear the feedback and i want to i want to get the reaction because it'll make our answer is much.
Interviewer,Better and while people might not be satisfied with the level that they're currently at in terms of abstraction we.
Dorsey,Have to start there to get to something tangible and real and i think a lot of people fairly come at this as.
Interviewer,Specifically why haven't you banned this one person or why haven't you take an action on on these particular things and.
Dorsey,It's the answer is it it's not one case these these are extremely extremely challenging and a lot of it has to do.
Interviewer,With the context of the conversation and just as an example there are particular racial slurs that are used in a way that.
Dorsey,Are harassing of folks and meant to silence a voice or to get a voice off the platform and in other communities.
Interviewer,And contexts they're perfectly okay an example of this is you know we have we have a bunch of gamers on on twitter.
Dorsey,And every day we have an exchange between two people saying hey rich you know i'm i'm gonna kill you tonight and.
Interviewer,In one context that's a violent threat and that is something that we would act on in another context it's a game and.
Dorsey,What that person meant was that i'm going to kill you in this game tonight so those are the sorts of nuances that.
Interviewer,We have to pay attention to in the context we have to we have to actually look at the context of the relationship.
Dorsey,Between the two people and how they're engaging so in the old days we were fairly mechanical and that we looked at.
Interviewer,The specific words and content being used now we have to shift to look at the network we have to look at the actions.
Dorsey,On the network act the behavior on the necks to contextualise that against the history of caspase.
Interviewer,Exactly and and we have a number of other occurrences where we get accused of taking content down or permanently.
Dorsey,Suspending someone because of something that they said which seems completely innocuous but what was happening in the.
Interviewer,Background was they had 17 accounts that they had control of that were all in unison in a coordinated fashion.
Dorsey,Attacking one particular account with the intent to silence or trigger this person or they we ban them in the past.
Interviewer,For a particular activity and then they are trying to evade our brand ban which is against our terms of service so.
Dorsey,There's a lot on the surface but there's even more underneath that has to do with behavior conduct and activity that is.
Interviewer,Against our term service that we take action on and where we have failed mm-hmm.
Dorsey,People is explaining the reasons why we take action yeah it's as if it takes place in a in a black box yeah and in.
Interviewer,Some cases that's because there might be private information that even either a victim or a a bad faith actor might.
Dorsey,Compromise them in some way and in some cases it might be active investigation so there's even.
Interviewer,Nuance in how transparents we can be around the actions or we take on the platform so but then the reaction to to.
Dorsey,The consumer is that it looks haphazard and it looks random it looks random and right and and and what the attention is.
Interviewer,All on these specific case studies like whether it's alex jones or jake wall or you know these specific individuals that.
Dorsey,Get a lot of press and attention for their you know behavior on your platform i'm i'm curious as to like how under.
Interviewer,What circumstances does one of these case studies like rise to your attention as somebody is running two different.
Dorsey,Companies and has a tremendous amount of responsibility for you know keeping both of these you know ships square and.
Interviewer,Twitter running in a certain direction you know i can't imagine that you can roll up your sleeves and get too.
Dorsey,Involved in specific scenarios but i would imagine from time to time it does require your your attention in your.
Interviewer,Discretion as to what to do yeah so to start with the principles of my approach and how i think about this number one is.
Dorsey,I want to build a service and a company that outlives me that doesn't require me being there - that doesn't require my.
Interviewer,Attention so by definition that means that we distribute nearly all of our decision-making and to me you know one.
Dorsey,Of the things that i look for is like if if i have to make a decision i see it as an organizational failure you know it's.
Interviewer,It's something that for whatever reason and it's likely my fault you know i i haven't set up the right organizational.
Dorsey,Structure i don't have a team dynamic that can work through debate or disagreement i i haven't presented or we.
Interviewer,Haven't presented the problem with the right context or maybe we're going after the wrong problem so it's all my fault.
Dorsey,Ultimately but if if i have to make a decision i think there is something wrong with the organization and and it's.
Interviewer,Not that's what i need to fix it's not making the decision that's fixing exactly that so.
Dorsey,My role then and my second principle is i need to ask questions in terms of how we're making this these decisions and.
Interviewer,Why we're making these decisions and raise the bar through my questions raise the bar in terms of how we're thinking.
Dorsey,About our customers the people that we serve secular trends that are happening whether they be societal or cultural or.
Interviewer,Legal or technological and then do we do we have a broader context that is cohesive across the company and also our.
Dorsey,Peer set so in cases like alex jones or jacob recently i was notified that we're taking action it wasn't brought to me.
Interviewer,With a question of like should we do this or not uh-huh i was notified that we're taking.
Dorsey,Action and often times i ask well why did we take this action what evidence do we have to take the action or in the.
Interviewer,Reverse i see i see something that's on the platform that looks like we should have taken action but weed in it and i.
Dorsey,Send that to the team and say what's going on here and again this points to our failure in terms of the dependency.
Interviewer,On reporting in that you know we only see what's reported so sometimes i see it and i ask the question and that kind.
Dorsey,Of serves as a report but there is no case at my tenure as ceo that i've made a decision on one of these cases or.
Interviewer,Reversed a decision by the team i have asked a lot of probing questions in some cases those questions lead to lead to.
Dorsey,Really looking at our process if it does i make damn sure that we admit when we make a mistake and what we've learned.
Interviewer,From it within the bounds of what we can share obviously usually around privacy or legal standards so that i think that.
Dorsey,I believe is my role and and again it's all against this prints of like if i'm not here if i die.
Interviewer,Tomorrow the company needs to be able to continue and we have to build this into a framework not into people we have to.
Dorsey,Think about systems not in these single points of failure in humans and we you know we were we just have a lot of work.
Interviewer,To do that and building into the algorithms and the machines and even when we do that even then when we move.
Dorsey,More towards a world where algorithms are doing more of our work there's some significant issues one our algorithms.
Interviewer,Right now can't explain why they make decisions they make they don't that's that's highly problematic extremely.
Dorsey,Scary especially i know you're you're wearing an orange i'm wearing my ring you know people wear apple watches and.
Interviewer,The apple watch every now and then will tell you when to stand you know if if we don't if we start offloading more and.
Dorsey,More of our decisions to these devices and we don't understand why they're making the decisions they're informing.
Interviewer,Us to take and they can't tell you why and they can't tell you why then it's really really dangerous so we need to.
Dorsey,Invest in explain ability this is a field of research in ai that it's quite fascinating we need to invest in.
Interviewer,Removing bias from machine learning models and and artificial intelligence which which we are doing but these are.
Dorsey,These are very very early things but even you know even as we move more of these enforcement actions and policies.
Interviewer,To to algorithms people need to be able to see why the actions taken are taken and if they.
Dorsey,Can't see it they won't trust it so we you know we have a few operating principles as a company one we believe.
Interviewer,You know our purpose is serve the public conversation our desire is to promote health in that public conversation too.
Dorsey,We want to earn trust and earning trust comes through a variety of methods transparency reliability consistency so.
Interviewer,That we don't appear random deliberateness when you read our rules you understand them and you can see why.
Dorsey,We acted in the particular way we acted based on the rules or why our algorithms did do the very same thing so you know.
Interviewer,We're just putting these principles in place we're just building these models we're investing in research areas like.
Dorsey,Explain ability and and and and bias in ml but you know it it is going to take some time and that's not satisfying and.
Interviewer,I think people get frustrated because we talked about it but i i want to talk about it i want to share some of these.
Dorsey,Ideas i want to share where we are in the journey alright i want to show the map and like where we've come from and.
Interviewer,Where we're trying to get to and in pointing where we're trying to get to open a dialogue so that people can.
Dorsey,Really push back on us and and say you're you're going in the wrong direction and here's why and you should.
Interviewer,Consider this other this other path that's the power of our service you can see how people are thinking about any.
Dorsey,Topic under the sun and you you get the sense of global consciousness immediately so we also have to take.
Interviewer,Advantage of that as well yeah i appreciate the transparency and and i think the openness and the willingness.
Dorsey,To entertain pushback speaks your punk rock roots a little bit i feel like from a pr publicity strategy it might have.
Interviewer,Behaved you to to be like introducing a new feature to twitter to address these things and then sort of said here's.
Dorsey,Here's the first of many things to come but we're introducing this new thing and this is because of this and it would.
Interviewer,Have given you a little bit of insulation i think against you know people that.
Dorsey,Feel like you're you're you know they're that there's a lot of talk but the challenge with that i agree with you i.
Interviewer,Mean that would feel good but the challenge with that is like there's there's not going to be any one feature.
Dorsey,That like makes one significant dent this is going to be a constant or unless you finally allow people to edit their.
Interviewer,Dream but i might not get into all of that i might have some things i might help some things but it's um if we if we.
Dorsey,Put too much weight on any one particular feature i think it's doomed to fail like a lot of this work has to.
Interviewer,Do with constantly iterating our models you know learning and real-time at scale.
Dorsey,Observing just this model of observing learning and approving is something we want to move are our issues in the past.
Interviewer,Is we've just moved too slowly on that on that mindset whereas we on that model we were able to.
Dorsey,Much much faster because we've improved dramatically our infrastructure we've got a lot more sophisticated about how.
Interviewer,To apply technology in the right way but i i definitely here i definitely hear the call and there are certain features.
Dorsey,Like like edit or you know putting all the conversations of the service or giving people more control over who can.
Interviewer,Reply or how they moderate comments within the reply is you yeah media plays or mute i think it's gonna turn off any.
Dorsey,Reaction to sweet like way that you can turn comments off on youtube and we're experimenting with all those but all of.
Interviewer,Them have another side right you know that you know recently we we tweeted about we are experimenting with people.
Dorsey,Enabling giving having more control over the reply so one of the things we're we're testing is like if you have a.
Interviewer,Tweet and some jarek replies to you giving you the ability to hide it and not delete it but hide it which kind of.
Dorsey,Moves it over to another call it tab that allows outside observers who are not you know you or that require to.
Interviewer,Actually see that you've moderated that reply but for your own conversation you can be the host of that conversation you.
Dorsey,Can you can edit it you can curate it a bit more you can't delete the tweet from the platform but you you can push it to.
Interviewer,The side and which forces people to do some work but also how it gives them some visibility into what you moderate.
Dorsey,And the reason why this is important is because a lot of what's been great about twitter have been activists and and.
Interviewer,Whistleblowers and journalists who you know a powerful figure might tweet something and then you see an immediate.
Dorsey,Reaction in terms of well actually that's just not true that's not factual like you know i'm sure you probably.
Interviewer,Ellie seen or heard about everything that was going on in the in the fire festival and one of the things that you.
Dorsey,See within the documentaries is the activity by the social media managers to delete rapidly all the comments that.
Interviewer,Call it out as a fraud and if we just allow it pure deletion of tweets because you as a person to like them then we you.
Dorsey,Miss a huge opportunity to to call out and to and to speak truth to to power in a way so any near these goals to.
Interviewer,Overcome tribalism and the siloing of information that that contravenes that what's important so there's a feature.
Dorsey,Like that that is big and will have impact on someone's individual experience but it comes at cost and we.
Interviewer,Need to mitigate the cost that it that it brings with it in in this case you know diminishing the potential for echo.
Dorsey,Chambers diminishing people to to share different facts and or you know speaking truth to power there's a certain.
Interviewer,Inevitability to twitter i think you've even tweeted like it's if if twitter wasn't invented then you know twitter.
Dorsey,Would have been invented right like that that that were of the moment where something like this would have come.
Interviewer,Along had it not been for you and biz and ev but i'm interested in in like what the internal experience has been.
Dorsey,For you because i look at you i look at biz i don't know f but between you and biz like you guys are i mean biz was.
Interviewer,Designing book covers like you were you know into fashion design and i was oliver botanical illustration and punk.
Dorsey,Rock and i mean like to really inherently creative people i mean you're not graduates of harvard business school.
Interviewer,Graduates at all yeah right like that it's it's so improbable and in certain respects beautiful that this creation.
Dorsey,Came out of came out of this you know special group of people who at the time intended it to be a.
Interviewer,A means for for people to to connect right to just share information about their lives and twitter has since become.
Dorsey,Something else entirely in certain respects means still retains that aspect of it but you could have.
Interviewer,Never predicted what it has matured into and i'm interested in how that feels like to be sitting you know right in the.
Dorsey,Middle of all of this having to make these kinds of decisions that we're discussing today and and and try to.
Interviewer,Navigate this you know behemoth in the right direction what does that like i mean it one it it.
Dorsey,Feels amazing i mean i think my my co-founder have said it said of perfectly recently you know he said you.
Interviewer,Know we often apt we often talk about everything that could have gone wrong with twitter to not enable it to.
Dorsey,Continue to thrive and to be useful to people but just have to pay attention the how much had to go exactly right for.
Interviewer,This to happen and you know we're all um we're all pretty quirky and and and and fairly weird and you know and i think.
Dorsey,The the best aspect of twitter is a it's it's a little bit it's a little bit weird it's a weird little thing and you.
Interviewer,Know we we built this because we wanted to use it and and that was the intention we wanted to use this technology in this.
Dorsey,Way and and it was just you know i i wanted to be able to go off anywhere and and share what i was seeing sure what.
Interviewer,Was happening and i wanted to be able to follow biz and see what he was thinking and see what was happening and then i.
Dorsey,Think the most beautiful thing about twitter is that people showed us what they wanted it to be and you know i.
Interviewer,Think being able to be observant enough to really listen to what something wants to be to me is true creativity and i you.
Dorsey,Know we we had the amazing fortune in that we were able to build something that felt very.
Interviewer,Foundational but was ultimately a discovery that i mean we discovered something essential something very very.
Dorsey,Low level and because there was so low level because it was so essential because it was so that you know this.
Interviewer,Core foundational layer people built social norms on top of it and the first such norm was using the apt symbol to.
Dorsey,Refer to another person which you know i took my laptop one day and i went to stacks in hayes valley which is a brunch.
Interviewer,Place and took four hours over over a waffle and some coffee and any time i saw in that symbol with a name i would.
Dorsey,Link him and then we turn that into a replies slash mentions page and suddenly conversation was born on the platform we.
Interviewer,Saw you know a few people using it but that usage grew and grew and grew we implemented it so everyone could use it.
Dorsey,And that made it more accessible and then everyone started using it same thing happened with a hashtag chris.
Interviewer,Messina started putting this you know hash slash you know a pound sign next to a word to tag by keyword and topic what.
Dorsey,His tweets were about and we found a search engine called summize we acquired them because they were recognizing all.
Interviewer,Of these hashtags and linking them to here's all the tweets that match that hashtag and suddenly you had not.
Dorsey,Conversation between two people or multiple people but you had conversation around the topic and and that just.
Interviewer,Opened another aperture and then you know tim o'reilly you know started really pushing this concept of okay i'm.
Dorsey,Following these people and all these people are following me and i want the people following me to see what see this.
Interviewer,One tweet from who i'm following so i'm a rebroadcast at which he called a retweet and yes and again he starts.
Dorsey,The rt yeah and then we implemented the rt away by making it a button and then everyone started doing it and that.
Interviewer,Created spread and network effects and contribution back to the conversation so everything that has made twitter twitter.
Dorsey,Has come from the people using it there was not invented in-house and some would argue that we don't really invent.
Interviewer,Twitter we only discovered it and i would agree with that you know i think we tuned in to something that was.
Dorsey,Interesting that was intriguing that we didn't know what it was going to become and in the same light people figured out.
Interviewer,How to game it too and and that's right this is a living breathing organism right that that you know could also you.
Dorsey,Know become a virus yes absolutely it could be at least at least so we're happy you have a pathogen yeah yeah at.
Interviewer,Least at least the pathways and the vectors that it provides can carry both positive and negative attributes and you.
Dorsey,Know i was i was watching spacex dragon launch yesterday last night and i you know certainly taken aback by the.
Interviewer,Accomplishment but also taken aback that like we can be in this like big virtual conversation together i don't know any.
Dorsey,Of these people but one of the screen shots i took was you know you know the the rocket it was in the t-minus 10 and.
Interviewer,I was watching through twitter and i just started seeing all these tweets and periscope comments saying you know.
Dorsey,Congrats or you know good luck from mexico good luck from india good luck from from japan and like wow okay i just.
Interviewer,Couldn't couldn't even imagine this in the past like have one single plane where anyone around the world can and.
Dorsey,Can just share how they're thinking and wish wish well upon one another but the flip of that is you you know.
Interviewer,Like any tool you can figure out in a way such that you can use the vectors to be more destructive and to be.
Dorsey,Distracting and to divide which i think is antithetical to the base technology but it doesn't mean that we should.
Interviewer,Assume that it'll just work itself out we we have to actively maintain and and and and garden there's this conversation.
Dorsey,And you know that the challenge is no one's done at the scale before so we have to learn it you know we have to.
Interviewer,Learn it in real time and part of the conversations like this is like i want to i want to share that i'm learning it.
Dorsey,In real time we're learning it in real time and we're gonna make a ton of mistakes in the in along the way but.
Interviewer,We're going to do it in public and we're going to admit when we're wrong and we just haven't done enough of that in the.
Dorsey,Past on this idea of doing it in public you know failing and succeeding in the public eye how do you just as a human.
Interviewer,Being deal with the reaction that comes with every single thing that you tweet like.
Dorsey,Do you like you put a lot of thought into what you're putting out into the world do you not read your app mention.
Interviewer,Like how do you do it like knowing that every city every time you tweet something at least with respect to.
Dorsey,What's going on at twitter that you're gonna get like there's gonna be a certain percentage of people that are.
Interviewer,Gonna want to say not nice things like how do you insulate yourself how do you see that and take it to heart but also.
Dorsey,Protect your own you know emotional well-being yeah i mean and this is where the meditation practice has helped me a.
Interviewer,Lot is just not constantly allowing myself to be reactive to whatever comes in front of me this is that the less.
Dorsey,Control i have over my own well-being and space and and and mindset the less effective i am in fixing our issues so i.
Interviewer,I approach it number one from that mindset of like i want to i want to go into the arena and experience everything.
Dorsey,That people are thinking because i the only way for me to really move forward is to at least see it ideally to.
Interviewer,Acknowledge it figure out what i can learn from even the most negative like what's the question behind the question.
Dorsey,What's the statement behind the statement what realizing also that you know people have a lot of a lot of fear.
Interviewer,Of companies like ours and and and me you know running companies like ours and they have a lot of distrust and.
Dorsey,Expressing that comes out often as anger and it comes out as hateful and it comes out as you know something that would.
Interviewer,Otherwise set me off but even that expression even them doing that might disarm a little bit i'd i think you know.
Dorsey,With the rest of online there's there's very little consequence to doing something like that and it's easy to be.
Interviewer,Behind a keyboard and and say things that you know some people say but i do think that there is a health aspect in.
Dorsey,Enabling people to express themselves but they certainly do not have a right for us to amplify that or to guide it to.
Interviewer,A person who wasn't open to accepting it and and and that's where the mechanics of the network failed today like it.
Dorsey,There's just so many open doors that people can take advantage of like replies like trends like search and you.
Interviewer,Know there's there's some power in those doors being open but if you don't feel you have enough control over them or.
Dorsey,Your own experience and you just can't give up why it won't this isn't useful to me and like ultimately you know as we.
Interviewer,Think about health we need to we need to realize two things one we need a we need to protect someone's physical safety to.
Dorsey,The best degree that we can being an online platform and then number two we need to protect people's right to freely.
Interviewer,Express themselves and we do believe that's a global right and we do believe that.
Dorsey,People weaponize it and they in the game it and their intent is to silence one another and i think everyone on the on.
Interviewer,The free speech absolutist side would agree that they prefer everyone to be able to speak and part of that agreement.
Dorsey,Is making sure that people feel safe to do so in the first place so we have to guide all of our rules around those.
Interviewer,Those concepts and principles in terms of you know what is impacting someone's ability to freely express themselves and.
Dorsey,And and then third realize that you know the the conversation to have is around attention and amplification and.
Interviewer,Recommendation that's where twitter's true power is and that's where i think we should be held a lot more accountable.
Dorsey,Publicly is what we recommend what we allow to be amplified what we do with people's attention which is you know a.
Interviewer,Scarce resource and something that our business is built off of and what about capturing the in speaking about.
Dorsey,Capturing people's attention and maintaining it how do you think about the addictive nature of not just your.
Interviewer,Platform but these social media platforms in general you know we're now in this era where we have people like.
Dorsey,Tristan harris speaking out about the erosion of you know our analog lives as a result of our you know are being held.
Interviewer,Hostage by our devices on actually tomorrow i'm getting a guy in the podcast called cal newport i wrote a.
Dorsey,Book called deep work and he's got a new book coming out called digital minimalism that's all about you know how.
Interviewer,How we can have healthier relationships with these devices while respecting the you know the addictive nature and what.
Dorsey,And what they truly are and he talks a lot about and tristan talks a lot about how so much energy.
Interviewer,Is put into trying to maintain that attention on the platform like is that like what's going on at twitter with.
Dorsey,Respect to how you've architected the platform for that purpose yeah i mean i think this goes back to the the.
Interviewer,Incentive conversation like where we're incentivizing a lot more kind of social status than we are utility and i think.
Dorsey,There is deep deep utility within twitter you know it's the the fastest way and most influential way to get your.
Interviewer,Thoughts to the world that there's nothing faster i think it also i find out what's going on and a figure out in.
Dorsey,Jail time yeah into you know it's a fastest way to tap into a global consciousness like there's nothing.
Interviewer,Faster it's not segmented by groups or communities or run on it everything is on the same plane and there's a lot of.
Dorsey,Power to that but at the same time you know we need to make sure that we're aligning the incentives of the network.
Interviewer,Towards that rather than you know coming up with the best tweet that has the most likes because you're the most outraged.
Dorsey,Or you have the best hot take without any sort of consideration around what's actually happening or you know like an.
Interviewer,Event just unfolds you quickly fire something off it's outrageous as hell which really.
Dorsey,Spreads it throughout the network and and then you know two hours later you realize what you just said was a.
Interviewer,Complete distortion of reality because something new breaks around the event so you know i think we need to make sure at.
Dorsey,Least in the conversation utility aspect that were were were incentivizing you know the breadth of the conversation the.
Interviewer,The timeline of the conversation the the fact that people can go back it goes back to what i hope to do with these.
Dorsey,Podcasts like you know i started some with this year and like bill simmons and and maybe i was really terrible and.
Interviewer,Maybe you know as people progress through the year with me maybe maybe they see you know my conversational game.
Dorsey,Gets more stronger and much more authentic and much more real and and more open that that would.
Interviewer,Be my hope so the same thing i want to have happen on twitter where you can see learning you can see development you can.
Dorsey,See iteration and and the beauty of conversation versus a post his conversation evolve it iterates and it.
Interviewer,Grows and it goes in directions and it's very fluid so we need to show more of that but in terms of the addictive.
Dorsey,Natures of the technologies yes i think we're we're making at least from an os level or we're making the right first.
Interviewer,Steps which is giving people the data so you know ios and android both in the base operating system now allow you to.
Dorsey,Track how much time you spend on particular apps or how much you use your phone and you can see it i think it's a.
Interviewer,Novelty right now i don't with the exception of potentially people's kids i don't think people are actually.
Dorsey,Utilizing that information in a way that is changing their behaviors at least that's my own experience i i look at my.
Interviewer,Screen time and it hasn't made me make any other new decisions you shared it though you share it you shared your.
Dorsey,Screen time on twitter before yeah yeah to generate a conversation about it but like it hasn't.
Interviewer,There's no again it goes back to incentives there's no incentive for me to change right now like you did i just.
Dorsey,Don't see the like at least within that view it's not presenting to me a path as we talked about earlier weather the.
Interviewer,Water and and the line it's not presenting necessarily upfront a solution that points me in a direction.
Dorsey,That has more you know fulsome human connection why don't one of the things we at twitter are our main twitter.
Interviewer,Account at the company we did this little thing yesterday where we tweeted get off of twitter go tell someone that.
Dorsey,You love them better to do it in person and one i love that we do stuff like that because you know i i don't want to.
Interviewer,Be afraid of telling people to get off a thing right off it and like kara swisher is rolling our eyes right now.
Dorsey,I know and - well that's that's that's her prerogative but like i think you know if you look at the replies to that.
Interviewer,Tweet it's amazing and and if you know if we if we can do whatever we can to encourage some fundamentally different.
Dorsey,Human connection great but in every one of those moments we get to learn and it might have you know it might have seemed.
Interviewer,A little bit i roley or stupid or whatnot but i don't want us to be afraid of stuff like that at that level because.
Dorsey,I we get to learn from those opportunities and based on those learnings we get to challenge our.
Interviewer,Assumptions but i you know it the world we want to get to is and i've said this on other podcast is i want i want people.
Dorsey,To walk away from twitter emphasis walk away from twitter feeling that they learn something and right now i feel.
Interviewer,Walk people walk away from twitter feeling outraged or feeling overwhelmed or feeling like they don't know what the.
Dorsey,Next step is or what the thing why the things even valuable so if we can direct a lot of our efforts towards like you.
Interviewer,Know i put down the phone and i feel like i learned something and you know i want to i want to build on it in this.
Dorsey,Way and then share back the progress then we've we've done the right thing and i i know that feels far away from.
Interviewer,What people perceive of twitter today but it's there and it does happen in small amounts like a it's really a.
Dorsey,Function of like what twitter you follow you you follow health twitter you learn untell enough stuff you you you know.
Interviewer,Rhonda patrick found my fitness you then mercola you know just you know all along the spectrum of health from the very.
Dorsey,Extreme to you know more the mainstream to to the other end of it i learned so much from those conversations on the.
Interviewer,Service yeah i would agree with you there's a lot of pretty vile arguments going on around.
Dorsey,Diet though you can fall into that rabbit hole as well yeah and i would just say you know sort of you know.
Interviewer,Respecting the challenges of foot and and the problems that you're facing that on a personal level you know twitter's.
Dorsey,Been an unbelievable resource for me i feel like i'd built most of my career on the shoulders of twitter because it's.
Interviewer,Allowed me this unbelievable ability to directly connect with all these people that i respect and admire and have then.
Dorsey,Been able to meet in real life for purposes of this show but even even before that like it's been a tremendous.
Interviewer,Value add in my personal experience and i would take that you know with everything else that it has and you know.
Dorsey,Now there's all these other social networks and i get a lot more traction on other ones but twitter's still like.
Interviewer,The first one that i go to in the morning when i have my social media time it's like twitter first i want to see.
Dorsey,What's going on right now yeah and that was a that was a big shift when i came back to the company and.
Interviewer,Almost four years ago and in that like i think we were we had my mind set too much of chasing after the people that we.
Dorsey,Don't have like trying to increase the pie size of the pie as quickly as possible versus focusing on the people.
Interviewer,We do have i'd you know and we have some of the most influential people in the world using us in a while it might feel.
Dorsey,I mean it's it's certainly smaller than others it drives culture it dries conversation and we don't even know how.
Interviewer,To count the impressions that tweets get we can't count tweets on cnn being screenshotted we can't count the tweets.
Dorsey,Being shown within newspapers so the the you know just the impressions that has around the world is significant and what.
Interviewer,We need to focus on is making sure that for the people who do love us that we're giving them opportunity to love us more.
Dorsey,And such that they want to they want to talk about the value they're getting out of it and back to your point you know.
Interviewer,It's a it's a cost-benefit analysis like you know there's certainly cost to twitter and we're seeing you know more.
Dorsey,And more than like people being fired / tweets they tweeted 10 years ago and not being able to clarify what they.
Interviewer,Meant and you know we also see a lot of benefit in terms that they've built their networks or careers their.
Dorsey,Understanding their practice by engaging in these communities we you know we have a woman who was in the westboro baptist.
Interviewer,Church who was using twitter every single day to spread hate against the lgbtqa community and you know four or.
Dorsey,Five very patient folks on twitter who are engaging her every day every day showing her different perspective and.
Interviewer,She left the church because of that and she credits a lot of that to those conversations on twitter and just.
Dorsey,Showing her a different perspective and she's working on getting the rest of her family out of it she was born into that.
Interviewer,Church so we don't do a great job at telling all those stories as well but they're real and they're impactful and.
Dorsey,They're meaningful and we you know we need to optimize for for more of that occurrence realizing that there's always.
Interviewer,Going to be negative approaches and our role is like we we can't amplify that like we we we need to make sure that.
Dorsey,People have control over the experience and if they choose to see everything that's there right in their choice but.
Interviewer,If they you know if if they don't you know they should be able to have a conversation they want to have and be.
Dorsey,The host that they want to be what do you foresee for the future as we kind of uh sure in this post privacy you know.
Interviewer,Culture and world that we live in where were seemingly all gonna be held accountable for things that we said or.
Dorsey,Did that were documented on twitter and other platforms you know ten years ago 20 years ago as culture shifts are we.
Interviewer,All just going to be you know put on trial for these things like we're in a very weird awkward in-between phase.
Dorsey,Right now trying to grapple with this issue and we you know in canceled culture right now holding.
Interviewer,People you know hands to the fire for for things that they did you know quite some time ago and i see that only.
Dorsey,Becoming more problematic in the short run until we figure out as a culture how we're going to manage this kind of thing.
Interviewer,Yeah you've you've talked about you know carol's concept of growth mindset on yeah on your podcast and if we you know.
Dorsey,If we have a culture that cancels people on mistake there is no opportunity for growth mindset there's no opportunity.
Interviewer,For learning there's no opportunity for evolution so i agree with you that we're in a weird state right now i think as.
Dorsey,More people experience this and more people see that there is potential for learning there's potential for a.
Interviewer,Rehabilitation there's potential for redemption i mean we're not just seeing this online or you know we're seeing.
Dorsey,This in the prison systems in the united states we're seeing this in like the conversation around infractions around.
Interviewer,Like you know canis cannabis sales in the past and what it now means that it's legalized within the state and you know.
Dorsey,The hundreds if not thousands if not tens of thousands of people we put away because of that very thing and and just.
Interviewer,Like the momentum of the framework and the system that doesn't allow for redemption or rehabilitation so this is.
Dorsey,Much broader than online and it's much broader than the conversation i think we're having and i don't think we're.
Interviewer,Allowing ourselves to connect all the dots and i don't think were we're allowing our our culture and our society.
Dorsey,To even have the chance at learning or growing if we if we can't sell everyone out there there's just no learning and.
Interviewer,Eventually you're gonna trip up yourself and if you're not giving someone else to benefit out no one's gonna give you the.
Dorsey,Benefit out either and i i think that experience will be had by a lot of people certainly all the younger folks.
Interviewer,And more and more of an of an older generation and as long as we have that open dialogue and show that's okay we're.
Dorsey,Good but you know as twitter we could also do some things like where we're you know.
Interviewer,We're thinking about this feature to allow people to go back and clarify tweets and what that might look like is.
Dorsey,You might have said you might have tweeted something five years ago about diet and someone might unearth it and.
Interviewer,Say you know you know rich you believe this and before this you believe you believe this and suddenly today that.
Dorsey,Older tweak it's all this traction and you can retweet it and and then suddenly you might be known as the person that is.
Interviewer,Completely inconsistent or in your views so you can imagine a feature where you could immediately go back clarify that.
Dorsey,Tweet when you do so it's kind of like a quote tweet a quote a retweet with comment and by doing so by clarifying it.
Interviewer,You're not allowing the original tweet to be retweeted without the clarification so anytime someone.
Dorsey,Retweets that original tweet the clarification comes with it so at least people have more context and and things.
Interviewer,Like that might make an impact they may not at all but we should test so it's also like a.
Dorsey,Lot of work right like i'm not i'm not gonna go back to 2008 and read all my tweets and whatever i said you know no i.
Interviewer,Figure out what needs clarification to someone like bringing something in the past stuff you can immediately go to.
Dorsey,That tweet clarify it and then and then the record is straight at least in your experience so walk me through a day in.
Interviewer,The life what's it look like for you now use two days a week you're here at the house right yeah i i've been i've been.
Dorsey,Working from home two days a week which i you know is it time for me to read to write to consider and this gives me a.
Interviewer,Lot of the free time that i need to to think the the other days are just back to back back meetings and and and my.
Dorsey,Life is in little little boxes and google calendar but every day i wake up usually between 5:30 and 6:30 and i.
Interviewer,Immediately start with a cold shower that that is my that is my my immediate caffeine in the morning and it's kind of.
Dorsey,Like this one of those small wins where i feel like i already won the day if i can go straight into cold water and have.
Interviewer,The mental capacity to do so them and the and it just feels i can take anything and just wakes me the hell up -.
Dorsey,So like right away before coffee before any yep i go straighten in a cold shower and there for like you know a minute to.
Interviewer,Five minutes and then i go into this room and i release it here and i met at 8:00 for an hour and i do have in pass.
Dorsey,On a based practice and and after that i get ready and i usually turn you know turned on my phone at that point to see.
Interviewer,If there's any emergencies i i keep my phone either in my kitchen or my closet not next to my bed i you know i turn off.
Dorsey,All the notification notifications during the night and i don't really check it into about you know 7:00 to.
Interviewer,7:30 and when i'm walking into work i leave the house around 7:30 and my my office is about five miles away and.
Dorsey,Takes me now about an hour 15 minutes an hour 20 minutes to to walk and no matter unless it's heavy rain i do it you know.
Interviewer,And any time i'm going in the office i'd i walk and sometimes it's really cold here and you know that the calls has.
Dorsey,Been as 39 but it gets my blood going gets my mind going and i was in a podcast i listen to audio books i.
Interviewer,Sometimes i just think sometimes i take phone calls i walk super fast if you ever see me on the street i like.
Dorsey,Ridiculous because it's just like you know almost almost jogging but um interesting same route every day same.
Interviewer,Same route every day sometimes i'd even adds time so i feel like i found the optimal path to to save to save time and.
Dorsey,I kind of i've shifted my entire outfit to this walk like i wear all black because you if i sweat you can't see.
Interviewer,Anything you can't see any stained if it rains like he can't see any of the the wetness.
Dorsey,And i wear these running sandals because they're the fastest that they enable me to move the fastest they're faster than.
Interviewer,Running so they're called earth runners earth runners calm they they're made up in.
Dorsey,Sonoma i think they may be in san francisco now but they're um super simple like you know if any of you or.
Interviewer,You read born to run you know all the running sibling side room fivefinger type shoes well they're pure their.
Dorsey,Prayer sandals so like they don't have any of the articulated toes or whatnot so it's a you know it's open tarahumara.
Interviewer,Yes the tarahumara sandals and so i usually wear those everyday which have been called out as well and press like.
Dorsey,I'm wearing i'm wearing these sandals and ever exposing your my toes to got the ceo of goldman sachs.
Interviewer,I'm like man should i not expose my ugly hands either like what i think can't be can be human here so we i so i i walk in.
Dorsey,With those and that iterated from sneakers and i just tried to find the fastest way to be in and and then like.
Interviewer,You know i wear wear these black jeans and this sweater that keeps me warm and you know i just wake up put these on and.
Dorsey,And go and then i look fist i don't need breakfast i have one meal a day so i go i have that's every day.
Interviewer,Every day yeah with the exception i'd i started experimenting a little bit recently where on.
Dorsey,Well i'll finish the rest of this so i go into twitter first um my first meetings usually at 9:00 i have meetings.
Interviewer,Until about 2:00 p.m. and then i walk across the street to square i usually stay until about 6 or 7 i take a lift.
Dorsey,Home i don't walk back home i try to eat dinner at 6:30 around around 6:30 or 7:00 not too late i go into the infrared.
Interviewer,Sauna which i really love i do a workout i do vii work out through an app sometimes.
Dorsey,They do multiple circuits of that and then and then i eat and then i i kind of wind down at 9:30 try to be in bed at.
Interviewer,Least by 10:00 and then go to sleep i try to get 9 hours of sleep that's been hugely impactful or a ring to keep me.
Dorsey,Accountable to it but so i i learned the one meal a day thing from from wim hof you know two years ago and i i loved.
Interviewer,Learning through experimentation and i love experimenting on myself and i've always been this way i was i.
Dorsey,Was vegan for two years it was it's very hard to be vegan st. louis missouri at least when i was i was i was right now.
Interviewer,You're in san francisco i know i know i know i will reboot this i i so i love experimenting i've always experimented.
Dorsey,With my diet i book always experiments with health practices some like some have been really informative to me and.
Interviewer,Very healthy some have not but the one meal a day thing i i just thought was a really interesting challenge and i just.
Dorsey,I heard it on the podcast i think it was with him in tim harrison magicite i want to try that and i after a week of some.
Interviewer,Pain i noticed i slept much deeper and during the day i was so much more focused so every day i i fast for 22.
Dorsey,Hours i have you know i have dinner within two hours and i have a really really big dinner and and recently over.
Interviewer,The past few months i've been breaking that by by having as kind of a reward for making it through the week on friday.
Dorsey,Morning i go to blue bottle coffee and they get one of their waffles which is amazing in the morning and and then i.
Interviewer,Was your big cheat that's it that's a cheat and i won't what i've been doing recently is i won't eat until saturday.
Dorsey,Dinner so and it gets tended fast because i've been playing with even more extended just pure water fast that the.
Interviewer,Longest i've done is three days and it it is trippy like the the amount of focus i have on day three is like crazy.
Dorsey,I was not expecting that and i would eventually like to go beyond that just to see what see what happens.
Interviewer,But i have to package it into these weekends because i don't trust myself enough to not balance it with my my day.
Dorsey,To day work and everything going on at the office and went on so yeah when when i learned something on a podcast like.
Interviewer,Like yours or you know something that like you know david goggins is doing and i i try it i try it for like a month and.
Dorsey,If i like it i stick with it and i just want to constantly experiment and that's that's why i dropped out of school.
Interviewer,That's why i cuz i i was learning so much more about experimenting myself and i i don't know any other way to learn if.
Dorsey,I accept by tinkering and playing and and trying new things and realizing early on it was a little bit too.
Interviewer,Haphazard now i like really if i'm gonna try something i'm gonna dedicate months to it and like a common practice and i.
Dorsey,Have a lot of patience as a characteristic and i have a lot of discipline and like i can really stick.
Interviewer,To something i say i'm going to do so that is a practice i also been journaling since i was very young.
Dorsey,Mostly you know through through my phone but before that was written journalism sometimes online that's where a lot of.
Interviewer,The ideas from tour came from was live journal i just had journaling in public which was like scary scary idea to to be.
Dorsey,Like what's the edge of honesty that you want to be open about to other people that you don't know and you can follow.
Interviewer,You and i you know i experimented with that everyday at twitter as well and like some of that was me sharing my.
Dorsey,Meditation and the amara is like look i'm oh i'm aware of what this might be pursue independent of like what's.
Interviewer,Happening within me ammar a tech guy in san francisco of course he doesn't meditation.
Dorsey,Of course he's going to tweet about it of course like he got bitten up by mosquitoes is gonna show that off like.
Interviewer,It's so silicon valley episode tonight i get that that's the thing that kind of like i i'm cognizant of like i'm just.
Dorsey,Playing into this stereotype but i don't care i get value out of it and i i know i'm gonna get some of that back and i.
Interviewer,Know i'm gonna get other things back and i don't want to be afraid of at least creating potential for someone else who.
Dorsey,Might be on the edge of trying something like this to like take the step or for it to resonate in such a way that they.
Interviewer,Develop some questions in their mind and because i would want that i won't i get so much out of people being open and.
Dorsey,Sharing and even though that they might play into a stereotype it helps me evolve and grow so i need to.
Interviewer,Model that behavior as well and i what's learning unless you share it well i think look there's certain aspects of.
Dorsey,That that are you know stereotypically silicon valley asked but i think what distinguishes it is the the self-care.
Interviewer,Aspect of it to me stands a little bit in in contradiction to this this you know hustle porn culture that i think is.
Dorsey,Also pervasive in silicon valley where you got to work twenty five hours a day and and you know sleep is for when.
Interviewer,You're dead and all of that for you to kind of say look i'm sleeping eight or nine hours a night no no i have the aura.
Dorsey,Screenshots living you know a relative me show me around your house like it's very there's a there's a minimalism.
Interviewer,Aspect to it like you live you know for you know compared to the way that you could live you're living a relatively.
Dorsey,You know simple stripped-down existence yeah i mean i and how does that inform like your thinking and your equanimity.
Interviewer,And how you you know the creative you know impetus that you bring to business i the philosophy that i've always that.
Dorsey,Has always resonated with me inherently and naturally and feels like i was i was born with was is.
Interviewer,This essentialism like what is absolutely essential in my life and even if you ask my parents you know when we.
Dorsey,Moved into a new house and my you know my parents came from nothing they barely even graduated high school st. louis.
Interviewer,Missouri didn't go to college were very upset when i didn't finish college because i would be the one person my.
Dorsey,Family did you so but you know when we would move into a new house i always chose the smallest room and i always put.
Interviewer,The least amount of stuff in it and i i appreciate i appreciate this concept of like i want to figure out how to unlock.
Dorsey,Everything i'm born with because i know that's all i need all i need is everything i'm born with.
Interviewer,Like i i don't need any of these objects i don't need any of these technologies i think i think of twitter as insanely.
Dorsey,Useful but i think of most technologies as a crutch to point back to what we're inherently capable of and in twitter's.
Interviewer,Case you know i think it represents the global consciousness i think it's the closest thing we have to tapping into a.
Dorsey,Global consciousness and to be able to not just see what people are saying but what they actually think the sentiment.
Interviewer,Behind it and i inherently believe that we have that power internally and i i believe that twitter's one of twitter's.
Dorsey,Role is to remind us of the potential and you know if meditation can get me to a point where i can where i can.
Interviewer,Experience that and feel it would you know which which it hasn't some way it's and got me more in tune to my instinct.
Dorsey,Into my into my gut and like my feelings and i proved i i mark those moments of instinct and i i marked them with enough.
Interviewer,Weight mental clarity and weight whether it be through journaling or just considering it deeply that when the.
Dorsey,Event does happen that i had an instinct about i can tie it back right now that's cool and that's and that has that has.
Interviewer,Shown me like this these technologies you know these rings that we're wearing they're.
Dorsey,Just reminders to me and crutches of what we inherently are born with and have the natural ability to do so and.
Interviewer,They're mirrors and if we can approach them in that light instead of something that drives us which i think you know.
Dorsey,Tristan you know accurately articulates if we we will be able to develop a healthy relationship with them we're.
Interviewer,Going to start any new technology we're going to start by a codependent relationship and then when when you get.
Dorsey,Aware of the power and you get to aware of the reflection the reflection is what becomes the interesting part and it's.
Interviewer,Reflection back on you and your consciousness in your awareness and anything that builds self awareness any.
Dorsey,Practice i mean any tool any object is is something that i want to invest in and and so i keep my life fairly sparse.
Interviewer,Because i think it'll be distracting otherwise do you canonize this in any specific like spiritual perspective that.
Dorsey,Guides your life i grew up catholic and and my parents are pretty devout catholics and my uncle's a priest you.
Interviewer,Know every christmas we go back and he says mass but i was i was the one in my family that left st. louis and i was the.
Dorsey,One that was never confirmed by choice and i i get my sense of spirituality through connection and you know what.
Interviewer,Twitter represents his spiritual to me like tapping into the consciousness the you know the the the larger organism.
Dorsey,Whether it be the the plan at the universe the the social consciousness is what is what is what drives me and it's.
Interviewer,The it's the answer i like to get at you know and the question that i like to ask and so that's where i feel like the flow.
Dorsey,And that's where i feel most alive is when i i feel like i can tap into that and like you know i go down to big sur a.
Interviewer,Lot and fixer like we look at this amazing fortune here in san francisco being able.
Dorsey,To travel two and a half hours away and go you know to this place that you immediately feel is mystical because of.
Interviewer,The redwood trees on this dynamic coast that goes down a thousand feet to the ocean where you see whales and and and.
Dorsey,You just feel this this connection and this wisdom and i i think that's so so powerful in such an important reminder.
Interviewer,Like today is my day where i don't you know saturdays is my day where i don't think about work at all with exception.
Dorsey,In this conversation but it's at a different level i i just clear the day completely to you know walk outside or.
Interviewer,To go down to big sur or to be with my best friends i have dinner with them ideally once a week and just laugh and.
Dorsey,Have some wine together and they just had a baby so that's all another new sense of joy and i need a lot of that.
Interviewer,Balance because that that is my spiritual connection at the moment it's just like feeling that that connection.
Dorsey,Is tangible way as possible and you you know you mentioned you know my path of like you know think about designing.
Interviewer,Jeans and botanical illustration and i took a thousand hours of massage therapy along my path of becoming an engineer.
Dorsey,And a ceo because i i grew up writing programs and it's so damn abstract you're so much in your head and you're.
Interviewer,Not using your hands and every time i realize i'm just like my dreams were me programming my dreams it's just such a.
Dorsey,Weird experience where i would have a stream where i was programming the next part of my dream and it was so lucid but.
Interviewer,It was so it wasn't grounded so i would always shift towards something that i loved.
Dorsey,Like botanical illustration and just drawing or something that would solve a need because i was developing carpal.
Interviewer,Tunnel and i didn't just want to get a massage i wanted to learn the the why behind it and then the.
Dorsey,Annex behind it so i could fix myself and but all these variations these side pass these forks in the road have always.
Interviewer,Brought me back to building technology because and added depth and enriched building that technology because i'd.
Dorsey,It's just where i feel my creativity most yeah i know you had an interest in public transportation and like urban.
Interviewer,Planning early days i feel like you should get together with elon and solve the traffic problem wait you guys.
Dorsey,Together he's trying to get the traffic to mars yeah well he's going underground too that's sure you know that's sure i.
Interviewer,Can't help but think that there's this weird meta parallel between like your own personal path towards broadening.
Dorsey,Your consciousness and and you know raising your awareness and and and growing as a as a human being and the.
Interviewer,Kind of hive consciousness that is twitter and the commitment to kind of raising the vibration of that like the.
Dorsey,Interplay between those i think is super interesting yeah i yeah i think um in that sense like you know back to our our.
Interviewer,Conversation around meditation it's the the observation is not just that we are external observers but we are part of.
Dorsey,This is some of the very act of observing is changing the system as well and we we have a responsibility to.
Interviewer,Really reflect the essentialness of humanity and and and being that reflection on the world for all the good.
Dorsey,And all the bad i mean that there's a lot of power to seeing you know how people think in ways that make us feel.
Interviewer,Great and also things that are super uncomfortable because we we need to be able to acknowledge those things we need.
Dorsey,To be able to acknowledge in person order to have a conversation about it and then there's no other path towards.
Interviewer,Evolution and making something better unless we can talk about it and and yeah so it's all recursive it's.
Dorsey,All recursive and the more i realize how recursive this world is i think the better our nets just get but at the same.
Interviewer,Time it's easy to go down to a very very abstract path and i get that and i you know we have to balance practicality.
Dorsey,With it but in that balance is is something really magical and sometimes we we discover something really magical.
Interviewer,And sometimes we we kind of get to get ourselves distracted yeah you know this this nonviolent communication this this.
Dorsey,This concept have you heard of and it's just you know kind of a meditation on how we how we communicate and utilizing.
Interviewer,Words like should as as things that kind of restrict the growth mindset and immediately going towards solutions in.
Dorsey,Our speech versus presenting more of needs and feelings and i you know it it's amazing how if you just change a.
Interviewer,Few words in your dialogue it changes a relationship with the person you're having a conversation with or gets to.
Dorsey,Something much deeper in the conversation so there's a there's a there's a really good the book is.
Interviewer,Nonviolent communication there's a there's a good audio book read by the author called speaking peace which is.
Dorsey,Sometimes corny at times because he picks up the guitar and sings but it's the substance and the framework and the.
Interviewer,System and the science behind it is real there's a lot of glad it's not violent in terms of the person that you're.
Dorsey,Communicating with but also with respect the self it's mainly yourself yeah it's mainly yourself saying the word you know.
Interviewer,We should cecily violent because it's holding you to a standard that you feel you can't meet or you can't you can't.
Dorsey,Learn from you you can't there's no path towards towards learning when you set this immediate expectation but and.
Interviewer,That's just one example of the framework so it's a that that has been fairly enlightening just i.
Dorsey,I love looking at how we use language and you know one of the things that i've been over years been trying to convince.
Interviewer,Both my companies around is like we have this way this word in technology called users and way back when when howard.
Dorsey,Schultz was on the square board the ceo of starbucks he pulled me aside one day he's like why do you call your customers.
Interviewer,Users oh my god good question i don't i don't know where it came from but we've always called him.
Dorsey,That and then i started researching it and you know it was it was that it was coined back in the early 80s when.
Interviewer,Actually earlier in that in the 70s when people were using mainframes and it was to represent an account someone who is.
Dorsey,Using the time on a mainframe and then the people who were really good like the engineers of the system administrators.
Interviewer,Kind of it developed this level system of amun super admin and you're a user and the user is stupid and we can't.
Dorsey,Trust what they do so it became this term losers oh you se rs and then when models like google came to be they know.
Interviewer,You know they had no way to refer to their that they don't have a direct customer or relationship with the.
Dorsey,Exception of advertisers but a lot of you know the value of something like google and something like twitter is.
Interviewer,People coming to pay them with their attention and that there's no you know monetary exchange as you would assume.
Dorsey,With customers but there is a exchange of value they're honest in attention so they called that a user of a system as.
Interviewer,Well so you use google you use user of google the problem with the word is that it creates this abstraction layer so we.
Dorsey,Have you know 330 million monthly active users on twitter and once you say that it's this abstract thing you'd if you.
Interviewer,Say we have 330 million people then you have more of this empathy for or who you're serving and who you.
Dorsey,Ideally want to serve i look at it through this different lens as somebody who's in in recovery we got like a user.
Interviewer,As somebody who's an addict right well that's that's another thing is it's a very niche as as negative.
Dorsey,Connotation to the word so and and it breeds addiction as well so like we're you know in square we never use the word.
Interviewer,User we use customer we use seller we use buyer as a word we use individual and it just at least creates more.
Dorsey,Potential for empathy you know not gonna do it alone but and i'm trying to get twitter more and more there as well mmm.
Interviewer,So where do you see twitter 5-10 years from now like if you have your druthers and you're able to implement all of.
Dorsey,These changes that you would like to see you know what is it what does it look like.
Interviewer,Um i think number one that we become known as you know we truly serve our purpose of serving not the public.
Dorsey,Conversation but the global public conversation that the predominant conversations on our service are the.
Interviewer,Existential conversations of the planet and you know in you vols recent book 21 lessons for the 21st century he talks.
Dorsey,About some of the existential conversations being climate change displacement of work through artificial.
Interviewer,Intelligence economic disparity these are conversations that no one nation state can solve alone it requires all of.
Dorsey,Humanity to work together to actually make an impact on great so i believe you need platforms like twitter to host that.
Interviewer,Conversation to arrange the conversation to enable the conversation to live and iterate and to evolve and i want to be a.
Dorsey,Service that people at least have first consideration for learning from those existential global conversations and.
Interviewer,Also being able to participate in them and we've seen evidence of that so that that's number one number two in serving.
Dorsey,The public conversation public conversation we have a desire and it is a desire it you know it it's not.
Interviewer,It's it's a responsibility of all of us in the world but it is a desire for us to promote health into that conversation.
Dorsey,And i want us to be known by that i want us to be known like if you engage in public conversation on twitter you.
Interviewer,Should expect civil dialogue and debate and to learn something and you should you should if you don't know how to get.
Dorsey,Into a conversation in that way we're going to teach you and we're going to teach you through the incentives as well.
Interviewer,And and that leads to the third point i want to have a strong point of view within the network itself around.
Dorsey,Redemption and rehabilitation and teaching people how to converse like i'm trying to learn right now like we are.
Interviewer,Ultimates as a company we're ultimate students of conversation and like word we're distilling all of our learnings.
Dorsey,Right into the product so that everyone can benefit from it that sounds super idealistic idea and again back to back.
Interviewer,To the stereotypical silicon valley but like we have to have these aspirations we're not going to get to 99 percent of.
Dorsey,It we're going to get to 80 percent maybe unless but if we can get to that milestone i think will improve the lives.
Interviewer,For you know a few people at least and and maybe maybe that spreads and and maybe that pushes but like i think right.
Dorsey,Now we're just we have such a binary view of the world of on platform off platform instead of like going back to.
Interviewer,What we were talking about earlier like how do we how do we put the growth mindset into twitter like how do we.
Dorsey,Enable people to come to it and learn from it and that to me is is the is a potential of technology and i think.
Interviewer,We're gonna be taught a lot by people growing up only knowing that i can have a conversation with anyone in the world.
Dorsey,At any point i think those fascinating that like my my friend's newborn who's only four months old.
Interviewer,He's growing up in a world where he only knows touchscreens exist he only knows that i i could have a conversation with.
Dorsey,Literally anyone and though in the world instantly he's growing up to a world that has a you know growing potential.
Interviewer,For a global currency like bitcoin and native currency to the internet that's not controlled by any central bank or.
Dorsey,Nation-state and you know therefore reflects a global citizenship in a very foundational way that is.
Interviewer,Powerful and the more we can listen to that experience of like you've only known this what do you do with it like.
Dorsey,What's the next step on this and is so exciting yeah it's exciting there is an idealism that that that is you know.
Interviewer,Venturing through everything you just said but it's it's beautifully articulated and you know i hope that we.
Dorsey,See all of that come to fruition you know i worry about you know the base nature of us as human beings and this.
Interviewer,Ticking clock that we're facing with global climate change like these are you know pressing matters that need redress.
Dorsey,In in the short run unless let's be eyes wide open about it let's see it truly and it is there are some scary things.
Interviewer,That all these technologies enable but i don't know any other way to get over them but sharing them eyes wide open and.
Dorsey,Seeing them eyes wide open like talking through them last question self-serving question because the.
Interviewer,Genesis of twitter came out of odio which was initially intended to be a sarcastic plot all right come full.
Dorsey,Circle here we are in the midst of this golden age of podcasting the mainstream adoption of this of this form of media.
Interviewer,Is you know penetrating to newer and deeper levels which is really cool and exciting and i really you know i believe.
Dorsey,In this medium you know as a very potent means of really having meaningful conversations and i love it to death but.
Interviewer,If you were to start a new company today to disrupt this podcasting platform or perfect it or you know solve problems.
Dorsey,That you see as somebody who's a fan and a consumer of vodka do you have a sense of what that would.
Interviewer,Look like yeah i mean i would i would first focus on starting with the problem of how do.
Dorsey,We provide economic incentive but that to me is like the biggest unlock and i think right now we only have tools of.
Interviewer,Attention and advertising and i think some of the contribution models are just in their infancy and you know things on.
Dorsey,Patreon and what sam is doing in terms of his own explorations and we have some you know varying experiments and.
Interviewer,Decentralization but i would go after that problem first i would and i would pair deeply with the podcasting platform.
Dorsey,I would i would figure out the economic incentive first and foremost and that they be on the same plane and i would.
Interviewer,Look specifically to cryptocurrency yeah you know i think there's a lot certainly in the ability to you know transact but.
Dorsey,I think this concept of what an ic o and initial coin offering at least points to it doesn't offer today but at.
Interviewer,Least points to like someone could buy equity in your success you know buy equity and the more reach you have they.
Dorsey,Actually have economic incentive and they then because what's interesting about that is it aligns incentives your.
Interviewer,Listeners incentives are aligned with your incentives and that you want to have engaging rich conversations that.
Dorsey,People find valuable and valuable enough that they're sharing you are rating your podcasts or whatnot and in ic o at.
Interviewer,Least points to a path towards aligning those incentives and to me like that's the unlock is like how do we get.
Dorsey,Alignment of incentives between distribution of the podcast and the economic incentives that that allow it.
Interviewer,To grow and to thrive or just maintain some people don't want to clear the presents but i want to spend 50% of my.
Dorsey,Time on this and in order to do that in you do 50% less of another thing that i make money for to you know provide for.
Interviewer,My family so that's what it all comes down to so that's number one is a you know attack the problem of.
Dorsey,Economic incentives and solve it in such a way that is on the same surface as a distribution platform in a second i.
Interviewer,Would look at is how do we go how do we look deeper into indexing what's in a podcast our search tools today are so.
Dorsey,Weak so weak i mean like i we take a search voice exactly but we can but no can alright no one's been ones doing a.
Interviewer,Filter i no one's built it and the things i think are exciting like we've had so many keywords in this.
Dorsey,Conversation right like from you know from meditation to impossible to or and if i could type or speak that word and.
Interviewer,Find all the conversations about or or could just pull up the the 30-second clip of you talking about this and it.
Dorsey,Would live somewhere on the internet and be catalog exactly but also crawl cross-referencing with all the other.
Interviewer,Conversations around ora or too so to go deep in the media to allow that to be queried and then once you have that then.
Dorsey,You can do some cool things like how do you expand your reach you know that as you look at the world the biggest way to.
Interviewer,Expand your reach is translation mm-hmm so automatically translating no matter what language you speak i can hear what.
Dorsey,I need to hear no matter what language they speak and and there's a technology can solve this today but no one's put it.
Interviewer,Together in one platform so economic incentives smeared with distribution and then going deeper into the into the.
Dorsey,Content and allowing more accessibility through translation or kind of a the trio of things i would look at to come.
Interviewer,Together if i were to create one today oh do 2.0 we gave up too early we gave up too early well yeah it was a little.
