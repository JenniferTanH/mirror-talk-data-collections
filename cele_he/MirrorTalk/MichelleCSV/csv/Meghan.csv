Michelle,The star of your own kids tv show absolutely not i mean when i was very young i wanted to.
Interviewer,Be a mommy like my mommy and then when i got a little older i thought i wanted to be a pediatrician.
Michelle,And then i got a little older and i realized there was math involved and i wasn't good at that.
Interviewer,And then i decided on law because i talked a lot so you know i could only imagine for my life what was before me.
Michelle,And this wasn't it so no is the short answer well now you are.
Interviewer,The star of your own kids show waffles and mochi what has that been like has it been a.
Michelle,Lot of fun oh it it's my favorite project i mean you know you have followed us and supported a lot.
Interviewer,Of the work that we've done and i love it all but this project you know it just sort of it brings it.
Michelle,All full circle um because it brings me back to kids and nutrition.
Interviewer,It's fun um the creative the co-creators erica thornlin and jeremy connor or are funny they bring the education but they.
Michelle,Bring the funny um and it's something that all families can enjoy this isn't just a kids show.
Interviewer,It's a family show and that's what drew me to it because i i was like i i'd watch this without my.
Michelle,Kids because i don't have little kids anymore so i am so excited about this it is a.
Interviewer,Quality uh program for sure and i'm glad to be a part of it and you guys are uh partnering up with.
Michelle,Partnership for a healthier america in a year where we've all witnessed these heartbreaking images.
Interviewer,Of people lined up for miles at food banks why is it so important particularly this.
Michelle,Year well this has been a hard year for millions i mean.
Interviewer,So many of us have complained about being cooped up and isolated and it's just hard it's.
Michelle,It's a strain but the truth is there are a lot of people who have lost work they're people who are struggling.
Interviewer,To keep food on their table there are families in this country today that are going hungry.
Michelle,And so uh we're partnering with a partnership for a healthier america to create the pass the love campaign um.
Interviewer,Where our goal is to feed a million families in need right here in this country and.
Michelle,Folks can go on to the website wafflesmochie.org and they can uh find out how to be a part of that effort.
Interviewer,As well as uh use the website to interact with the show.
Michelle,Um the kids can get on in their recipes that they can practice and um they can win their own.
Interviewer,Badges because waffles and mochi always earn a badge from mrs oh when they complete an assignment.
Michelle,Um so it's a it's it's the site is for a little bit of everything but you can learn more about the pass the love.
Interviewer,Campaign there too well as you said this show is for moms too.
Michelle,We know that you know we're all watching the shows our kids watch and this has been a really trying year.
Interviewer,For mothers mothers who are working from home and teaching our kids two million women.
Michelle,Have left the work force this year what do you say to all of of those that are struggling.
Interviewer,You know mothers were all always already hard on ourselves and this is a time where we have to give ourselves a.
Michelle,Break um this is not the year to try to do it all.
Interviewer,And to beat yourself up when you can't this has been stressful so we have to give ourselves a break as mothers.
Michelle,Do the best that we can and remember in the end that what's most important for our kids is that they know.
Interviewer,We love them and that we try to be as consistent as we can but we can't get everything right.
Michelle,The other thing i would encourage mothers to do is to find some time just to get a moment by.
Interviewer,Yourself even if it means going into the bathroom lock a door and if you don't have a lock.
Michelle,Barricade yourself in and just get a moment to take a deep breath.
Interviewer,Because we can't be there for our families if we're not there for ourselves first.
Michelle,I've hidden in the pantry i have to admit maybe while eating my kids string cheese.
Interviewer,I can only imagine i mean my girls are young adults they're running from us now.
Michelle,I remember those years they are barricading themselves in their rooms because they're tired of talking us.
Interviewer,But you but you've said that one of the most beautiful parts of this year was the unexpected.
Michelle,Uninterrupted time with your girls i mean you thought they were off and go gone to college and now all of a.
Interviewer,Sudden they're back what's it been like it's been great for us i i feel for them because.
Michelle,You know malia is a senior this year this was her last year in college and sasha has essentially missed her.
Interviewer,Second year in college so i feel for them but for barack and i we have cherished this time i mean you.
Michelle,Don't get that time back again where you see your children in their adult life.
Interviewer,You know uh having a different set of conversations cherishing a different kind of.
Michelle,Relationship i'm no longer just parenting i i'm guiding i'm counseling.
Interviewer,And it's just fun seeing how their minds work what they're afraid of it's even fun.
Michelle,Just peeking in and hearing them in their online classrooms it's like oh you.
Interviewer,Actually did your reading you have an opinion i like that like probably astounded by.
Michelle,Them and and i i read that um your husband was shocked by how much one of their.
Interviewer,Boyfriends ate oh yeah we're speaking of food yes we had uh.
Michelle,The the pleasure of having malia's boyfriend with us for part of the time last year because he was graduating and.
Interviewer,Was afraid to go home and miss an internship so we housed him we didn't grow up we did we didn't raise.
Michelle,Boys and so they eat a lot and sometimes we forget that he'd need.
Interviewer,To eat he'd need to eat often so we had to really adjust our shopping and our eating schedule the poor boy.
Michelle,Would be sitting around waiting for the next meal it's like we we weren't thinking about lunch so.
Interviewer,Yeah it's a whole different ball game and we just got a little taste of it.
Michelle,One of the things that i think people have found comfort in is your honesty and you posted a.
Interviewer,Photograph and and you wrote an open message really to everybody that's in which you said.
Michelle,I hope you all are allowing yourself to feel whatever it is you're feeling so i.
Interviewer,Wonder at the darkest points of your last year what what were you feeling.
Michelle,You know the darkest points were you know when we we when we felt bombarded by everything.
Interviewer,You know a virus that felt out of control with no real clear solution uh before us the.
Michelle,Country shut down racial un unrest visualizing the kind of injustice that.
Interviewer,Can happen on the streets seeing young people despair.
Michelle,At where this country was going i mean it was a it was a lot and it continues to be a lot.
Interviewer,Because we still haven't solved those problems so you know i i shared that because it was.
Michelle,The truth of how i was feeling it's hard to say oh i'm great i'm fine when deep down.
Interviewer,You know that's a lot to struggle with and i know that as an adult at least i have some perspective and context to.
Michelle,Bring to life most young people don't um and you want young people to stay.
Interviewer,Encouraged to feel okay about their down times but know that life is long.
Michelle,You want them to realize that there's a a brighter light at the end of the tunnel and to just.
Interviewer,Stay stay fast steadfast in your pursuit of coming out of that darkness you know so.
Michelle,If we don't share those emotions with our kids then they think those feelings that they have.
Interviewer,Are abnormal so we have to kind of learn to be open and honest about our down times.
Michelle,As well yeah talk about our lowest times yeah absolutely um as you mentioned in this last year we.
Interviewer,Watched george floyd call out for his mom we watched rihanna taylor's.
Michelle,Mom grieve her baby as a mom yourself how do you like how do you come to terms with all of that.
Interviewer,Yeah you you you don't come to terms with it but you do have to talk about it you.
Michelle,Have to you you have to sit down with your children and acknowledge the truth.
Interviewer,Of the world we live in um and we what i know is that you can't shy away from those discussions.
Michelle,Even if they're uncomfortable um or painful uh and i don't think if there's a.
Interviewer,There's an age where it's too soon to have those conversations now the conversation you.
Michelle,Have with a seven-year-old is very different with the conversation that you're going.
Interviewer,To have with a teenager but finding ways to help young people know that what they see and.
Michelle,Feel is real that they're not crazy that that that we still do struggle with race in.
Interviewer,This country um and that they can't take that in they have to know that that's not their.
Michelle,Problem to own uh so how i come to grips with it is to talk about it and to talk about it.
Interviewer,Often and to be ready to take on my kids pain and their questions and their concerns.
Michelle,And do it with as much truth and honesty as i can muster like i can't imagine how many moms and.
Interviewer,Their kids were sitting around kitchen tables having those conversations well and the truth is.
Michelle,Jenna this isn't new for minority families i mean these are the conversations that we.
Interviewer,Always have to have because you know when you're sending your child out into a world.
Michelle,Where people might fear them simply because of the color of their skin you have to prepare them early we don't.
Interviewer,We we've never had the luxury of not talking about these issues and now hopefully.
Michelle,The rest of the country the rest of the world understands that it's not enough for.
Interviewer,Us in minority communities to have those conversations if we're all not having them with our.
Michelle,Children yeah so this time maybe it feels like there's.
Interviewer,Real progress well we have to hold hold that that that hope up high because uh.
Michelle,You know we we have to continue to make progress you know you've got little ones growing up and i know you have a vision.
Interviewer,For the kind of world that you want your your children to walk into and it is one of fairness and justice.
Michelle,And equality and unity and we have to work for that it won't just happen.
Interviewer,Uh just because we want it now you know we have to sacrifice for it we have to use our voices to speak on and i think.
Michelle,That more people after this year uh are ready to do work yeah i think so too um i.
Interviewer,Remember talking with you i wonder if you'll remember this and talked about life in the white house although you.
Michelle,Didn't take a single moment for granted that there were moments of real loneliness.
Interviewer,And so i wonder when you watched meghan markle speak out the other night if what went.
Michelle,Through your mind um public service in uh is a it's a it's it's a bright sharp hot spotlight.
Interviewer,And most people don't understand it and nor should they um but you know there are ways to uh steal.
Michelle,Yourself and protect yourself but the thing that i always keep in mind.
Interviewer,Is that none of this is about us public service it's about the people that we serve.
Michelle,Um and especially in times like this you know i want the country to be focused on the the big issues that we face you know.
Interviewer,Creating jobs for people who don't have jobs you know feeding people who are going hungry.
Michelle,Making sure that people actually take the vaccine and understand the importance of continuing to protect.
Interviewer,Ourselves because we are not out of the woods on this issue yet so you know.
Michelle,I always try to push the light back out uh and focus it on the folks that we're actually here to serve.
Interviewer,You but what about when she talked about the fact that she experienced racism i mean i feel like that was.
Michelle,Heartbreaking to hear that she felt like she was in her own family.
Interviewer,You know her own family thought differently of her as i said before race isn't a new.
Michelle,Construct in this world for people of color you know um.
Interviewer,So it wasn't a complete surprise to sort of hear her her feelings and to have them articulated i think.
Michelle,The thing that i hope for and the thing i think about is that this first and foremost is a family and.
Interviewer,I pray for forgiveness and healing for them uh so that they can use this as a.
Michelle,Teachable moment for us all you know living in a world where there are.
Interviewer,There's a lot of interracial uh families and we've got to learn to live together and support each other and value each.
Michelle,Other i think we still have work to do uh to understand.
Interviewer,Where we all are coming from and that's gonna take time uh but it's it's got it's it's it.
Michelle,Requires effort and honesty to make that happen you all um the ex-president's club just got.
Interviewer,Back together y'all all got vaccinated yeah albeit virtually and it seemed like y'all were all in the same clinic.
Michelle,But you weren't uh do you feel like there's hope on the horizon yes yes it's it is here we have a.
Interviewer,Vaccine uh i have taken it and i would encourage everyone to take it when they have the.
Michelle,The chance to take it um i believe in science i take the flu shot.
Interviewer,Every year and knock on wood i don't get sick that often so i don't want people to be.
Michelle,Afraid of it um you know this is you know we are blessed to have.
Interviewer,People uh who are chemists and scientists and doctors who are doing the right thing but we.
Michelle,Have to do our part and if we do we are we will come out of this thing.
Interviewer,Uh it has happened before there have been pandemics in this world before and we've come out.
Michelle,On the other side with cooperation and consistency in our our behavior our.
Interviewer,Willingness to sacrifice for each other uh and and and getting the vaccine so.
Michelle,Yes i think we will come out on the other side of this thing whole uh and we'll be able to the country will.
Interviewer,Open back up and we will be able to sit in concerts together and.
Michelle,Have meals and restaurants i think we'll always be uh impacted by this time i don't think.
Interviewer,This this is something that we'll forget so there may be some changes afoot.
Michelle,As a result of this past year but we'll we'll learn from those changes we'll grow from them and will continue.
Interviewer,To build this great nation well now that you're vaccinated is there anything you're looking forward to or.
Michelle,Have you been able to hug your mom yet or do any of these things that i know you've been dreaming.
Interviewer,About she's first on the list but my mom is no joke about this she's still sort of like.
Michelle,I'm not sure if i'm ready to see you yet i was like okay ma all right so when when she's.
Interviewer,Ready that will be an epic hug yeah yeah but i understand she is.
Michelle,A senior citizen and she doesn't play she's not going to put herself in harm's way.
Interviewer,So but she's at the top of my list getting back to chicago our hometown and uh.
Michelle,And and giving my mom a hug or at least getting her out here if she'll come so so there's a lot to look forward to.
Interviewer,There sure is uh it's no secret that dr biden is a good friend of yours.
Michelle,Or what can you expect when y'all can get back together maybe a reunion at the white house.
Interviewer,You know buddy again yeah i stand ready and willing to support this first lady in any way that she needs um.
Michelle,You know this is a small club as as you very well know and few people know what this is like.
Interviewer,And i have told her that if there's anything i can do to help ease her transition or support.
Michelle,Her work i'm i'm ready to do that and i know that when they're ready for it they'll reach out and.
Interviewer,You know i'm looking forward to doing continuing the work of joining forces i know she's expressed interest in doing.
Michelle,More work with our military families and i hope to be able to support her in that but whatever she needs i'll be there for.
Interviewer,You recently said that you're on the way towards retirement which shocked me because i've traveled with you.
Michelle,And the amount of energy you have but that you couldn't wait to make fun of your husband's golf game and.
Interviewer,Was that is that serious i can't imagine that well you know it's sort of sort of serious.
Michelle,But as you know i mean we we are we've got a lot on our plate right now but you know we're we're at.
Interviewer,That age you know we're moving into our 60s my husband is 60 this year so.
Michelle,We're we will retire one day and if we're gonna do that in the way that we want to which is to have.
Interviewer,A legacy that we can pass on to the next generation then we've got to spend these next years.
Michelle,Really being thoughtful about that exit strategy because if you don't have an exit strategy.
Interviewer,Sometimes you just don't exit and they work forever i i don't want that um so.
Michelle,It's not imminent but it's it's we're closer to that than we are not and what do you.
Interviewer,Imagine you know i always see us continuing to work.
Michelle,And be supportive particularly of young people i mean that's gonna be at the core of the work of the.
Interviewer,Presidential uh foundation um you know there there will always be young people who.
Michelle,Will need some guidance and support and we stand ready to to help those young people.
Interviewer,Make their way towards their goals so i look forward to that so our our future involves young people.
Michelle,Always heard knitting but that that can right knitting do whatever you start you're later.
Interviewer,I became it's it's now known i mean probably because people are like michelle obama is knitting right.
Michelle,Well now i at the beginning of quarantine i thought okay we don't know how long.
Interviewer,We're going to be locked down let's get some paints and some puzzles and i just stocked up on stuff.
Michelle,And then i was like ah i should order some knitting needles i never knitted before.
Interviewer,So i got this basic kit and i made i learned the stitches then i made a scarf.
Michelle,Then i made a blanket then i just got hooked and then i got cats i just finished a sweater for.
Interviewer,Barack i mean wow really i really find it very meditative uh so.
Michelle,Let me not go on i'll sound a little crazy after no i think that's so cool right now so forgive me.
Interviewer,I like it i've seen a i've talked to have a father that's an artist too which i came out of nowhere so i get it.
Michelle,Um i got to sit down with you to talk about your book becoming which now is out for young adults which must.
Interviewer,Have been fun to to rewrite it well we didn't really um i worked with.
Michelle,The publishers and their young adult editors and we i i didn't want to rewrite it.
Interviewer,And and we had sort of looked at versions that sort of fundamentally changed chapters and i was.
Michelle,Like no that's not what the book is and that's not what the story is and it's hard to say what would you leave out.
Interviewer,So the book is basically the same it's a little shorter we condense some paragraphs to make them.
Michelle,More accessible we change words out that we're a little too you know an adult um but the core of the.
Interviewer,Book is essentially the same we added an introduction that's especially.
Michelle,Structured for our my young readers um added some more pictures that were a little more kid-friendly um kind.
Interviewer,Of the fun times in the white house and uh more my interactions with young people.
Michelle,And online there's actually a a study guide that um parents or book clubs or.
Interviewer,Teachers can use to help sort of walk young readers uh through the content because what i.
Michelle,Realize is that the young adults version of a book isn't just for kids it's yeah.
Interviewer,People who are where english is a second language or adult readers who are just learning so i didn't want to change the.
Michelle,Story fundamentally i wanted to be as honest and as real with this version of the book as we were.
Interviewer,With the original so well i think it's i feel like it's really appropriate too.
Michelle,Because you're going to be speaking you know writing directly to young women and men who are.
Interviewer,Becoming who are trying to figure out what it is they want to be exactly exact i mean the story truly my.
Michelle,Journey was told with young people in mind um you know sharing so much of my early.
Interviewer,Years my childhood was was really me tapping into the experiences that all kids are facing you know those.
Michelle,Insecurities those first failures and embarrassments the you know the.
Interviewer,You know the the first time you got into an argument with a friend your first kiss.
Michelle,All of that you know um those are important things to hold on to and i want kids to understand that now.
Interviewer,That those small moments that you think are nothing well those are the kernels um.
Michelle,In your story uh and i want young kids to start valuing that um because they're gonna they're gonna.
Interviewer,Be able to look back and point to some of those uh those small moments to say aha that's.
Michelle,That explains my feelings today or that gives me clarity.
Interviewer,On why i approach problem solving in this way you just never know it's the sights and the.
Michelle,Sounds and the smells of your childhood that stay with you i mean those are the things i draw on.
Interviewer,Those messages those images i still drawn at 57 years old um some of those.
Michelle,Memories are the memories that guide me they they they whisper in my ear as i approach the.
Interviewer,Work that i do even today um so yes i'm excited to hear what young people think about it what they're.
Michelle,Learning from it um i'm starting to have conversations with young people.
Interviewer,Uh and it's just you know it's just fascinating to hear how they see the world and i love to hear their.
Michelle,Voices and to encourage them to use them to get comfortable hearing their voices in in the out there in the world.
Interviewer,So uh i'm excited about it you know what speaking of i um i got a somebody emailed me and said.
Michelle,This happened 12 years ago this was in um maybe early december november somebody said this happened 12 years ago.
Interviewer,On this day and it was me as a young person showing your and my sister.
Michelle,Showing your really young people how to slide down the banister and i just thought like.
Interviewer,Wow that those are little memories that felt like even 12 years later something important.
Michelle,To me and they remember malia and sasha remember that time more than a lot of things that i would have.
Interviewer,Thought of because they saw those pictures too and we sat and had an entire dinner.
Michelle,About those first days and uh how they just cherished you know these two young beautiful women who had done what.
Interviewer,They were doing who had taken time out of their lives because it was very clear you guys were.
Michelle,Excited to do it you can't you came in from where wherever you were especially.
Interviewer,To meet with them and they knew that and it made a difference in in their entire experience so.
Michelle,You should do you feel like that that america that small gesture but you know.
Interviewer,People may be from different political parties girl you know girls showing girls like that we're getting closer.
Michelle,Back to that america how our leaders act in the world sets the tone um you you know that.
Interviewer,I know that we all know that i mean people follow the lead um and i i think that we.
Michelle,As a country are going to look for different kind of leadership because it just feels better it's just a.
Interviewer,Better way to live in the world um it's it's it's better when we're kind and we're.
Michelle,Generous to one another it feels good inside i am praying.
Interviewer,That we are going to get back to that um but again it's going to take all of us telling ourselves.
Michelle,This is really what we want uh because it's not just how we vote but it's how we act every day towards each other and.
Interviewer,Those are the choices that we make every day in the gas station line at the bus stop.
