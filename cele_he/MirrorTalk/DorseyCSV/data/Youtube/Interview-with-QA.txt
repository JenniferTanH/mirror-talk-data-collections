so the format for today will be I'm

gonna be doing a short interview with

mr. Dorsey before we then open it up to

your questions from the floor

so my first question is one that I asked

you just ten minutes ago before I

realized I don't want you to answer what

is the best thing about your job

probably the best thing about my job is

just being able to see like the feeling

you get when you are when you help

create something and you actually see

people interact with it and you see

people use it whether it be you know in

my case a program or a piece of hardware

or art when you actually see it on

someone else's face and you and you see

that interaction it's just uh it feels

electric so being able to to see people

use our technologies and and to see our

customers has been really something my

favorite is always when my my mom

independently discovers something that I

didn't have to tell her about and and

there are two moments when the first

thing is my parents were some of the

first people on Twitter and we started

with SMS and my mom thought it was the

it was the way to contact me and my

family like she thought Twitter was SMS

and she thought it was a private channel

so she would and you can now search back

to all of her first tweets and it's at

Marsha Dorsey you can search back to all

of her first tweets and she was actually

like yelling at my brothers and Jack

when he coming home and all these other

things and then she realized oh wait a

minute this is public and then the

second time with with square is she her

favorite coffee store and st. Louis

Missouri some coffee started using us

and she she went in and she she texted

me she's like Jaka

you know my favorite coffee store just

started using square and like I love

when people just happen upon it rather

than having to direct from my head go

look at what I made go look at what they

did especially you know someone someone

like my mom so it's always uh that's

probably the best part of the day is

seeing how people seeing how people use

it okay and with regards to kind of your

early career I read somewhere that one

of the main inspirations for Twitter was

um

taxi systems and how they have very

short you know messages to convey where

they are is that true yeah yeah I really

missed the boat on creating goober but I

was a huge huge into dispatch and the

reason why is and playing again back to

my parents my parents I'm from st. Louis

Missouri st. Louis Missouri how many of

you have been there st. Louis so st.

Louis has has had a has had a tough

history and so in the 40s 50s and 60s a

lot of people left the city and moved

out to the suburbs and my parents are

always stood by the city and the

metropolitan area is about 4 million

people and the city has dwindled down to

about 350,000 people and it's extremely

segregated North and South lines its

highest highest homicide per capita in

the country we switch with Detroit and

DC does those three usually but my

parents they grew up in the city they

loved the city and you know for me it

developed this obsession and fascination

with cities as well and the way that

really manifested for me for maps I was

just obsessed with with maps and I would

get lost and I'm constantly just

wondering what was happening at this

particular intersection or what was you

know down the street whatnot and I had

tons of maps of st. Louis and tons of

maps of my other favorite city they had

never been to which is New York City my

parents also had a police scanner always

in a CB radio so we lived right next to

the highway and

I would always listen to the trucks and

the and the police and fire trucks and

the ambulances and eventually my parents

got a IBM PC jr. and a Macintosh and I

would actually take the information from

the police scanner and plot it out on my

paper maps I could actually watch the

police cars move because there is

reporting where they are and where

they're going or what they're doing but

little by little the computer became

this thing that was uh was amazing

because they could actually build a map

on it and I can make those I could put

dots on that map and I can make those

dots move and I taught myself just

enough programming to make that happen

and and that's always been my approach

in my life as I've never really had a

desire to become an engineer I never had

a desire to become a CEO or start a

company or be an entrepreneur I learned

whatever it took to move me to the next

step to unblock whatever I wanted to do

and for me I wanted to see the city in

any way and the computer was was the way

to get there so taught myself had a

program in C and eventually I had these

maps of police cars and ambulances that

were riding around st. Louis all from

the police scanner and then I little by

little found public databases that were

accessible on the Internet of of

historical movements that I could

program in and then I learned to when I

was about 17 or 18 that this whole thing

I was doing had a name and it was called

dispatch so I found the biggest ditz

dispatch firm in the world which just

happened to be in New York City and it

was called DMS and I found I found their

website but they had no contact

information no way to get in so I was

pretty good at computers at this time

and st. Louis had a pretty strong

underground hacking culture and I

learned a lot from it and I figured out

a hole in their website and I found

their corporate email list and

found the name of the CEO and the email

of the CEO and the chairman and they

sent too many mails saying your website

has a hole in it here's how you fix it

and by the way I write dispatch software

and they flew me out and I I joined EMS

and suddenly I was working on dispatch

for all of New York City which was

amazing because the thing about dispatch

for me is you could actually see how the

city is working living breathing how it

moves but unfortunately in that case was

from a very vertical standpoint in terms

of city services and and Twitter really

was born out of a desire to see it from

a personal level if if an individual

could report what they're doing and

where they're going and what they're

doing next and we could see that all in

real time what would that look like and

so yeah in my my uh what's my

fascination and and career really

started in dispatch was just high

transactional always available low

latency systems over deep deep deep deep

and in the background in many places

that people just didn't consider Asiya

and with regards to Twitter when you set

it up alongside you know the other

co-founders did you have any idea where

did he want it to get where do you think

it might go were you hoping it would end

up we are I mean we didn't really have

any any idea and and that's not why we

were building it we were building it

because we wanted to it was it was fun

and and it was something that we we

wanted to see and I had my dispatch

background and I've had a blogging

background and biz joined up at blogger

for a little while when he was at Google

and we all somehow ended up at OU do

have joined oh do and became CEO I

joined about two months after that and

then biz joins two months after that and

the funny thing about that was no one

there really cared about what we were

building which was podcast

and we just had no passion for it and

that the business was not doing well the

direction was was fairly weak so we we

often went out and just thought about

you know what what would we do and what

would we want to work on and we had

these these hack days where we would

actually try to implement some of these

ideas and and Twitter was born out of

born out or one of those but the

important thing about this we just had

this amazing team but the wrong initial

idea and when you have amazing people

and really creative people you'll come

up with something and and and really the

desire was just to build something that

we wanted to use on a on a daily basis

and it resonated with us every day and

and we were fortunate and that it

resonated with others too but there was

no particular design or desire or goal

around its success and I think it's very

hard to start with that as a as a

barrier because it it ends up blocking

the creativity ultimately from mine

stunning you went to college for a

little bit then dropped out obviously to

pursue your other girls did your time at

college have any impact on the where you

are today or was it just something that

got in the way of your real passion I

think everyone learns in a different way

and I was I was deciding because of this

fascinates from City Heights cities I

also had a fascination with with leaders

of cities and and mayors and I was

deciding actually when I was entering in

University should I go with a political

science program or should I go with the

computer science program I know most

people don't compare the two but I did

and I decided ultimately go down the

computer science route because I imagine

that if I went down political science

and I went down the route of of trying

to be a Marin to get into politics that

I could write a law or a rule and I

could probably see the effects of it

within two to four to maybe eight years

whereas I could write rules and laws

in a program and model it and see it

within see the result of it within eight

seconds so the speed was quite

attractive and and just this unbounded

creativity and potential that's in front

of you when you when you program it's

it's a weird feeling because um you you

have this ability to just create

something from absolutely nothing and

whatever you imagine you you can you can

probably do and there's a real there's a

real electricity to that so in school I

found that it was more driven towards an

academic outcome than it was a practical

outcome in my particular program so I

was learning a lot more I was at DMS

when I was at NYU I was learning a lot

more and moving faster than outside of

the university then I was inside so I

just decided that I'm going to I'm going

to and the University part and just work

on that on the external and get working

on on what I want to build right away

and I you know my my mom reminds me

every week that I'd still have an

opportunity to go back to school but I'm

learning a lot right now and I think

it's a different answer for every single

every single person and you have to

answer it only for yourself on that kind

of point was it a really tough decision

so you mentioned your mom and not

necessarily I don't know she still wants

you to go back to University and was

there a lot of pressure from your

parents when taking that decision or do

you just go ahead and I'm more or less

just went ahead and did it but they they

were not happy about I mean they come

from a Catholic upbringing in st. Louis

Missouri so my parents didn't finish

high school and I was the first to even

attempt going to college parents weren't

all that well off so you know they

definitely had a lot of aspirations for

me in that particular vein so there was

you know there's a lot of

standard Catholic guilt they couldn't

went along with that decision but I got

over it and I don't know if my parents

have and and he talked a little bit

about politics as well and I read

somewhere that your dream job was to be

mayor of New York City

well aspirationally it was but I've

realized that I feel like can probably

influence more with with these companies

and I then I could actually being a

mayor and I think that's generally been

more and more the case these groups of

individuals who are creating these

technologies and creating these

movements and have just so much

influence right now and it's not limited

to any particular geographic or

political boundary and it's really it's

really really exciting in that and that

comes with a responsibility that forces

you to mature very very quickly and

again it goes back to like where are you

learning the fastest and I just felt my

my maturity and going down one

particular route of life was was so much

more accelerated than than another one

and I think going down the political

route and more of a mayor route I still

love I I just don't think I'd be able to

do as much as I like and I I love my I

love my freedoms and my my independence

that would also be cut off so yes yeah

coming back to the companies you're

involved with both with Twitter still as

well as you'll see a square how do you

balance that is there ever a conflict of

interest or just in terms of tying me

how do you decide where the priorities

are well I am I spent a year where I'd

actually did half and half and the

intention was just to keep that to a

year and kept it to a year and that was

really hard I started the week at square

and on Monday and I would go to Twitter

in the afternoon and then I would start

Tuesday at Twitter and then there would

go to square and that

Junoon so i'd have this like snake

through that felt like these you know

24-hour days at one company so i made it

i made it work but it wasn't it wasn't

the healthiest thing and now we we just

have such an amazing leadership team in

place and and the potential is really in

front of the company so I concentrate my

time a lot more now on with our CEO dick

so we have dinner every every Tuesday

night same restaurant same table usually

the same food never the same

conversation which is always a good

thing and then the food is good what is

it it's a restaurant called Zuni yeah I

probably should not have given that name

out but I did probably gonna have to

find a new place now I'm sorry no that's

my fault so I yeah and then I I just

meet with members of the management team

on Tuesday so I think there's actually a

lot of parallels between the two

companies I think they're both working

on something fundamental something

essential to a civilization and to

humanity Twitter obviously working on

communication and square working on

Commerce both have been with us forever

we commerce I believe actually was it

was a predecessor we were trading goods

and services before we're using language

to trade stories and what's what's

inching to me about both is if you if

you simplify either one of them there's

so much that's built on top of each that

actually benefit and get easier for

people and get better for people so I'd

rather spend all of my time and my

effort focused on the the lowest layer

of of what we have to deal with on a

daily basis and I can't think of of

anything more fundamental than

communication and commerce apart from

health and education and obviously

governance so I think all of those are

on the

I would always I would always choose to

work in some dimension and in

simplifying those and so I see a lot of

parallels between the two companies in

that sense and that their fundamental

and I also see that they both they both

stand for a very clear purpose and they

both stand for a leveling of the playing

field what was most amazing about

Twitter was that we we designed it for

for SMS so anyone in the world that had

access to you know just a shared or a

five dollar cellphone could actually

have a conversation with the entire

world and you know someone with a with a

five dollar Nokia could actually have a

conversation with someone the $900 iPad

and we see that almost every single day

and it really makes the world feel small

and we have we have some of the you know

these really powerful individuals using

the service and then we have we have the

largest governments in the world using

the service so you know they're both the

important thing is they're both using

the same tool and that means you know

you're only limited by the are the

quality and the influence of of your

idea and and your ambition ultimately

and it can scale back and forth quite

quickly and we see the same thing with

Square where we have we have people who

are piano teachers or golf instructors

or doing something on the side using the

exact same tool that we supply to to

Starbucks and you know glow and and to

Whole Foods and if we can handle the

transactional capacity of a Starbucks

that means that anyone who has that

aspiration in the same way that Howard

did could also use us to get there and

and that means that because it's the

same tool it truly loves Lovis a playing

field my mother my mother owned a coffee

store when I was uh when I was 12 and

you know she had a very very different

ambition than Howard Schultz her

ambition was to provide a venue for the

neighborhood to provide a sense of

community in the neighborhood to sell

beans

but tell me have three employees and

those three employees happen to be me

and my two younger brothers and she

didn't want to have multiple locations

she don't want to grow beyond that and I

find that to be very admirable and I

think there's a there's generally a

trend today where more and more

companies and more and more groups of

people can actually choose to stay small

and still have massive impact whether

it's a deep impact like my mother in a

community or a global impact like teams

of six who can actually create something

and and really everyone around the world

can can participate in and then use it

Howard Schultz had a very different

ambition which is he had a similar

coffee store and he wanted that coffee

store in every city around the world and

I admire both approaches but it's a

difference in an ambition and and what

they want to do and I believe that

fundamentally the tools should remain

consistent and and really get out of the

way so that people can can meet that

okay just so you kind of continue on

that so you talked a little bit about

how Twitter is a great leveler and

indeed you can make it happen that

they've been amazing things happening on

Twitter and Twitter being useful things

like the Arab Spring the uprising

coordinating the protest and then more

recently there's been a lot of focus on

Twitter trolls and some some of the

negative abuse that can happen on

Twitter do you see the company is having

a social responsibility to promote a

certain view or promote certain ideals

or is it very much as you said just a

tool to allow people to interact I mean

I think the main purpose of Twitter is

to make sure that we let every voice

flow and I think it's really important

for us to see every opinion and I think

ultimately like every technology is just

a reflection of of the world and what we

want in civilization both the present

and the future State so what we we have

to make sure of though is that everyone

who participates in lending their voice

to Twitter and using Twitter to amplify

that voice they feel safe doing so and

you know abuse has has no has no part on

on the service and we have a staff of

many that are dedicated to making sure

that people feel safe and they can

continue to trust the brand and the

service to make sure that their voices

is heard everywhere in a way they want

to be heard and also that they don't

feel threatened in any way but you know

I I wanna I want to live in though I

want to live in a world where I can

actually see all opinions because I

think I think there's there's value in

every opinion it's up to me to decide

which one is truly valuable on which

ones or which ones I act on but if we

were to take that away and and live and

very very sheltered ways I think we

would we would take away a massive

learning opportunity as well so I think

the most important thing is to give

people controls you turn it off you turn

it on and I think as long as those and

those controls are intuitive and people

know how to use them immediately

people people feel great and trust and

trust the service and and when that

fails or when it's confusing or when

people are frustrated we've failed as a

company as well okay my final question

on Twitter before we move on to square

so then based on that do you have a

problem with things like ISIL using

Twitter to promote the latest their

video do you see that as being something

that maybe Twitter should draw a line on

and you know close the site close that

particular account down or do you feel

that it would get a lot of retweets is

it something that people deserve to hear

about I think it goes again back to the

controls and I think um I think people

should have the freedom to choose what

they what they see and what they choose

not to I don't think it should be forced

upon them I don't think it should be you

know an unexpected surprise in any way

I think they fully have to opt into it

but the more we start adding bias or

editorial to the service the less people

all over the world trusted and I

think that that trust is something that

we've really worked hard to earn and and

we'll continue to do more of that and be

very transparent around those policies I

mean I think the most important thing is

is to explain why something like that

may still be on the service and and to

also work with our peers to make sure

that we have a consistent point of view

around that but this is a reflection of

the world today and this is happening

and I would rather live in a world where

at least we're having a conversation

about it and we and we're talking about

it because I think ultimately it allows

us to move faster and in solving it and

fixing it and addressing it if that's

what we need to do okay

now moving on you left Witter or I mean

you left a CEO and most people would

have said that you know creating and

founding one life-changing business is

enough but you moved on to set up square

which has just been launched in the UK

yesterday was it launched around the

world yesterday around the world yes not

sure our cash register product around

the world for free yesterday so those of

people people in the audience who might

not necessarily know that a huge amount

about square do you want to very briefly

explain what it is that you do what's

your vision for the business yeah so

five how many of you have have seen

square good amount we have a lot of work

to do

but we have a lot of work to do with

Twitter tear so I mean that that's one

of the reasons why you you keep keep

working at this as a if it feels over

just I don't think it's it's truly as

big as it as it could be so I think so

five years ago I switched roles with my

co-founder eV and he was chairman and

our CEO and I became chairman he became

CEO and I reconnected with my second

boss after my mother at the coffee store

which is a guy named Jim McKelvey in San

Louis Missouri and he became a glass

artist and we we really loved working

together when I was about 15 16 years

old and he was an engineer as well

and we were talking about you know just

wanting to work together again and we

didn't really know on what and then one

day he called me in desperation and said

I lost I lost I lost the sale of my

glass art and he says you know two

thousand dollar pieces of glass art and

the reason he lost that cell is because

he couldn't accept a credit card and the

funny thing was we were both talking to

each other on an iPhone so we have these

like effectively super computers next to

our ears and the guy can't close the

sale because he can't accept a credit

card so why why is that and and we

started asking why and we started

realizing while this industry is

extremely complicated so it seemed like

a very interesting challenge can we

build something that allows Jim to

accept a credit card and we we set aside

a month to build it and we knew nothing

about the credit card industry both of

us were actually in credit card debt at

the time we you know we we saw what the

credit card industry actually did to st.

Louis and families in st. Louis we

didn't really like the credit card

industry in many ways we didn't think it

was fair but we recognized that buyers

were using them all the time and in the

United States and all these independent

sellers and and the smaller folks really

just had no opportunity to even accept

them so what it meant is they they

ultimately missed a sale and they they

missed an opportunity to grow or

opportunity for revenue and so we we

searched on Google for how to accept

credit cards we found rock-bottom

merchant accounts calm we signed up for

rock-bottom merchant accounts calm and

we started learning about well how do we

actually accept the credit card do we

take a picture with the phone no that

seems like a weird experience if I'm

handing over my credit card and you're

taking a picture of it we looked at the

30 pin on the bottom of the iPhone and

turns out that has a huge license fee

and we just didn't want to pay that

and and then the interesting thing was

uh all these phones have a headphone

jack on it and the headphone jack is

also a microphone and if you probably

not for a lot of your cards but if you

take out your credit card and you look

on the back there's a magnetic strip and

that made magnetic strip is actually the

same technology that you would use in a

cassette tape to play music in fact that

is an audio track and that audio track

can be decoded into numbers and those

numbers are your credit card number and

your expiration and if you actually play

this audio track it sounds like a

squirrel screeching like I don't know if

you've heard a squirrel screaming but

it's not a it's not a pleasant sound at

all

but if you if you swipe it through you

actually hear that sound and you can

write some software to decode that into

a number and then you can send that

number up to Visa and MasterCard you can

check to see if there's funds available

on it and if there are you capture them

and then that goes into a bank account

so we ultimately made a cassette tape

reader that plugged into the microphone

jack of the iPhone and we swiped the

cards through and that and the damn

thing worked and and we swiped this is

my favorite company to pitch ever

because I would go around to people and

I would say do you want to see my new my

new project and they would say yeah and

I would say and give me your credit card

and and they would say no I said well he

and I can see what I'm working on and

and then they would hand it over and I

would take anywhere from five to five

hundred dollars

or take $500 for the from the people who

gave me like black Amex doesn't what not

so and and the way we we pitched it to

TV sees when we actually decided to

build a company and raise money was to

see the pitch they would have to give me

their credit card as well and we we did

something interesting I put all the B

C's that I didn't want to work with in

the first week and I met ten during the

first week and all the VCS that I really

wanted to work with in the second week

and and the reason why is I wanted to

make all my mistakes in the first week

and then just nail it in the second week

in the last the last we see that we Matt

is the one I wanted to work with most

which which was Vinod Khosla of Khosla

Ventures and the price started very high

with a hundred dollars and it went down

to $1.00 with Vinod but it was um it was

just uh there's a lot of fun we learned

so much about the credit card industry

and risk and fraud and we knew nothing

about building hardware and we we

learned everything that we needed to to

make it work in a month and it just

started resonating with with everyone we

showed and and little by little we

figured out how to actually build the

readers and send them out for free and

and then a funny thing happened in that

we realized hey we weren't just building

a credit card terminal but actually were

building a full point-of-sale and these

points of sales around the world and

it's a there's a reason that the acronym

is POS they are not the best systems in

the world and people don't have a hold

you know very high regard for for a

point of sale it's usually a effectively

a calculator on on top of a cash box but

what's what's interesting in the

opportunity is that there's all this

potential data and insights that you can

have around a business you can actually

bring back up to the seller to help them

make better decisions around how to grow

their business and some people decide I

don't want to grow my business I'm happy

like my mom with what I have but a lot

of people do want to grow the business

and they

just no access to any analytics around

how they're doing most places that we

that we found in America like coffee

places you go in and you ask them a very

simple question how many cappuccinos did

you sell today and they'll have no idea

and if they do know they were usually

counting cups coming out of the

dishwasher or waiting for you know their

paper cup inventory to diminish and it

just seemed so simple to solve but no

one's spent the time to do it so we

ultimately have been working on for the

past five years a really sophisticated

register that is in many ways on par or

better with what a Walmart has in terms

of running and understanding their

business and we give it away for free

to all these sellers and that's what we

we launched yesterday and made available

to the whole world so anyone around the

world can download this piece of

software for their Android or their or

their iPhone and and really see and

understand their business and and you

know hopefully hopefully grow that

business from it because we just believe

so much in the power of the independent

business and the small business to to

drive the global economy do you see this

being particular focus you talked a lot

about for example coffee shops in

America but off the top of my head I can

just think of for example in India we

it's a place where there are there

aren't that many huge supermarket chains

and loads of small businesses and

nowadays there are so many smartphones

out there do you see this has been

particularly helpful in places like the

developing world or it's not really

something that you know yeah I mean I

think it's less about we're definitely

seen as a as a mobile payments company

and mobile payments is one of those

phrases that just means kind of

everything and and therefore it means

nothing and and I think ultimately what

it's about is is around commerce which

is a very very simple activity it's a

exchange between a buyer and a seller

and it has nothing to do with the

payment device that's used to do that it

could be a barter it could be a digital

currency it could be a credit card it

could be it could be a paper currency

but what's important is really

accounting for that transaction that

exchanger buyer because if you can

account for

you can learn from it and then you can

grow so I think that applies in in every

every market not just not just a market

like the United States or in Europe but

but everywhere because I think everyone

can make use of of insights and and the

Stata and if they have access to it in

an easy way where they can just flip it

on and Wow

like I you know why am I getting all

these sales at 3:40 p.m. and what if I

open you know an hour

what if I stay open an hour later for

the next two weeks what does that

actually do to my to my business turns

out and increases my business by 20%

we've had we've had sellers you know

look at that and and and and actually

perform those action so now our job is

to answer that question and direct them

in that way before they even ask the

question right and and that's a that's

really exciting and and then we can also

build pretty interesting services like

we we have we've we launched a service

called square capital six months ago and

what it does is we have this deep

because we're building the register our

merchants these companies are putting

their full inventory their full menu a

list of all their employees their full

business all their sales into this one

system so we have this really deep

understanding of how they're doing right

we know their industry we know we know a

lot about where that industry is going

so what we can do is after after a few a

few months of them just using the

register which is free to download and

free to use we can actually send them an

email saying you know here are three

options were we're happy to announce

that you know we we can extend you

advance you capital and from these three

options it could be a thousand dollars

it could be five thousand dollars it

could be ten thousand dollars would you

like to you know get this advance of

capital here's the price it's all fair

it's all upfront you know exactly what

you're paying for the capital and you

can choose one of those and it goes into

your bank account the very next business

morning and typically you have to go to

a bank and get

small business loan and that processes

six months to even a year in some cases

and the way that this advance is paid is

is paid and returned is actually just by

swiping their customers card a fee is

extracted so just in the course of doing

their business they're actually paying

that advance back and and we've lent and

we've advanced over seventy five million

dollars in just six months to 15

thousand sellers and 85% of sellers who

have taken in vance once take another

one so there's an opportunity not just

to build something that accepts a

payment not just to build something that

allows you to see your business but

actually can give businesses capital to

grow their business in a very fair and

up front and in a very rich rich way

okay my final question before we open it

up to the audience how do you see square

working with things like Apple pay the

introduction of NFC chips and phones or

is it a competitor and things that even

like Bitcoin I guess yeah I think our

philosophy has always been you know

we're building this register right and

we need to empower our sellers to accept

every form of payment that comes across

the counter and whether that's cash

cheque EMV NFC Bitcoin any other digital

currency that comes their way our

sellers should never have to think about

that they should always think about

making only think about making the sale

and buyers should just have the the

freedom to use whatever they want to use

so if they want to use Bitcoin they

should be able to use Bitcoin and they

should not the seller should not have to

think about what currency or what

payment method they're they're using so

we we started in the US we opened in

Canada and Japan and NFC has just never

been large in those in those markets and

I know that it seems counter to what you

all experience because NFC is is growing

quite quickly in the rest of the world

but I always found the u.s. is really

behind and technology adoption Masek

adoption like even with Twitter it took

us 10 years to really adopt SMS and mass

you all had it for 10 years prior to to

the United States and and we didn't

really get it until 2005-2006 and the

reason why is it was the first time when

you could send a message between the two

largest carriers a text message between

two large cares which were Verizon and

singular because they both had different

technologies SMS as you know as a g8 GSM

technology and Verizon is CDMA so we we

never really invested in building an NFC

reader because we're in markets that had

no buyer adoption whatsoever of NFC so

Apple could change that but what they've

done is they've created a convenience

which is a chip that proxies a physical

card and allows it to be read by an NFC

terminal so we we certainly don't see it

as as competition in any way because

we're not building a phone and we're not

building a payment payment device we're

building a register that accepts

payments and and what that means is we

need to build NFC terminal that that

accepts it and back to that philosophy

of of making sure that ourselves can

accept every form payment it's something

we have to do we have a we have a

product called square market that allows

anyone who's using the register to flip

a switch on any of the items in the

register and it builds a web page for

them that they can tweet out or put on

Facebook or put it on their own their

web page and people can actually buyers

can actually use Bitcoin to pay with

that so if if they've turned on the the

ecommerce ID for any of those items

bitcoin is an option for a buyer and we

get a small amount of orders from that

but it was important for us to make sure

that we're we're constantly testing

testing these new technologies and and

you know our sellers are paying us to do

that work and to be ahead of it

brilliant so that's it from me I'm now

gonna move on to some questions from the

audience hi why 140 characters

it's a great question so there's two

reasons one practical and one conceptual

so the practical one first is that we we

originally focused on SMS and and the

web was really just a way to kind of

archive and and see the tweets later on

the web was really not a big part of the

original vision because we wanted

something Noah's there was real time in

life and you could actually feel and and

it would buzz your pocket right you

could actually physically feel it so the

other thing that was really important to

us in working with SMS was making sure

that we had a very simple approach and

simple experience and that simplicity

met in that case that we would send one

message that a message would not break

up and there was a limitation in SMS at

the time which was a hundred and sixty

characters so I had a really really

cheap little Nokia device and I loved

the thing it was from a virgin and

there's a prepaid phone and I wanted to

make sure that it worked on this thing

and I had a great experience on it and

you know that was a t9 keyboard and a

lot of you probably haven't used the t9

keyboards but I used them and I loved

them is super fast and so we we took

those 160 characters and you know I also

paid for every text message so we didn't

want to we don't want to break it up and

and and require you know to receive a

text message to get charged twice for

one for one tweet this was important to

me but it was also important to if we

wanted to go around the world we could

actually reach everyone in a in a

cost-effective way as well so the 160

characters we took 20 characters out for

the username and we arrived at 140 and

that was that but the conceptual side of

it was we believed that you know this

constraint inspires a creativity and if

we really constrain the size of the

canvas

people might be more off-the-cuff and

they might be more in the moment and

that's really what we wanted because we

wanted this to feel again very live and

just very very human and very of the

moment and and the metaphor you know we

use is like if I were to give you a red

paintbrush and this huge canvas that

that just took up this entire wall and I

asked you to go paint that canvas you

compose yourself naturally right because

this is a huge canvas and you want to

you you want to you want to do the right

thing you know that that's what it kind

of goes through your mind but if I were

to give you that same paintbrush and

that same red paint and I'd give you a

business card and I say make a mark just

very quick to make the mark and and

that's kind of the feeling we wanted was

that everything you everything you write

everything you tweet is a value to

someone and we wanted to make sure that

it feels like you can just fire these

things off very very quickly as if you

were you're speaking and and and someone

the interpreter is going to devalue it

and that's always been really important

to us and you know in the in the early

days of the service we we got a lot of

we got a lot of heat for 140 characters

and just how useless Twitter was right

and and people would would explain in a

way that wow this is just a since it's

only only 140 characters you know all

people are gonna end up doing is just

talk about what they have for breakfast

and we would share that so much like

theirs and Twitter is just about what

you have for breakfast and you know my

answer to that is well you know

sometimes I do tweet about what I have

for breakfast and most of the world

could care less and was probably

offended because it's so not valuable to

them but there was one person in the

world that really cares and that's my

mom and when she gets the tweet that I

just stayed breakfast and one day for

breakfast and she's really happy because

she knows that I'm still eating I'm

alive and yeah and I had breakfast and

she loves it so what I mean what's in

thing about that is it's all up to who

receives a message and who interprets

the message and we can't we can't judge

the value as it goes out we you know we

have to leave it up to the individual to

really bring value to that message into

that tweet and that's always been an

important part of our philosophy Thanks

what are some of the key lessons from

your time at Twitter which helped and

influenced the way you set up and

launched swear there were many I you

know again I really had no aspiration to

be a CEO or to be a leader in the

company or even create a company I just

wanted I wanted to to build and use this

thing and I was so excited about that

and and and really you just learn

whatever you have to you learn whatever

you have to learn to make that work and

and right now a company is just a great

vehicle to spread an idea around the

world and it allows an idea to to thrive

but the idea and the purpose of our work

always leads not not the company the

company is support and that and the

businesses is oxygen not a to that idea

so I think you when when you are tasked

with then creating a company you kind of

want to you you you tend to or at least

I did you grow up a little bit too fast

sometimes and you try to put too much

structure in place or the wrong

structure in place and that distracts

you from you know really the work that

you absolutely need to do and one of the

interesting thing I did two big lessons

from from that time number one was the

power of instrumentation the power of

knowing exactly what's happening within

the system and the power of transparency

within the system but also within the

company so we would go down a lot in the

early days of the company because we

just had no instrumentation at all

it's like driving the car flying a plane

and not having any sense of how fast

you're going

right it's extremely dangerous so we we

just didn't know what people were doing

with it

how how the resources were being used

and and ultimately it just crashed to a

halt multiple times and little by little

we started instrumenting the system and

we we built simple things that would

tell us what the system is doing or how

people are using it and these seem like

of course you build dashboards and of

course you you know you look at the data

but you know in the in a moment when

you're creating these things that's not

what you put first it's it's often an

afterthought and the biggest thing that

that solved was we stop speculating

about what was going on and we could

actually point to what was going on and

then since we could point to it we could

fix it and we had a ton of communication

issues in the company at that time just

that we wouldn't talk to each other for

in some cases and and in like

engineering sometimes we want to talk to

operations and when you have those

divisions in the in the company the

people using the service actually see

the results of it right so any

organizational difficulty actually

manifests in the service itself and

that's just ultimately rude and selfish

and you're putting your own your own

mess in front of the people that are

using your service or the customer so as

we started instrumenting the system we

had a lot healthier communication this

is a funny thing because we're building

a communication company and we couldn't

communicate internally so that was

number one and the first bit of code I

wrote for square was an admin dashboard

so we could actually see everything

that's happening constantly and then

number two is just how important it is

to to really make sure that you're

building the right team dynamic and and

that means hiring great people who share

your you know who share the purpose and

share the vision but it also means that

we're parting ways with people who who

don't and and we had some people in the

is a Twitter who were just you know not

not not not folks who really worked well

together with others and and this was

probably the hardest thing for me to do

as a CEO in the early days I had to I to

fire someone who had the entire system

in their head and when you're faced with

that you're like well I can't I can't

fire this person because if I fire this

person then the whole system is going

down and we can never get it back up and

it took me a long time to do it about

six months and that's you know a regret

actually but ultimately when I when I

did it and I did it and you know when I

when I was when I was when we were

parting ways I was crying and he was

crying and then I went back to tell the

company and we're only about seven

people and I was crying and the company

was crying and like it was at a very

emotional period because we were also

under a lot of stress because we're

constantly going down and now we just

parted ways with the guy who knew how to

bring the system back up but something

really interesting happened immediately

after that all these new leaders and the

company emerged and actually we didn't

go down and and we built we built a lot

of great practices to stay up more and

more so I think when you're just getting

started whether it's a company or

organization you try to get people

really quickly but you don't you don't

edit as much and you don't really make

sure that there's a great team dynamic

and if you don't it can be really really

poisonous to the culture and and

ultimately will will block new ideas and

new leadership from from emerging so

constantly looking at the team and

making sure that we have the right team

in place is something I applied to

square as well hi my name is Christian R

once and thank you for coming to Oxford

today my question to you is what do you

think more people in your position

within the tech industry can do to

encourage women in tech so in your case

you've invested in peak and you've also

AM set up a female coding program at

square what do you think others in your

position can do to follow suit well I

mean I think

I think doing it I I don't I don't think

it's just women in tech but really

established establishing more leadership

in in our in our women and I'm really

proud to say that like over over 54% of

squares led by by women on my team so

our CFO our head of business and our

head of engineering are all women

leaders and they you know I think the

most important thing is to always

establish a role model for who you're

who you're really looking to become in

terms of your own leadership aspirations

and and your own aspirations around

impact so making sure that we're we're

really hiring for that and and we're

hiring really great people to put them

in those positions of leadership and

we're and we're establishing that in the

company as a majority of the company not

a minority of the company is really

critical and and then and then talking

about it all the time this is this is

what we've done and and we're really

proud of it and we're doing more and

this is what that looks like and we've

invested a lot of time and effort and

resources into programs like girls who

code who does an intensive seven-week

program teaching girls how to engineer

and program and we have our own program

called code camp which we do three four

day intensive for college girls and also

high school women as well so I think

it's you know just just doing it and

making the time investing in it and and

setting the intent and and you know

making sure the whole company knows that

this is our intent and this is something

that we believe in it'll just spread

because everyone in the company will

constantly talk about it as well and

that'll spread around around the

industry so we try to talk about it

in in there's many ways and channels as

we can with square you seem to have got

lots of funding on board and it seemed

sort of from the face of it that you're

very much in charge still in my

experience that's quite hard small

startup but big funds on board how do

you go about attracting funding and then

managing your investors after you've

secured it I think the the thing that's

always worked for me is realizing that

your your investors are first and

foremost I always want to go to anyone

that I want to work with with something

to show and it was really important to

us before we talked to any investors on

the Twitter side that we actually had

people using the service and in in in

some at some scale and on the square

side that we actually had a working

prototype square we had really seven

merchants when we actually went to raise

money but we had a working prototype

that people are actually using and if

people can't see it and feel it's very

very hard to sell and I don't want to

just go and tell people this is gonna be

the biggest thing ever

I want to I want to be able to show that

and have them feel it and walk away

feeling that as well so that's first and

foremost is have something to show and

so that they can actually feel and start

making it a part of their story as well

and feel like they have ownership over

it and then second is the realization

like I always kind of approach this is

like this is a this is a if if we take

money from someone this is kind of like

hiring someone that we can never fire we

can never get rid of right so that means

do we really want to work with this

person is this person going to be

someone that really pushes us pushes us

in a way that we need to be pushed and

and you can tell that very fairly

quickly in that first week of pitching

square got a lot of people who said you

know okay great we don't have any

questions we'll get back to you in about

30 minutes probably with with the term

sheet and I said I don't want a term

sheet especially if you're not asking

any questions

because they asked no questions

during doing the pitch and that means if

if they're on our board that they're

actually not going to be all that

constructive in terms of really asking

the tough questions and making sure that

we're you know we're not just in our own

bubble but they're looking outside that

is the role of the board is to is to

look outside and bring all their insight

and wisdom to us so that we can help

guide to guide the company and and that

second week we got a lot of tough

questions and and that's what I love

because I know if I'm getting tough

questions in the pitch I'm going to get

tough questions in the boardroom as well

and not just the boardroom but every

week I mean if a node emails me once a

week about have you thought about this

are you doing this and you know I know

this person can I make an introduction

here and it's just very very useful so

I'm looking for someone who I just love

working with and I think you you have to

set a very very high bar it's not just

about money or the firm it's about the

individual that you're ultimately going

to work with and people ask me all the

time like you know what firms would

would you suggest I go pitch and like

fine find the people that you really

want to work with in those firms and if

there's someone that really you know

just really resonates with you and you

love and you love the idea of working

with them focus on them and if it if it

test out to be to be the case great but

I think you have to kind of treat it as

like I'm adding this person to my team

and square was um was a little bit

different because one of the things that

I stated to all the investors in the

board meeting and and and folks who

might join the board is like look this

is not going to be a stress-free company

like there are so much interest in in

commerce and payments and there's gonna

be a ton of competition in the future

we're very early right now but this for

me a ton of competition in the future

and not a lot of people want to work in

payments because it's perceived as being

slow and you have to work with these

banking partners which aren't the

fastest moving organizations in the

world and people are trying to steal

money from me all the time

so this is not a place that you know

it's going to be stress-free so I need

to know that you will actually have a

level head in times of in times of

crisis because it's going to be very

easy for us to see something and then

react quickly and if we constantly react

to something then we're actually

building someone else's roadmap and

we're not fulfilling our own vision and

I want to make sure that we stay calm

cool collected in that as a board and as

an investor group and that you trust the

folks with the most context to do the

work and that is the folks in the

company and I just made sure that

everyone everyone knew that and if they

didn't like that then don't invest and

and some people some people walked

because that and that was great great

for me because that meant I didn't have

to deal with that later on you know I

think social networking platforms have

had the dual effect of attracting

hundreds of millions of people but also

alienating many those who've used it and

also those like me who never joined them

not because I never wanted to sort of

enjoy the benefits that they offered but

because of my sort of fears over privacy

and you know my fundamental skepticism

of sort of where technology is headed so

what do you say to that and how do you

try to coax those people that the

unconverted the the fearful but the ones

who are equally as enthusiastic as you

to to join sort of the global community

whether online or personally thank you I

think it's a I think it's a great

question and it's definitely a concern

shared by by many I think the first and

foremost we we say the word technology

and we tend to put it on a pedestal and

that pedestal makes it very abstract and

then that abstraction makes it very

scary and we have to keep in mind that

technology is ultimately just a tool and

these are tools and we pick up the tools

and we give power to the tools and

and we can also take that power away

from the tools fundamentally I believe

that all tools and all technologies are

really just reflections and mirrors of

our desires as civilization our desires

is as a humanity and and ultimately I

think a reminder and potentially even a

crutch that we're already born with

everything that we need and I truly I

truly believe that you know and you see

this trend where we're moving from these

abstractions where you know before a

computer would fill this room and now it

fits in my pocket and maybe very soon

around my wrist and just 10 years ago

the only way to input something was a

keyboard and a mouse and now we're using

our fingers and potentially very very

soon we'll be using our voice and and

and and more of these these very human

aspects so the interfaces keep becoming

more and more human and and and

utilizing more of what we're born with

and I think what what's important to me

about about Twitter is that I think it's

a closest thing that we have to right

now that we have to like a global

consciousness where you can actually see

the world in real-time and not only can

you see what's happening from from a

news level and from an event level but

you can actually see how people think

and feel about it and ultimately if we

have more of that sort of activity and

and the nice thing about Twitter is you

share as much as you want or you can

just stop if we have more of that

activity though we actually see how

people live and what they desire and you

know how they want to how they want to

see the world how they want to change

the world how they want to live in the

world and ultimately I believe that that

creates a potential for empathy and if

we have more empathy in the world we

have more opportunity to remove a lot of

a lot of conflict so I think broadly we

can use these tools in a way to build

more empathy around the world

and that empathy can actually actually

has a chance to to diminish a lot of the

conflict that we see in you know where

we've also internalized but I I believe

that we have the tools necessary to do

it without these technologies as well

and I think these technologies really

serve a purpose of reminding us of that

and you know maybe in 20 years 50 years

we will understand how to lock more of

the powers of the mind in order that in

order to do that when we're busy

exploring space and we're busy exploring

the the physical universe but but what

really interests me is are the folks

that are really exploring that the

depths of the of consciousness and how

the consciousness actually interconnects

and how it relates and I think

technology provides a model for that

that might teach us in different ways so

I think it's something to be excited

about but it again goes back to these

controls of how do I turn it off and how

do I turn and turn it on and if that's

not intuitive or if it's not apparent

then it's going to feel scary and if we

continue to use these words like

technology or disruption or we don't

explain that the why of what we're doing

with these things these these are things

to increase the amount of people who can

participate and these are things that

increased velocity of communication or

effort and if you increase velocity and

the increase participation you get time

back for more meaningful pursuits and I

think that's enough positive but we can

also use the tools in a very negative

way and we just we have to make that

decision it's ours and ours alone it's

not the tools

greatest inspiration I that that varies

that varies a lot I think I think you

always find role models for phases of

your life and right now I'm I'm really

obsessed with this artist named Robert

Irwin I mean how many of you know Robert

Irwin okay well he has a he isn't

there's a book out about him which is an

interview of his life and he's an artist

and he he started as a as a painter and

then he started questioning well do I

really need the boundaries of the canvas

and then he moved to to light and then

you know he made these these light

sculptures upon walls and he's like well

do I really need the the wall and then

he started using you know just these

massive rooms and he's just constantly

questioned every single thing and I love

people who who really are comfortable

exploring this this this ultimate

question of why right so you know why is

the question that is just it's the

easiest question to ask but it's the

hardest question to answer right and

that to me is is really you know the

driving force and and and what how

curiosity manifests is being able to

constantly ask the question why and

doing the work to answer the question

why and this is a this is a you know

sometimes a fun little exercises you

take a your friend or your parents or or

your nephew or nieces or brothers or

sisters and I would do this to my

parents all the time like dad why is the

sky blue as I well you know

such-and-such recession like well why

like well you know because this and why

and he's like that's just how God made

it and it's just it's it's interesting

how quickly people kind of go to

Authority and then there's another route

where instead of going to authorities

look well that's that's what we prove to

science or you know that that is uh

that's how the universe works or that's

what you know this person said or that's

what you know my boss said or whatever

it is there's another course where we

can say I don't know and if you're

saying I don't know then that means that

you're going to find out and and Robert

Irwin is someone who just constantly

questions every single thing that he

does in terms of this that's why what

like why am i painting in a canvas why

is that I don't know and and then he

explores a completely different meaning

so he's a he's definitely a current role

model but I've I've had I've had many

many throughout my throughout my life

Virginia Woolf is another one to whom I

love and in terms of just her her prose

and her writing style and just her

strength and confidence and comfort with

being isolated and in her work and her

art and you know just how how she lived

thanks very much for coming today Jack I

really enjoyed your talk my question

relates primarily to the branding of

Twitter and you touched briefly on on

some branding issues could you talk

about a little bit how about how you

came up with named Twitter and also the

verb to tweet I mean it's something that

everybody knows regardless of whether

they're a Twitter fan or user or not and

to me it's very iconic and I think you

really nailed it I'd really like to know

the thought process about how you got

there yeah I I would agree with you I

mean I think um I think Twitter is a is

one of those brands now that has so much

awareness around the world I think it

actually has more awareness or equal

awareness to to coca-cola but unlike

coca-cola it actually stands for

something it's not just a beverage no

offense to coca-cola but I don't drink

it

but it actually stands for something to

people because people bring the meaning

to people bring their own purpose to it

and people bring their own ideas to it

and and they feel ownership over it as

well so we uh when we were starting the

company we wanted something that really

kind of expressed or had a physical

manifestation you know because when you

received one of these messages and they

were called updates at the time we

didn't have the word tweet when you

received an update your phone would

would buzz and we we just thought that

was so cool that like you know you do

something virtually and it actually

affects something physically that was

amazing and it was just so cool for me

as a programmer I could write one line

of code and I could actually make

business pocket buzz which is hard to

say and he's like whoa and takes out his

phone and it's a message and I just

thought that was so cool so we wanted a

name that really celebrated that and we

came up with the word jitter and twitch

and both of those words don't really

bring up the best sort of imagery right

it's something you actually want to

avoid so Noah Noah glass who started OTO

and and and and and was formative in the

early early Twitter days went to the

dictionary and he found the word Twitter

and it's actually in the dictionary and

it was in the dictionary before the

company and it means a short

inconsequential bursts of information

and chirps from birds and we saw the

definition were like of course I mean

this is it this is what we do so we took

that name and then like a standard web

2.0 company we removed the vowels and we

started with the name twt TR but we

didn't do it just to copy like a Flickr

or the you know the the web 2.0 trends

we did it because we were text-based and

in the United States a short code was

was five digits and we wanted

we wanted our shortcode to be twt TR so

we applied for it and then we found out

that this magazine team people had that

shortcode so then we added the vowels

back in and we came up with shortcode

four zero four zero four which had

nothing to do with what we did but it

was available so so then our name was

our name was Twitter and because it was

chirps from birds we we we took a bird

illustration that we found on the web

and that became our logo and and then

the people using the service actually

came up with the word tweet and you know

we a lot of our history is really around

people using the service inventing ways

of doing things on the surface the at

user name the hashtag the retweet I

think one of the one of the new kind of

models and and interesting behaviors is

this concept of the tweet storm which is

you know number one number two number

three number four number five number six

it's a series of tweets that's meant to

be won all these things have been

invented by the people using the service

and the word tweet was coined by the

people using the service so it's it's

really meaningful when you build a brand

so that people can bring their own

personality and their their own

invention and and product too because

that means you haven't just built a

product you've actually built a platform

and people can build upon that platform

and make their own thing upon that

platform and then if they feel ownership

over that they continue to just use it

and in really interesting ways so we've

been very very fortunate in in the name

and and the bird as our logo and and the

current bird just you know when you see

it it really stands for something it

doesn't just stand for something for the

people in the company but stands for

something for the four people in the

world and and and and that's something

I'm really really proud of but naming is

so difficult and something that I

i-i've always had trouble with because

my name people always thought my name

was actually John they thought Jack was

a nickname and no I said you know my

name is actually Jack believe me and my

name actually has 14 different

definitions and in the dictionary Jack

and thirteen of them are derogatory so I

always had I always had issues with my

name and a naming in general and but but

having the right name just just really

makes makes everything really magical so

yeah pretty well unfortunately that's

all we have time for today thank you all

for coming and I would like you all to

join me in thanking mr. Dorsey

thank you
