Interviewer,"So Mark, there's been a lot of interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing over the past several years. We all saw how IBM's Watson Supercomputer dominated on Jeopardy. And now we're seeing a new technology take hold, something called #RPA that is gaining momentum. What do you think about the future of Artificial Intelligence, and where the industry is headed?"
Cuban,"You know, I've said it before and I'll say it again. In 10 years a liberal arts degree in philosophy will be worth more than a traditional programming degree. What is happening now with artificial intelligence is we'll start automating automation. Artificial intelligence won't need you or I to do it, it will be able to figure out itself how to automate  over the next 10 to 15 years. Now the hard part isn't whether or not it will change the nature of the work force, it will. But, the question is, over the period of time that it happens, who will be displaced? Marc Andreessen used to say that software is eating the world. Now, I believe, automation is going to eat the world."
Interviewer,"Wow, finally some good news for those liberal arts and philosophy majors! So, if that's going to happen, what are people who lack tangible skills, such as the philosophy majors you mention what are they going to do in this new era of automation?"
Cuban,"Well, I wouldn't say they don't have tangible skills. Knowing how to critically think and assess from a global perspective, I think, is going to be more valuable than what we see as exciting careers today which might be programming or accounting or those types of things. And frankly, the speed at which we're seeing automation permeate the workplace, scares the s- out of me. However much change you saw over the last 10 years with the iPhone, over the last 20 years with the Internet, over the last 30 years with PCs, etc., that is nothing. Nothing! We'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than in the last 30."
Interviewer,"So forget those typical 'safe' majors and study something you really enjoy, something you can be passionate about. Because many of those safe career paths are going to be automated. Is that what you're saying?"
Cuban,"I would tell people to follow their passion, even if it's in something that doesn't have an obvious job prospect but teaches you how to think. Look, I was passionate about baseball until I realized all I had was a 70 MPH fastball. I'm a realist so I gave that up and started focusing on things I could be really good (and competitive) at. And the more I worked at it, the better I got. I realized, nobody quits anything they are good at because it's fun to be good at something. But a lot of jobs are going to go away a lot faster than anyone imagined, even if you are good at it. Being able to learn and think...that's the future."
Interviewer,"Okay, so you believe automation is coming at an even faster rate than we've seen before. But didn't you revoke the credentials of two ESPN writers (Mark Stein and Tim MacMahon) who cover the Mavericks in 2016, because of your concern that they were relying on automated game reports that could (and would) eventually replace human-generated content? What's the story?"
Cuban,"While it may seem counter-intuitive to ban someone from covering us as a way of stopping automation, it really was my only option. I was worried about a lack of high quality in-depth coverage of every game, combined with an increased reliance on wire services. Instead of having a dedicated reporter, we saw data fed into algorithms and game summaries spit out and I think that is a long term problem for all sports. If I did nothing and the trend towards more and more games being covered by wire reporters continues, then it could get to the point where it was too late. So, I felt like if I didn't do it then, I wouldn't have a chance to stop or slow what I felt was a negative trend for the Mavs and the NBA. When a fan goes to a Mavs page and the only coverage is a wire service or eventually an automated summary, one highlight and a tweet, that hurts all stakeholders."
Interviewer,"For more information on the AP partnership with Automated Insights (that Mark is referring to above), see https://automatedinsights.com/customer-stories/associated-press/."
Interviewer,"Okay, Mark, well it sounds like in this case you were against the very technologies that you say are inevitable but regardless, let's pivot :-) and talk about technologies that you do like. You've invested in Twitter. Is Twitter going to be a player in the Automation space?"
Cuban,"Automation is coming at us faster than ever before, and there are trillions of dollars to be made in artificial intelligence. I believe the first Trillionaire will be someone who masters AI. If you are not getting up to speed on Deep Learning, Neural Networks, etc. you will lose."
Cuban,"In terms of Twitter, I started buying Twitter stock last year because I think they finally got their act together with Artificial Intelligence. Twitter has made real advances in machine learning on its platform to draw people back to the app when they have been away for a while, or to battle abuse and fight against spam accounts. They still have a way to go but they are working with IBM Watson and others. So, yes, I like Twitter and obviously, so does the President."
Interviewer,"Okay, so let's talk about your investment philosophy and the kinds of companies you like to invest in. Any thoughts you'd like to share."
Cuban,"Sure. You know, when I'm making an investment, whether on Shark Tank or elsewhere, I look for businesses that are unique and make me wonder 'why didn't I think of that'? I've invested in several startups...one is Genetesis, a medical device company in Ohio that uses noninvasive biomagnetic imaging to diagnose chest pain. I'm also backing a 3D printing firm called Fabric8 Labs that uses a Stereo-Electrochemical Deposition (SED) process that can produce objects in solid metal. I'm invested in companies related to sensors, (Motionloft), medical startups Biomeme (personalized medicine), Unikrn (online esports betting site) and others."
Interviewer,"Great, thanks. Any final thoughts on how the Dallas Mavericks can leverage automation technology even crypto?"
Cuban,"Well, we're accepting Bitcoin and Ether cryptocurriences to pay for tickets this season. As far as tokens, we will be taking tokens originated by companies (with whom) we have business relationships. We want to make our products and services how and where our customer want to buy it. As long as we can hedge or exchange the payment method and it works with our payment gateway, we will accept it as payment. I believe that blockchain technology will be at the core of most transactions in the future."
