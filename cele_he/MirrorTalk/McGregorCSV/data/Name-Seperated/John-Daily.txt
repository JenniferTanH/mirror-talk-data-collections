Charles Barkley: Oh, man! You're like a Dave and Busters if it was a person. Next, we got a man who wears $10,000 suits and just bought $350,000 Rolls Royce, UFC fighter, Conor McGregor.

Conor McGregor: Charles, I'm not going broke, so you can take your patronizing tone and shove it up your ass.

Charles Barkley: Alright, I know you're not broke now, but let me ask you a question. How many high school friends work for you?

Conor McGregor: Six.

Charles Barkley: Well, you better get yourself a Roth IRA, Conor. You know what that is?

Conor McGregor: Yeah. I've been in the IRA since protestants moved into my neighborhood.

Charles Barkley: That is incorrect. Once again, the answer is always no.' Remember, if you own an animal that used to belong to a drug dealer or middle eastern dictator, that's a red flag. Okay, pick again, Gronk.

John Daly: Hell yeah, man. I just launched my own alcoholic sports drink. It's called Smirnoff Sport. Smirnoff Sport. It's just blue vodka.

Conor McGregor: Invest? Pfft. Why should I invest in some silly bank for years when I can go to Vegas and double my money in an hour? All I do is win, Charles.

Charles Barkley: Okay. Last time you went to Vegas, what happened?

Conor McGregor: I lost.

Charles Barkley: Conor, gambling is an addiction. I still have my issues myself. Yesterday I bet Michael Jordan $10,000 that I would get a hole in one.

Conor McGregor: the odds of that is fairly long, man.

Charles Barkley: Okay, the question there, Trust a Stripper. Scenario: A stripper you just met follows you home, sits you down, and then says put on this blindfold and count to 1,000. Do you do it? I'm going to give you a hint. You don't do it. [buzzer] Conor.

Conor McGregor: I like that. She's freaky, right? Yeah, you bloody go for it
