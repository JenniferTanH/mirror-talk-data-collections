Interviewer,WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS THE KEY TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP?
Paul,"I'm going to assume that by entrepreneurship you mean starting startups, because in fact they're very different things. Starting startups is a tiny subset of entrepreneurship, with different rules from the rest. The key to starting a successful startup, especially for younger founders, is for it to grow organically out of your life"
Interviewer,HOW DO YOU PROPERLY IDENTIFY A COMPANY YOU WANT TO INVEST IN?
Paul,"There are hundreds of different kinds of clues, but if I could only ask one question, it would be Why are you working on this particular idea?"
Interviewer,WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF WORKING IN VENTURE CAPITAL?
Paul,"Working with good founders. Suggesting an idea to a really good founder is like passing the ball to Lionel Messi. You know he's going to score, and probably in a way that will be fun to watch."
Interviewer,WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN YOUR FIELD?
Paul,"The hardest part about investing, especially early stage investing, is predicting how much founders can grow. You're not just judging what founders are, which is hard enough, but what they could become."
Interviewer,IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC ADVICE THAT YOU WOULD GIVE YOURSELF IF YOU WERE BACK IN COLLEGE?
Paul,"I would tell myself to make an explicit effort to think about what interesting things there were to learn there, then try to learn them. Like most students, I blundered along semester to semester, worrying about whatever was due tomorrow. I never lifted my head up and looked around and tried asking, who here is working on interesting things, and what could I learn from them?"
