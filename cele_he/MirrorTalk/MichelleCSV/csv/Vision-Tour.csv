name,line
Interviewer,Oh so when i started thinking about who has had some of the greatest impact on the global vision of what health and.
Michelle,Wellness and empowerment looks like this person's name came to mind first Brooklyn please welcome our WW 2020.
Interviewer,Visionary conversation before the first lady of the United States it's funny.
Michelle,Whoa this does this feel like you just feel like deja vu all over again for you because you were here wearing those bag.
Interviewer,Balenciaga gold boots yeah Barack is like weirdos boots what'd you do with those boots I was like they.

Interviewer,Go to the michelle museum that's right you know you don't walk around the street match anything with those boots.
Michelle,Yes barely get on stage and but does this feel familiar so I know 20 was 20 19 your year or what it was crazy.
Interviewer,It was unexpected yes it was a good year that's because Michelle Obama's book be coming I know everybody in there has it.
Michelle,It wasn't just the best-selling memoir book of the year it's the best-selling memoir of all times and what that says.
Interviewer,To me i think it's like now eleven point seven million probably twelve since we've been sitting here billion what it.
Michelle,Says to me is that it's such an extraordinary time to be a strong confident assured and above all else.
Interviewer,Well a woman in the world today absolutely I mean so many people saw themselves in my story it's also a time.
Michelle,For owning our stories and i think that's part of what resonated with PSA a lot of people came up and said well you.
Interviewer,Were so vulnerable you was it hard for you to tell sorry to tell your truth there were.
Michelle,Things you covered that were difficult like trouble in your marriage in trouble having getting pregnant was that hard to.
Interviewer,Do and my response is no that's my story I embrace every aspect of who I am because as I've said I like my story I.
Michelle,Like all the highs and lows and the bumps in between yeah yeah and I think that you know what we learn from that is.
Interviewer,People are they are they gravitate to other people's vulnerabilities mm-hmm they we gravitate to one another when we.
Michelle,See the best and the worst in ourselves because it makes us feel human mm-hmm you know and I think people connected to.
Interviewer,The humaneness of the story what happened that you could never have anticipated on the tour I mean didn't.
Michelle,You all do 30 cities we did 34 cities we did Europe you know tour in Europe but I think that and I won't say that it was.
Interviewer,Surprising because we're feeling it here you know is that people are hungry for connection they're hungry for community.
Michelle,What's happening here is that there are people gathering together they're moving outside of their individual lives and.
Interviewer,The loaning loneliness that can come with social media obsession and Instagram worlds we feel lonely and when.
Michelle,We come together in a space like this you know for whatever the reason whether it's to hear about a book or to talk.
Interviewer,About health or to see oprah it reminds us that we are not so on a like and people are hungry for that and it's that.
Michelle,Hunger and i don't take any credit for it I don't I don't think you know I think we underestimate the the desire.
Interviewer,For people to feel a connection to each other I know all of the riddle in this room paid money to come out to give up a.
Michelle,Saturday we know all that saturday me and as I said ain't nobody twerking on this stage.
Interviewer,You know people are talking and having conversations but the the current climate speaks down to people you know.
Michelle,We think that people don't want to talk about books and talk about deep things and to you know really be.
Interviewer,Self-reflective speaking of a current climate you know one of the things that you have now become famous forever for.
Michelle,Is that when they go low we go high and that ain't always easy you know it's not always easy and what I wanted to ask you.
Interviewer,That in this climate where low has taken new lows yeah how do you maintain a high and not appear to be passive and not.
Michelle,Lose your equilibrium because low is gone lower yeah yes well because going low is easy which is why people go to it.
Interviewer,It's easy to go low it's easy to lead by fear it's easy to be divisive it's easy to make people feel afraid that's the.
Michelle,Easy thing and it's also the short-term thing and for me you know what I learned from my husband what I learned in eight.
Interviewer,Years at the white house is that this this life this world our responsibility and it is so much bigger than us right.
Michelle,So what i have to keep in mind is usually when I want to go low it's all about my own ego you know it's not about.
Interviewer,Solving anything it's not about fixing anything it's about seeking revenge on the thing that happened to you yeah and.
Michelle,When you as oprah you talk about purpose yes what it's all about and my purpose on this planet is not to just take care.
Interviewer,Of my own little ego you know there is a bigger purpose for me out there so when I respond to something I have to think.
Michelle,About that light i'm trying to shine what role model am I trying to be what what are the words that I'm gonna say.
Interviewer,And how will it affect young people who are looking at me but that's the bigger picture that puts you in a position to.
Michelle,Think high because if you're thinking about the long term you don't take the short-term measure of getting even with.
Interviewer,Somebody right here and now today because it makes you feel good in the moment if it's not gonna fix a problem.
Michelle,If it's not I'm gonna move the needle then you're not going high you're just being selfish.
Interviewer,Yeah i was going to ask you that because you know when you are the rock star that you are.
Michelle,And yes when you're filling stadiums all over the world you're a rock star just take it just take it no yes not just.
Interviewer,Rocks are rock star role model world's most admired woman when you are that well you carry all of those titles does.
Michelle,That affect how you then make decisions the is that now a part of what you think about before you make a decision or have.
Interviewer,An intention i don't know that it's any different today but I feel like I have a risk but when you I believe that when.
Michelle,You are a public figure I believe this that when you have any level of a Fame or if you have a.
Interviewer,Platform i believe and i always have believed that I have a responsibility with that platform and I think about.
Michelle,Kids i care a lot about young people and I know that what we say what they hear come out of our mouths all of us but me.
Interviewer,In particular because they're paying attention that it has a lasting effect and I am a mother I'm a mother I care.
Michelle,About kids first so i think deeply about what kids are hearing me say so yes I do I take that very seriously and I take.
Interviewer,The words that i say to children very seriously you know when I'm with a young person I want them to hear me I want.
Michelle,Them to hear me see them it's important for them to know that this person who's so famous and has this platform thinks.
Interviewer,That they are beautiful and smart and kind and good yeah as I said earlier that everybody just wants to know that.
Michelle,You hear me yes and that you see me what's the best advice do you think you've given your daughters oh gosh I.

Interviewer,Is the thing that over the years was a running theme in your house that you said over and over there you know what I.
Michelle,Tell them is what i continue to tell themselves is that they have to walk their own walk you know they they cannot.
Interviewer,Define themselves by looking at each other or looking at me or their dad they have to take the time to get to know.
Michelle,Themselves give themselves a moment to figure out who they want to be in the world not who they think I want them to.
Interviewer,Be not what the rest of the world says about them but to really think about how they want to shape their lives and how.
Michelle,They want to move in this world so i don't want them measuring themselves by external influences and for young girls.
Interviewer,That is hard to do oh no that is a very hard thing to do and everybody should understand that is responsibility its.
Michelle,Industry larger it drives me crazy hard when it was hard with just cable TV when you're watching all the images and in.
Interviewer,Music videos it's i don't know exponentially difficult yeah with with social media when you're comparing.
Michelle,Yourself to everybody on social media so I constantly have to remind them that they have to live in their own skin and.
Interviewer,That takes time too and i try to make sure they understand that that that unfolding of understanding who you are.
Michelle,It it is a journey of becoming you don't know it all in your 20s no you don't you just started to go something right how.
Interviewer,Did you do that in the white house where you have access to everything and everybody in the world I think it's.

Michelle,Kids things is not parenting is that it is a verb it is an active engaging thing and that means you got to know you your.

Michelle,They're neither did i but you're trying to make sure that these men and women who are following them around that the.
Interviewer,Girls can trust so i had to get my information about what they were doing or not doing just the same way everybody.
Michelle,Else from other parents and other kids who will tell on each other you know that takes that that takes some energy.
Interviewer,And now all that energy i can now place back on me and figuring out my next chapter you.
Michelle,Know how i want to spend the rest of my life what I want to do what I to 2020 vision is and Beyond exactly exactly.
Interviewer,Exactly so do you all actually now how do you have more time for each other just yes yes so and more emotional time.

Michelle,Posted a message y'all see this message that he posted on Michelle's birthday on social media and said he said that in.
Interviewer,Every scene you are my star and you have called him your soul affirming partner is it more so now 28 years as opposed to.
Michelle,Earlier years does it just keep getting better or it's it's more seasoned it's it's all of that you know I mean and.
Interviewer,This is what i try to tell young people it's it's you know marriage is hard and raising a family together is a hard.
Michelle,Thing it takes a toll but if you're with the person if you know why you were with them you know you understand that there.
Interviewer,Was a friendship and a foundation there that may it may feel like it goes away during some of those hard times but it.
Michelle,It's something that you can that we always come back to and we're coming back to that point where we see each.
Interviewer,Other again you know because some of the hardest times in our lives we just we just.
Michelle,Escaped it we survived it you know we went through a tough time we did some hard things together and now we're out.
Interviewer,On the other end and i can look at him and I still recognize my husband he's still the man that I fell in love with -.
Michelle,Who i value and i respect and i trust he's been an amazing father through so much he is he shows up what he has shown.
Interviewer,Up well in the world and it's he has been who he promised he would be to me and so that has been tested over 28.
Michelle,Years you know so what i tell young couples is that you got to hang in there you know you can't quit the minute it.
Interviewer,Gets hard because this this thing of living life and building a life together is a naturally hard thing to do so you.
Michelle,Can't quit when it's hard because then you'll miss the good part and I do joke you know and some people hate when I say.
Interviewer,This but if you live long enough to be married for 40 years 50 years which is what we're working towards if you get to.
Michelle,A point where eight eight of those years are bad ten of those years are bad wouldn't you take those odds you know.
Interviewer,But that's what marriage is you can have chunks of hard bad times and if that's how you define your marriage by just the.
Michelle,Hard times then you'll miss the the the truth of what's really there so you were so open in becoming when you talked.
Interviewer,About it or was a boo-boo they went to therapy and therapy really was an eye-opener for you and for him.
Michelle,What we all need to reflect and it's very hard to do it in a marriage with the person you're trying to work on.
Interviewer,Sometimes you need an objective person to just hear you out you know you may not be right you may just want to get it.
Michelle,Out and so we have him sitting there listening to you get it out sometimes that helps it's like I don't know about.
Interviewer,Yourself i talked about this it taught me that I am responsible for my own happiness that I didn't marry Barack for.
Michelle,Him to make me happy no one can make me happy you know so my disappointments were about what I thought he should be.
Interviewer,Doing for me giving to me when i hadn't really done the work to figure out what did I want and how do I go after what I.
Michelle,Want on my you know if I'm gonna show up equal in this partnership I have to be able to.
Interviewer,Make myself happy and so I had to stop focusing on what he wasn't doing and started thinking about.
Michelle,How to carve out the life that i wanted for myself with or without Barak and the more I did that the more I succeeded in.
Interviewer,Defining myself for myself the better i was in my partnership and isn't that for you the cornerstone of your own wellness.
Michelle,Program is defining your own happiness and working towards that but one of the things I said this earlier what I tried.
Interviewer,To tell my girls is walk your walk you know that's been my mantra one thing I do every year I started doing right.
Michelle,After the white house is taking a retreat and I think some of the people who some of my girlfriends who've gone.
Interviewer,On a retreat we go to this place where you're essentially walking for four hours it is it's hard and my friends who.
Michelle,Don't know what it is are usually mad at me by the middle of it that's that place.
Interviewer,Where you get up at 5:00 in the morning actly and one of the lessons of walking for that long because it's rare that you.
Michelle,Have to walk and these are hikes this is up mountains and down streams and valleys and all you have is a Camelback.
Interviewer,With some water and some hiker is telling you it's water water water and you're just like shut up just shut up.
Michelle,With that water when is it over this hike but you're hiking with other people and what you realize is that not.
Interviewer,Everybody has their own way of hiking some people can get up the mountains fast some people are fast on the flats.
Michelle,Some people are slow and methodical about how they walk and I always found that when I was not enjoying my walk is.
Interviewer,When i was comparing my walk to somebody else in the group and I had to sort of start telling myself over these four.
Michelle,Hours stop comparing yourself to the person walking ahead of you or behind you walk your walk do your walk why are.
Interviewer,You here how fast do you need to go how how fast do you need to take that incline to get through it because if you.
Michelle,Do what she did in front of you you won't make it so for me the such that I always have to tell myself.
Interviewer,Is what is my journey what what is my definition of health for me not what I see in a magazine you know because the.
Michelle,The people in magazines don't look like us they do they don't even set it up to look like us they don't even look like.
Interviewer,That right so i sometimes i'm at a photo shoot you give urine looks around the photo.
Michelle,Shoot at last sort of shoot i counted 47 people oh yeah those are yeah yeah this is also rich people's problems talking.
Interviewer,About photo shoots right and in my photo shoot girl there were like a hundred people yes it requires so many people.
Michelle,Did youdid make you look like this right people somebody put these bracelets on me and then they moved one over there.
Interviewer,And i was like why'd you move that one what did why that one but who's got time to figure it out they just push her out.
Michelle,On stage just get out there was sort of my walk but some it's somebody else's walk to this way I was talking to Tina.
Interviewer,Fey recently and she said that she she's at a stage now where she appreciates that she has moved through life in a few.
Michelle,Different body shapes yeah what do you appreciate most now about your body it's mine all mine and it's a.
Interviewer,Healthy body that works every day and i try hard not to judge it and it is different I mean you have to get to know.
Michelle,Your body because what this body is at 56 isn't this I can't do the same thing that I did when I was 36 it's not the.
Interviewer,Same body we we are we're living things we're not machines you know we run out of gas we need fuel we need sunshine and.
Michelle,Light we have to take care of ourselves and when you don't as you get older just like any living thing it begins to fail.
Interviewer,On you and for me i'm trying to figure out what is that balance that I need to make sure that the this body that God.
Michelle,Me that i'm taking care of it the best that I can and that it will serve me well as I get older and that isn't doing.
Interviewer,That what i did at 30 does not take care of this body at 56 so I can't look at some little kid in the gym next to me.
Michelle,And even wanna walk her walk because she's 30 you know and I'm 56 with a 56 year old body and I love my body you.
Interviewer,Know and as a as a as a child of growing up with a person with a father with a disability who could not walk my father.
Michelle,Would have given anything to have any one of my legs for me to judge that and not to just embrace it and be happy that.
Interviewer,I'm alive moving able to move hmm i haven't L myself appreciate what what God gave you and take care of that yeah.
Michelle,Be and be balanced about it i like that you so freely speak the number 56 yay for me because you have been around.
Interviewer,Women we all have and men to like oh i'm not gonna say the number oh my gosh I'm turning 40 and oh my gosh I'm trying.
Michelle,Turning 50 you never had any of that we we are so ridiculous as women you know we were working with we were struggling.
Interviewer,With so much you know just the notion to the other thing we don't want to talk about our age and then we want to act.
Michelle,Like we should look like we did when we're 20 you know when I'm sorry men y'all can look any kind of way you know.
Interviewer,And it seems to be okay it's it's i told my daughters because as they're getting older they start to judge themselves and.
Michelle,You know it's interesting when they talk about well I couldn't fit in my jeans that I had last year and I said but.
Interviewer,You're a whole nother year older you're now becoming a woman you don't have a child's body that's like saying you know.
Michelle,At 20 i'm really upset that i couldn't wear my favorite overalls anymore when I was 10 yeah you know that's as.
Interviewer,Ridiculous as it is at 56 to think that I should look like I did when I was 36 or for anyone to judge me.
Michelle,Like that or to judge a woman like that we're aging a nice culture where people are trying to stop it yes and then you.
Interviewer,Have all of these frozen faces yes and let me tell you when you're old now this is another thing most people I mean.
Michelle,You're in a photo line and everybody looks the same and you're like didn't I just meet you no nope y'all just have.
Interviewer,The same lips right and the same forehead and the same yeah let it go but we have to embrace our change and I'm.
Michelle,Lecturing to myself truthfully ladies because I do I struggle with this too you know I struggle with looking at the.
Interviewer,Mirror going mmm well whoa oh and i hate I hate looking at myself I hate listening to my voice I hate watching.
Michelle,Myself on tape because i'm constantly judging myself too just like everybody else really are you still I was gonna.
Interviewer,Ask you is there any self-doubt left yes I remember when cuz I I opened or interviewed you at the very first tour.
Michelle,Stop in chicago remember that really little nervous we prayed backstage because I was the first one and I.
Interviewer,Remember you were anxious and i read somewhere where you said you weren't even sure people would show up yeah.
Michelle,Exactly it's like you know i mean i lived in a cocoon of the White House for eight years I knew sort of kinda that.
Interviewer,People maybe sort of like me you know might might be interested in the book I don't know you know the people who have.
Michelle,Read you guys i say i wasn't really I wasn't fishing for a compliment not everybody likes me though you know some.
Interviewer,People think i'm the devil incarnate you know I mean you know when you're in the politics you get the good and the venom.
Michelle,Too you know and that's why in the book I remind people look people called me all kinds of things when when I was when.
Interviewer,I was campaigning for barack when it was a competition they called me on American and this stuff sticks with you men.
Michelle,Talked about the size of my butt you know there are people who were telling me I was angry.
Interviewer,You know you that stuff hurts you know and it makes you sort of wonder what are people seeing you know you know that.
Michelle,That stuff is there and look i'm a black woman in America and you know we're not always made to feel beautiful you know.
Interviewer,We're you know so there's still that you know there's still that baggage that we carry and not everybody can relate to.
Michelle,That but yes there is baggage that that I carry just like anybody else I was wondering if touring the world filling.
Interviewer,Arenas and stadiums around the world helped to release some of that self-doubt the release doesn't come from.
Michelle,The adoration or the the book sales the work is still from within that's the thing you know it's yes it is it's the.
Interviewer,Voices in my head it's not y'all it's me you know it's me changing the the playbook the the the recording in my.
Michelle,Head that was that has been played over and over again and that's what a lot of women a lot of you that's why I take.
Interviewer,Take what what children hear from me you know I take that very seriously because my voice becomes the part that the.
Michelle,Recording in their head so what could that voice possibly be saying to you at this point that brings self-doubt it's.
Interviewer,Always are you working hard enough is there you know are you using this platform.
Michelle,Or a good purpose are you focused on what other people need are you getting outside of your own ego that's you know.
Interviewer,We're constantly checking that with the work that we're doing I mean I just spent a year on a book tour talking.
Michelle,About me it feels like that's enough now let's talk about somebody else's story now.
Interviewer,We're where are these girls who are not going to school because you know what in the end that's why I'm here I'm not here.
Michelle,To talk about my story or to talk about my journey I'm here to shine a light on other young women and that's your the.
Interviewer,Big work i had that's the big i feel that that's the work that speaks to me you recently released a companion to be.
Michelle,Coming it's called the the journal lovely for discovering your voice I gave away many for Christmas thank you and.
Interviewer,I've been keeping a journal you know since about 15 years old I love some of the questions you include in here you.
Michelle,Say if you could have a conversation with a loved one who has passed away what would you ask him or her I'm asking.
Interviewer,That of you you know i wish i knew they like on I wish I had taken the time to get to know my grandparents full stories.
Michelle,Because a lot of what i talk about are my impressions of what my grandparents must have been going through I talk.
Interviewer,About my paternal grandfather dandy and he was kind of a crotchety old man I read about and now that I'm older I can.
Michelle,Look back and think why was he so angry but it it was because he was a brilliant black man in the era of segregation and.
Interviewer,Jim crow who could not realize his potential and he was probably very bitter about that and imagine how that.
Michelle,Would imagine how that would feel i wish I was old and I wish I had been old enough to sit down with him and ask him.
Interviewer,What you know what he went through how did he how did he survive living through a world that had such limited.
Michelle,Expectations for him when he knew that you know there was so much more for him yeah I would want to unpack that so that.
Interviewer,I could get to know him better and the reason why I put this kind of stuff in in the journal is.
Michelle,Because this is what our stories are and I want particularly young people to know that there's time now to have some of.
Interviewer,Those conversations with the elders in your life because the more you understand their stories their journeys.
Michelle,Their pains and their hurts you get to understand who they are in a full sense and then you judge less and you're more.
