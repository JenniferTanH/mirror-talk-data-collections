Interviewer,"Yeah. In all discussion, I know you've heard it, low kicks, calf kicks, low kicks, calf kicks. When you hear that, do you say, ""Yeah, I executed perfectly"", or do you say, ""Why are people not giving me credit for everything else I did in that fight?""."
McGregor,You're going to walk like a dog in that octagon on Saturday night.
Interviewer,"I guess, lastly, for me, Dustin, this is obviously different. It was similar last time. It's getting kind of ugly again. Is this getting personal for you at this point?"
McGregor,"You're only a little b***h. Your wife is your husband. You're only a little b***h of a thing; a silly little hillbilly. Joe Lee's wife, Joe Lee's wife, Joe Lee's wife, you little b***h of a thing."
Interviewer,"Thanks, Dustin. Conor, I want to ask you the same. Conor, throughout your career, when something has gone wrong, you've always evaluated spot on and made the corrections right afterwards. You really did point to those low kicks and said how dangerous those were. In the time since, have you seen other issues or other challenges that he presents to you, or is that really all that you need to address here?"
McGregor,"This is my bread and butter. This is what wakes me up in the morning with fire in my belly. Errors to correct, tactics to prepare for. I've had a great camp, a great focus on the opponent's details."
Interviewer,"Conor, it's clear that the gentlemanly Conor that was in Abu Dhabi is not here this time around. Dustin's admitted, at fight number one, you got in his head. As you're sitting there right now, do you feel that you've been able to get into his head or under his skin again?"
McGregor,"I'm going to go through his head, put holes in them, and take it off his shoulders. That's the goal here. He's done here. This is it for him. This is the end of the road. Even after that last fight, ""Oh, I don't love this anymore. I don't love doing this."" He knew what was coming. He knew the smacks he took. It's on, now. Saturday night, he's getting walked around that octagon like a dog and put to sleep."
Interviewer,"Hey, Conor, just one last one for you. We think about all the things that you've accomplished in your career. Certainly, there's not a title on the line in this one, but what would a win in this trilogy series mean for you? What would this mean, as part of your legacy?"
McGregor,"It's beautiful. Another addition, another feather to the cap. It's what I love to do. I love to come in here, defy the odds, do the unthinkable, and put on a show."
Interviewer,"Thank you, Conor. Dane, just one quick one for you. I know that you were teasing some big numbers and big trends and were excited about it. As we sit right here, what can you tell us about the status of this pay-per-view and where you expect it to end up?"
McGregor,"It's garbage. Don't have that garbage up on my bleeding stage. Where's the proper 12, the real sauce, the real Irish hot sauce."
Interviewer,"Dustin, it seems like you have something to say."
McGregor,Good one.
Interviewer,"Another one for Conor. This is really the first time you've been in the same room with Dustin since Fight Island. Has seeing him in person now, after all the back and forth, on social media-."
McGregor,"I think he looks rough, to be honest. It looks like the wait is getting to him. I can see it in his eyes. There's stress in his eyes, a lack of sleep. You can see it. It's coming for him on Saturday night and he knows it and I know it. I'm going to love doing it."
Interviewer,"Dustin, same question. Is finally seeing Conor in person, after all the back and forth on social media, has it elicited any more emotions or is it still just business, as usual?"
McGregor,I see a corpse. I see a dead body.
Interviewer,"All right. Robbie, Barstool Sports, over here. Question for Conor. Conor, we know you left the kids at home this time. Are they going to be watching on Saturday night or are they not allowed to witness the violence you plan on delivering?"
McGregor,"The fight will be about 5:00 in the morning on Irish time, so the kids will be asleep. They'll watch it in the morning, when they wake."
Interviewer,"Conor, when people think about you, they think about the guy who apologized to absolutely nobody. Is that guy here today and will he be here on Saturday?"
McGregor,"An evolution of that guy. I'm better than that man, do you know what I mean? I'm out there evolving. I'm about to come on full circle and I look forward to showing it on Saturday night."
Interviewer,Dustin-.
McGregor,"That night was the single greatest performance in UFC history, widely regarded. The night I won the second world title in Madison Square Garden. This performance, on Saturday night, I'm going to top it."
Interviewer,"Question for the notorious Conor McGregor. You're already a hall of famer, your legacy is already cemented. Winning against Dustin Poirier, winning this trilogy fight, where does it stack up against all the accomplishment, beating Aldo, getting the Champ status against Eddie Alvarez. Where would this rank?"
McGregor,"My mindset, I'm back on the building site now with a hard hat, a  vest with two hammers on my fucking hands."
Interviewer,"Out of curiosity, did you finish the bottle of hot sauce that Dustin gifted you on Fight Island?"
McGregor,Didn't touch it.
Interviewer,"Dustin, question for you. Winning this trilogy, would it be more meaningful than winning the interim lightweight strap at UFC 236 against Max Holloway?"
McGregor,"Don't contradict yourself, Dustin, because the last time we were up here, you were giving us all a large one. Saying, oh, the title means everything. Yet here you are looking for the bread and the butter, you little fake c***."
Interviewer,"Then, this is the last question for both of you. Get your hand raised Saturday evening, how quickly would you like to return? Would you like to fight for the strap before the end of 2021 against ?"
McGregor,"Yes, we're going to fill out the Allegiance Stadium, the Death Star."
Interviewer,"Question for Conor. Conor, the say that game recognizes game. When you look at Dustin, does he feel like he's on your level? Do you recognize him as a champ?"
McGregor,"No, he's not in the same stratosphere as me. The man looks disgraceful up here. He looks frail. He looks frail at this weight now. I'm telling you, his head, his body, his frame, his eyes. That weight class is getting to him. I'm all the way, ready to go. There'll be no 155, there'll be nothing free given here. Everything is getting took here."
Interviewer,"Second question for Dustin. You entered the UFC as a young fighter. Now you're a wise business man. What's that journey been like for you to be entering the fight game, but now in the business game?"
McGregor,Your wife is your husband.
Interviewer,"Question for Conor. Conor, win or lose, do you respect Dustin Poirier no matter what happens on Saturday night?"
McGregor,"I don't give a fuck about him, to be honest. I don't give a rat's ass about him. He's Buster Douglas. He's Buster Douglas, is what he is and that's the way he's going to go down. He's going to be known for that. It was a fluke win and I'm going to correct it on Saturday night."
Interviewer,Does this Conor McGregor look-.
McGregor,He's not going to do nothing.
Interviewer,-that I can't pay attention to this fight.
McGregor,"Don't keep watch on me, because that little filly won't do nothing."
Interviewer,"Conor, right here. Conor, right down here. Conor, question for you. You have won exactly one fight since Barack Obama was president."
McGregor,Watch your mouth. I'll go down and smash your nose in.
Interviewer,"Hold on. Conor, as a fighter-."
McGregor,"I'll go smash your nose in and then I'll laugh. Then, I'll laugh."
Interviewer,Cross talks over the last six months.
McGregor,You little rabbit. I'll smack him.
Interviewer,Sent you to a place where time doesn't exist six months ago. We want to know why should anyone expect anything different on Saturday?
McGregor,"It's one more fight I won than your little sissy ass, you little fanny pad."
Interviewer,"Question for Conor. Despite your feelings towards Dustin, Habib, and Nate, do you still think it's important to have a strong rival to help you get better and establish legacy?"
McGregor,"Yeah. Fuck the whole roster. Fuck the entire roster. I see the way it is. You try and be nice to them, you try and help them out, but fuck them all now. It is what it is and that's it. I'm coming for all of them."
Interviewer,Question for Conor. I'm curious. You've been talking a lot about legacy. How much would a trilogy fight with Nate Diaz interest you?
McGregor,"It's for sure going to happen. It must happen. More than that, it must happen, it will happen. I look forward to the day."
Interviewer,Last thing from me for Conor.
McGregor,"Louisiana wasn't good enough for you, was it? You left Louisiana. It wasn't up to scratch to get you to where you needed to be, was it?"
Interviewer,"For Conor, what else do you feel you still have to accomplish? You already were a simultaneous two division title champ. What else do you have on your radar to accomplish?"
McGregor,"Strainers, scraps, fights. That's what I love to do. It's what I've been doing my entire life and that's it. More mega fights."
Interviewer,"Question for Conor. Conor, the lack of trash talk last time around made things easier for Dustin, he said. Can you regain, in an intimidation factor, after losing it? How do you regain a psychological edge?"
McGregor,I don't give a bollocks about all that. Lock me in the cage with him. You're going to see what's happening.
Interviewer,"TMZ Sports. Conor, congrats on making the cover of Forbes."
McGregor,Thank you so much.
Interviewer,How long until you're a billionaire?
McGregor,By the time I'm 35. I'm 32 now.
Interviewer,"35. Okay. You'll be 33 next week. Do you want the boss, Dana, to get you anything for your birthday?"
McGregor,"No, I have everything I need. I have everything I need."
Interviewer,"Thank you. Thank you. Conor, same question to you?"
McGregor,"I love it all. There's not one bit of it I hate. I love every bit of it, from the start, to the middle, to the finish, to gearing up, to right now, here at the presser, to the weigh in tomorrow, and to the fight on Saturday night. I absolutely love it all."
Interviewer,"Conor, history has shown when you are active, you are sharper. Do you think you'll look back on this five year stretch and regret only fighting three times in your prime?"
McGregor,"I don't regret nothing I've done on this planet, as long as I live. I love my life. I've done some incredible things and I've had an incredible career. Long may it continue."
Interviewer,"Conor, should we expect to check calf kicks this fight?"
McGregor,You'll pay to see that.
Interviewer,"Finally, Conor, I've watched all your interviews this week. It seems like you've been hesitant to give the official ""Mystic Mac"" prediction for this one. Can you go on record-."
McGregor,"No, I said I'm going to take him out in a stretcher. He's going out in a stretcher in this fight."
Interviewer,"What round, sir?"
McGregor,You'll pay to see that.
Interviewer,Thank you.
McGregor,Shut your fucking mouth.
Interviewer,"We not talking about being at the top one year, two years, three years, four years, motherfucker. 21 years!"
McGregor,You owe money.
Interviewer,"I do? Let me see the bag! . Yeh he was right, yeh, the bag got books and we gonna show you what the books look like. If you believe in yourself like you say you believe in yourself, bet your whole fight cheque, you b****!"
McGregor,"No fucking problem. Send the contract kid, it's done."
Interviewer,"Let me see what it look like, grab me one , let me see what it look like. See if this b**** want to bet this."
McGregor,"Do what you're told, b****. Do what you're told, b****."
Interviewer,"You know, you know. You know, I like you."
McGregor,You love me.
Interviewer,"You fucking idiot, you fucking idiot, that's the fuck you are. You punk! This your boss, you b**** ."
McGregor,Good one.
Interviewer,And y'all got the fucking nerves to believe in a fucking fighter that like to fucking quit? This is a fucking quitter!
McGregor,And you act 10.
Interviewer,"Hey he told me, hey. You see, I'm not going to go there. I'm a'go there in the last press conference, I ain't gonna go there right now. And we talk about females."
McGregor,"You don't even know nothing about true fighting. You've never been in there. You're against little boxers afraid. You're against a different animal here, Floyd."
Interviewer,"Shut the fuck up, b****."
McGregor,Shut your mouth.
Interviewer,Shut the fuck up.
McGregor,Shut your mouth. They want you off this stage. You're embarrassing yourself up there.
Interviewer,Yeh I'm going to keep this souvenir. Can I keep this souvenir?
McGregor,"You do something with that flag, I'll fuck you up."
Interviewer," I like you, I like you."
McGregor,"That's it? That's it?! There's about five grand in here! There's about five grand in here! F*** me. Just know, you do something with that flag you ain't getting this bag or this money back and I'm going to fuck you up on this stage."
Interviewer,Has your strength and conditioning changed any in prep for this fight?
McGregor,"It's exactly what it should be for this fight. I know the fighting weight  and I'm preparing for that the size, the weight, the distance. Last fight, I felt like I was in phenomenal condition but when the weight got changed, I had to eat up to that weight and I mismanaged it. I threw out the diet. I ate a lot and I over-trained. I attacked in the first round really went after him. But the weight was a factor... mine and his. He was breathing heavy and hurt pretty bad but he took shots well. Someone at my regular weight wouldn't have been able to do that. I wasn't as lean as I usually am and it affected my performance. I blew out my energy and just didn't have anything in the tank."
Interviewer,Which martial art is the best to start learning first?
McGregor,"To fight MMA? You need to learn striking and grappling, so you could start a lot of places. It's an individual thing what are you willing to put the time in to? I started out with some semi-contact kickboxing then went to a boxing gym. The skills I learned in the boxing ring footwork, power punches, working with both hands, good defense helped make me the fighter I am. But heavy sparring isn't always the way that fast, snappy kickboxing style is also important. I think you should train in everything, and I do that Capoeira, Tae Kwon Do, Karate. But you can't train in just one. I'm open to all styles of combat. You want to wrestle? I'll wrestle. My fight style is always changing and I keep trying to learn new sh*t, so where I started doesn't seem that important. Any martial art is really about dedication and discipline. I used to want to be a footballer. Even then I was out every night doing drills after dark. Then when I discovered combat sports, I became even more obsessed. I don't have more talent. I just work harder. That kind of attitude helps you more than anything whether you're in the fight game or on some other path."
Interviewer,How did you come up with the gorilla in a crown design for your chest tattoo?
McGregor,"Lots of people talk about tattoos and their special meaning, but for me it's just about how it looks. My gym's logo is a gorilla and I wanted to get something along those lines. I feel like I'm the king gorilla in the gym, so I asked for a crown. I do like gorillas the way they carry themselves, their balance and core strength. Animal movement fascinates me."
Interviewer,"How do you prepare mentally for an opponent you know has beat you once? Do you need to control feelings of revenge, or do you let them fuel you?"
McGregor,"This fight, any fight... it's always about your mental state. And I'm always in control of that. Losing was a tough pill to swallow but it's not that big of a deal. You move on. And in a way, I celebrate defeat because it becomes inspiration. How do you prove anything to yourself unless you face adversity? I own what happened the last time and I learned from it. That's a blessing, because what happened will never happen again. There was a lot of hate that came out of the woodwork after that fight. That's just fuel for me. There's a reason I wanted this fight again at 170 it's the same exact story, but will have a different ending. I'm facing the challenge head-on as always and I'm going to prove that I can dominate at that weight."
Interviewer,What do you wish people knew about how MMA fighters train?
McGregor,"Some people seem to think MMA training is all about lifting weights and sparring. They don't realize fighting is a mental exercise. The most important thing is mindset it's my belief that makes me stronger than any opponent. Even physically, the brain is what controls our movement it tells us when and how to move. You have to be mentally engaged at all times you visualize everything before it happens. I think about my sport all day, every day. I don't think of anything else."
Interviewer,"Which exercise, in the gym or out, do you think has been the most beneficial for you, and why?"
McGregor,"Physically, my most important skill is balance. It's not a single thing, but exercises that are about balance are most beneficial for me. I practice yoga all the time... planks, handstands, extensions. Martial arts is all about being loose, flexible and maintaining perfect balance and yoga trains for all of that."
Interviewer,You've mentioned that you potentially over-trained the week before the first Diaz fight. What have you learned about recovery?
McGregor,"The weight issue affected my training for that fight. Usually, a few weeks out, I'm cutting weight. That puts you in a particular state of mind. I'm rationing food, but also energy. I stay focused on fight-specific things and preserve energy for the actual fight. Getting up to welterweight, I was eating what I wanted 24-7. So nutrition was a factor. But eating like that also gave me energy to burn. And I was not disciplined about it. My training was just too much and not focused. I've never been one to over train or go too hard. I prefer constant, light to medium, intelligent training and I got away from that last time. That's not an issue now."
Interviewer,What adjustments have you made to your nutrition?
McGregor,"I'm doing what has always worked for me. I eat good food. I'm just making sure this time I get to weight in a more disciplined, performance-focused way not eating any sh*t food. If it had a face or grew in the ground, it can be on the menu. Seriously, my typical diet is good quality meat, fruits and vegetables fish, steak, chicken, quality greens, good carbs from vegetables like sweet potato. I stay hydrated with water or coconut water. I do like my coffee."
Interviewer,What supplements are you using?
McGregor,"I get most of my nutrition from food. There's no cutting corners and there's no supplement that can make up for a sh*tty diet. But when you train like I do, you need to make sure you're getting your nutrients, and you can't just be eating all the time. One of the things I use is a protein supplement BSN Syntha-6 EDGE®. It delivers a lot of high-quality protein but helps keep things lean. I don't want to feel heavy, even in the higher weight class. That hurt me last time. I want the weight to be lean muscle and the Syntha-6 EDGE® helps with recovery and muscle building without excess carbs, calories and fat. Plus, it tastes like a milkshake. People have made a big deal about some recent comments about my sweet tooth. I'm not eating any cheesecake at the moment, so the protein shakes are as good as it gets."
Interviewer,Can you give us a sample gym workout? Something you might do for strength or power?
McGregor,"There's really no standard day for me in the gym. It's always a mix. But for strength and power, I use a lot of free weights. I use them to build strength and balance at the same time with exercises like single-leg deadlifts and pistol squats. I do moves that utilize the full body, and bodyweight for power dead hang pullups, muscle-ups, burpees, handstands. Handstands with leg raises and lifts are great for core and balance as well. I'm also fascinated by animal movement and incorporate that kind of motion in my workouts like a lizard crawl for strength and agility."
Interviewer,On his aim of being an owner in the UFC.
McGregor,"If I was an owner, I'd have had fans in the arena, where are the fans at? That's who we fight for, that's who pays the bills and who deserve the show. I'm on probation and up to my eyeballs on all sort of civil cases. Bring the fans here, here we are. I didn't get what I asked for."
Interviewer,On coming back.
McGregor,"I came back for the love of this, to shut this man up, this rat, this weasel. A man who grows in numbers but when confronted on his own cowers away, that's what you saw on the bus. He shit his jocks. I came back for the love of fighting and the love of war. I am going to enjoy putting a beating on this glass-jawed rat."
Interviewer,On when they used to be 'cordial'.
McGregor,"He was a fan boy, he bought t-shirts to support the cause. Nothing but respect, but then in his neck of the woods, a man involved in something - who's now in prison - started to invest and pump money into his gym. He started to gain false power and think he was a tough man, then shit thew fan and there's not a bean left. I'm here to put the nail in the coffin."
Interviewer,This is everything I expected. I come here to smash this guy.
McGregor,"You say 'send location', here I am. Did you not see me outside the fucking bus? I showed my hands, no weapons. I went there unarmed and he did fucking nothing. He hid and cowered behind women and caused what happened to happen. Here's my location, right here in front of you, do something! You'll do nothing."
Interviewer,On training camp.
McGregor,"It's been a war zone in my camp, we have been preparing for war. All you have to do is look at the imagery and video we have released, we have shown glimpses of the true hard work we have put in for this camp. Broken orbital bones, broken zygomatic arches, swallowed teeth, broken feet, broken fingers. This fool is saying it's going to be a long night, trust me mate I'm ready for a long night."
Interviewer,Do you think he's going to stand with you?
McGregor,"I don't give a fuck what he does. He's going to shoot for the legs... he's an amateur... 26-0.. can you believe it? He's an amateur in the pro game. He's fought nobody, anybody he's half fought has gone to a decision. I'm going to maul him."
Interviewer,On why he came back.
McGregor,"Shut up you backwards clown. I don't have to fight for money anymore, I've made so much. From the boxing I made a hell of a lot of money."
Interviewer,"You come for money, I come for legacy."
McGregor,"You're a fake, lying rat. You're saying its not about money, you're a lying bitch."
Interviewer,On this wrestling coaching.
McGregor,"I am very, very well coached, I am ready for this. We are ready for war, we are ready for all outcomes. You are looking at supreme confidence here. We are going to enjoy this on October 6, that's why we're here, because we love it."
Interviewer,"I don't know what he's going to do on October 6, does he think whiskey is going to help him? I think I'm going to make him tired and then play with him. When he gets tired he gives up. He moved to boxing and he tapped there."
McGregor,I'll tap your head off the canvas.
Interviewer,On a prediction.
McGregor,"Domination, his head bouncing off the canvas. All his pony talk is going to be put on blast. I think one , he has a glass jaw. I know he is afraid of a smack and if you're afraid of a smack off me, it'll feel like a double-barrelled shotgun."
Interviewer,Shakes his head.
McGregor,"I am in a war state of mind, every training session is a war zone. Two years out of the UFC Octagon but not two years out of the fighting Octagon, I fight every day in my life. We are coming to the final stages of preparation now."
Interviewer,On the incident with the bus.
McGregor,"I just thank the Lord Jesus Christ that that man didn't have the balls to come off the bus, or that the bus door didn't open, because if it did, this man would be dead right now and I would be in a cell. I am just here to compete."
Interviewer,"Conor, what was going on with your late arrival? Was it a conscious decision, a little bit of a mind game?"
McGregor,"He knew what he signed up for. The traffic is a little heavy, there must be a McGregor fight on. I don't know where the little fool is. He's better off running anyway, I bet he was saying a load of shit up here. He didn't say anything last time... fuck it, these things happen."
Interviewer,"Are you disappointed at all, we were looking forward to the face off. It was maybe an opportunity for you to get in his head."
McGregor,"I did not plan this, I tried to get here. I'm only a couple of minutes late for fuck sake. The mad backwards c*** should have stayed put. That's a sign; he doesn't want to be around me, he doesn't want to be around these people - he's petrified. He said nothing in New York and I bet he was saying shit here. It is what it is, I've given you enough face-offs over the year. I'm here to fight this man on Saturday night, it's more important that he gets the weight off. I want him making weight, I want him to show up on Saturday night because he was missed weight before and been rushed to hospital and all this other bollocks. Get that man in a sauna and cook him like the little chicken-jaw rat that he is."
Interviewer,"Conor, you've achieved a lot of incredible things in your career already..."
McGregor,Who's on the Proper whiskey?! Only another couple of hours and I'll be on it with you.
Interviewer,"Can you say where this will rank... stepping away for two years and coming back to fight the unbeaten Russian champion, the toughest stylistic match-up for you, where would this rank?"
McGregor,"It's another day, setting the bar high and knocking it out of the park. I plan on knocking that man's nose straight into the nosebleeds, that's what's going to happen on Saturday night."
Interviewer,"We see the two opportunities he may have as grappling and cardio, how much were those the focus of your camp?"
McGregor,"I've been grappling and wrestling much heavier men this whole camp. Only yesterday... 200 pounders for 25 minutes straight. I have cut no corners and I am ready for all outcomes. Once I hit him he is going to turn weak, I expect panic in him early but we've prepared for every outcome. I also don't give a bollocks, I've experienced it all."
Interviewer,The fans weren't there in New York; they're here today... is this the way it should always have been?
McGregor,"This is what I campaigned for in New York. I almost wasn't going to show up to the New York press conference. It's great to see the fans here and they're going to keep coming and coming. I'm filled with energy seeing my people come here and I'm going to make every single one of you proud on Saturday night. Thank you truly from the bottom of my heart, it's good to be back!"
Interviewer,"Tony Ferguson is carrying his belt around, Khabib is carrying his belt around, where are your belts?"
McGregor,"I was in a hurry, they're in my gaff at the minute, in my bedroom. I forgot them as I came out but there's a bloke gone to get them. But because I was late and because that little backwards c*** sprinted off the stage I thought fuck it, I'll just come on the stage. I know who the king is and I'm going to show it on Saturday night."
Interviewer,"Part of the reason for him leaving early was to get on schedule and make weight tomorrow. If he doesn't, do we still have a fight?"
McGregor,"You know with me there's always a fight going on somewhere. I don't give a bollocks about the weight, but if he doesn't make weight we'll figure it out when we get there. I'm fighting, know that!"
Interviewer,"At the open workouts, Khabib had something to say about the Irish language and about your family... what do you have to say to those comments."
McGregor,"You should never take information from an informant; you should keep distance from the informant at all times. That's the friendly way of putting it... his manager is a fucking snitch terrorist rat and that's it. I can go into heavy detail... and I will! He was pulled off a flight going from Cairo, Egypt to New York on September 11, 2001. He was caught with five passports in his possession. He turned informant and turned on the people he was working with. I don't even know how that man is in this fucking country. The Irish people are facing this immigration stuff on the way over and you've got this man with such a crazy background, Ali Abdelaziz, and he's rocking around free, it beggars belief to be honest. But don't ever take information from an informant and that's what that man is doing; he's a rat b****** and I'm going to get him on Saturday night."
Interviewer,Do you think the presence of the Irish fans has gotten to him mentally?
McGregor,"uck him and his mentality. I don't give a fuck about him. My heart is black towards him, towards his team and towards his people. I can truly see inside that man's head and style. I don't give a fuck about him and his people. There is way deeper shit than just a fight on Saturday night so it is what it is. I'm going to settle this the noble way and see what happens after that."
Interviewer,Do you think you're in Khabib's head?
McGregor,"It's clear as day, but again I don't care about his mentality or what he is thinking here. I am ruthless; I am coming to put a hole into this man's skull, dig my knuckle into his orbital bone and that is what I am going to do."
Interviewer,You have been very gracious before in wins and in defeat. Do you see yourself being able to squash the beef after fighting him?
McGregor,"Fuck peace. There will never be peace here. I always say you should aim for peace, but if you can't aim for peace, aim between the eyes. I'm going to aim right between that man's eyes and this is never over, never over. Never, ever, ever over."
Interviewer,Let's talk about whiskey for one second. I wonder if your whiskey is good?
McGregor,"Ask my bollocks! There's always going to be people who are hating, it comes with the territory of being at the top of the game. Trust me, it is the tastiest Irish whiskey there is on the planet. I fucking love it and I don't care what anybody says. I'm not even trying to sell it, just have a sip. Just take a bottle and enjoy it. When I count to three, I want everyone in this building to scream at the top of their lungs, fuck the Jameson brothers, One, two, three, fuck the Jameson brothers! Yes, coming for it all, me."
Interviewer,Have you been getting any numbers back on how well it's been doing?
McGregor,It's exceeding expectations. I'm involved with a couple of people who have been in the liquor business their entire lives and they've never seen anything like this. I've just got to thank my fans and the people who support me. It has sky-rocketed... we are trying to get more glass created and keep the whiskey flowing. It's out of the park but it's flowing in Las Vegas.
Interviewer,Is part of the art of war to you learning as much about your opponent as possible?
McGregor,"I just observe. I know every shot everyone throws, every move everyone makes. I just keep my eyes on the game that I run. I overlook my empire with my hawk eye."
Interviewer,"Khabib has talked about your past, what do you think that means?"
McGregor,"He's listening to that informant. It's all good to me, it's closing on fight night. You just cook yourself in that sauna you smelly Dagestani rat, and be there on Friday for that weigh-in and be there Saturday for the right. Say what you want, you don't have the bollocks to stay here for a couple of minutes extra. He spotted his chance and went running; like in the fight, I believe he'll spot an exit and he'll try and take it, but I won't let it happen."
Interviewer,"You mentioned falling out of love with the game, are you here to stay?"
McGregor,"Yes, that's why I'm here; the fans, the love, the energy. Truly, you can't beat that. It's as addictive as this Proper Twelve whiskey. But you know what's better than money? More fucking money, and there's a lot more coming in. I just love to be here doing what I'm doing. I'm only 30 years of age so I'm very, very young in the game. Even though I've been around and I'm experienced, I'm young compared to others so I'm here for a good while yet."
Interviewer,"You say it'll never be over with Khabib, can you see yourself fighting him more than once, or if you get the devastating KO will that be the end of it in terms of in the cage?"
McGregor,"I don't know, we'll see what happens. I'd like to fight that Ali, I'd like to fight that rat b****** somewhere. He's had a few fights, I might want to spark Khabib and then headline that Madison Square Garden card on November 3. I may want to do that one, that's what I'm thinking. Get the fight promo started; The Snitch against The Irish Proper Animal."
Interviewer,Where does your legacy go from here when it's already so big.
McGregor,"I just keep doing my thing, looking for a knock. At the end of the day, when I sign up, you're going to get a fight, that's a known fact. I come out fast, I come out aggressive and it's a damn fight. There's no holding, no stalling, it's a straight knock. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing. My legacy is set in stone, two-weight world champion, the first, the only. I just keep on going, see what happens."
Interviewer,What would you describe your level of hunger to be? Might Khabib be hungrier than you?
McGregor,"No. I'm starving. I am starving for this man's head. I am going to eat him alive in here and I don't give a bollocks. There is no-one hungrier than me, I am 24/7 in this game."
Interviewer,"You used to say you wanted to come to Las Vegas a month before, how come you haven't done that this time?"
McGregor,"It's hard to leave Ireland when you're in it; it's a damn good place to be. The air, the people, it's where I'm from so I spent more time there this time round. But I've also done the rounds in Las Vegas, I've been here for many, many months on end. I'm used to the climate so I said I'll stay in my beautiful home of Ireland then come out a little later and that's what we did. I feel great, I'm energised, we've done it easily."
Interviewer,You looked Khabib in the eyes a few weeks ago; what did you see then and what will you see tomorrow?
McGregor,"I saw a man who does not want to be here. He got out of here quick style, but hey you can't run now so I'm excited about that."
Interviewer,"Jose Aldo came out very aggressively in the first round, do you think we'll see something similar with Khabib?"
McGregor,"He's afraid of a clatter, make no mistake he does not like to be hit. He's a flincher as we call them in the novice ranks, that's what he is. He's also easily backed up so I am well aware of what to expect and it ain't nothing that fazes me."
Interviewer,When are you going to fight in Ireland again?
McGregor,"I said the other day, where is the Dublin fight? I know the situations with Croke Park, I know we want the stadiums but I'd fight in the Ringside. I'd fight in the Ringside on the south circular road where I made my boxing debut and my MMA debut. It's a pub and it holds about 50 people but I'd fucking fight in it. I certainly must, must, must fight in Ireland before I call it a day."
Interviewer,You've spoken about new weight classes... how necessary is 165lb for the UFC?
McGregor,"I think we would benefit from having more champions. With an overlook we could help athletes with their weight cuts but I don't think it's the be all and end all. When people are campaigning for these weight classes, and anything in general, they usually use it as a complaining tactic. I think you need to sit down and discuss all aspects and figure it out. I believe it would be beneficial having more belts on the line... potential dual-weight and treble-weight champions. I am for it, 155lb, 165lb, 175lb, 185lb, 195lb, 205lb."
Interviewer,Do you see yourself at 165lb?
McGregor,"Have you followed my career? I could go 185lb. I don't give a bollocks, if there's a fight there I'll take it. I would like te 165lb belt, but I would also like te 170lb belt. I think the game is going through a stage where we're looking to make it better for the athletes with their weight, but also the more belts... but I understand the way boxing has gone and there's hesitation about but I think we can sit down and come to a decision."
Interviewer,Dana said your mental game has surpassed even Muhammad Ali...?
McGregor,"Thank you so much, Dana, I appreciate the kind words. I have nothing but good things to say about you. You bare an OG (original gangster) of the fight game. The work you've put in to get this game to each level, you don't get the credit you deserve. The ESPN deal you got, when Lorenzo bowed out I wasn't sure what would happen, but with the ESPN deal, you are a true OG of the fight game and it's an honour to be up here doign business with you. I know we've had our ups and downs but it's an honour. Thank you for the kind words about Muhammad Ali, you tell the truth, no matter what, you tell the truth, like me also. Muhammad Ali was a special, special individual. I am not even close to that man, the things he did in his career, he is a special man. To even have my name next to that man is a truly special moment but I can't compare myself to the great man."
Interviewer,"If this fight does two million pay-per-view buys, how much money could you make?"
McGregor,"We're estimating three to three and a half million. I'm closing in on the $50m mark and for a mixed martial artist to make $50m in a MMA bout is breathtaking. Life is good; to think where we've come from... when I fought Nate Diaz the first time he was on $20,000 to show and $20,000 to win... the game has gone to so many new heights so quickly. It's a great time to be involved in the sport. Times are good so let's enjoy these momentous ocasions."
Interviewer,How long until you're a billionaire?
McGregor,I'd say by 35 I'll be a billionaire.
Interviewer,"Hell yeah, man. I just launched my own alcoholic sports drink. It's called Smirnoff Sport. Smirnoff Sport. It's just blue vodka."
McGregor,"Invest? Pfft. Why should I invest in some silly bank for years when I can go to Vegas and double my money in an hour? All I do is win, Charles."
Interviewer,"Okay. Last time you went to Vegas, what happened?"
McGregor,I lost.
Interviewer,"Conor, gambling is an addiction. I still have my issues myself. Yesterday I bet Michael Jordan $10,000 that I would get a hole in one."
McGregor,"the odds of that is fairly long, man."
Interviewer,"Okay, the question there, Trust a Stripper. Scenario"
McGregor,"I like that. She's freaky, right? Yeah, you bloody go for it."
Interviewer,"What's up Los Angeles! Ladies and gentlemen, the reigning and defending 155lb champion of the UFC, 'The Notorious' Conor McGregor."
McGregor,"Baby, we did it. I couldn't hear anything those motherfuckers said, thank fuck. This boxing press conference is a completely different set up to what we're used to, but 20,000 people, it's mind-blowing. I'm absolutely honoured to be here before you, to give you this great spectacle. And somebody's 0 has got to go!"
Interviewer,You just show up and I'm going to do the rest.
McGregor,I'm here right now.
Interviewer,You can get it right now.
McGregor,Do something.
Interviewer,You can get it right now.
McGregor,Do something.
Interviewer,You can get it right now.
McGregor,Do something.
Interviewer,You can get it right now. Talking that shit.
McGregor,"Am I the hungry lion I once was? Maybe not. It's certainly different, but I'm now the fat cat. I'm the fat cat pulling all the strings around here, and that's an even more dangerous individual."
Interviewer,Poirier acted shady?
McGregor,"I feel almost pity for some people in the game, to be honest. I had a little bit of pity for Dustin. He's been around many years. It's not a pretty game for a lot of people in this business. I just came back and wanted to be respectful and give the jewels, and f*ck that this time. It wasn't reciprocated. It was shady. It's not that I didn't know about it. It's not that I didn't know the intentions, but now the intentions are clear, and I'm gonna punish him for that."
Interviewer,I was looking past him.
McGregor,"I pitied the man, to be honest. I was looking past him. I had a Manny Pacquiao camp in place, and that was three-quarters of the camp."
Interviewer,They fight me afraid.
McGregor,"He also shot for the legs 20 seconds in, almost as fast as the Dagestani (Khabib Nurmagomedov) did. The Dagestani shot for the legs for a takedown 15 seconds into the first round. Dustin was 20 seconds. They know what's what. They know the danger that they face. I understand they fight me afraid. They dive for the legs. They try and stall positions. They shell up. They look to kick the legs. There's things I'm aware of now, and I've made adjustments. I look forward to correcting it."
Interviewer,For the record ...
McGregor,"My record in mixed martial arts competition is 19 wins and one loss. I only count knockouts. I only count knockouts. Dustin's record is 13 wins, two losses. The only thing that's final in this business is a knockout. All the other things the decisions, the taps all that sh*t means nothing to me."
Interviewer,Rewriting history.
McGregor,"I sent electric bolts through his entire body, from his head to his toes. You can see him rattled in the octagon. In the first round AND in the second round, he was out on his feet. He knows it, as well as I know it. It's gonna be a butchering."
Interviewer,Murder shots.
McGregor,I'm coming in to kill this man. I'm coming in with vicious intent here murder shots.
Interviewer,UFC needs me forever.
McGregor,"UFC needs me forever. I am forever. I am forever. My accomplishments are forever, my knockouts are forever, my run is forever, my domination of two divisions is forever, and what's to come is gonna be more forever."
Interviewer,"Conor, the fight obviously stopped in a horrible way. Give us your thoughts on how it was going."
McGregor,"I was boxing the bleedin' head off him and kicking the bleedin' leg off him. Usual shite,  dived to close the distance. THIS IS NOT OVER! If I have to take this outside with him, it's on outside. I don't give a bollocks."
Interviewer,He said that he believes that one of the kicks he checked broke your leg.
McGregor,"There was NO CHECK! There was not one of them was checked. Your wife is in my DMs! Hey baby, hit me back up. I'll chat to you later on! I'll be at your after-party. The Wynn nightclub. You look in bits, ya little ho! F*** him!"
Interviewer,"Conor, you missed with a punch and stepped back. Tell us what you felt. Tell us what you thought was going on?"
McGregor,"Just, the thing had separated and I bleedin' landed on the wonky leg, like Anderson Silva that time. Something similar to that. It's a fucking mad old business. F*** sake!"
Interviewer,"Listen, it was a wild fight, for as long as it lasted. I'm sure you'll be back and I'm sure you're going to want Dustin again. And I'm sure he'll oblige you."
McGregor,"I don't really care, to be honest."
Interviewer,"Oh, man! You're like a Dave and Busters if it was a person. Next, we got a man who wears $10,000 suits and just bought $350,000 Rolls Royce, UFC fighter, Conor McGregor."
McGregor,"Charles, I'm not going broke, so you can take your patronizing tone and shove it up your ass."
Interviewer,"Alright, I know you're not broke now, but let me ask you a question. How many high school friends work for you?"
McGregor,Six.
Interviewer,"Well, you better get yourself a Roth IRA, Conor. You know what that is?"
McGregor,Yeah. I've been in the IRA since protestants moved into my neighborhood.
Interviewer,"That is incorrect. Once again, the answer is always no.' Remember, if you own an animal that used to belong to a drug dealer or middle eastern dictator, that's a red flag. Okay, pick again, Gronk."
McGregor,"Invest? Pfft. Why should I invest in some silly bank for years when I can go to Vegas and double my money in an hour? All I do is win, Charles."
Interviewer,"Okay. Last time you went to Vegas, what happened?"
McGregor,I lost.
Interviewer,"Conor, gambling is an addiction. I still have my issues myself. Yesterday I bet Michael Jordan $10,000 that I would get a hole in one."
McGregor,"the odds of that is fairly long, man."
Interviewer,"Okay, the question there, Trust a Stripper. Scenario"
McGregor,"I like that. She's freaky, right? Yeah, you bloody go for it."
Interviewer,"I wanted to get your reaction today to the ruling that the Nevada State Athletic Commission made that will allow the request that you and Floyd made, to reduce the size of gloves from 10 ounces to 8 ounces. Can you give me your thoughts about that ruling?"
McGregor,"I'm very happy with how the Nevada State Athletic Commission handled it. I think they handled it fairly - they listened to both requests and just the overall approach to the decision and the referees, the judges, I think they were very fair throughout. So that was a good thing for me to see that they're taking into consideration both fighters' requests and I'm very happy with it."
Interviewer,What was your specific reason for wanting the smaller gloves?
McGregor,"You've got pros and cons on both sides. You've got both athletes asking for the request. And then you've got me also coming up in ounces from what I'm used to. I know some in the media are like oh no, it's 10, it's 8, but hey, look what I fight with. I fight in 4 ounce gloves, fingerless gloves. The knuckles are barely covered in what I am used to, so it benefits both in certain ways and I'm very happy with it."
Interviewer,What kind of gloves will you wear in the fight; what brand?
McGregor,"You know, we're still in discussion with that, so we'll see in a little bit."
Interviewer,I wanted to know might there be two or three things that people don't know about you that hasn't been written before?
McGregor,"Oh wow. I don't know. What you see with me is what you get. I am the same person on and off the camera. A lot of people like to say I'm not. Obviously there are different moments. You'll catch me against an opponent, I'm a little different but I portray myself as who I am. So what you see is what you get with me. And there have been many articles, many stories, many things written, but it's been okay I suppose. It's just I am who I am. I speak the truth for what I believe and people portray that in many ways. So I'm pretty open and what you see is what you get with me."
Interviewer,"Is there anything like you like to cook, maybe any other hobbies - changing diapers now lately?"
McGregor,"Yes. I'm razor quick with the diaper changes. Right now I have a nutritionist who's been with me for this time, bringing in the weight. So the cooking is out the window, my son has been living with me since, it must be three months now. We've had one hell of a camp. It's been one long stretch. A lot of hard, hard work. A lot of dedicated and focused work and then of course the nutrition has been top of the range, and that's why I'm at peak physical condition at this moment, ten days out. Now we are closing in on the weight cutting phase, and then we weigh-in and we fight. So that's about it. I'm by the book."
Interviewer,How have you approached the challenge of possibly going 12 rounds in this fight?
McGregor,"We've adjusted to the timing in my cardiovascular preparation. On the endurance phases we've stretched it out to accommodate the 12 three minute rounds. It's actually been very enjoyable to go from five, five minute rounds which is what I'm used to, which is 25 minutes, to 12 threes in boxing, which is 36 minutes. You've got to factor in there's not as much grabbing, but not to the extent of a mixed martial arts bout where you can end up on your back and you've got to tactically work your way back to your feet, which is very draining."
Interviewer,I'm wondering if you see a difference between how fans treat you and Floyd and whether you think race plays any role in that.
McGregor,"How many times have I been slayed by people? It's give and take here. I get my fair share of hate and my fair share of love also. I believe it's 50/50. I mean look at every boxing analyst. It's like I've been discarded and it's like I'm not welcome. I've suffered as well, so it is what it is. For me, this is athlete versus athlete. I was upset that Floyd tried to bring this in. I thought that was a weak move on his part. And he knows and his people truly know that it's not from me, not that I'm saying that there's not people on both sides that have this mindset where it's black versus white and this type of thing. But it's certainly something I do not condone. This is athlete versus athlete and two prime physical condition athletes about to take part in an amazing event and that's it on my end. So I'm disappointed to hear the way sometimes it's been portrayed, but I suppose it's just the nature of the game with the way things are going on in the world at the moment. But all I can do is stay focused on my craft and look to go out and put on a great performance for the fans who are supporting this event, as a whole."
Interviewer,What do you make of some of boxing circles being so dismissive of this fight? Is that something that motivates you?
McGregor,"It's certainly motivating. The disrespect and the disregard to my skill set is disappointing. I look at people so many times and their mind is closed. They've got a closed mind to how things can be done. It's a set way and there's no other way. Where if that was the case we'd never have reached across the waters and searched for other lands. And we'd never have went into space. Do you know what I mean? You've got to have an open mind and you've got to realize that there are other ways and there is a time and a place for every single moment. You've got to give respect for other disciplines and other styles. Like for instance, fighting is a complex game. There is a time and a place for every single attack and every single move. It's about finding the correct timing for it. So when I hear the way they carry on and they disregard and disrespect, it is what it is. I use it as motivation and I look forward to going in and educating them. But at the same time I get it. I'm coming in; I'm supposed to be from another sport and so again, I understand where it's at. But I'm just looking forward to August 26th, going in and proving what I'm saying and then educating the world on what martial arts are and giving the fans and everybody a good solid fight and earning my respect in this game also."
Interviewer,"In UFC you can't always wear personal sponsors, logos and endorsements like that. Are you looking forward to that? What do you have planned endorsement wise for August 26th?"
McGregor,"Yes. I've got a couple of endorsements coming up. And then as far as an apparel deal, we're close on an apparel deal. But at the same time, I'm in no rush. I've got good endorsement deals. As far as in ring endorsements, there are two that will be on the shorts I believe. Look, there are so many moving parts in the game. I'm just kind of trying to roll with it. And look, it's ten days from the fight time so I leave this to my agency and my management agency. I rely on sports management to handle that side of the business, but it is certainly a good business, so I'm very happy with everything that's been going on, on the endorsement side."
Interviewer,"I just wondered how your preparation and also the buildup kind of outside around you, has differed from your big UFC fights and whether that's affected your preparations at all."
McGregor,"Oh, look it's another day for me. It's another day of making history. It's another day of doing what I've been told I shouldn't be doing or I can't do. It's another mega blockbuster event. It's nothing new to me here. So the only difference in this buildup is I have a little son now with me. So we are here in Las Vegas as a family and my coaches and sparring partners and team, they have their multiple houses close by. So it's just been - I go to the gym and I train really hard for that given day. I come home, I rest and chill with my family and then I repeat."
Interviewer,Do you believe Floyd and what he has said about a rematch? Specifically on Jimmy Kimmel.
McGregor,"Yes. I didn't watch - I didn't hear the Jimmy Kimmel bit - but I got some snippets of it that someone sent - I got tagged in some stuff, but I didn't really hear much of what he said. As far as what he said on the world tour, he said he would step into the octagon. If he would do that he would have my respect. Anyone that's willing to step into a game like that where the limitations are so short, deserves respect. And that's at all levels whether it's at club level in a small hall, or a big stadium, it's still full of fans. If you get into that game or any combat sport game for that matter. I'll be here to grant him his rematch."
Interviewer,I wondered whether your mindset has changed toward anything he's done or anything that's happened in the buildup has made you more confident?
McGregor,I think the team I have around me has instilled confidence in me. And we have a solid team. It's been a growing team and an adjusting team throughout my career. And I think we just understand how it's done and how it's done correctly. And training has gone absolutely flawless. Everyone has a say; everyone listens to each other. Everyone's input is there and then we come to the best solution off of everyone's input and it's just been an absolute amazing camp.
Interviewer,"Floyd has worn eight ounce gloves in 46 out of his 49 fights. So for that reason, was there any consideration on your part, to wear 10 ounce gloves, just to inconvenience his side?"
McGregor,"No. Not at all. I mean I said that doesn't bother me. Again, I'm - I was already up six ounces from four to ten, so it's down a little bit from ten to eight, so how often he's worn the gloves never factored into it. I didn't even know that for instance, so that didn't factor into my thoughts at all. I do not care about his record. I do not care about his achievements. Every fight is on a fight by fight basis. So that's the way we approach it."
Interviewer,Was Robert Byrd the referee that you asked for? And what do you think that he will bring to this fight? Are you happy with it?
McGregor,"They gave us options. We didn't necessarily ask for any referee in particular. There was a referee or two that gave an opinion on the fight and it was like a little bit, if that's the case then it's very hard for them to be considered. So that was where we were at with it. And then the referee - I mean we were kind of hoping there was like a mix between an MMA - someone who had some link to an MMA bout. Robert Byrd is a phenomenal referee. We've watched him - I've watched him ref since the announcement has been made. He's a good ref. He lets the fight take place. He doesn't interrupt. He steps in when he should step in."
Interviewer,You weren't hoping for Tony Weeks then by any chance?
McGregor,"Tony Weeks was also a consideration. He was also selected - he has had - he has ref'd both MMA bouts and boxing bouts, so yes, he was definitely one on our list also. But we are happy. We are happy with the selection."
Interviewer,Did you have any issue with the three judges selected by the Commission?
McGregor,"I haven't really studied on the judging so it's very hard to find out like a history of the judges just yet. I believe my coach. I'm sure that coach has been already on that case. But I believe it's a fair mix across the board. I believe there's US, there's European. I think it's again, I commend the Nevada State Athletic Commission, they've done a hell of a job. It was fair all the way through. So we are very pleased."
Interviewer,"On Monday your former sparring partner, Paulie Malignaggi, said that he is trying to fight you. That's his intention. He would like to fight you. I'm wondering if this is something that you're interested in?"
McGregor,"Look, tell the kid to join the queue. Tell him to shut his mouth and join the queue, will you fast? Lord save me. He got his ass whooped and he went sprinting and I don't know what you want me to say about the guy, but hey, there's a big list of people that want to get in there and try and fight me, so tell him to join the queue and we'll see what happens after the fight."
Interviewer,"Some fighters like Terrence Crawford and David Haye have put out videos mocking your training. Have you seen these videos and if so, what do you make of the response to your training on Friday?"
McGregor,"I've seen some videos. It is what it is. It's lighthearted. I don't take it personally. If anything, I see stiffness in every single one of them. You must have the limbs free. Your shoulders must be disconnected. You must have the ability to disconnect your shoulders and reconnect it at the point of impact. With that skill set is how you can change a jab to a hook in the blink of an eye or a jab to an uppercut in the blink of an eye. It's the same thing with the hip flexors for kicks. If I throw a front kick to your midsection; if I'm tight in the hip and I can't free the leg like I can free my shoulders like I showed one of many training methods on how to free the shoulders, if I can do that with my hip flexor, I can change the point of impact from the belly and switch it up to the head in a millisecond."
Interviewer,You said that you want to defend your multiple world titles in MMA. Do you still consider yourself the featherweight champion?
McGregor,"Oh, 100%. I mean how can I not consider myself the UFC featherweight world champion and the UFC lightweight world champion? The current UFC featherweight world champion is Max Holloway, a man who I dismantled. And then the former was Jose Aldo. I still reign supreme over that division. And then also, the 155-pound division, I know there's talk of an interim belt. I had already won that belt and literally a month later, there was an interim scheduled."
Interviewer,Conor what have you heard as far as the metrics from the fight?
McGregor,I saw it pointing to record breaking numbers. All across the board. From the gate to the sponsorships to the Pay-Per-Views. Absolutely every angle.
Interviewer,"Conor, I'd like to start with you. Welcome back, of course, first things first. I mean, this entire pandemic. I think we've wondered. What would a Conor McGregor fight be like with no crowd, and now it's limited crowd. So now that you're kind of in the building, you're getting a sense for what the atmosphere is like. And we think about you, the bright lights are on the big crowds. That's when you perform, how does that affect your energy, your focus on fight night?"
McGregor,"I tell you what it feels pretty good right now. You know the crowd here. I know it's a small crowd, but it feels good, so I'm very happy to be here."
Interviewer,"Fair enough. But of course, as you said, this is a big fight, you know, pay-per-view headliner, but it's interesting. I mean, you have a victory over Dustin. There may be the title fight on the line, maybe there's not, we don't really know. So what provided kind of your daily motivation? I mean, you know, that extra practice, that extra grind that you might not want to go to. What, was providing that for you?"
McGregor,"My love for the game, my love for competition, my love for combat, and, you know, Dustin has put on an incredible run since our last fight. It's been a long time coming. Yes, I did get a over him the first time, but you know, he's rose right up and he's back up there at the top of the division. So I'm excited to go on and compete with him again."
Interviewer,"Fair enough. And you went out there and kind of made a pretty bold prediction. You said you think you can get it done in 60 seconds. You know, I know you have a lot of respect for him. But I wonder, that puts a lot of pressure on you, right? I mean, you win in the second round or you got shot decision. Maybe it was a letdown. So any regrets in making that prediction, do you stand by it?"
McGregor,"You know, well, I got him out of there in 90 seconds the first time. So I mean, I'm not that far off, but you know, I just started complete confidence in my preparation and in my abilities, I know Dustin's a hell of a competitor. I know there's questions here. He's heavier and he's up on it. He's up on a different weight, but he's more experienced. I feel I can do it. However, you know, there are question marks regarding conditioning and things like that. I know his team has been spouting about the condition and on that I have put in a lot of work to get myself correctly to the 155 pound frame. I got 40 seconds inside the octagon in 2020, which caused major frustration in my, you know, it's not enough. I need more. So I'm going to go in there and I believe, I believe I can get him out there and possibly we'll hit him early and hurt him. But, you know, I, I hope for, for a good long, a good long bell."
Interviewer,"Last thing for me, Conor, I mean, it's kind of a, I think probably no coincidence in the timing, but you were named in a lawsuit this week. I just wonder if you have any comments on that and if that's affecting your focus and I think that's a lot on your shoulders ahead of a big fight like this."
McGregor,"You know, it's all news. It's been, it was investigated totally over the course of two long years and I was cleared of any wrongdoing and, and that's it, you know, so much positivity in my life. I've got a great challenge ahead of me on Saturday, on Saturday night. And I'm very excited to get in. I put in an immense amount of work to get my frame correct at 155 to get my conditioning. You know, I want to answer questions here and I hope, I hope, I hope those things can bring it to me and we can, we can have a good fight."
Interviewer,"Fair enough. Thank you, Dustin. Just one last one for Dana. Please, Dana obviously this is a massive Pay-Per-View."
McGregor,"Can I, sorry you've got the hot sauce, Dustin. I'm actually very, I want to, I'd love to taste the hot sauce."
Interviewer,I've got a bottle for you.
McGregor,"I appreciate that. I've got a bottle of Proper for you. I love to share that. That's so, you know what I mean? He's putting in the work. I've been highly impressed. I think the whole business has been highly impressed. After that last many, many years ago, he rose up became champion. He's given so much back. I'm honored to share this octagon with this man. I know we have this competitive fire and it's still there. There's still that, you know, there is no denying that we, we have a clash and it's going to be a good firework field bell. And, but the respect is admirable for this man from me."
Interviewer,"I don't want to make it seem like we're up here giving each other back massages, but Conor's, I just want to clear the air, Conor's team, McGregor sports entertainment, did reach out to my foundation and they are, you know, starting the donation to the good fight foundation. And we have huge, huge plans for that. So Connor, man to man."
McGregor,"My Pleasure, buddy, my pleasure.Thank you."
Interviewer,You're going to help a lot of people with that.
McGregor,"Yes, yes and you, you."
Interviewer,Maybe you can help them with a distribution deal for the hot sauce.
McGregor,"Of course, of course. No problem. I got to taste it first though. You know, I don't put my name to something unless it's the proper, you know what I mean? Unless it's the finest."
Interviewer,"I got you. You'll taste it Sunday morning, then I'll give you a bottle after. Yeah?"
McGregor,That's perfect.
Interviewer,"And then question for Conor, Max Holloway declared himself the best boxer in MMA. You kind of laughed at that on Twitter. So I'm wondering, how would you rate the three gentlemen up here boxing compared to yours?"
McGregor,"I'll tell you what, the last press conference I'd done with  it was just myself and Dona up here. This time we've got three other men, four of us and we're all in the same division. So there are opponents, potential future opponents and I'm very excited about that. That's kind of what halted me in 2020, before the pandemic even hit, it was like nothing really presented itself. Well, here, we've got three up here. We've got Max skateboarding in the hallway, back at the hotel, so I'm very happy with that. I'm very excited to see how the bout goes in the coming event. I know the two men know the magnitude of where they are at and I'm excited, that's going to breathe an exciting fight. You know what I mean? It's going to be a lot of power thrown I hope. I would tell the two lads, if there is any stalling or any situation like that, to be separating and let the shots fly because there's a lot at stake here. And I wish both men, the best of luck."
Interviewer,"And then question for all four gentlemen up there, a unique situation four dads fighting on Saturday in the main up coming event. So are your kids aware of what's going down on Saturday? Are you going to let them watch? I know Conor has Conor Jr and his kids here, but are you going to let your kids watch on Saturday night?"
McGregor,"Sorry, say that again, was that to me?"
Interviewer,It's for all four. Are all four gentleman's kids going to watch the fight on Saturday?
McGregor,"My kids will watch them, after having them for a week and giving them the experience, they are a little young though. I don't think I'll have them in the arena for the actual bout, but there'll be watching their daddy for sure. And I look forward to going back after the fight."
Interviewer,"I told you guys, we'll see what happens this week."
McGregor,We'll get him. We'll get him.
Interviewer,"Hey, Conor, out of the available lightweights to you right now is Dustin the hardest challenge you could be facing?"
McGregor,"I think so, yeah. You know what, I'll always go. I'll always look to get the highest challenge. Dustin here has a win over Hooker, who is on stage here. He has a win, he knocked out Justin. So there's some high contenders already. And Justin and Tony knocked out Tony, who was another contender. So I think I'm right at the top here. I would make the case, if that man is continuing to dodge this and dodge the commitment of competing again, the title should be stripped and we should be engaging in a title fight. But I'm sure it will happen after this bout. I'm interested to hear what the excuses are, what will be said after the fight. But I predict a title strip."
Interviewer,"Going off prediction. You said, ""It's going to take 60 seconds to beat Dustin."" It might go longer. But do you have the shot in mind already that you want to finish in with? Or is that something that presents itself in the fight?"
McGregor,"I have a million shots. I've so many weapons in my arsenal and they're all fine tuned at this time. I'm in a phenomenal place. And I look forward to getting out and showcasing, painting my picture and putting on a beautiful performance for the fans around the world."
Interviewer,"Hey, just a quick one from me as the unofficial lightweight tournament commissioner, I just wanted to get available confirmation you guys, because listen, Charles Oliveira with the victory only over Tony Ferguson, he's pretty much through to the semifinals. Now we've got Justin, you've probably just come into the mix, but of course it's about you guys. The semifinal spots at stake, even if one or two, you come out of this weekend and fight for the title. I think most media fans, we want to crown a new undisputed lightweight champion by the end of the year. And I just want to get a quick confirmation-."
McGregor,"Book it, put me in. Book it, I'm in."
Interviewer,"Hey Conor, you looked like you had something, you were about to say there when Dana was talking about the pay-per-view numbers. Why don't you ."
McGregor,"Yeah. It just goes without saying. You don't go and come up and talk about EA Sports, UFC Selections and all this type of thing, when it comes to me. All the pay-per-views are treading. The Embedded has been record breaking again, it's almost double. The first episode of the Embedded has almost double all of the other Embeddeds that came out in 2020 by one, McGregor Serone. So it's trending in the right direction. I'm very excited about it. I'm very excited to get these guys on the platform here, you know what I mean? And like I said, and I'm happy to hear Chandler say this and Hooker say this, ""Take your chances and reap the rewards here."" So that's it, there's going to be two cracker fights and I'm ready. And as the guy from BT said about the tournament, book it, we're in and that's amazing. Let's go."
Interviewer,"One more for you, Conor. I know you kind of said at the beginning, the narrative about your conditioning and everything going into this fight. Can you just expand on that? And why do you think there are those doubts about your cardio?"
McGregor,"You know what, I think it's a myth. Obviously I had the Diaz one, the first Diaz fight I went from feather weight and then a month or so later I was at welterweight, that's obviously going to have impact and then there was other issues, but I think overall it's a myth and it's a myth that's... It's out there and that's it. I hope we can answer it. And I will answer it in time. At some stage, I keep showing up here, someone's going to be able to stay in the pocket with me and stay in there and fight with me. And I hope it's this-."
Interviewer,"Hey. Question for Conor. How are you doing? I've enjoyed listening to you talk about getting the frame right for 155. And it struck me, it's kind of crazy that you've only competed there twice. You've been in the UFC for, what, seven years? You've only competed at 155 pounds twice. Is that your ideal weight class, do you think? Do you think that's where you operate at the highest level?"
McGregor,"I've done pretty good in all the other ones as well. I've done good in them all. I've knocked secured belts in multiple divisions and I've secured knockout victories in multiple divisions. And I do feel great at this weight, but whatever I commit to I feel great at. When I do the welterweight belts, I feel great. I feel strong and big. I still feel this now. You know what I mean? I feel fast, also. So I'm excited to get in and showcase it. And like you said, I have not had that much fights at 155 pounds in the UFC, and I'm eager to put in a stint, to get a run going like I done with the featherweights. I think I went seven or eight fights within the space of a year and a half. That's what I'm looking for here if they can match me up."
Interviewer,"Yeah. And one Tweet that you... I don't know exactly when you put it up but you said that after you won the 155 pound belt you wondered, maybe you should've jumped up and gone for that 170 pound belt right away. And I just wonder... Obviously things have worked out well for you. The Mayweather fight made you a whole lot of money, but have there ever been... Do you think about that sometimes? ""What would have happened had I not left the sport?""."
McGregor,"Yeah. Sometimes I think, ""Man, I should've just stayed in the featherweight division and fought Ricardo Lamas and all those type of guys and I've just been in the featherweight division."" I always look to challenge myself and seek greater heights. And although I've been the champion at 155 pounds. I have not had much time at this weight in the UFC, and this is what I wish to do now."
Interviewer,Last thing for you
McGregor,"All of those events were 2018. It's now 2021. What I will say is as long as we fight again, there'll be no issue. And that's it. If he continues to run, well then I'm not sure. We'll see what happens."
Interviewer,"Overall, this is the toughest competition that I will ever face in my entire life. But I think when you look at my resume, when you look at my track record, guys like Eddie Alvarez, guys, like Benson Henderson, these are champions that were here in the UFC. Granted it was a couple of years later, but I've been competing at a high level since I was 14 years old, as I said. So I've been dreaming of this day or visualizing this day just in case it ever did come, and now I'm fully prepared to take the opportunity head on. And absolutely, all these guys are the best in the world. And the UFC lightweight division is the most hyped, most electrified, most energetic division in the UFC today. And it was a perfect time to insert my name into the mix."
McGregor,"I bring all of the discipline and the drive that I learned in my martial arts training and preparation and competition into the business world, and it's helped me tremendously. It's why I always would urge any parents around the world to get their children into mental martial arts. Any type of combat sport. And it's not necessarily to compete. If they wish to compete, well then they can compete. But the things that they learn through martial arts, you cannot learn it anywhere else and it will translate many other things, especially the business world. So it's pretty much the same. Two of the same."
Interviewer,"I think we've seen a lot of growth in Conor. One of the baddest men on the planet and now one of the most daddest men on the planet. All of us, as you alluded to, we're all dads. We all started coming up hungry, humble. And now we're dads and really fighting for a different purpose. So you see that in him, you see that in Dustin, you see that in Hooker, and you see that in myself. So man, either way, Saturday night we're all going to go out there, put on a great show. Everybody by that pay-per-view. Let's go."
McGregor,"Appreciate that, brother. Thank you."
Interviewer,"Conor, how are you doing mate?"
McGregor,Yeah.
Interviewer,"You've evolved so much in your fighting career, but I think you've always been an artist inside and outside the cage with your fighting style and your ability to sum up things in such a poetic manner. But can you just talk to me a little bit about how you define yourself as an artist?"
McGregor,"I'm just an insanely driven young man. You know what I mean? I'm passionate about what I'm passionate about and I give it my all. That's it. I'm a hard worker, through and through. If something needs to be done, Conor McGregor gets it done. Make no mistake about it."
Interviewer,"That's awesome. Staying on the topic of art, I wanted to read you a quote from 2013 that you said. It's really poignant and I think it deserves to be read out in full, so just bear with me. ""I've lost my mind on this game, like Vincent van Gogh. Dedicated his life to his art and he lost his mind in the process. That's happened to me, but fuck it. When that gold belt is around my waist and my mother has a big mansion, my girlfriend has a car for every day of the week, and my kids kids get everything they ever wanted, then it will pay. Then I'll be happy I lost my mind. Can you just reflect and talk to me about how that makes you feel, hearing that in 2021?"
McGregor,"Yeah, it's been some ride. I've got it done and I'm up here mad as a brush. I've been through what all, my friend. I appreciate that. And it's been a wild ride for me. It's not been easy at times, but what a life. And I'll tell you what, I wouldn't want it to be any other way. I'm very excited to be back here. I'm very excited to have fans back in the area. I'm very excited about the competition, the multiple competition. I just feel invigorated. And as you said about artistry and all, and Vinny van Gogh. I'm going to paint a beautiful picture here inside this octagon on Saturday night, and I'm very excited to do so."
Interviewer,"We know the motivation behind Dustin's fight against Conor McGregor is to beat Conor McGregor and to become the champion within one year. But you, Conor McGregor, you fought Jose Aldo, and you elevated the standard and then you fought Eddie Alvarez and you became the double champ, and you're just elevating standards each time. So, beating Donald Cerrone last year, and now you're fighting with Dustin Poirier; what's your motive? After this? After seven, eight years of competing in the UFC?"
McGregor,"I feel like I'm only starting, man. Everyone kind of wants to, ""Hey, Conor, you've done it all. You're so rich. Richer than Dane, over here. What are you doing here?"" I'm like, I'm allowed here, I want to be here, I want to perform for the fans. I'm a young man, I've got many highlights, all the money, all the belts, everything that comes in and that goes, what lives on are highlights"
Interviewer,"Conor, question down here. Talk to me about how your training camp went in Portugal. I know it was kind of secluded due to the lockdown. You've had secluded camps in the past, do you think this is something that you want to continue with going forward?"
McGregor,"Yeah, I'll tell you what. It's been a phenomenal camp all across the board. We were in Lagos in Portugal, we were in Dublin, we were in Dubai, and now we finish it up here. Yeah it was an amazing camp. I have an amazing team of people around me, all across the board, from the nutritionist, from my coaches in mixed martial arts, in jujitsu, in boxing, in wrestling, and all my sparring partners... It's a phenomenal team I have... as well as my conditioning coaches. I'm looking forward to going in and represent them all my team's hard work. You know what I mean? We put a lot of hard work in here and I'm going to go in and do my team proud."
Interviewer,"And Conor, this one is for you. I know you've been asked a lot about this whole Khabib thing, but I'm just curious to know"
McGregor,"You know, I don't really care. I did not say that, Dana said that. Let's just get to the fight. All these men are up here, there are plenty of challenges, it's a tough business and things have gone on in his personal life. I don't wish him any harm. Like I said, it was in 2018, a lot of time has passed. The world knows this fight is not over. This war is not over. The sport needs it to happen, the people need it to happen, I'm not going to chase it if he doesn't want it. And that's it. I'll keep my calm and move on. And that's what I'm doing, I'm back here at the 155 pound division, I'll show the world what's what over time and that's it. It begins on Saturday night against Dustin Poirier."
Interviewer,"Finally, my last question. I heard Dustin say that he actually kind of enjoyed the fights during this past year without a crowd because he felt it was a bit more intimate and he was more focused. I'd like to know, does having or not having a crowd affect you in any way when you're inside that octagon or not really?"
McGregor,"Yeah, no, a fight is a fight for sure when you're inside that octagon. I was actually very, very excited to compete with no crowd, at the start I was like, ""Oh, I don't know"" but over time then I really wanted to see and hear my power, and my velocity, and my precision. I wanted to hear my shots whistle through the air with no background noise and, and really put a statement out there of the difference. I almost got to do it, but there's not that many fans, only a couple of thousand; my power, my speed, my precision, my velocity, my whistle will still whistle strong on the night. And I'm excited to show."
Interviewer,Thank you.
McGregor,"Thank you guys, thank you."
Interviewer,"Conor, clearly, I'm sure, frustrated with the result, not what you're hoping for, but what are the emotions like for you right now?"
McGregor,"Yeah, it's heartbreaking, John. It's hard to take. Damn. . So, it is what it is."
Interviewer,"We think about your mental toughness and what you're made of. I mean, was that difficult for you to know, like, This leg just isn't working anymore. Like there's, I'm, I'm dead in here.""?"
McGregor,"I was going to tough it out. Do you know what I mean? I toughed it out as much as I could, but it was an unusual one , where I would feel okay in sparring or something, checking that side."
Interviewer,"You said the inactivity just caught up to you. I mean, is it physical? Is it a timing? what was the cost of the inactivity?"
McGregor,"It's the whole shebang. You know what I mean? But I have no excuses here. It was a phenomenal performance by Dustin, and that's it. I don't know what I ...."
Interviewer,"Last thing for me, Conor, Dana was here earlier and he said like he hadn't talked to you yet, but he was like, ""This could go one of two ways. Either A, Conor gets hungry, you know what I mean? It drives him and he comes back better than ever. Or he walks away. He know he's got money in the bank, he doesn't need to do this."" As you sit there right now, which of those two paths sounds right?"
McGregor,"Yeah. I'll certainly regroup, I'll regroup and pick myself up, you know what I mean? Get up off the floor and go again and that's it. Styles make fights, there's many great stylistic match-ups out there. Me, myself and Dustin are one-and-one myself, and Nate are one-and-one. There's many good match-ups for me and I'll adopt a different approach for the trilogy, I feel with Dustin, because those leg kicks are not to be messed with. You know what I mean? A that calf kick, the low calf kick, I've never experienced that."
Interviewer,"Conor, was the the leg something that you felt growing over time as he landed more shots, or did it suddenly happen? Because in the final sequence, there's a moment where it looks like your leg suddenly goes dead and your balance goes?"
McGregor,"Yeah, it was accumulating, accumulated for sure. I knew when I seen that he had Tiago Alvarez in the corners like these, I knew what was coming. I knew he likes to kick the low-key. He's also experienced that kick before, himself, Kagan. That's my first time to experience that. But one of them soon gain early and Tiago said, ""That was a good one."" And I was in my head thinking, ""You bastard, it was a good one."" And then it just started accumulating up. But, fuck it, it is what it is, man. I'm not that upset over it, which is another weird one for me, you know what I mean?"
Interviewer,"Dustin looks like he's going to go on and fight for a title now. You mentioned his name. Do you think now's the time to do the Nate rematch? Would that be a fight that makes sense for you, or you're not even thinking about that?"
McGregor,"No, I'm not. I was just kind of thinking I have a lot of... Like I said, styles make fights. I adopted a similar approach against Nate, but I was above the leg, it was the leg kick above. And that low one is an interesting one, for sure. It's a very interesting kick, same stance. Opposite stance, it's nothing. You know what I mean? He threw, actually, an opposite, a right low kick, and I checked it clean. But the outside ones wrapping around. And even though I felt like it toned the leg out, checked it, and you have to almost turn it right out and it has to hit the bone, it can't hit the muscle. And that's it."
Interviewer,"You mentioned the clench. There was a moment where you were both against the cage trading shoulder shots with each other, and it looked like you were having a conversation or something. Were you guys talking to each other?"
McGregor,"Yeah, just the usual cracking back and forth, one for one it was. But I felt the better ones, anyway."
Interviewer,"And last thing for me, Conor, you say you're sitting there and you're not upset and that's a bit of a weird one. Is part of that because this is something that you love to do, otherwise you wouldn't be doing it anymore? And the fact is, despite the loss, you finally have been able to compete again for the first time in a year. John mentioned about, ""Our people worry you might sort of go off and leave the game."" Are you still happy right now? Are you happy that you just got to compete?"
McGregor,"Yeah, I am, I am happy. I'm disappointed, but I'm happy for sure. I got to come out here and do this fight here in the Middle East, put on a show for the people. I done me best. And things don't go your way at times, but pick yourself up and carry on. I've got a lot of good things going on in me life, if you know what I mean? So I'll just keep me head high and that's it. And take the shots, take the licks and just fucking keep on going."
Interviewer,"Conor, right here. A lot was made, coming into this fight, of the sheer size of Dustin. A lot of people said he was cutting down from 180 to 155. Did you feel the strength or size of him in there?"
McGregor,"No. I was way stronger in the clenching. And I turned hm against the fence, I had him pinned. And we both had to make one... Well, I made 155, they made 156. But no, he just fought a good fight, an experienced fight. He's been in here a lot, almost more than double the amount of time I've been in here, in the cage. And that's it, it's a hard... You keep showing up, you'll get there. And like I said, I'm very happy for Dustin and his wife, and the things that they've been doing. I'm proud and honored, like I said before, proud and honored to share the octagon with him and we all want a piece."
Interviewer,"I don't want to sour your mood, but Habib has responded to your loss on Twitter. He says, this is what he wrote. He goes, ""This is what happened when you changed your team, leaving the sparring partners who made you a champion and sparring with little kids far away from reality."" Do you have a response to that at all?"
McGregor,"My team has been the team since day one, I've not changed anything. It is what it is. Respect the athletes, and that's the character of the man, for sure, behind the mask. And whatever, what's he want to do? Does he want to come back or no? Because he's not throwing to no leg kicks, you know what I mean? I got up off the ground against Dustin, I turned Dustin. You know what I mean? Look at little pockets of that sequence where he fights. Like I said, styles make fights."
Interviewer,Yeah. Dana did say it's-.
McGregor,"That's fighting talk. So if you're coming back, come back. You try and do it. So that's that."
Interviewer,"One of the main comments right now on social media from all the fans is, ""Even legends can lose."" How do you feel to have such an amazing fan base that supports you until the end?"
McGregor,"I'm very, very grateful for the support I receive. It's got me up off the floor many times throughout my competitive life and me personal life. And that's what I said, I'm proud and honored to come here before you and put a show on for people of the world. To do this through Christmas, to go the 155, to give it a shot. I done this for the support, for the fans, for the people that support me. And all I can say is I'm sorry I let the side down. And I'm fresh. I'm healthy. There was no trauma blows, there was no... It's just me leg is like a football. Below me knee is literally like a football, an American football inside me suit pants. It went right up into the hip."
Interviewer,"Hey Conor, a wise man once said, ""He who fears being conquered is sure of defeat."" And although we didn't get to see the masterpiece that you intended on creating tonight, we got to see a sensational display of heart, charisma and pride all week. I feel that the people that will take the most away from this will be your children. Leading by example in defeat. And if that's not a masterclass, I don't know what is. Do you agree?"
McGregor,"Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. You've been great all week and now you're bringing things back to make me well up."
Interviewer,Thank you.
McGregor,"I'm very happy to have me kids here and me family with me, side by side. And I am who I am at this time, you know what I mean? I'm a different man for sure. And the competitive fire is still in me. And like I said, I will regroup and adjust and come back. I've done it before and I'll do it again."
Interviewer,"Thank you, my friend."
McGregor,"I thought it was great, it was just like fighting in the prelims. I felt good and that's it. It felt no different, inside the octagon is inside the octagon, and I just need more time in there. Just to be settled. And then, I just need to make me adjustments and go for it."
Interviewer,"And after what we saw today with Michael Chandler, I don't know if you had the opportunity to watch the knockout?"
McGregor,"I did, yeah. I thought it was a beautiful knockdown. it was a good fight."
Interviewer,"Dennis said that probably this will be the next title fight. Who do you pick, Chandler or Poirier?"
McGregor,"I don't know, man. I don't know. I don't know. Don't just write me off yet. I'll make me adjustments and keep moving, so anything can happen in this game. And I'll go back, I'll get healthy and I'll re prepare. I've built an incredible... I've got to a great place in me body, physically. And I'm going to continue to grow on that. You know what I mean? I get the swelling down in the leg and I'll get back to me training and me cardiovascular work, me strength work, me skills work, and just keep living the martial arts life."
Interviewer,"Conor, can I just... Over this way, sorry. You've spoken, there's so many people talking about you when it's like Manny Pacquiao or Floyd Mayweather, and getting into boxing and all of that kind of stuff. Does something like today make you think, ""I want to concentrate on one thing,"" or are you still going to be kind of open-minded to do that?"
McGregor,"Geez, there's none of them leg kicks in boxing anyway. But look, I always did want to focus on me MMA courier, but I'm also open. I'll just see what happens. I don't know what will happen. That Manny fight was happening, it was as good as done. So I don't know, man. I just want to get in and just get back into a bounce, and especially against that style of fighter, and not take those kicks. Don't play with those kicks. Although, I don't know. It's just a motherfucker to take, man. That's me mind's going, so I'm just trying to replay all the sequences. And I haven't watched the fight back yet. I just had a shower and came here, and I look forward to watching that back."
Interviewer,"How did you feel in that first round, though? Because I thought, just me here, that you're striking was going really well and stuff. Was it just a case of that first kick where was you was like, ""Ah.""."
McGregor,"It wasn't just... Yeah, no. It just kept building up, you know what I mean? And then I threw one at him, I was like, ""Throw your kicks, man."" I wanted to let him walk... Even when we were in the clench, he got the take down and I got back up and turned him. I was like, ""Right, lovely."" Where I'm getting more time in the octagon, that was in my head. I was like, ""Lovely now, we got a bit more time in here now."" So I wasn't in a hurry. And you know me, I come out, ""Wha!"" And I go over it. So there's a lot of me head now. I'm not even like, ""Oh, maybe I need to go back that way."" I'm just going to be who I am in the moment and take things as they come. And that's it."
Interviewer,"You say the Pacquiao fight is probably on the back burner now, is that because of the leg, I assume?"
McGregor,"I don't know how long. It's muscle, it's all muscle. It's just deep into the muscle and it's just a complete dead leg right the way up. It's no bone, no nothing, not a mark on the head. I'm just plain good, man. It's just  instead of a bleeding dead leg. But it is what it is, man. Fair play to him, it was a smart fight. He got the shot, he got me down in the first, man. I should've just tied it up in the fucking... When I caught a few of them kicks, I should have laid and just pressed him against the fence and keep beating him in the fence. Hit him with a lovely elbow on the temple that hurt him. Should have just kept mauling him."
Interviewer,"And lastly from me, I want to talk about the evolution of your character that we've seen. You're very humble and you've been very respectful and classy for this whole process. Talk to me, do you think becoming a father has really brought that out of you and that makes you appreciate things like this that much more? You can go to your family after this. That's why you're maybe not as upset as what you said?"
McGregor,"Yeah, but I mean, yeah, of course. But I am upset, I'm upset. I'm sad, but I'm still a contender. I'm happy. And like you said, I've got a lot going. It's not nice going back without the win, you know what I mean? That's for sure. But life is like that sometimes and we pick ourselves up and keep going."
Interviewer,"Conor, just real quick to your left over here. I know you would have rather had the win, but Dana did say when he was in here that this was one of the two or three highest selling pay-per-views in UFC history. What does that mean to you and say about your drawing power still at this point?"
McGregor,"Yeah, it's always good. I tried to come in and give a show all across the board, in the lead up and in the fight week and in the fight itself. Sometimes you come in here and make magic, and sometimes you don't. And I'm happy with all my records and I'm happy that I got to compete and do it again. It is what it is."
Interviewer,"What do you think is a bigger trilogy, Dustin or Diaz?"
McGregor,"I think they're both pretty, pretty big. Two south paws as well, which is interesting. Yeah, they're both there, so see what happens."
Interviewer,Is there one you want more?
McGregor,"Yeah, I don't know. I just want to regroup for a minute, to be honest, you know what I mean? I want to just watch the fight and see where I'm at. Right now, I'd probably say Dustin, obviously. It's fresh, and that's it."
Interviewer,"Conor, just one last question here. Over here to your right, just over here. The other day you were saying, ""What does the champ champ do? He does it again."" The lightweight title, where do you see yourself in that now? Is that something that you really feel you want to regain before you retire? Or are you comfortable just taking fights you just mentioned?"
McGregor,"No, I would love to get in and get back on the horse and secure the new belt with the Irish flag on it, for sure. And anything can happen in this business, as long as you stay active, as long as you compete. Things shape around you, you know what I mean? You show up, you reap the rewards and that's it. That's what's happened for Dustin tonight, and it's what's happened against me tonight. I'll keep me on the prize, for sure. All right, thank you guys so much, I appreciate it. Thank you all."
