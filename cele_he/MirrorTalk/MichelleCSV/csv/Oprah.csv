Michelle,To believe this was happening in our lifetime as the famed historian Doris Kearns.
Interviewer,Goodwin reminded us people will be writing about this moment for hundreds of years.
Michelle,And now as she prepares to leave the White House its Michelle Obama who's on the precipice of her own exciting next.

Michelle,First lady as a political force because this right now is the greatest country on Earth has pundits wondering about her.
Interviewer,Next move this is obama is not only a woman to watch in American politics but also considered the coolest first lady.
Michelle,In us history I remember being here eight years ago mm-hmm I was doing an interview for a.
Interviewer,Magazine we're actually sitting in this very room we took our shoes off we we did and you.
Michelle,Were talking about the girls schedules and trying to figure all that out and I left you know thinking and feeling the.
Interviewer,Weight of it all like the weight of the legacy that you all were carrying the responsibility so I want to know has.
Michelle,That weight lifted or has it just shifted you know it's it's lifted I mean you know let's let's be honest I mean.
Interviewer,You know there is there's no way to describe what it feels like to open up the paper every day and know that almost.
Michelle,Every headline is your husband's responsibility at some level mm-hmm anywhere in the world any major problem.
Interviewer,Any major issue falls on the laps of the commander in chief and that is a weight that is is indescribable and now that.
Michelle,It's time for us to move on yeah that weight has lifted a bit not completely because the work isn't done until the.
Interviewer,President-elect takes the oath of office but knowing that we've made it this far and we've survived and in many ways I.
Michelle,Believe we've thrived mm-hmm there is a weight that's lifted mm-hmm was there a time where you thought this.
Interviewer,Period would make or break you when did you feel the most tested you know I I think I tend to push the challenges this.
Michelle,Is a defense mechanism that i've had throughout my life you know the bad stuff I just don't hold on to you know I.
Interviewer,Mean so if we were to sit here and you were to read through some of that stuff I'd be like oh yeah that's all oh I.
Michelle,Forgot all about that it's like oh yeah I think I was kind of mad but I think the way I handle things and I you know I.
Interviewer,Can't i think we as women do it we as black women better be able to do it because there's so much that comes at us.
Michelle,All the time and every day in subtle that could tear your soul apart if you let it but my mother always taught me.
Interviewer,Girl you better keep it moving you know you got to brush it off and I think I've grown up doing that so the challenge is.
Michelle,Yeah there are times that you know frustrated me you know this this past election was challenging for me as a as.
Interviewer,A citizen to watch an experience it was painful had you originally planned to go out or was there a moment where you.
Michelle,Decided i'm gonna no well they didn't campaign they always asked me yeah party my husband people you know there isn't.
Interviewer,An important election that has gone by where they didn't ask you a they didn't ask you know the question for me is just.
Michelle,Always what and how how is the structure I've said this before if I'm out there if I leave this house and leave my girls.
Interviewer,How do i know that this will have impact I don't want to just be out there just to be out there um but I'm always asked.
Michelle,So i you know that was something that people were kind of dancing around the subject okay we're going to ask the.
Interviewer,First lady if she'll go out and you know you could see people dancing around the subject but it was pretty clear that you.
Michelle,Know you want eated yeah yeah after the primaries were or that you know they wanted us all to do as much as we could.
Interviewer,So there seemed to be something that happened to you during this particular campaign I think was in New Hampshire.
Michelle,There was a level of urgency and dynamism that we had not seen before that seemed to be coming from a.
Interviewer,Different space that wasn't just political well this was the context of that speech was unique mm-hmm.
Michelle,We saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women and I can't believe that I'm saying that a.
Interviewer,Candidate for president of the united States has bragged about sexually assaulting women and I have to tell you.
Michelle,That i can't stop thinking about this it has shaken me to my core in a way that I.
Interviewer,Couldn't have predicted you know to have a candidate for the presidency speaking in such terms about women as I said was.
Michelle,Not it was not a normal thing so my response you know in light of what I was seeing from my female staff what I.
Interviewer,Was hearing from my daughters their reaction to it for me required a different kind of response you know you.
Michelle,Can't just stand before people and just give a regular political speech I mean I was scheduled to go out on stump right.
Interviewer,After this was happening and the question was well do I just go out there and talk like that act like that didn't.
Michelle,Happen well god that's not true that's not honest and that's something that Barak and I have always tried to be in.
Interviewer,This office is honest you know so that people feel like when we say something we do mean it mm-hmm you know um so in.
Michelle,That time there was no way that i could be out on the campaign trail and not address how that was making not just me.
Interviewer,Feel we could feel that you had been shaken too yeah well not because a lot of people had been shaken to their core.
Michelle,And still are they are still feeling the reverberations of that kind of caustic language so I heard that on election.
Interviewer,Night you can't believe everything you read yeah please don't wait wait I read I.
Michelle,Read that on election night you went to bed yes and did not know the results until.
Interviewer,The next morning you know we absolutely I look I don't I do not like the back-and-forth the process of politics I.
Michelle,Don't like to hear pundits chit-chattin a man and I don't like it so you had awakened enough November 9th and you.
Interviewer,Were told yeah i got up and i looked at my my iPhone mm-hmm and I saw it and what was your first.
Michelle,Thought well pretty much you know you kind of saw the tea leaves I kind of felt helping by the time you went to bed.
Interviewer,He's in bed good sense he i was getting myself ready for either outcome you know so mentally I'd already kind of digested.
Michelle,It before I actually read it you know so this is what why it's important to.
Interviewer,Understand for all the people out there they have to understand that as I've said time and time again words matter.
Michelle,And they matter most to our kids our young people and the words that we say moving forward all of us it matters.
Interviewer,Which is one of the reasons why barack and I are so supportive of this transition because no matter how we felt.
Michelle,Going into it it is important for the health of this nation that we support the commander-in-chief wasn't done when.
Interviewer,My husband took office but we're going high and this is what's best for the country so we are going to be there.
Michelle,For the next president and do whatever we have to do to make sure that he is successful because if he succeeds we all.
Interviewer,Succeed when you say it wasn't done for your husband for his presidency what do you mean by that that there were people.
Michelle,Who did not support his presidency there were people in Congress there were leaders in Congress who did not support.
Interviewer,His presidency which was not something that was good for the country was good for politics but it wasn't good for the.
Michelle,Country um and that wasn't the right that way to approach it when someone is cruel or.
Interviewer,Acts like a bully you don't stoop to their level know our motto is when they go low we go high.
Michelle,So in this when they go low we go high that is that went viral now everybody repeats it it's now one of the most.
Interviewer,Famous quote i just want people to act on it okay so I want to know what that meat is like what does that look like in.
Michelle,The reality of this time it looks like so many things but you know it goes back to words matter what we say how we.
Interviewer,Behave we are modeling to the next generation so if we want maturity we have to be mature if we want a nation.
Michelle,That feels hopeful then we have to speak in hopeful terms we have to show love and empathy if we want smart leaders.
Interviewer,Then we have to be smart voters you know we cannot vote from a place of fear we have to vote from a place of openness so.
Michelle,We have to we have to model what we want and that's what you're saying you're doing mm-hm.
Interviewer,So what was it like when the trump's came to visit it was very pleasant it was very pleasant I mean it was a.
Michelle,Wonderful visit because this is a really great job you know we did you have any advice for it.
Interviewer,This is you know i didn't we didn't we talked about the kids but you know my offer to Milania was you know you really.
Michelle,Don't know what you don't know until you're here so the door is open as I've told her and as Laura Bush told me um.
Interviewer,You know and as other first lady's told me so I'm not new in this going high thing I mean I'm modeling I'm modeling.
Michelle,What was done for me by the bushes and Laura Bush was nothing but gracious and helpful and her team was right there for.
Interviewer,My team all throughout this entire eight year process and your team is doing the same we will do whatever they need to to.
Michelle,Help them succeed so that's one of the things I said to Melania when you get to a place when you can digest all this and.
Interviewer,You have questions because you know you don't have questions you know the day after the election it's just sort of.
Michelle,Like yeah you're looking on the house it's like well what do you want to know it's like I don't know what.
Interviewer,I should know and i knew that so my door is open and that that was really the nature of the the meeting coming up.
Michelle,Let's stop there yeah what did you say plus let let's not forget I just didn't wake up first lady.
Interviewer,And later that was one of those things that you just sort of think day you don't even know me.
Michelle, so how are you feeling right now you're packing up you're not physically packing.
Interviewer,Yourself well yeah i do a lot of pointing I'm not like boxing boxing things but.
Michelle,I'm doing a lot of but even when you're pointing you even when you're pointing cuz this happened to me when I was.
Interviewer,Leaving chicago you come across things and it's like oh I remember that I remember that well a lot of the books.
Michelle,You know books because we're going going through like my sign book from Nelson Mandela yes that's not being packed up.
Interviewer,Anywhere i'm gonna carry that with me i don't don't touch that book you know we have a lot of photo books and I think.
Michelle,You actually saw one i saw one of the photo books just now coming oh just imagine we do those all the time we do.
Interviewer,Them as you do look every year for your staff we do it every year Brock does one for his team for his entire senior team.
Michelle,We do one for family members sort of laying out the year that the girls had you know that's kind of a good Christmas.

Michelle,Were so little they were just looking through this year I was looking at your staff what I sent just looking through.
Interviewer,The book of this year mm-hmm so many events from college signing day going to have tea and lunch from the Queen so.
Michelle,Many meaningful school trips there so there's meaning and yet as I was going through the pages so much laughter oh.
Interviewer,Gosh yeah we're the happy side of the White House meaning and laughter yeah no no that was one of the things that I.
Michelle,Told my team when we first came in it's like we we because of the weight that the president has because of especially.
Interviewer,When he first came into office and we were dealing with a financial collapse that was unprecedented most people don't.
Michelle,Remember that um the country was little remember and a lot choose to forget exactly exactly.
Interviewer,That we're on the brink of financial we were on the brink and we entered an unprecedented recession and you're.
Michelle,Dealing with people losing their homes and we're in about their jobs and on and on and on and we sort of felt.
Interviewer,Like we need to be substantive but we also need to have a little levity you know Americans need a little joy and we.
Michelle,Were the joy masters and you did that in this house because sitting here in this house which represents many things first.
Interviewer,And foremost a seat of power but it was very clear that the image of you and your family rocked the world and then.
Michelle,You literally flung the doors open to everybody from every walk of life every ethnicity every kind of celebration we.
Interviewer,Wanted to change things up here in the White House hope it from the moment she moved in First Lady Michelle Obama made.
Michelle,It her mission to redefine the white House as a more inclusive House of the people he wanted to open the doors.
Interviewer,Really wide so a bunch of different folks who usually don't get access to this place she created an atmosphere of.
Michelle,Warmth by celebrating all cultures hello everyone knows let's animal Barack first lady's openness and acceptance led to a.
Interviewer,Flood of firsts on the white house staff the first man to ever serve as social secretary to the White House the first.
Michelle,Openly transgender staff member was hired and for the first time in history mrs. Obama opened a White House family.
Interviewer,Dining room to the public there she placed an expressionist painting by Alma Thomas the first work of art by an.
Michelle,African-american woman inside the white House it seemed that you all did that purposefully absolutely yeah absolutely.
Interviewer,And what why was that a priority because images experiences can be life-changing particularly for our kids and so many.
Michelle,Kids from so many backgrounds never get to do this kind of thing I mean you think of all the kids who live miles.
Interviewer,Away in anacostia who never get to set foot on that South Lawn who never get invited into these doors.
Michelle,And you know experience the magic that is the white house I thought of that the night all the Girl Scouts were out on.
Interviewer,Them yeah yeah you know and it's not just kids locally but kids all over the the country all over the world and quite.
Michelle,Frankly i love the look on their faces you know I mean some of it is selfish yes because well you know the joy is.
Interviewer,Gonna say the joy when somebody else feels something again right and for many young people you know getting to sit in.
Michelle,The state dining room and talk in the musicians and you know eating from our China and sitting in the East Room and.
Interviewer,Listening the alexander hamilton private performance I mean to see the joy the tears the you know we've changed their.
Michelle,Lives forever and so yeah that was purposeful that was necessary author Peter Slevin wrote this for the BBC.
Interviewer,About the unprecedented challenges that you faced he said first ladies arrive in the White House without a playbook they.
Michelle,Have no official duties no salary no official jobs let's stop there yeah what did you say first ladies arrive in.
Interviewer,The wake up okay yet the critics are ready to pounce from every point on the compass more so with the first.
Michelle,African-american first lady in a country that is anything but post-racial so you arrived here with great expectations and.
Interviewer,There were comments being made then and since that you said knock you back a bit what allowed you to stand in your own.
Michelle,Truth and find your way being a grown-up you know you know being you know I always said it to myself.
Interviewer,I this would be really hard if i were 20 or 30 and that's why I look at these young celebrities and I just feel for.
Michelle,Them because you have to be grown-up enough to know your self in this and that just takes time that's you know of.
Interviewer,Course i had great parents and i have a husband who loves me I have people all around me who affirm me look that helps.
Michelle,But just being straight-up grown-up helps because you know over the course of a professional career.
Interviewer,And let us not forget i just didn't wake up first lady I mean I went to law school I practice law I work for the.
Michelle,City i ran a non profit I was an executive at a hospital I've been in the world I've worked in every.
Interviewer,Sector and you don't do that without coming up against some stuff you know having your feelings hurt having people.
Michelle,Say things that aren't true you know and it's not just about race I mean you know it's just life Hitchin so.
Interviewer,Over the course of living you learn how to protect yourself in it you learn how to take in what you need and get rid of.
Michelle,The stuff that's clearly not true you know so I have a very good sense of who I am and my view to this stuff has.
Interviewer,Always been like it's always a challenge it's like oh you think that I'll show you cuz I'm gonna work so hard and I'm.
Michelle,Gonna be so on it yeah that my actions will speak for themselves and I don't have to say anything.
Interviewer,Coming up when you were labeled that angry black woman was that one of the things that knocked you back and later.
Michelle,Would you ever run for office  it made me wonder well does how are.
Interviewer,People seeing me or you might remember the onstage celebratory fist bump between me and my husband after a.
Michelle,Primary when that was referred to as a terrorist fist jab and over the years folks have used plenty of interesting.
Interviewer,Words to describe me once that i exhibited exhibited a little bit of uppity ism another notice that I was one.
Michelle,Of my husband's cronies of color cable news charmingly referred to me as Obama's baby mama this is what.
Interviewer,Chimamanda ngozi adichie wrote do you see that I did I like you know when I read that means I know you don't.
Michelle,Three pieces by rats one you should i read that one that was a pencil that this was in the New York Times recently.
Interviewer,And she said because she said what she thought and because she smiled only when she felt like smiling and not constantly.
Michelle,And vacuously america's cheapest caricature was cast on her the angry black woman mm-hmm that's what she said.
Interviewer,She said it well and she said it well but that was one of the most beautiful things I read about you I thought she.
Michelle,Summed it up for all of us but when you were labeled that angry black woman was that one of the things that knocked you.
Interviewer,Back and it's one of those things that you just sort of think day you don't even know me yeah you know I mean you.
Michelle,Just sort of feel like wow where did that come from yeah you know and that's the first blowback could you think well.
Interviewer,That is so not me but then you sort of think well this isn't about me this is about the person or the people who write.
Michelle,It you know i mean that that's just the truth it's like I always used to say it's just so it's so much about that and.
Interviewer,Then you start thinking oh wow mm we're so afraid of each other you know color wealth these things that don't matter.
Michelle,Still play too much of a role in how we see one another and it's sad because the the thing that least defines us as.
Interviewer,People is the color of our skin it's the it's the size of our bank account none of that matters you know this yes of.
Michelle,Course you know our it's our values it's how we live our lives and that was the blowback and then I thought okay well.
Interviewer,Let me live my life out loud so that people can then see and then judge for themselves you know how does it laugh.
Michelle,Out loud don't dial it back don't apologize dilute it don't apologize for it it speaks for itself.
Interviewer,So malia was 10 and sasha was 7 there were itty bittys and I remember one of the things that you said when I.
Michelle,Interviewed you eight years ago here you said either our stay here will make or break them.
Interviewer,Michelle calls the girls sasha and malia her proudest achievement she often said they're just two little girls trying to.
Michelle,Figure it out fifteen-year-old Sasha is in her second year of high school.
Interviewer,The obamas plan to stay in washington dc until she graduates 18 year old Malia will walk in her parents footsteps as a.
Michelle,Freshman at harvard university next fall were there moments were you thought they might be broken.
Interviewer,That's a good question you know i was so vigilant about this um I was I always had my ear to the ground I mean I talked.
Michelle,About this that the first year was really you know while we were doing work laying the foundation I'm on our.
Interviewer,Initiatives i mean i was really just cautiously making sure that they felt normal that they felt good um and I.
Michelle,Think they were okay now in the teenage years this is the time when you know kids start to bristle against all kinds.
Interviewer,Of authority imagine being 18 17 16 15 and you've got at least eight men with guns driving you around walking into.
Michelle,Your parties not letting you ride in your friends cars I mean there were those tensions for sure that we had to.
Interviewer,Sort of work through but as i reminded my girls it's like these aren't problems okay or they'll ease theirs I'm very.
Michelle,High class these are very high class rooms much security so memes Barack and I because of where.
Interviewer,We come from we just couldn't sympathize with there it's like girl you live in the White House you you're not gonna get.
Michelle,To complain about this coming up where do you think your greatest impact as first lady has been and later the next.
Interviewer,Family that comes in here their lives will be turned upside down you.
Michelle, with every song too long every laugh and daring style choice the.
Interviewer,Power of michelle obama's personality and authenticity has made her a pop culture icon why I'm in a bar yes.
Michelle,Whining about this work is there anything you wanted to do as a person you baby yeah how to do some cool things.
Interviewer,Like you know open a window as with all of the first lady's work there is a purpose behind all the fun exercise is.
Michelle,Not al the fresh approach shined a light on the initiative she felt most passionate about like healthy eating.
Interviewer,Everyone should have a healthy breakfast oh not me military families and one very near to.
Michelle,My heart educating girls all over the world so when you get here mm-hmm everybody beats with you and what.
Interviewer,Is going to be your initiative it feels like everything that you did came out of a personal space it felt like it was a.
Michelle,Real thing for you right do you think he moved the needle on childhood obesity yes yes I do I think we have I think and.
Interviewer,The we started talking about it exactly well the the when I first announced that we were gonna be working on childhood.
Michelle,Obesity i mean there were a number of people from all sides of the aisle you know they're feminists who thought well.
Interviewer,What's she doing out in the garden a woman who went to Harvard she should be doing X Y s everybody had their serve.
Michelle,This is too light this isn't a real issue or this is too weighty she'll never have be able to move the needle it.
Interviewer,Was it was a little bit of everything which is another reason why you can't take any of it seriously because.
Michelle,Everybody had something to say right i will take you the moment to get that that I can't pay attention to whatever.
Interviewer,Yeah i knew that coming in you did cuz just as a professional you know that if you want to get anything done you.
Michelle,Can't do everything and you're not gonna please everybody exactly you change the conversation really for the way we.
Interviewer,Looked at our military after teaming up with Jill Biden yeah that has been one of the greatest honors that we've had.
Michelle,Jill came to this issue differently than I because she is a blue star mom Beau wasn't the military so we're just funny.
Interviewer,How we and interesting i should say how we came to this issue from different vantage points but I always say every.
Michelle,American should spend some time in a military community yes I was going to ask you what being with those military.
Interviewer,Families um how did that enhance or enlighten your perspective I mean I knew you knew a lot going in right going into.
Michelle,This yeah it was important to have them as my inspiration because it made any challenges that we were looking at here.
Interviewer,In the white house with our chandeliers and our Butler's and our you know gowns and all that any complaints that I might.
Michelle,Have paled it was it seemed silly when i looked at some of these families you know dealing with their 8th and 9th.
Interviewer,Deployment you know with family members coming back in these the average military kid goes to eight nine ten.
Michelle,Schools over the course of their childhood and these kids are resilient these families are brave they do not.
Interviewer,Complain so when i would spend time in those communities I think I'm not complaining about nothing I'm gonna.
Michelle,Figure out how we live these people up how we tell their stories you know I get a little worked up that so you have to.
Interviewer,Just sort of calm on death so what do you think your greatest impact as first lady has been greatest impact that's.
Michelle,Hard to say that's one of those sort of I'm really good and let me tell you how you know I probably the greatest is just.
Interviewer,One of the greatest things when i see young women particularly african-american women but young women.
Michelle,Generally seeing somebody educated strong outspoken just seeing that on a regular basis it's exactly what I said.
Interviewer,On the way here in the car you then what did you say I said you're just being here being who you are being.
Michelle,Yourself and allowing the rest of us to see that made us feel that whatever it is you were we couldn't be that we.
Interviewer,Couldn't be in the white house but we wanted a little bit of that for ourselves coming up let me just tell.
Michelle,America this is hard Plus hope and whether or not you achieve that.
Interviewer,You I have to ask you this because when everybody found out I was gonna be.
Michelle,Interviewing you this question came up and I ever sang in no weevils oh it's not gonna happen but the people.
Interviewer,Seriously think that you are gonna run for office yeah yeah I don't I think some people think it's seriously and.
Michelle,Some people are just you know they're just hopeful and that's good hope is good but um yeah just that reaction.
Interviewer,Would you ever run for office i have to ask it no no County office no I I look that's one thing I don't do I don't make.
Michelle,Stuff up i'm not coy i haven't proven that I I'm pretty direct if I were interested in it I'd say it I don't.
Interviewer,Believe in playing games you know it's not something I would do but it also speaks to the fact that people don't.
Michelle,Really understand how hard this is and it's not something that you Kali really just sort of asked a family to do again.
Interviewer,Maybe cuz we got it wrong or we think we got it wrong so it's like well now you do it you just go back in there and do.
Michelle,It you're the closest thing to that so you do it um but let me just tell America this is hard it's a hard job I.
Interviewer,Set it on the campaign trail it requires a lot of sacrifice it is a weighty thing and it's not something that you even.
Michelle,Look to one family to take on at that level you know for that long of a period of.
Interviewer,Time it uses enough and 16 years would be right let's just you know 16 years I wouldn't do that to my kids yeah because.
Michelle,What people don't understand is that you run their lives stop at any age I mean the next family that comes in here every.
Interviewer,Person in that family every child every grandchild their lives will be turned upside down in a way that no American.
Michelle,Really understands and it's not for us to complain about it and so you don't hear complaints but it is a truth an.
Interviewer,Actuality that there is a weight to it yeah so the Democratic Party has not asked you to.
Michelle,Run for anything no no conversations I'm not having conversations no a conversation is like.
Interviewer,Two - a two-way street i don't know what they're talking about but I'm not talking back you're not gonna be talking.
Michelle,Back no no so your husband's administration um every everything the election was all.
Interviewer,About hope do you think that this administration achieved that yes I do because we feel the difference now yeah.
Michelle,See now we're feeling what not having hope feels like you know hope is necessary it's it's a necessary concept.
Interviewer,And barack didn't just talk about hope hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes I mean he and I.
Michelle,And so many believe that if you what else do you have if you don't have hope yeah what do you give your kids if you.
Interviewer,Can't give them hope you know our children respond to crises the way they see us respond you know it's like the.
Michelle,Toddler that bumps his head on the table and they look up at you to figure out whether it hurts and if you're like oh.
Interviewer,My god they're crying but if you're like you know what babe it's okay it's okay and I feel that way about the nation I.
Michelle,Feel that barack has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate having a grown up in the.
Interviewer,White house who can say to you in times of crisis and turmoil hey it's going to be okay let's remember the good things.
Michelle,That we have let's look at the future let's look at all the things that we're building all of this is important for.
Interviewer,Our kids to stay focused and to feel like their work isn't in vain that their lives aren't in vain what do we do if we.
Michelle,Don't have hope oprah what do we do we don't have hope is is cute oh hey you here.
Interviewer,Fancy meeting hey hope and whether or not you achieved that absolutely I was making that same point listen you ain't.
Michelle,Gonna see you how are you thanks for stopping behind Russ we were talking about hoping whether or.
Interviewer,Not your administration achieve that absolutely absolutely I feel hopeful what are you most hopeful about now the.
Michelle,Next generation okay the next generation you know we've talked about this history moves in.
Interviewer,Cycles and what lasts is the impact what we've done has had in people's minds and hearts that's a and that continues I.
Michelle,Want to ask you this so she change to be our first lady yeah we love her the approval ratings you can tell but she.
Interviewer,Was always your first lady yeah yeah what surprised even you about the way she took on this mantle of first lady.
Michelle,Ism you know we all knew she was brilliant and cute and strong and a great mom but I think the way in which.
Interviewer,She blended purpose and policy with fun uh-huh so that she was able to reach beyond.
Michelle,Washington on her healthcare initiatives on the military family work was masterful uh-huh.
