Interviewer,Can you tell us about your interactions with journalists and the press?
Snowden,"One of the most challenging things about the changing nature of the public's relationship to media and the government's relationship to media is that media has never been stronger than it is now. At the same time, the press is less willing to use that sort of power and influence because of its increasing commercialization. There was this tradition that the media culture we had inherited from early broadcasts was intended to be a public service. Increasingly we've lost that, not simply in fact, but in ideal, particularly due to the 24-hour news cycle."
Snowden,"We see this routinely even at organizations like The New York Times. The Intercept recently published The Drone Papers, which was an extraordinary act of public service on the part of a whistleblower within the government to get the public information that's absolutely vital about things that we should have known more than a decade ago. These are things that we really need to know to be able to analyze and assess policies. But this was denied to us, so we get one journalistic institution that breaks the story, they manage to get the information out there. But the majors-specifically The New York Times-don't actually run the story, they ignore it completely. This was so extraordinary that the public editor, Margaret Sullivan, had to get involved to investigate why they suppressed such a newsworthy story. It's a credit to the Times that they have a public editor, but it's frightening that there's such a clear need for one."
Interviewer,"Let's think about it in terms of your role in changing the world, which is presenting these new facts. There was a section of the technology press and the intelligence press who, at the time of the leaks, said we already know this, except it's hidden in plain sight. Yet, a year after you made the disclosures, there was a broad shift of public perception about surveillance technologies. That may recede, and probably post-Paris, it is receding a little bit. Are you frustrated that there isn't more long-term impact? Do you feel the world has not changed quickly enough?"
Snowden,"I actually don't feel that. I'm really optimistic about how things have gone, and I'm staggered by how much more impact there's been as a result of these revelations than I initially presumed. I'm famous for telling Alan Rusbridger that it would be a three-day story. You're sort of alluding to this idea that people don't really care, or that nothing has really changed. We've heard this in a number of different ways, but I think it actually has changed in a substantial way."
Snowden,"Now when we talk about the technical press, or the national security press, and you say, this is nothing new, we knew about this, a lot of this comes down to prestige, to the same kind of signaling where they have to indicate we have expertise, we knew this was going on. In many cases they actually did not. The difference is, they knew the capabilities existed."
Interviewer,"Former Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson has said her paper definitely made mistakes, ""I wish we had not withheld stories."" What you're saying certainly resonates with what I know and understand of the recent history of the US press, which is that national security concerns post-9/11 really did alter the relationship of reporting, particularly with administration and authority in this country. What we know about drone programs comes from reporting, some of it comes from the story which The Intercept got hold of, and Jeremy Scahill's reporting on it, which has been incredibly important. But a great deal of it has also come from the ground level. The fact that we were aware at all that drones were blowing up villages, killing civilians, crossing borders where they were not supposed to be really comes from people who would report from the ground."
Interviewer,"Something interesting has definitely happened in the last three years, which makes me think about what you are telling us about how the NSA operates. We're seeing a much closer relationship now between journalism and technology and mass communication technology than we've ever seen before. People are now completely reliant on Facebook. Some of that is a commercial movement in the US, but you also have activists and journalists being regularly tortured or killed in, say, Bangladesh, where it's really impossible to operate a free press, but they are using these tools. It is almost like the American public media now is Facebook. I wonder how you think about this? It's such a recent development."
Snowden,"One of the biggest issues is that we have many more publishers competing for a finite, shrinking amount of attention span that's available. This is why we have the rise of these sort of hybrid publications, like a BuzzFeed, that create just an enormous amount of trash and cruft. They're doing AB testing and using scientific principles. Their content is specifically engineered to be more attention getting, even though they have no public value at all. They have no news value at all. Like here's 10 pictures of kittens that are so adorable. But then they develop a news line within the institution, and the idea is that they can drive traffic with this one line of stories, theoretically, and then get people to go over onto the other side."
Snowden,"Someone's going to exploit this; if it's not going to be BuzzFeed, it's going to be somebody else. This isn't a criticism of any particular model, but the idea here is that the first click, that first link is actually consuming attention. The more we read about a certain thing, that's actually reshaping our brains. Everything that we interact with, it has an impact on us, it has an influence, it leaves memories, ideas, sort of memetic expressions that we then carry around with us that shape what we look for in the future, and that are directing our development."
Interviewer,"Yes, well that's the coming singularity between the creation of journalism and large-scale technology platforms, which are not intrinsically journalistic. In other words, they don't have a primary purpose."
Snowden,"They don't have a journalistic role, it's a reportorial role."
Interviewer,"Well, it's a commercial role, right? So when you came to Glenn and The Guardian, there wasn't a hesitation in knowing the primary role of the organization is to get that story to the outside world as securely and quickly as possible, avoiding prior restraint, protecting a source."
Interviewer,Is source protection even possible now? You were extremely prescient in thinking there's no point in protecting yourself.
Snowden,I have an unfair advantage.
Interviewer,"You do, but still, that's a big change from 20 years ago."
Snowden,"This is something that we saw contemporary examples of in the public record in 2013. It was the James Rosen case where we saw the Department of Justice, and government more broadly, was abusing its powers to demand blanket records of email and call data, and the AP case where phone records for calls that were made from the bureaus of journalism were seized."
Snowden,"That by itself is suddenly chilling, because the traditional work of journalism, the traditional culture, where the journalist would just call their contact and say, hey, let's talk, suddenly becomes incriminating. But more seriously, if the individual in question, the government employee who is working with a journalist to report some issue of public interest, if this individual has gone so far to commit an act of journalism, suddenly they can be discovered trivially if they're not aware of this."
Interviewer,"Right, but that's kind of what happened with the reporting of the story."
Snowden,"And in ways that I didn't even predict, because who could imagine the way a story like that would actually get out of hand and go even further"
Interviewer,"You're actually giving a sophisticated analysis of much of what's happened to both reporting practice and media structures. As you say, you had no prior interactions with journalists. I think one of the reasons the press warmed to you was because you put faith in journalists, weirdly. You went in thinking I think I can trust these people, not just with your life, but with a huge responsibility. Then you spent an enormous amount of time, particularly with Glenn, Laura, and Ewen  in those hotel rooms. What was that reverse frisking process like as you were getting to know them? My experience is as people get closer to the press, they often like it less. Why would you trust journalists?"
Snowden,"This gets into the larger question-how did you feel about journalists, what was the process of becoming acquainted with them? There's both a political response and a practical response. Specifically about Glenn, I believe very strongly that there's no more important quality for a journalist than independence. That's independence of perspective, and particularly skepticism of claims. The more powerful the institution, the more skeptical one should be. There's an argument that was put forth by an earlier journalist, I.F. Stone"
Interviewer,"I hope they're not using Microsoft Office, but you never know."
Snowden,They have the blank page ....
Interviewer,"They have the blank page, exactly."
Snowden,"In their content management system, or whatever. How is that individual going to approach this collection of facts in the next week, in the next month, in the next year, in the next decade? What will the professor in the journalism school say in their lecture that will impart these values, again, sort of memetically into the next cohort of reporters? If we do not win on that, we have lost comprehensively. More fundamentally, people say, why did you trust the press, given their failures? Given the fact that I was, in fact, quite famous for criticizing the press."
Interviewer,"If they had done their job, you would be at home now."
Snowden,"Yeah, I would still be living quite comfortably in Hawaii."
Interviewer,"Which is not so bad, when you put it that way."
Snowden,"People ask how could you do this, why would you do this? How could you trust a journalist that you knew had no training at all in operational security to keep your identity safe because if they screw up, you're going to jail. The answer was that that was actually what I was expecting. I never expected to make it out of Hawaii. I was going to try my best, but my ultimate goal was simply to get this information back in the hands of the public. I felt that the only way that could be done meaningfully was through the press. If we can't have faith in the press, if we can't sort of take that leap of faith and either be served well by them, or underserved and have the press fail, we've already lost. You cannot have an open society without open communication. Ultimately, the test of open communication is a free press. If they can't look for information, if they can't contest the government's control of information, and ultimately print information-not just about government, but also about corporate interests, that has a deleterious impact on the preferences of power, on the prerogatives of power. You may have something, but I would argue it's not the traditional American democracy that I believed in."
Interviewer,"So nothing you experienced in the room with the team, or what happened after, made you question or reevaluate journalism?"
Snowden,"I didn't say that. Actually working more closely with the journalists has radically reshaped my understanding of journalism, and that continues through to today. I think you would agree that anybody who's worked in the news industry, either directly or even peripherally, has seen journalists-or, more directly, editors-who are terrified, who hold back a story, who don't want to publish a detail, who want to wait for the lawyers, who are concerned with liability."
Snowden,"You also have journalists who go out on their own and they publish details which actually are damaging, directly to personal safety. There were details published by at least one of the journalists that were discussing communication methods that I was still actively using, that previously had been secret. But the journalists didn't even forewarn me, so suddenly I had to change all of my methods on the fly. Which worked out OK because I had the capabilities to do that, but dangerous."
Interviewer,When did that happen?
Snowden,"This was at the height of public interest, basically. The idea here is that a journalist ultimately, and particularly a certain class of journalist, they don't owe any allegiance to their source, right? They don't write the story in line with what the sources desires, they don't go about their publication schedule to benefit, or to detriment, in theory, the source at all. There are strong arguments that that's the way it should be"
Snowden,"That's just being careful, right? But ask yourself-should journalists be just as careful when the one facing the blowback of a particular detail is their own source? In my experience, the answer does not seem to be as obvious as you might expect."
Interviewer,Do you foresee a world where someone won't have to be a whistleblower in order to reveal the kinds of documents that you revealed? What kinds of internal mechanisms would that require on behalf of the government? What would that look like in the future?
Snowden,"That's a really interesting philosophical question. It doesn't come down to technical mechanisms, that comes down to culture. We've seen in the EU a number of reports from parliamentary bodies, from the Council of Europe, that said we need to protect whistleblowers, in particular national security whistleblowers. In the national context no country really wants to pass a law that allows individuals rightly, or wrongly, to embarrass the government. But can we provide an international framework for this? One would argue, particularly when espionage laws are being used to prosecute people, they already exist. That's why espionage, for example, is considered a political offense, because it's just a political crime, as they say. That's a fairly weak defense, or fairly weak justification, for not reforming whistleblower laws. Particularly when, throughout Western Europe they're going, yeah, we like this guy, he did a good thing. But if he shows up on the doorstep we're going to ship him back immediately, regardless of whether it's unlawful, just because the US is going to retaliate against us. It's extraordinary that the top members of German government have said this on the record-that it's realpolitik; it's about power, rather than principle."
Snowden,"Now how we can fix this? I think a lot of it comes down to culture, and we need a press that's more willing and actually eager to criticize government than they are today. Even though we've got a number of good institutions that do that, or that want to do that, it needs a uniform culture. The only counterargument the government has made against national security whistleblowing, and many other things that embarrassed them in the past, is that well, it could cause some risk, we could go dark, they could have blood on their hands."
Interviewer,"But Ed, when you talk about this in those terms, you make it sound as though you see this as a progression. Certainly there was a sharp increase, as you demonstrated, in overreach of oversight post-9/11. Is it a continuum?"
Interviewer,"It felt from the outside as though America, post-9/11, for understandable reasons, it was almost like a sort of national psychosis. If you grew up in Europe, there were regular terrorist acts in almost every country after the Second World War, though not on the same scale, until there was a brief, five-year period of respite, weirdly running up to about 2001. Then the nature of the terrorism changed. To some extent, that narrative is predictable. You talk about it as an ever increasing problem. With the Freedom Act in 2015, the press identified this as a significant moment where the temperature had changed. You don't sound like you really think that. You sound as though you think that this public/private secrecy, spying, is an increasing continuum. So how does that change? Particularly in the current political climate where post-Paris and other terrorist attacks we've already seen arguments for breaking encryption."
Snowden,"I don't think they are actually contradictory views to hold. I think what we're talking about are the natural inclinations of power and vice, what we can do to restrain it, to maintain a free society. So when we think about where things have gone in the USA Freedom Act, and when we look back at the 1970s, it was even worse in terms of the level of comfort that the government had that it could engage in abuses and get away with them. One of the most important legacies of 2013 is not anything that was necessarily published, but it was the impact of the publication on the culture of government. It was a confirmation coming quite quickly in the wake of the WikiLeaks stories, which were equally important in this regard. That said, secrecy will not hold forever. If you authorize a policy that is clearly contrary to law, you will eventually have to explain that."
Snowden,"The question is, can you keep it under wraps long enough to get out of the administration, and hopefully for it to be out of the egregious sort of thing where you'll lose an election as a result. We see the delta between the periods of time that successive administrations can keep a secret is actually diminishing-the secrets are becoming public at an accelerated pace. This is a beneficial thing. This is the same in the context of terrorism."
Interviewer,What do you think about the relationship between governments asking Facebook and other communications platforms to help fight ISIS?
Snowden,"Should we basically deputize companies to become the policy enforcers of the world? When you put it in that context suddenly it becomes clear that this is not really a good idea, particularly because terrorism does not have a strong definition that's internationally recognized. If Facebook says, we will take down any post from anybody who the government says is a terrorist, as long as it comes from this government, suddenly they have to do that for the other government. The Chinese allegations of who is and who is not a terrorist are going to look radically different than what the FBI's are going to be. But if the companies try to be selective about them, say, well, we're only going to do this for one government, they immediately lose access to the markets of the other ones. So that doesn't work, and that's not a position companies want to be in."
Snowden,"However, even if they could do this, there are already policies in place for them to do that. If Facebook gets a notification that says this is a terrorist thing, they take it down. It's not like this is a particularly difficult or burdensome review when it comes to violence."
