Interviewer,I get my sense of spirituality through connection and what Twitter represents is spiritual to me tapping into the.
Dorsey,Consciousness the larger organism whether it be the plan at the universe the social consciousness is what drives.
Interviewer,Me there's a lot of power to seeing you know how people think in ways that make us feel great and also things that are.
Dorsey,Super uncomfortable because we need to be able to ignore in person or have a conversation about it and there is no.
Interviewer,Other path towards evolution and making something better unless we can talk about it that's Jack Dorsey and this is.
Dorsey,The retro podcast the rich roll podcast hey everybody how you guys doing what's happening my name.
Interviewer,Is rich roll i am your host this is my podcast and today my guest is Jack Dorsey jack is the co-founder and CEO of.
Dorsey,Both twitter and square and somebody who I think it's fair to say quite incontrovertibly has become one of the.
Interviewer,Most influential figures of the modern age somebody who has made this crazy indelible impact on the cultural.
Dorsey,Landscape by really helping shape the way that we communicate as a culture Jack has been doing the podcast rounds.
Interviewer,Lately he's had recent appearances on a wide variety of shows including sam harris two appearances on Joe Rogan Ben.
Dorsey,Greenfield the other day and several more and I listened to all of them and I realized that jack is a polarizing.
Interviewer,Figure for many but on a personal level I have to say I found him to be quite transparent somebody who has been open.
Dorsey,About twitter's failures the challenges that he and his organization have faced continue to face as well as incredibly.
Interviewer,Composed under the pressure of being held accountable for his platforms shortcomings and my sense is that his.
Dorsey,Response to many of the hard questions that are being posed to him that have been being posed to him on all of these.
Interviewer,Podcasts and interviews have left a lot of critics feeling unsatisfied and I guess what I want to say is that if you.
Dorsey,Are such a person one of these people then I'm not sure this podcast is gonna change that view because my interest was.
Interviewer,Less on retreading the territory that was explored at length on Rogen nor was it an attempt to hold him to account in.
Dorsey,The way that tim poole did on joe show instead or rather my intention for this conversation was simply to better.
Interviewer,Understand this human behind the curtain in other words what does it actually feel like to be.
Dorsey,At the helm of one of the largest and most powerful social media platforms on the planet what is a day in the life of.
Interviewer,Jack dorsey looked like and what daily self-care practises does he employed a mitigate the stress of his.
Dorsey,Responsibilities and just how did this young man blaze such an incredible extraordinary entrepreneurial path it's.
Interviewer,These kind of questions that inform how I approached this conversation I first met Jack about two years ago and because.
Dorsey,He had tweeted out a few episodes of the podcast I knew he was at least an occasional listener of this show so when.
Interviewer,I found myself in san francisco i deemed him to see if he wanted to meet up and he invited me to square the square.
Dorsey,Headquarters and what i discovered when I met him was a person quite different than what you might imagine he was.
Interviewer,Sitting on an open staircase by himself with a cup of tea at the far end of this giant open floor plan office space he.
Dorsey,Told me he doesn't even have a proper office and I just found this person to be very soft-spoken kind curious and I.
Interviewer,Guess i realized that that this is somebody who is an animal altogether different from the typical alpha startup.
Dorsey,Ceo mold and i liked him instantly and although our encounter was brief Jack left me kind of intrigued I wanted to.
Interviewer,Better understand who he is and what led him to this rarefied air and really what makes him tick so when he began showing.
Dorsey,Up on all these podcasts i reached out to him he invited me to his home in San Francisco and and this is where it got.
Interviewer,Really interesting unsurprisingly he has a beautiful home it's very well appointed but what was surprising was.
Dorsey,Its modesty considering his essentially unlimited resources it's very minimal almost Spartan there's no entourage it's.
Interviewer,No private chef he cooks his own meals no you know there's no Lamborghini collection there wasn't even an.
Dorsey,Assistant there was just jack completely unpretentious barefoot excited to show me his Inn.
Interviewer,At sauna is cold plunge the kitchen counter where he works from a tunnel a couple days a week you know all in all a.
Dorsey,Man who is very intentionally and mindfully stripped excess materialism and distraction away from his life.
Interviewer,Somebody who prioritizes solitude contemplation meditation he meditates at least an hour a day and a whole wide.
Dorsey,Variety of self-care practices all designed to optimize deep thinking and equanimity including the fact that he.
Interviewer,Walks five miles to work every single day and I guess what I'm trying to say is I found his intentionality that he.
Dorsey,Brings to his life is discipline his curiosity his presence of mine I found it all admirable he's a truly truly.
Interviewer,Fascinating guy living a very unusual life so this conversation is really an exploration of that life we do cover how.
Dorsey,Twitter was conceived the responsibilities of logistics the challenges involved in shaping and.
Interviewer,Policing the behemoth platform that sees about 500 million tweets every day and how he envisions the evolution of this.
Dorsey,Platform the impact of twitter on culture and how he would ultimately kind of close a conversation with how he.
Interviewer,Would disrupt and innovate the podcast space and his answer is very interesting on that point but mostly this was just.
Dorsey,My attempt to understand jack and some of the habits practices and strategies that he employs including the opposite.
Interviewer,Of meditation intermittent fasting so many more things to navigate his most uncommon life as one of the most.
Dorsey,Influential figures of our time final note because it took place at Jack's home we did not video this program and.
Interviewer,You might hear a little crackling in the background it's because we were sitting at the forefront like next to his.
Dorsey,Fireplace so we had a live fire as we discussed it it was all very nice so this is me and Jack Dorsey.
Interviewer,Thank you for inviting me to your home thanks for taking time on a Saturday Saturday afternoon it's raining outside.
Dorsey,We're sitting by a crackling fire in a code who we are in the cloud I feel like I'm in Big Sur overlooking the ocean.
Interviewer,Here so if you hear waves crashing or seagulls or the crackling of the fire over here that kind of just should.
Dorsey,Create a visual palette so where we are right now and we just did a little meditation five-minute meditation to set.
Interviewer,The stage which was great I feel good feel good me too so I think that's a natural segue into talking a.
Dorsey,Little bit about meditation in your life I know you've been meditating for like twenty years and it's something that is.
Interviewer,Important to you so what is what is the practice look like for you yeah I um I started playing with meditation about 20.
Dorsey,Years ago it wasn't that serious and i think the the the most I you know I actually practiced within that time.
Interviewer,Frame was you know probably 20-30 minutes and wasn't really aware of a lot of the theories and some of the the.
Dorsey,Focus that i needed until about two years ago when I went to my first event possum of course I went to this little.
Interviewer,Town just south of dallas and did a ten day silent meditation retreat and it was one of the hardest but also one of the.
Dorsey,Most rewarding things i've ever done and one of the practices of impasto is to do one of these retreats every year but.
Interviewer,Also to carry through with your practice you do two hours a day one hour in the morning one hour in the evening before.
Dorsey,Before bed and the i mean what it's what it's done for me is is really just a sense of clarity certainly certainly.
Interviewer,Want to focus certainly one of recognizing when I'm reacting to some which has this you know momentum of not.
Dorsey,Feeling necessarily in control but as i did it you know at the end of last year I just went even deeper into that.
Interviewer,Clarity and was you know instantly reminded of the year prior and you you I had this experience where I just felt.
Dorsey,Like i was picking up where i where he left off and that was really powerful to me so for me every single day it's a.
Interviewer,Time to build self-awareness and that's what it comes down to yeah it's something I've been interested in doing.
Dorsey,For some time yet i have yet to go - yeah attending one of those retreats they're scary yeah well I know it I have.
Interviewer,Plenty of friends who have done it and from what I understand it's it's around that day five day six area that you get.
Dorsey,Into you know that make-or-break period where you start to freak out Dave for is really hard because you go into this.
Interviewer,Mode called strong determination and up until day four you're basically focusing on your breath and it's not just the.
Dorsey,Concept of the breath it's actually the physical sensation of the breath it's a physical sensation of the breath on your.
Interviewer,Upper lip and through your nostrils and that was a huge unlock for me but on day four you go into the impasto training.
Dorsey,And strong determination which means that you are encouraged not to move at all.
Interviewer,You you you know you're sitting in a lotus or a half Lotus position and you shouldn't be shifting around or moving.
Dorsey,Your posture and then your way whatsoever and that becomes extremely challenging but also a good reflection.
Interviewer,Into what the practice actually is because you'll at least for me my experience was you know my legs were.
Dorsey,Just killing me i the the urge to move is is almost unbearable and through that through observing that pain and choosing.
Interviewer,Deciding not to react to it you apply that concept in that methodology to everything to emotions to physical pain.
Dorsey,To mental hardships and and being able to recognize it I'm on it and train it you know for those next few days is uh.
Interviewer,Is is really powerful but day six was my worst day the morning I was a you know I looked I you meditate with other people.
Dorsey,But you know you're not allowed to talk you're not allowed to read to write to do any physical exercise to look anyone.
Interviewer,In the eye it's the conditions are such that you feel like you're on a retreat by.
Dorsey,Yourself and on day six i cannot kind of looked around in the hall and everyone just looked like a Buddha base they all.
Interviewer,They all look like they were they were already enlightened it I got it I heard out I don't get this I like I I'm not.
Dorsey,I'm not getting it but at the end of day six you do these discourses at the end where there's some insight into the.
Interviewer,Theory and and a little bit into the practice and something the teacher said just unlock something for me so the last.
Dorsey,Meditation of the day at 9:00 p.m. or 8:30 was um was one of my best and I walked out and I just felt so much peace.
Interviewer,And so much joy and i cried and then i fell asleep and I walked back up at four in the morning and was back into the.
Dorsey,Pain back into not understanding what i was doing which again is part of the practice where you you you can't hang on.
Interviewer,Something you can't react overly to something that's negative and you can't react overly to something that's.
Dorsey,Positive either you want have a calamity between in in in in the entire spectrum right and something about becoming an.
Interviewer,Observer of that pain or that discomfort or that jubilation creating some distance between yourself and that.
Dorsey,Experience i think is where the teachable moment where you can kind of mind that equanimity absolutely right.
Interviewer,Yeah absolutely and you know it's just ten days of working from 4:00 in the morning until 9:30 mm-hmm focused.
Dorsey,Entirely on that in real you you won't get it right away and it's just this that the most important thing.
Interviewer,Is is the is the practice of it not reaching any particular milestone or state it's just that constant practice.
Dorsey,So you stepped it up this year and you went to Myanmar you know to do as opposed to Texas for another silent.
Interviewer,Meditation retreat and on your return from that experience you decided to share this and in a threaded tweet what.
Dorsey,Your experience was and that like became like a thing there were a lot of people that jumped on you for not addressing.
Interviewer,The atrocities of the government when you know I it was interesting because I read it and I I felt like you were just.
Dorsey,Sharing this experience that you had it was it was certainly in a political you know motivation behind that but I guess.
Interviewer,When you're jack you have to be much more mindful about yeah you choose your words and and how you decide to describe.
Dorsey,These experiences yeah i am so after my first meditation in Texas first I met you know this amazing teacher there and.
Interviewer,That goenka know not going to go inca passed away I ever maybe maybe even ten years ago and so he has all these.
Dorsey,Assistant teachers that lead you through the the courses and I met one of the assistant teachers and became friends.
Interviewer,With him and you know i was talking about going you know doing where should I do my next meditation and we discussed.
Dorsey,Myanmar burma because that is where Kalinka is from that is where a lot of the practice that I was practicing has.
Interviewer,Been kept in a very pure form in terms of the the writings but also the the physical practice and after my first.
Dorsey,Meditation in texas i had one tweet and I just I didn't feel I was ready to to talk about it I didn't feel it was.
Interviewer,Appropriate because i don't i didn't feel I had experienced enough to the depth that I I could communicate in a.
Dorsey,Way that resonated with people mm-hmm but after this after the second retreat in Myanmar I felt I felt more.
Interviewer,Ready it was um it was completely different I mean it was I went in a day before into into Myanmar I immediately.
Dorsey,Went to the center and we started meditating and I I left two days after and I I was there as Jack not.
Interviewer,Representing square or twitter i was there to focus on myself because I think one of the most important things I.
Dorsey,Believe that i have a responsibility to both our employees and also the people that we we serve on on the on the.
Interviewer,Platforms is self-improvement constant self-improvement I've identified this as at least this practice is something that.
Dorsey,Makes me a lot stronger a lot more resilient a lot more aware and able to approach my work with a lot more clarity.
Interviewer,And discipline so i went because of the you know the the practice is lineage within within that within that country.
Dorsey,And within that people and within the culture and wasn't really thinking enough about the surrounding.
Interviewer,Circumstances of the country and the people and you know I think the the misstep was not even addressing that.
Dorsey,Focusing entirely on meditation that was my intent which was to focus this entirely on my my experience and if it.
Interviewer,Resonates with people it does if it doesn't it doesn't and you know I think it it did resonate with folks but there.
Dorsey,Was there was an ask to just be more aware of the surroundings shine more light on that and and I I get all that.
Interviewer,That the benefit is i did have a lot of social groups reach out to me immediately after and folks come to me.
Dorsey,To at least converse about you know what is happening and what has changed and there.
Interviewer,Are multiple atrocities within the country not not just the one that it's tend to be focused on yeah yeah so I've.
Dorsey,Learned since you know a bunch of the dynamics and and and you know some other ways I might be able to help but I'm.
Interviewer,Still i'm still and uh i'm still in the learning phase where you know just where can I actually apply myself and and and.
Dorsey,Help and and drive more the conversation within the within the country so it touched me and it it's something that I.
Interviewer,Will definitely be top of mind for for quite some time but I think it was but it was important for next time yeah it.
Dorsey,Was important for me to also see that in person and experience in person rather than read it through text Sarita through.
Interviewer,The the major media channels and see the people and one of the biggest surprises I had was every single monk I saw every.
Dorsey,Every nun i ran into had a had a cell phone and Facebook is the Internet it's similar to you know when back in.
Interviewer,The day when aol was the internet for many people it wasn't about a web browser it was you know the way in was.
Dorsey,Was aol and and facebook was that for for nearly everyone in the in the country you didn't you don't see URLs.
Interviewer,You don't see website addresses you see Facebook pages and it's just so dominant and I didn't have that understanding and.
Dorsey,I don't think i would have the depth of understanding unless I actually went there and experienced it myself.
Interviewer,And what do you extract from that the fact that you know Facebook is the internet they're like what you know what.
Dorsey,Is that vote for the future what does that mean having um having grown up with the internet in st. Louis Missouri I was.
Interviewer,A hacker early on and in my life you know 12 13 14 and save us had this thriving.
Dorsey,Hacker community and it was a you know it had a lot of the punk ethos had a lot of the technology through later had a.
Interviewer,Bunch of the hip-hop ethos in terms of just questioning everything working in public sharing everything sharing all.
Dorsey,The mistakes not being centralized at all I think there's elements that are that.
Interviewer,Are certainly dangerous to that i am definitely skeptical of centralized organizations even my own even Twitter.
Dorsey,And square you know i think the internet more than anything else has allowed us to remove so many barriers and.
Interviewer,Boundaries that can tend to be artificial and and and this promise of at least providing the framework and the.
Dorsey,Infrastructure towards a understanding of a of one humanity like we have the technology to.
Interviewer,Do this and it started in 1979 and the ideals just get stronger and stronger and stronger so starting with a more.
Dorsey,Decentralized medium and and you know the recent flow towards more centralization such as Google and.
Interviewer,Youtube and facebook and twitter and square is something I'm very very cognizant of and also i I don't discount.
Dorsey,The the power and and also the skepticism and lack of trust that people have in organizations like ours so I.
Interviewer,Think on the positive it does breed a healthy skepticism and distrust which i think is useful to push companies like.
Dorsey,Ours to be a lot more open and pushed towards more towards more Internet ideals but there's certainly a hard road.
Interviewer,To get there but i i would want to see a place like Mia Mar to have more entry points.
Dorsey,Than just facebook obviously right at the same time they've gotten a lot of people on who were not on before and and.
Interviewer,On the network and i think we have to weigh the trade-offs of you know that getting people on the on-ramp into this.
Dorsey,Global network and and the custodian that does it and then hopefully hold organizations like my own to account in.
Interviewer,Terms of making sure that they see all the pathways in and out and and have optionality right.
Dorsey,I feel like this you know desire to hold yourself and and your companies to to account for this is sort of part and.
Interviewer,Parcel of this you know for lack of a better phrase like podcast or that you've been on lately.
Dorsey,You know out of the blue all of a sudden you've made yourself available to talk to all manner of people you've been on.
Interviewer,Tons of shows no no no i don't know a lot I mean you did one yesterday crypto one yesterday I know you've done Sam.
Dorsey,Harris joe rogan i think you're going back to talk to Joe you did Bill Simmons clearly there's a conscious decision.
Interviewer,Here too to step out and share your perspective in a transparent way and my sense of this is that you've done that.
Dorsey,With a large degree of equanimity I think the equanimity was seen in that exchange with Kara Swisher where you did.
Interviewer,That experiment and conversation by doing it on Twitter you maintained your cool under fire like I in that I saw.
Dorsey,Meditation coming to the front in the way that you managed all of that but just the fact that you're making.
Interviewer,Yourself available for these conversations I find interesting and so I think the first I have two questions.
Dorsey,On that the first is you know what is you know what was behind this decision to do this and and you know right now.
Interviewer,Yeah i i mean i have a i've had a few goals with us one I'm a student of conversation and Twitter's purpose in.
Dorsey,The world is to serve the public conversation and in the light I am aware that I'm absolutely.
Interviewer,Terrible at at it and i am vibrator that why do you say that well I you know I was um when I was a kid I had a speech.
Dorsey,Impediment and i went through a lot of speech therapy I couldn't pronounce most words I just sound like gibberish was.
Interviewer,Coming out of my mouth and to some people that still may be the case but I I really hold back because of that.
Dorsey,Awareness that i was dysfunctional in some way in communicating with people and I became extremely shy I've always.
Interviewer,Been an introvert meaning that i get most of my energy from solitude versus actually works getting a lot of their.
Dorsey,Energy from being around people so i die naturally at that predisposition towards being more quiet and being more in.
Interviewer,Solitude but that really pushed me into a very very shy place where you know even conversations my parents and.
Dorsey,Brothers were were somewhat limited and eventually I realized it in fifth or sixth grade and I just said like I can't.
Interviewer,Function like this and they joined the speech club and I joined the debate club and I did the things I just freak to.
Dorsey,Freak me out but that's still that's still lingers you know I still AM hyper aware of how I'm talking and you know.
Interviewer,Just a little bit of uncomfort in my own skin and conversation but I wanna I think I think my the characteristics.
Dorsey,That have made me realize some of the milestones I want in my life and some of the excess success I've realized is that.
Interviewer,I will put myself in very uncomfortable situations I will be patient with myself and I will learn super fast so I I felt.
Dorsey,Number one that podcasting was a great way to do that it's something I'm a huge consumer of I you know my walks in the.
Interviewer,Morning it's what I listen to it's it's when I take the most joy in and in the morning and I.
Dorsey,Just get so much so much out of them that I also wanted to understand the format much more directly and then.
Interviewer,Second we we don't talk enough out in the open about what we're seeing how we're thinking why and we do that in you.
Dorsey,Know articles and and the traditional press but there's something about podcasting to me that just allows much.
Interviewer,Much more nuance and just some time to breathe and and I think the thing I enjoy certainly compared to Twitter.
Dorsey,We'll talk about the irony that that that you're gun-shy about conversation when you know facilitating conversation.
Interviewer,Is the core you know foundational goal of Twitter itself I yeah I don't know if it's the gun shy that I feel I just I.
Dorsey,Know that um i know i want to master it and I I wanna I want to get really great at it and I know I have a long way to go.
Interviewer,Not just in conversations like this but also personally as well if I could study one thing that also serves my company.
Dorsey,Given our role than amazing so I you know I I think the the thing I love most about podcasts going back to.
Interviewer,My introvert misses conversations like this where you can actually hear the silence between thoughts and like just.
Dorsey,The the amount of time that people take to think and there's just so much fatality within that silence that I find.
Interviewer,Intriguing and interesting and there's just a rhythm that I'm trying to understand and and in a master as well.
Dorsey,So so that's a big part of it a lot of it this year has has you know honestly been you know somewhat reactive people.
Interviewer,We've we've we don't have a strategist in terms of like who we've been talking to who I've been talking to.
Dorsey,A lot of folks have been asking me for quite some time and I pushed it off and just been kind of going down the queue.
Interviewer,And and and i'm also you know happy to meet a bunch of the folks that I listen to all the time like I'm I'm going to be.
Dorsey,Going on ben green fields pretty soon and I listen to every single one of its podcasts and and I think I learned so.
Interviewer,Much from him and i so i'm excited personally just to just get into it with him I have no idea what we'll talk about.
Dorsey,Because he is so health health focused it's gonna be so I would imagine be really granular on like your date you.
Interviewer,Know daily practices yeah which i'm also excited to talk about because I don't I don't get to talk about that a lot with.
Dorsey,The exception of my friends and some of my co-workers who just think I'm the weirdest person in the world well we're.
Interviewer,Gonna get into it a little bit probably not to the extent that Ben well but I think that that you know your.
Dorsey,Observations are correct i mean in many ways I see podcasts as an antidote to what ails Twitter because it provides.
Interviewer,That space for nuance and i think anybody is hard pressed to walk away from a conscientious mature mindful.
Dorsey,Long-form podcast between two people even if you completely disagree with that person's worldview it's almost like.
Interviewer,Because we're empathetic creatures were able to see the shared humanity and I think that's something that that that.
Dorsey,Twitter just isn't built for yeah ways i want to you know I want us to figure this out cuz I I think I don't think.
Interviewer,It's just voice or video that creates empathy I'd text certainly can create the same I think we have not unlocked.
Dorsey,That from an experience standpoint from a pacing standpoint I think we've provided exactly the wrong incentives on.
Interviewer,The on the service and what i mean by that is when you open up the app what are we inherently telling you to do.
Dorsey,Implicitly you know what what are you what are we getting you through the arrangement.
Interviewer,Of the buttons through the numbers and the metrics that we provide we're giving people guidelines in terms of what they.
Dorsey,Should optimize for and i think right now they're completely wrong like you know we we made a decision quite some.
Interviewer,Time ago to make the size of your your follower count bold and big on your profile page and we have this like.
Dorsey,Button we have retweet we haven't really opined on the ordering of those of those.
Interviewer,Actions and and what what that means so when we when we built this you know we we discovered these features and these.
Dorsey,Gaps and then we put them on the interface and I don't think we gave it enough consideration because we didn't.
Interviewer,Have we didn't have this focus on this on this purpose of conversation there was some of it was reactive to our peers.
Dorsey,Some of it was looking at good ideas over there and putting it in in our service but we're taking time now to.
Interviewer,Step back and say like how do we truly serve a public conversation not just people posting not people posting quick.
Dorsey,Takes or hot takes or outrage but like how do we how do we incentivize more contribution that is healthy to the.
Interviewer,Network and and and this is a concept that we're really spending a lot of time thinking about is this concept of.
Dorsey,Conversational health and what that means and it's one of the reasons I'm I'm fascinated for my own personal.
Interviewer,Health and why i get into all the practices like meditation that I do is because I feel that there is something.
Dorsey,To being able to understand when a conversation is healthy or not and I know it because like we've all had we've.
Interviewer,All had conversations that feel toxic and you just want to walk away from it we've had conversations that feel really.
Dorsey,Empowering and inspiring and you you wish they lasted for hours and hours and hours and if if we can if we can feel.
Interviewer,That i feel we can also quantify it enough that we can understand at scale what.
Dorsey,These things look like and and what what actions have the greatest potential to create more of them and so right now.
Interviewer,We're just you know we're in this phase where we're trying to understand what it means to measure whether an online.
Dorsey,Digital conversation is healthy or not and so what are the technological parameters by which you would adjudicate.
Interviewer,The health of a conversation we're we started with probably the best way to articulate this is is the body metaphor.
Dorsey,And you know we we have all these indicators of health on our body one is you know just the flush nests of your.
Interviewer,Face the other is your body temperature and you know this internal body temperature should be a should be 98.6.
Dorsey,Fahrenheit and if it's above that or below that it indicates that something is out of balance it doesn't say what.
Interviewer,But it indicates that probably something is in out of out of imbalance and we built this tool called a thermometer to.
Dorsey,Measure that indicator and then based on that reading we can start diagnosing solutions and you know I I could read.
Interviewer,That your your temperature is really high and I can give you a glass of water hot water with lemon in it and say based.
Dorsey,On all of our experience i don't know all of our research if you drink this there's a higher probability that it.
Interviewer,Will bring your system back into balance at least this particular indicate indicator faster than this red wine that.
Dorsey,I'm about to andrew and then you have a choice do I do I take this or this red wine which.
Interviewer,Based on all of our evidence all of our research all of our experiences creates a probability that probably extends the.
Dorsey,Amount of time that your system is in balance so you can you can push that to the digital and then it's you know it's.
Interviewer,What are the indicators of conversational health so we have four stakeholder indicators that we've shared.
Dorsey,With the world that we're we're working to understand how to measure right now like we're.
Interviewer,Working to build the thermometers for these indicators number one is shared attention how much of the conversation.
Dorsey,Is attentive to the same things versus on disparate things number two is shared reality are we is.
Interviewer,This you know is this conversation sharing the same facts or are they different facts like an example as a way.
Dorsey,Of judging how siloed a certain conversation exactly like so it's not to find truth it's not to find what is.
Interviewer,Factual or what is not factual but just like what facts are people using and what percentage of the conversation is.
Dorsey,Using this fact basis versus another one so a recent example is you know the round earth versus the Flat Earth right.
Interviewer,Conversation so 99.999% of this conversation is using a fact that the earth is round whereas where as a small.
Dorsey,Percentage he's using a fact that the world is flat so healthier conversation will be sharing more facts mmm so that's.
Interviewer,Number two number three is receptivity so how receptive are the participants to engaging in a civil way and debate and.
Dorsey,Dialogue and finally is variety of perspective is it a high variety of perspective or is it a filter bubble or.
Interviewer,Echo chamber and these four ideally as they go higher conversation is very healthy so you want you know presence.
Dorsey,And attention you want to be sharing the same facts to have a debate around them you want both to be receptive if you.
Interviewer,Want a variety of a opinion and perspective so that we can build off each other and and and so that we can.
Dorsey,Iterate but we also realize that if you do something to increase one it might have a negative impact on another so you.
Interviewer,Know you might increase variety of perspective by bringing more perspectives into the conversation and.
Dorsey,By doing so you might decrease shared reality or you might decrease shared attention so just like the temperature.
Interviewer,Of your there are other indicators of health that have some sort of connection and.
Dorsey,While your your body temperature might go into balance other indicators like the flushing that your skin might get.
Interviewer,Aggravated more so then how do you take that information that you aggregate and build tools that facilitate conversation.
Dorsey,To move in that direction i mean that's that's the you know the hard part yeah so so so an example is you know one we.
Interviewer,Need to identify if these are the right indicators we do so by actually building the measurement tools to get it somewhat.
Dorsey,Of a baseline measurement and we're not doing this alone we're doing it with external parties as well.
Interviewer,Researchers mit cortical labs define the first four indicators and they're actually doing it not just for Twitter.
Dorsey,But for talk radio podcasting as well to measure that the percentage of conversations there and as we build in.
Interviewer,Understanding baseline of the other measurement then we can start deploying solutions and we can watch how it.
Dorsey,Deviates from the baseline so an example of a solution might be we have all these people sharing links sharing articles.
Interviewer,And i might share an article from fox News or New York Times and I might share that article and have my own kind of.
Dorsey,View on this like saying a tweet of this article is spot-on or this is completely off the mark and this all the reasons.
Interviewer,Why one of the things we experimented with is when we see those articles shared to bring up other tweets that.
Dorsey,Might have different perspectives as indicated by the text that they're sharing on top of the URL and you know.
Interviewer,You you might you might then see for the same article for the same link to different perspectives on it and there's.
Dorsey,Some research to indicate that that emboldened people into their views there's other research to indicate that.
Interviewer,That elites gets people thinking about what their viewpoint means and and how that evolved.
Dorsey,So that that's just one experiment and the way we can run that and then we can look at how it affects some of those.
Interviewer,Metrics at scale we're super early on in this another one is a the brexit conversation you know the only tool that.
Dorsey,And this kind of gets to the core fundamentals of the service we only give you the ability to follow an account so.
Interviewer,If you were a vote lever you're probably following folks like Boris and and Nigel and and related accounts very very few.
Dorsey,People and they're mainly journalists follow accounts that have a completely different perspective than themselves.
Interviewer,Very few people watch cnn and then immediately flip to Fox News mm-hmm just to get the other other.
Dorsey,Theater and and the other movie that's that's playing on this on that on the same reality so if you follow only those.
Interviewer,People you're probably only getting reasons to leave but if you were to do a little bit more work and you saw the.
Dorsey,Vote leave hash tag vote leave trending and you tap into that you'll see 99% on conversation reasons to leave but you.
Interviewer,Might see 1% of reasons to stay and in that key in that case at least there is some potential to see a different.
Dorsey,Perspective and sees diversity of opinion but we make that so hard for people you can't follow a hashtag today.
Interviewer,You can't even get into that conversation where there is even an element of variety of perspective so.
Dorsey,Those are the things we're looking at if we allow someone to follow a hashtag or follow a topic does that increase.
Interviewer,Variety of perspective does it increase shared reality does it increase shared attention or does it diminish those.
Dorsey,Things yeah it's that extra step that you have to do right now I mean if you go to.
Interviewer,What's trending and you click on a hashtag you're gonna see in general my experiences you'll see a smattering of.
Dorsey,Different perspectives on that issue but if you could follow an issue with an ad like at you know issue X and then your.
Interviewer,Feed would be propagated with different person Actives on that issue it would break the.
Dorsey,Chains of the silo effect that's creating so much toxicity but I think it also it it means that you have an.
Interviewer,Optimistic perspective on the malleability of a human of a human psychology oh yeah I mean that because.
Dorsey,People are bringing in a lifetime of experience that has formed a certain perspective and just because you're.
Interviewer,Gonna pepper that feed with a smattering of different views doesn't mean that it's gonna change that person's.
Dorsey,Worldview totally maybe it shouldn't i don't know and I don't know if that's your responsibility but certainly there.
Interviewer,Is a you know a level of toxicity right now on on your platform that I know you're endeavoring to address but these.
Dorsey,Are very difficult problems to overcome yeah and I I don't think it's our responsibility to change their view I do.
Interviewer,Think it's our responsibility set up the circumstances where if they choose to look outside their own view or to add to.
Dorsey,Their view or challenge their own view that it's easy to do so right now it's extremely difficult and and and we saw.
Interviewer,This in 2016 2015 leading up to the election this you know this MIT cortical lab put.
Dorsey,Out a put out of a infographic that showed you know a number of the journalists on the Left.
Interviewer,Left end of the spectrum we're not following folks on the right whereas folks on the right were following folks.
Dorsey,On the left and you see these huge siloed concentrations of people on the Left who are just feeding themselves.
Interviewer,With stories around what's going to happen whereas folks on the right and the spectrum work we're seeing.
Dorsey,Everything and these are just journalists these are journalists right and journalists by and large are gonna.
Interviewer,Be people that are more likely to follow a difference of opinion typically but in leading up to the u.s. election.
Dorsey,According to the graph they were not right they were certainly not enough and I mean to me the most dangerous thing.
Interviewer,About what we've done as a service is to incentivize more of these echo chambers and filter bubbles and not give people.
Dorsey,Tools to at least change the probability that they would see more right and and that I think you know can embolden a lot.
Interviewer,More toxicity can embolden a lot more of the bad faith actors who intend to disrupt which we saw certainly leading.
Dorsey,Up but but you know twitter will be 13 years old in March and we've we've probably seen this throughout our.
Interviewer,Lifetime and a lot of it has to do with you know we've we made a system that people have figured out how to how to.
Dorsey,Game and and we we haven't had enough punitive actions with the exception of this very binary decision of leave up or.
Interviewer,Take down and and that that very binary action is just not enough it's not nuanced enough especially if you take a.
Dorsey,Broader view on humanity and you believe in the concepts of rehabilitation or redemption or you know at least showing.
Interviewer,People you know the path towards health and greater participation in the in the same sense of like giving people the.
Dorsey,Choice of drinking the water or the wine when they're sick we we don't do that we you know we have this very very blunt.
Interviewer,Tool of leave up or or remove mm-hmm at the same time the acceleration with which you know sophisticated well.
Dorsey,Financed entities are weaponizing the platform is only going to increase and you know I think there's an analogy to.
Interviewer,Doping in sports in the sense that you know the doping the sophistication of the doping is always a step or two ahead.
Dorsey,Of the policing body's ability to detect right so the entity is always playing catch-up to what's ahead.
Interviewer,And it seems like that's a similar game that's afoot here totally in in the technology world the metaphor would be.
Dorsey,Security so right now i forget the exact quote but Edgar Allen Poe brought this up quite some time ago where you know he.
Interviewer,He believed he was able to build a cryptographic puzzle that no one could crack and quickly learn that anything.
Dorsey,That one person can design another person can break down right and security probably at a surface level is.
Interviewer,Considered to you know your your goal might be one of perfection a cure a purely perfect system that no one can.
Dorsey,Break into but the reality of it is the mindset should be one of constant observation learning and improving you.
Interviewer,You want to taste stay ten steps ahead of your of your attackers and the way you do so is by really looking at.
Dorsey,Patterns of how they are testing the system and attacking the system and when you find them iterate a few steps ahead.
Interviewer,And then share all your findings so the whole community can get much better and you you just take out that that one.
Dorsey,Potential potential vector so so on that rubric how would you grade Twitter's performance on that very human very poor.
Interviewer,Because i think for the majority of our lifetime you know we were fairly mechanical and our approach to.
Dorsey,Technology we were not utilizing machine learning and deep learning to lift some of the burden certainly from our own.
Interviewer,Folks who have to enforce all of our rules but also lifting the burden from the victims like our our system right.
Dorsey,Now it's just not fair you know our our system works entirely on if I'm a victim of abuse I report that someone just.
Interviewer,Harass me or docks me or whatnot and then we entirely dependent upon reporting yeah we do not scalable it's.
Dorsey,Impossible to monitor that not scalable but ultimately not fair why should the.
Interviewer,Victim have that burden and so we we weren't able to even consider removing that because we just weren't as.
Dorsey,Sophisticated with machine learning and deep learning as we are now so now our number one goal along this health factor.
Interviewer,Is proactive monitoring of our systems so that we can catch some of these things before someone even has to report.
Dorsey,It and there's a variety of tools that we can use to enforce whether it be asking people to remove tweets temporary.
Interviewer,Suspensions all the way to the to the worst option which is you know a permanent suspension which ultimately.
Dorsey,You know over time we we shouldn't feel great about like we we weren't able to rehabilitate we weren't able to.
Interviewer,Incentivize and show people why healthy approaches and behaviors and participation would increase their reach.
Dorsey,Or increase the value they got out of the service so so that ultimately is where we want to get to but we're right.
Interviewer,Now we're focused on number one like how do we this is another thing I don't think our industry does enough of is we.
Dorsey,Haven't really admitted the connection between the digital world and the physical world and there's a lot that.
Interviewer,Happens on twitter that i think we could scope entirely to online and we'd miss everything else that's happening offline.
Dorsey,Or wedded those offline ramifications so meaning things like daxing or we're talking digital harm really becomes yeah.
Interviewer,Helpful reality so that so the number one thing we want to protect now is someone's physical safety so it sounds a.
Dorsey,Little bit odd for a predominantly digital company to say that we should be focused on protecting.
Interviewer,Equal safety but it has real manifestations someone daxing which is sharing private information about.
Dorsey,Someone's physical location or phone number or email address puts a person in you know of some physical jeopardy.
Interviewer,Safety jeopardy and at least raises the potential so could we can can we recognize when those when those.
Dorsey,Occurrences happen in real time and and prevent it and if we can do that and that's a tightly scoped problem then we.
Interviewer,Can extend it to more and more of the cases that we see every single day especially what women on our platform.
Dorsey,Experience on a daily basis and so we want to get to a something that is really measurable that has impact on you.
Interviewer,Know someone's real-world physical life and then tie it back to what we're doing online and I just think as an industry.
Dorsey,We need to focus more on that connection between the physical and the and the online and and and and show the show the.
Interviewer,Progress we you know we we talk a lot about this but we we we really have to show it so now that we have a lot more.
Dorsey,Sophistication around machine learning and artificial intelligence we can automate a lot more of this but a big.
Interviewer,Part of us progressing in the right way is scoping it so that we can really make the problem very very small get some.
Dorsey,Sort of success or at least a path to our success there and then and then brought it out right so you've been.
Interviewer,Going on all these podcasts and talking a lot of people about these problems and and and how you're attempting to you.
Dorsey,Know wrap your brain trust around how to solve them and the early stages of actually solving them do you think that.
Interviewer,Like like what's your sense of how this campaign is going like is this working I I mean I don't know I don't know that it.
Dorsey,Is and yet let me just say this and then I'll let you talk I have this sense that you're in an impossible situation.
Interviewer,Because you're coming on or you're coming on line and you're talking about these.
Dorsey,Things and i feel like you're being very transparent and very earnest about it and very thoughtful but you're not.
Interviewer,Giving people that answers that they like the answers are just not inherently satisfying right or or the time line is.
Dorsey,Off or something and so people are left feeling like they're not getting a direct response like you've been accused.
Interviewer,Of being evasive i don't think you're being evasive but perhaps people are just wanting to.
Dorsey,See the results more quickly like how are you thinking about this or what's your sense well this is going first and.
Interviewer,Foremost we have to realize that we have to we have to show not tell and my goal here is not to my goal here is not to.
Dorsey,First of all i don't consider this a campaign you know I yeah I I think it's important that we have conversations in.
Interviewer,Public and that we we show our thinking and we I I want to I want to bring up ideas in public that people can push.
Dorsey,Against and i want to hear the feedback and I want to I want to get the reaction because it'll make our answer is much.
Interviewer,Better and while people might not be satisfied with the level that they're currently at in terms of abstraction we.
Dorsey,Have to start there to get to something tangible and real and I think a lot of people fairly come at this as.
Interviewer,Specifically why haven't you banned this one person or why haven't you take an action on on these particular things and.
Dorsey,It's the answer is it it's not one case these these are extremely extremely challenging and a lot of it has to do.
Interviewer,With the context of the conversation and just as an example there are particular racial slurs that are used in a way that.
Dorsey,Are harassing of folks and meant to silence a voice or to get a voice off the platform and in other communities.
Interviewer,And contexts they're perfectly okay an example of this is you know we have we have a bunch of gamers on on Twitter.
Dorsey,And every day we have an exchange between two people saying hey rich you know I'm I'm gonna kill you tonight and.
Interviewer,In one context that's a violent threat and that is something that we would act on in another context it's a game and.
Dorsey,What that person meant was that i'm going to kill you in this game tonight so those are the sorts of nuances that.
Interviewer,We have to pay attention to in the context we have to we have to actually look at the context of the relationship.
Dorsey,Between the two people and how they're engaging so in the old days we were fairly mechanical and that we looked at.
Interviewer,The specific words and content being used now we have to shift to look at the network we have to look at the actions.
Dorsey,On the network act the behavior on the necks to contextualise that against the history of caspase.
Interviewer,Exactly and and we have a number of other occurrences where we get accused of taking content down or permanently.
Dorsey,Suspending someone because of something that they said which seems completely innocuous but what was happening in the.
Interviewer,Background was they had 17 accounts that they had control of that were all in unison in a coordinated fashion.
Dorsey,Attacking one particular account with the intent to silence or trigger this person or they we ban them in the past.
Interviewer,For a particular activity and then they are trying to evade our brand ban which is against our Terms of Service so.
Dorsey,There's a lot on the surface but there's even more underneath that has to do with behavior conduct and activity that is.
Interviewer,Against our term service that we take action on and where we have failed mm-hmm.
Dorsey,People is explaining the reasons why we take action yeah it's as if it takes place in a in a black box yeah and in.
Interviewer,Some cases that's because there might be private information that even either a victim or a a bad faith actor might.
Dorsey,Compromise them in some way and in some cases it might be active investigation so there's even.
Interviewer,Nuance in how transparents we can be around the actions or we take on the platform so but then the reaction to to.
Dorsey,The consumer is that it looks haphazard and it looks random it looks random and right and and and what the attention is.
Interviewer,All on these specific case studies like whether it's Alex Jones or Jake wall or you know these specific individuals that.
Dorsey,Get a lot of press and attention for their you know behavior on your platform I'm I'm curious as to like how under.
Interviewer,What circumstances does one of these case studies like rise to your attention as somebody is running two different.
Dorsey,Companies and has a tremendous amount of responsibility for you know keeping both of these you know ships Square and.
Interviewer,Twitter running in a certain direction you know I can't imagine that you can roll up your sleeves and get too.
Dorsey,Involved in specific scenarios but i would imagine from time to time it does require your your attention in your.
Interviewer,Discretion as to what to do yeah so to start with the principles of my approach and how I think about this number one is.
Dorsey,I want to build a service and a company that outlives me that doesn't require me being there - that doesn't require my.
Interviewer,Attention so by definition that means that we distribute nearly all of our decision-making and to me you know one.
Dorsey,Of the things that i look for is like if if I have to make a decision I see it as an organizational failure you know it's.
Interviewer,It's something that for whatever reason and it's likely my fault you know I I haven't set up the right organizational.
Dorsey,Structure i don't have a team dynamic that can work through debate or disagreement I I haven't presented or we.
Interviewer,Haven't presented the problem with the right context or maybe we're going after the wrong problem so it's all my fault.
Dorsey,Ultimately but if if i have to make a decision I think there is something wrong with the organization and and it's.
Interviewer,Not that's what i need to fix it's not making the decision that's fixing exactly that so.
Dorsey,My role then and my second principle is I need to ask questions in terms of how we're making this these decisions and.
Interviewer,Why we're making these decisions and raise the bar through my questions raise the bar in terms of how we're thinking.
Dorsey,About our customers the people that we serve secular trends that are happening whether they be societal or cultural or.
Interviewer,Legal or technological and then do we do we have a broader context that is cohesive across the company and also our.
Dorsey,Peer set so in cases like alex jones or Jacob recently I was notified that we're taking action it wasn't brought to me.
Interviewer,With a question of like should we do this or not uh-huh I was notified that we're taking.
Dorsey,Action and often times i ask well why did we take this action what evidence do we have to take the action or in the.
Interviewer,Reverse i see i see something that's on the platform that looks like we should have taken action but weed in it and I.
Dorsey,Send that to the team and say what's going on here and again this points to our failure in terms of the dependency.
Interviewer,On reporting in that you know we only see what's reported so sometimes I see it and I ask the question and that kind.
Dorsey,Of serves as a report but there is no case at my tenure as CEO that I've made a decision on one of these cases or.
Interviewer,Reversed a decision by the team i have asked a lot of probing questions in some cases those questions lead to lead to.
Dorsey,Really looking at our process if it does I make damn sure that we admit when we make a mistake and what we've learned.
Interviewer,From it within the bounds of what we can share obviously usually around privacy or legal standards so that I think that.
Dorsey,I believe is my role and and again it's all against this prints of like if I'm not here if I die.
Interviewer,Tomorrow the company needs to be able to continue and we have to build this into a framework not into people we have to.
Dorsey,Think about systems not in these single points of failure in humans and we you know we were we just have a lot of work.
Interviewer,To do that and building into the algorithms and the machines and even when we do that even then when we move.
Dorsey,More towards a world where algorithms are doing more of our work there's some significant issues one our algorithms.
Interviewer,Right now can't explain why they make decisions they make they don't that's that's highly problematic extremely.
Dorsey,Scary especially i know you're you're wearing an orange I'm wearing my ring you know people wear Apple watches and.
Interviewer,The apple watch every now and then will tell you when to stand you know if if we don't if we start offloading more and.
Dorsey,More of our decisions to these devices and we don't understand why they're making the decisions they're informing.
Interviewer,Us to take and they can't tell you why and they can't tell you why then it's really really dangerous so we need to.
Dorsey,Invest in explain ability this is a field of research in AI that it's quite fascinating we need to invest in.
Interviewer,Removing bias from machine learning models and and artificial intelligence which which we are doing but these are.
Dorsey,These are very very early things but even you know even as we move more of these enforcement actions and policies.
Interviewer,To to algorithms people need to be able to see why the actions taken are taken and if they.
Dorsey,Can't see it they won't trust it so we you know we have a few operating principles as a company one we believe.
Interviewer,You know our purpose is serve the public conversation our desire is to promote health in that public conversation too.
Dorsey,We want to earn trust and earning trust comes through a variety of methods transparency reliability consistency so.
Interviewer,That we don't appear random deliberateness when you read our rules you understand them and you can see why.
Dorsey,We acted in the particular way we acted based on the rules or why our algorithms did do the very same thing so you know.
Interviewer,We're just putting these principles in place we're just building these models we're investing in research areas like.
Dorsey,Explain ability and and and and bias in ml but you know it it is going to take some time and that's not satisfying and.
Interviewer,I think people get frustrated because we talked about it but I I want to talk about it I want to share some of these.
Dorsey,Ideas i want to share where we are in the journey alright I want to show the map and like where we've come from and.
Interviewer,Where we're trying to get to and in pointing where we're trying to get to open a dialogue so that people can.
Dorsey,Really push back on us and and say you're you're going in the wrong direction and here's why and you should.
Interviewer,Consider this other this other path that's the power of our service you can see how people are thinking about any.
Dorsey,Topic under the sun and you you get the sense of global consciousness immediately so we also have to take.
Interviewer,Advantage of that as well yeah i appreciate the transparency and and I think the openness and the willingness.
Dorsey,To entertain pushback speaks your punk rock roots a little bit I feel like from a PR publicity strategy it might have.
Interviewer,Behaved you to to be like introducing a new feature to Twitter to address these things and then sort of said here's.
Dorsey,Here's the first of many things to come but we're introducing this new thing and this is because of this and it would.
Interviewer,Have given you a little bit of insulation I think against you know people that.
Dorsey,Feel like you're you're you know they're that there's a lot of talk but the challenge with that I agree with you I.
Interviewer,Mean that would feel good but the challenge with that is like there's there's not going to be any one feature.
Dorsey,That like makes one significant dent this is going to be a constant or unless you finally allow people to edit their.
Interviewer,Dream but i might not get into all of that I might have some things I might help some things but it's um if we if we.
Dorsey,Put too much weight on any one particular feature I think it's doomed to fail like a lot of this work has to.
Interviewer,Do with constantly iterating our models you know learning and real-time at scale.
Dorsey,Observing just this model of observing learning and approving is something we want to move are our issues in the past.
Interviewer,Is we've just moved too slowly on that on that mindset whereas we on that model we were able to.
Dorsey,Much much faster because we've improved dramatically our infrastructure we've got a lot more sophisticated about how.
Interviewer,To apply technology in the right way but I I definitely here I definitely hear the call and there are certain features.
Dorsey,Like like edit or you know putting all the conversations of the service or giving people more control over who can.
Interviewer,Reply or how they moderate comments within the reply is you yeah media plays or mute I think it's gonna turn off any.
Dorsey,Reaction to sweet like way that you can turn comments off on YouTube and we're experimenting with all those but all of.
Interviewer,Them have another side right you know that you know recently we we tweeted about we are experimenting with people.
Dorsey,Enabling giving having more control over the reply so one of the things we're we're testing is like if you have a.
Interviewer,Tweet and some jarek replies to you giving you the ability to hide it and not delete it but hide it which kind of.
Dorsey,Moves it over to another call it tab that allows outside observers who are not you know you or that require to.
Interviewer,Actually see that you've moderated that reply but for your own conversation you can be the host of that conversation you.
Dorsey,Can you can edit it you can curate it a bit more you can't delete the tweet from the platform but you you can push it to.
Interviewer,The side and which forces people to do some work but also how it gives them some visibility into what you moderate.
Dorsey,And the reason why this is important is because a lot of what's been great about Twitter have been activists and and.
Interviewer,Whistleblowers and journalists who you know a powerful figure might tweet something and then you see an immediate.
Dorsey,Reaction in terms of well actually that's just not true that's not factual like you know I'm sure you probably.
Interviewer,Ellie seen or heard about everything that was going on in the in the fire festival and one of the things that you.
Dorsey,See within the documentaries is the activity by the social media managers to delete rapidly all the comments that.
Interviewer,Call it out as a fraud and if we just allow it pure deletion of tweets because you as a person to like them then we you.
Dorsey,Miss a huge opportunity to to call out and to and to speak truth to to power in a way so any near these goals to.
Interviewer,Overcome tribalism and the siloing of information that that contravenes that what's important so there's a feature.
Dorsey,Like that that is big and will have impact on someone's individual experience but it comes at cost and we.
Interviewer,Need to mitigate the cost that it that it brings with it in in this case you know diminishing the potential for echo.
Dorsey,Chambers diminishing people to to share different facts and or you know speaking truth to power there's a certain.
Interviewer,Inevitability to twitter i think you've even tweeted like it's if if Twitter wasn't invented then you know Twitter.
Dorsey,Would have been invented right like that that that were of the moment where something like this would have come.
Interviewer,Along had it not been for you and biz and EV but I'm interested in in like what the internal experience has been.
Dorsey,For you because i look at you i look at biz I don't know F but between you and biz like you guys are I mean biz was.
Interviewer,Designing book covers like you were you know into fashion design and I was Oliver botanical illustration and punk.
Dorsey,Rock and i mean like to really inherently creative people I mean you're not graduates of Harvard Business School.
Interviewer,Graduates at all yeah right like that it's it's so improbable and in certain respects beautiful that this creation.
Dorsey,Came out of came out of this you know special group of people who at the time intended it to be a.
Interviewer,A means for for people to to connect right to just share information about their lives and Twitter has since become.
Dorsey,Something else entirely in certain respects means still retains that aspect of it but you could have.
Interviewer,Never predicted what it has matured into and I'm interested in how that feels like to be sitting you know right in the.
Dorsey,Middle of all of this having to make these kinds of decisions that we're discussing today and and and try to.
Interviewer,Navigate this you know behemoth in the right direction what does that like I mean it one it it.
Dorsey,Feels amazing i mean i think my my co-founder have said it said of perfectly recently you know he said you.
Interviewer,Know we often apt we often talk about everything that could have gone wrong with Twitter to not enable it to.
Dorsey,Continue to thrive and to be useful to people but just have to pay attention the how much had to go exactly right for.
Interviewer,This to happen and you know we're all um we're all pretty quirky and and and and fairly weird and you know and I think.
Dorsey,The the best aspect of twitter is a it's it's a little bit it's a little bit weird it's a weird little thing and you.
Interviewer,Know we we built this because we wanted to use it and and that was the intention we wanted to use this technology in this.
Dorsey,Way and and it was just you know i i wanted to be able to go off anywhere and and share what I was seeing sure what.
Interviewer,Was happening and i wanted to be able to follow biz and see what he was thinking and see what was happening and then I.
Dorsey,Think the most beautiful thing about Twitter is that people showed us what they wanted it to be and you know I.
Interviewer,Think being able to be observant enough to really listen to what something wants to be to me is true creativity and I you.
Dorsey,Know we we had the amazing fortune in that we were able to build something that felt very.
Interviewer,Foundational but was ultimately a discovery that I mean we discovered something essential something very very.
Dorsey,Low level and because there was so low level because it was so essential because it was so that you know this.
Interviewer,Core foundational layer people built social norms on top of it and the first such norm was using the apt symbol to.
Dorsey,Refer to another person which you know i took my laptop one day and I went to stacks in Hayes Valley which is a brunch.
Interviewer,Place and took four hours over over a waffle and some coffee and any time I saw in that symbol with a name I would.
Dorsey,Link him and then we turn that into a replies slash mentions page and suddenly conversation was born on the platform we.
Interviewer,Saw you know a few people using it but that usage grew and grew and grew we implemented it so everyone could use it.
Dorsey,And that made it more accessible and then everyone started using it same thing happened with a hashtag chris.
Interviewer,Messina started putting this you know hash slash you know a pound sign next to a word to tag by keyword and topic what.
Dorsey,His tweets were about and we found a search engine called summize we acquired them because they were recognizing all.
Interviewer,Of these hashtags and linking them to here's all the tweets that match that hashtag and suddenly you had not.
Dorsey,Conversation between two people or multiple people but you had conversation around the topic and and that just.
Interviewer,Opened another aperture and then you know Tim O'Reilly you know started really pushing this concept of okay I'm.
Dorsey,Following these people and all these people are following me and I want the people following me to see what see this.
Interviewer,One tweet from who i'm following so i'm a rebroadcast at which he called a retweet and yes and again he starts.
Dorsey,The rt yeah and then we implemented the RT away by making it a button and then everyone started doing it and that.
Interviewer,Created spread and network effects and contribution back to the conversation so everything that has made twitter twitter.
Dorsey,Has come from the people using it there was not invented in-house and some would argue that we don't really invent.
Interviewer,Twitter we only discovered it and i would agree with that you know I think we tuned in to something that was.
Dorsey,Interesting that was intriguing that we didn't know what it was going to become and in the same light people figured out.
Interviewer,How to game it too and and that's right this is a living breathing organism right that that you know could also you.
Dorsey,Know become a virus yes absolutely it could be at least at least so we're happy you have a pathogen yeah yeah at.
Interviewer,Least at least the pathways and the vectors that it provides can carry both positive and negative attributes and you.
Dorsey,Know i was i was watching spacex dragon launch yesterday last night and I you know certainly taken aback by the.
Interviewer,Accomplishment but also taken aback that like we can be in this like big virtual conversation together I don't know any.
Dorsey,Of these people but one of the screen shots I took was you know you know the the rocket it was in the t-minus 10 and.
Interviewer,I was watching through twitter and i just started seeing all these tweets and periscope comments saying you know.
Dorsey,Congrats or you know good luck from Mexico good luck from India good luck from from Japan and like wow okay I just.
Interviewer,Couldn't couldn't even imagine this in the past like have one single plane where anyone around the world can and.
Dorsey,Can just share how they're thinking and wish wish well upon one another but the flip of that is you you know.
Interviewer,Like any tool you can figure out in a way such that you can use the vectors to be more destructive and to be.
Dorsey,Distracting and to divide which i think is antithetical to the base technology but it doesn't mean that we should.
Interviewer,Assume that it'll just work itself out we we have to actively maintain and and and and garden there's this conversation.
Dorsey,And you know that the challenge is no one's done at the scale before so we have to learn it you know we have to.
Interviewer,Learn it in real time and part of the conversations like this is like I want to I want to share that I'm learning it.
Dorsey,In real time we're learning it in real time and we're gonna make a ton of mistakes in the in along the way but.
Interviewer,We're going to do it in public and we're going to admit when we're wrong and we just haven't done enough of that in the.
Dorsey,Past on this idea of doing it in public you know failing and succeeding in the public eye how do you just as a human.
Interviewer,Being deal with the reaction that comes with every single thing that you tweet like.
Dorsey,Do you like you put a lot of thought into what you're putting out into the world do you not read your app mention.
Interviewer,Like how do you do it like knowing that every city every time you tweet something at least with respect to.
Dorsey,What's going on at twitter that you're gonna get like there's gonna be a certain percentage of people that are.
Interviewer,Gonna want to say not nice things like how do you insulate yourself how do you see that and take it to heart but also.
Dorsey,Protect your own you know emotional well-being yeah I mean and this is where the meditation practice has helped me a.
Interviewer,Lot is just not constantly allowing myself to be reactive to whatever comes in front of me this is that the less.
Dorsey,Control i have over my own well-being and space and and and mindset the less effective I am in fixing our issues so I.
Interviewer,I approach it number one from that mindset of like I want to I want to go into the arena and experience everything.
Dorsey,That people are thinking because i the only way for me to really move forward is to at least see it ideally to.
Interviewer,Acknowledge it figure out what i can learn from even the most negative like what's the question behind the question.
Dorsey,What's the statement behind the statement what realizing also that you know people have a lot of a lot of fear.
Interviewer,Of companies like ours and and and me you know running companies like ours and they have a lot of distrust and.
Dorsey,Expressing that comes out often as anger and it comes out as hateful and it comes out as you know something that would.
Interviewer,Otherwise set me off but even that expression even them doing that might disarm a little bit I'd I think you know.
Dorsey,With the rest of online there's there's very little consequence to doing something like that and it's easy to be.
Interviewer,Behind a keyboard and and say things that you know some people say but I do think that there is a health aspect in.
Dorsey,Enabling people to express themselves but they certainly do not have a right for us to amplify that or to guide it to.
Interviewer,A person who wasn't open to accepting it and and and that's where the mechanics of the network failed today like it.
Dorsey,There's just so many open doors that people can take advantage of like replies like trends like search and you.
Interviewer,Know there's there's some power in those doors being open but if you don't feel you have enough control over them or.
Dorsey,Your own experience and you just can't give up why it won't this isn't useful to me and like ultimately you know as we.
Interviewer,Think about health we need to we need to realize two things one we need a we need to protect someone's physical safety to.
Dorsey,The best degree that we can being an online platform and then number two we need to protect people's right to freely.
Interviewer,Express themselves and we do believe that's a Global right and we do believe that.
Dorsey,People weaponize it and they in the game it and their intent is to silence one another and I think everyone on the on.
Interviewer,The free speech absolutist side would agree that they prefer everyone to be able to speak and part of that agreement.
Dorsey,Is making sure that people feel safe to do so in the first place so we have to guide all of our rules around those.
Interviewer,Those concepts and principles in terms of you know what is impacting someone's ability to freely express themselves and.
Dorsey,And and then third realize that you know the the conversation to have is around attention and amplification and.
Interviewer,Recommendation that's where twitter's true power is and that's where I think we should be held a lot more accountable.
Dorsey,Publicly is what we recommend what we allow to be amplified what we do with people's attention which is you know a.
Interviewer,Scarce resource and something that our business is built off of and what about capturing the in speaking about.
Dorsey,Capturing people's attention and maintaining it how do you think about the addictive nature of not just your.
Interviewer,Platform but these social media platforms in general you know we're now in this era where we have people like.
Dorsey,Tristan harris speaking out about the erosion of you know our analog lives as a result of our you know are being held.
Interviewer,Hostage by our devices on actually tomorrow I'm getting a guy in the podcast called Cal Newport I wrote a.
Dorsey,Book called deep work and he's got a new book coming out called digital minimalism that's all about you know how.
Interviewer,How we can have healthier relationships with these devices while respecting the you know the addictive nature and what.
Dorsey,And what they truly are and he talks a lot about and Tristan talks a lot about how so much energy.
Interviewer,Is put into trying to maintain that attention on the platform like is that like what's going on at Twitter with.
Dorsey,Respect to how you've architected the platform for that purpose yeah I mean I think this goes back to the the.
Interviewer,Incentive conversation like where we're incentivizing a lot more kind of social status than we are utility and I think.
Dorsey,There is deep deep utility within Twitter you know it's the the fastest way and most influential way to get your.
Interviewer,Thoughts to the world that there's nothing faster I think it also I find out what's going on and a figure out in.
Dorsey,Jail time yeah into you know it's a fastest way to tap into a global consciousness like there's nothing.
Interviewer,Faster it's not segmented by groups or communities or run on it everything is on the same plane and there's a lot of.
Dorsey,Power to that but at the same time you know we need to make sure that we're aligning the incentives of the network.
Interviewer,Towards that rather than you know coming up with the best tweet that has the most likes because you're the most outraged.
Dorsey,Or you have the best hot take without any sort of consideration around what's actually happening or you know like an.
Interviewer,Event just unfolds you quickly fire something off it's outrageous as hell which really.
Dorsey,Spreads it throughout the network and and then you know two hours later you realize what you just said was a.
Interviewer,Complete distortion of reality because something new breaks around the event so you know I think we need to make sure at.
Dorsey,Least in the conversation utility aspect that were were were incentivizing you know the breadth of the conversation the.
Interviewer,The timeline of the conversation the the fact that people can go back it goes back to what I hope to do with these.
Dorsey,Podcasts like you know i started some with this year and like Bill Simmons and and maybe I was really terrible and.
Interviewer,Maybe you know as people progress through the year with me maybe maybe they see you know my conversational game.
Dorsey,Gets more stronger and much more authentic and much more real and and more open that that would.
Interviewer,Be my hope so the same thing i want to have happen on Twitter where you can see learning you can see development you can.
Dorsey,See iteration and and the beauty of conversation versus a post his conversation evolve it iterates and it.
Interviewer,Grows and it goes in directions and it's very fluid so we need to show more of that but in terms of the addictive.
Dorsey,Natures of the technologies yes i think we're we're making at least from an OS level or we're making the right first.
Interviewer,Steps which is giving people the data so you know iOS and Android both in the base operating system now allow you to.
Dorsey,Track how much time you spend on particular apps or how much you use your phone and you can see it I think it's a.
Interviewer,Novelty right now i don't with the exception of potentially people's kids I don't think people are actually.
Dorsey,Utilizing that information in a way that is changing their behaviors at least that's my own experience I I look at my.
Interviewer,Screen time and it hasn't made me make any other new decisions you shared it though you share it you shared your.
Dorsey,Screen time on twitter before yeah yeah to generate a conversation about it but like it hasn't.
Interviewer,There's no again it goes back to incentives there's no incentive for me to change right now like you did I just.
Dorsey,Don't see the like at least within that view it's not presenting to me a path as we talked about earlier weather the.
Interviewer,Water and and the line it's not presenting necessarily upfront a solution that points me in a direction.
Dorsey,That has more you know fulsome human connection why don't one of the things we at Twitter are our main Twitter.
Interviewer,Account at the company we did this little thing yesterday where we tweeted get off of Twitter go tell someone that.
Dorsey,You love them better to do it in person and one I love that we do stuff like that because you know I I don't want to.
Interviewer,Be afraid of telling people to get off a thing right off it and like Kara Swisher is rolling our eyes right now.
Dorsey,I know and - well that's that's that's her prerogative but like I think you know if you look at the replies to that.
Interviewer,Tweet it's amazing and and if you know if we if we can do whatever we can to encourage some fundamentally different.
Dorsey,Human connection great but in every one of those moments we get to learn and it might have you know it might have seemed.
Interviewer,A little bit i roley or stupid or whatnot but I don't want us to be afraid of stuff like that at that level because.
Dorsey,I we get to learn from those opportunities and based on those learnings we get to challenge our.
Interviewer,Assumptions but i you know it the world we want to get to is and I've said this on other podcast is I want I want people.
Dorsey,To walk away from twitter emphasis walk away from Twitter feeling that they learn something and right now I feel.
Interviewer,Walk people walk away from twitter feeling outraged or feeling overwhelmed or feeling like they don't know what the.
Dorsey,Next step is or what the thing why the things even valuable so if we can direct a lot of our efforts towards like you.
Interviewer,Know i put down the phone and i feel like I learned something and you know I want to I want to build on it in this.
Dorsey,Way and then share back the progress then we've we've done the right thing and I I know that feels far away from.
Interviewer,What people perceive of twitter today but it's there and it does happen in small amounts like a it's really a.
Dorsey,Function of like what twitter you follow you you follow Health Twitter you learn untell enough stuff you you you know.
Interviewer,Rhonda patrick found my fitness you then Mercola you know just you know all along the spectrum of health from the very.
Dorsey,Extreme to you know more the mainstream to to the other end of it I learned so much from those conversations on the.
Interviewer,Service yeah i would agree with you there's a lot of pretty vile arguments going on around.
Dorsey,Diet though you can fall into that rabbit hole as well yeah and I would just say you know sort of you know.
Interviewer,Respecting the challenges of foot and and the problems that you're facing that on a personal level you know Twitter's.
Dorsey,Been an unbelievable resource for me i feel like I'd built most of my career on the shoulders of Twitter because it's.
Interviewer,Allowed me this unbelievable ability to directly connect with all these people that I respect and admire and have then.
Dorsey,Been able to meet in real life for purposes of this show but even even before that like it's been a tremendous.
Interviewer,Value add in my personal experience and I would take that you know with everything else that it has and you know.
Dorsey,Now there's all these other social networks and I get a lot more traction on other ones but Twitter's still like.
Interviewer,The first one that i go to in the morning when I have my social media time it's like Twitter first I want to see.
Dorsey,What's going on right now yeah and that was a that was a big shift when I came back to the company and.
Interviewer,Almost four years ago and in that like i think we were we had my mind set too much of chasing after the people that we.
Dorsey,Don't have like trying to increase the pie size of the pie as quickly as possible versus focusing on the people.
Interviewer,We do have i'd you know and we have some of the most influential people in the world using us in a while it might feel.
Dorsey,I mean it's it's certainly smaller than others it drives culture it dries conversation and we don't even know how.
Interviewer,To count the impressions that tweets get we can't count tweets on CNN being screenshotted we can't count the tweets.
Dorsey,Being shown within newspapers so the the you know just the impressions that has around the world is significant and what.
Interviewer,We need to focus on is making sure that for the people who do love us that we're giving them opportunity to love us more.
Dorsey,And such that they want to they want to talk about the value they're getting out of it and back to your point you know.
Interviewer,It's a it's a cost-benefit analysis like you know there's certainly cost to Twitter and we're seeing you know more.
Dorsey,And more than like people being fired / tweets they tweeted 10 years ago and not being able to clarify what they.
Interviewer,Meant and you know we also see a lot of benefit in terms that they've built their networks or careers their.
Dorsey,Understanding their practice by engaging in these communities we you know we have a woman who was in the Westboro Baptist.
Interviewer,Church who was using twitter every single day to spread hate against the LGBTQA community and you know four or.
Dorsey,Five very patient folks on twitter who are engaging her every day every day showing her different perspective and.
Interviewer,She left the church because of that and she credits a lot of that to those conversations on Twitter and just.
Dorsey,Showing her a different perspective and she's working on getting the rest of her family out of it she was born into that.
Interviewer,Church so we don't do a great job at telling all those stories as well but they're real and they're impactful and.
Dorsey,They're meaningful and we you know we need to optimize for for more of that occurrence realizing that there's always.
Interviewer,Going to be negative approaches and our role is like we we can't amplify that like we we we need to make sure that.
Dorsey,People have control over the experience and if they choose to see everything that's there right in their choice but.
Interviewer,If they you know if if they don't you know they should be able to have a conversation they want to have and be.
Dorsey,The host that they want to be what do you foresee for the future as we kind of uh sure in this post privacy you know.
Interviewer,Culture and world that we live in where were seemingly all gonna be held accountable for things that we said or.
Dorsey,Did that were documented on twitter and other platforms you know ten years ago 20 years ago as culture shifts are we.
Interviewer,All just going to be you know put on trial for these things like we're in a very weird awkward in-between phase.
Dorsey,Right now trying to grapple with this issue and we you know in canceled culture right now holding.
Interviewer,People you know hands to the fire for for things that they did you know quite some time ago and I see that only.
Dorsey,Becoming more problematic in the short run until we figure out as a culture how we're going to manage this kind of thing.
Interviewer,Yeah you've you've talked about you know Carol's concept of growth mindset on yeah on your podcast and if we you know.
Dorsey,If we have a culture that cancels people on mistake there is no opportunity for growth mindset there's no opportunity.
Interviewer,For learning there's no opportunity for evolution so I agree with you that we're in a weird state right now I think as.
Dorsey,More people experience this and more people see that there is potential for learning there's potential for a.
Interviewer,Rehabilitation there's potential for redemption I mean we're not just seeing this online or you know we're seeing.
Dorsey,This in the prison systems in the united States we're seeing this in like the conversation around infractions around.
Interviewer,Like you know canis cannabis sales in the past and what it now means that it's legalized within the state and you know.
Dorsey,The hundreds if not thousands if not tens of thousands of people we put away because of that very thing and and just.
Interviewer,Like the momentum of the framework and the system that doesn't allow for redemption or rehabilitation so this is.
Dorsey,Much broader than online and it's much broader than the conversation I think we're having and I don't think we're.
Interviewer,Allowing ourselves to connect all the dots and I don't think were we're allowing our our culture and our society.
Dorsey,To even have the chance at learning or growing if we if we can't sell everyone out there there's just no learning and.
Interviewer,Eventually you're gonna trip up yourself and if you're not giving someone else to benefit out no one's gonna give you the.
Dorsey,Benefit out either and i i think that experience will be had by a lot of people certainly all the younger folks.
Interviewer,And more and more of an of an older generation and as long as we have that open dialogue and show that's okay we're.
Dorsey,Good but you know as Twitter we could also do some things like where we're you know.
Interviewer,We're thinking about this feature to allow people to go back and clarify tweets and what that might look like is.
Dorsey,You might have said you might have tweeted something five years ago about diet and someone might unearth it and.
Interviewer,Say you know you know rich you believe this and before this you believe you believe this and suddenly today that.
Dorsey,Older tweak it's all this traction and you can retweet it and and then suddenly you might be known as the person that is.
Interviewer,Completely inconsistent or in your views so you can imagine a feature where you could immediately go back clarify that.
Dorsey,Tweet when you do so it's kind of like a quote tweet a quote a retweet with comment and by doing so by clarifying it.
Interviewer,You're not allowing the original tweet to be retweeted without the clarification so anytime someone.
Dorsey,Retweets that original tweet the clarification comes with it so at least people have more context and and things.
Interviewer,Like that might make an impact they may not at all but we should test so it's also like a.
Dorsey,Lot of work right like i'm not i'm not gonna go back to 2008 and read all my tweets and whatever I said you know no I.
Interviewer,Figure out what needs clarification to someone like bringing something in the past stuff you can immediately go to.
Dorsey,That tweet clarify it and then and then the record is straight at least in your experience so walk me through a day in.
Interviewer,The life what's it look like for you now use two days a week you're here at the house right yeah I I've been I've been.
Dorsey,Working from home two days a week which I you know is it time for me to read to write to consider and this gives me a.
Interviewer,Lot of the free time that i need to to think the the other days are just back to back back meetings and and and my.
Dorsey,Life is in little little boxes and Google Calendar but every day I wake up usually between 5:30 and 6:30 and I.
Interviewer,Immediately start with a cold shower that that is my that is my my immediate caffeine in the morning and it's kind of.
Dorsey,Like this one of those small wins where I feel like I already won the day if I can go straight into cold water and have.
Interviewer,The mental capacity to do so them and the and it just feels I can take anything and just wakes me the hell up -.
Dorsey,So like right away before coffee before any yep I go straighten in a cold shower and there for like you know a minute to.
Interviewer,Five minutes and then i go into this room and I release it here and I met at 8:00 for an hour and I do have in pass.
Dorsey,On a based practice and and after that i get ready and I usually turn you know turned on my phone at that point to see.
Interviewer,If there's any emergencies i i keep my phone either in my kitchen or my closet not next to my bed I you know I turn off.
Dorsey,All the notification notifications during the night and I don't really check it into about you know 7:00 to.
Interviewer,7:30 and when i'm walking into work i leave the house around 7:30 and my my office is about five miles away and.
Dorsey,Takes me now about an hour 15 minutes an hour 20 minutes to to walk and no matter unless it's heavy rain I do it you know.
Interviewer,And any time i'm going in the office i'd I walk and sometimes it's really cold here and you know that the calls has.
Dorsey,Been as 39 but it gets my blood going gets my mind going and I was in a podcast I listen to audio books I.
Interviewer,Sometimes i just think sometimes i take phone calls I walk super fast if you ever see me on the street I like.
Dorsey,Ridiculous because it's just like you know almost almost jogging but um interesting same route every day same.
Interviewer,Same route every day sometimes i'd even adds time so I feel like I found the optimal path to to save to save time and.
Dorsey,I kind of i've shifted my entire outfit to this walk like I wear all black because you if I sweat you can't see.
Interviewer,Anything you can't see any stained if it rains like he can't see any of the the wetness.
Dorsey,And i wear these running sandals because they're the fastest that they enable me to move the fastest they're faster than.
Interviewer,Running so they're called earth runners earth runners calm they they're made up in.
Dorsey,Sonoma i think they may be in san Francisco now but they're um super simple like you know if any of you or.
Interviewer,You read born to run you know all the running sibling side room Fivefinger type shoes well they're pure their.
Dorsey,Prayer sandals so like they don't have any of the articulated toes or whatnot so it's a you know it's open Tarahumara.
Interviewer,Yes the tarahumara sandals and so i usually wear those everyday which have been called out as well and press like.
Dorsey,I'm wearing i'm wearing these sandals and ever exposing your my toes to got the CEO of Goldman Sachs.
Interviewer,I'm like man should i not expose my ugly hands either like what I think can't be can be human here so we I so I I walk in.
Dorsey,With those and that iterated from sneakers and I just tried to find the fastest way to be in and and then like.
Interviewer,You know i wear wear these black jeans and this sweater that keeps me warm and you know I just wake up put these on and.
Dorsey,And go and then i look fist I don't need breakfast I have one meal a day so I go I have that's every day.
Interviewer,Every day yeah with the exception i'd i started experimenting a little bit recently where on.
Dorsey,Well i'll finish the rest of this so i go into Twitter first um my first meetings usually at 9:00 I have meetings.
Interviewer,Until about 2:00 p.m. and then i walk across the street to square I usually stay until about 6 or 7 I take a lift.
Dorsey,Home i don't walk back home i try to eat dinner at 6:30 around around 6:30 or 7:00 not too late I go into the infrared.
Interviewer,Sauna which i really love i do a workout I do vii work out through an app sometimes.
Dorsey,They do multiple circuits of that and then and then I eat and then I I kind of wind down at 9:30 try to be in bed at.
Interviewer,Least by 10:00 and then go to sleep i try to get 9 hours of sleep that's been hugely impactful or a ring to keep me.
Dorsey,Accountable to it but so i i learned the one meal a day thing from from wim HOF you know two years ago and I I loved.
Interviewer,Learning through experimentation and i love experimenting on myself and I've always been this way I was I.
Dorsey,Was vegan for two years it was it's very hard to be vegan st. Louis Missouri at least when I was I was I was right now.
Interviewer,You're in san francisco i know i know i know I will reboot this I I so I love experimenting I've always experimented.
Dorsey,With my diet i book always experiments with health practices some like some have been really informative to me and.
Interviewer,Very healthy some have not but the one meal a day thing I I just thought was a really interesting challenge and I just.
Dorsey,I heard it on the podcast i think it was with him in Tim Harrison magicite I want to try that and I after a week of some.
Interviewer,Pain i noticed i slept much deeper and during the day I was so much more focused so every day I I fast for 22.
Dorsey,Hours i have you know i have dinner within two hours and I have a really really big dinner and and recently over.
Interviewer,The past few months i've been breaking that by by having as kind of a reward for making it through the week on Friday.
Dorsey,Morning i go to blue bottle coffee and they get one of their waffles which is amazing in the morning and and then I.
Interviewer,Was your big cheat that's it that's a cheat and I won't what I've been doing recently is I won't eat until Saturday.
Dorsey,Dinner so and it gets tended fast because I've been playing with even more extended just pure water fast that the.
Interviewer,Longest i've done is three days and it it is trippy like the the amount of focus I have on day three is like crazy.
Dorsey,I was not expecting that and I would eventually like to go beyond that just to see what see what happens.
Interviewer,But i have to package it into these weekends because I don't trust myself enough to not balance it with my my day.
Dorsey,To day work and everything going on at the office and went on so yeah when when I learned something on a podcast like.
Interviewer,Like yours or you know something that like you know David Goggins is doing and I I try it I try it for like a month and.
Dorsey,If i like it i stick with it and i just want to constantly experiment and that's that's why I dropped out of school.
Interviewer,That's why i cuz i i was learning so much more about experimenting myself and I I don't know any other way to learn if.
Dorsey,I accept by tinkering and playing and and trying new things and realizing early on it was a little bit too.
Interviewer,Haphazard now i like really if i'm gonna try something I'm gonna dedicate months to it and like a common practice and I.
Dorsey,Have a lot of patience as a characteristic and I have a lot of discipline and like I can really stick.
Interviewer,To something i say i'm going to do so that is a practice I also been journaling since I was very young.
Dorsey,Mostly you know through through my phone but before that was written journalism sometimes online that's where a lot of.
Interviewer,The ideas from tour came from was live journal I just had journaling in public which was like scary scary idea to to be.
Dorsey,Like what's the edge of honesty that you want to be open about to other people that you don't know and you can follow.
Interviewer,You and i you know i experimented with that everyday at Twitter as well and like some of that was me sharing my.
Dorsey,Meditation and the amara is like look I'm oh I'm aware of what this might be pursue independent of like what's.
Interviewer,Happening within me ammar a tech guy in San Francisco of course he doesn't meditation.
Dorsey,Of course he's going to tweet about it of course like he got bitten up by mosquitoes is gonna show that off like.
Interviewer,It's so silicon valley episode tonight i get that that's the thing that kind of like I I'm cognizant of like I'm just.
Dorsey,Playing into this stereotype but i don't care I get value out of it and I I know I'm gonna get some of that back and I.
Interviewer,Know i'm gonna get other things back and I don't want to be afraid of at least creating potential for someone else who.
Dorsey,Might be on the edge of trying something like this to like take the step or for it to resonate in such a way that they.
Interviewer,Develop some questions in their mind and because I would want that I won't I get so much out of people being open and.
Dorsey,Sharing and even though that they might play into a stereotype it helps me evolve and grow so I need to.
Interviewer,Model that behavior as well and i what's learning unless you share it well I think look there's certain aspects of.
Dorsey,That that are you know stereotypically Silicon Valley asked but I think what distinguishes it is the the self-care.
Interviewer,Aspect of it to me stands a little bit in in contradiction to this this you know hustle porn culture that I think is.
Dorsey,Also pervasive in silicon valley where you got to work twenty five hours a day and and you know sleep is for when.
Interviewer,You're dead and all of that for you to kind of say look I'm sleeping eight or nine hours a night no no I have the aura.
Dorsey,Screenshots living you know a relative me show me around your house like it's very there's a there's a minimalism.
Interviewer,Aspect to it like you live you know for you know compared to the way that you could live you're living a relatively.
Dorsey,You know simple stripped-down existence yeah I mean I and how does that inform like your thinking and your equanimity.
Interviewer,And how you you know the creative you know impetus that you bring to business I the philosophy that I've always that.
Dorsey,Has always resonated with me inherently and naturally and feels like I was I was born with was is.
Interviewer,This essentialism like what is absolutely essential in my life and even if you ask my parents you know when we.
Dorsey,Moved into a new house and my you know my parents came from nothing they barely even graduated high school st. Louis.
Interviewer,Missouri didn't go to college were very upset when I didn't finish college because I would be the one person my.
Dorsey,Family did you so but you know when we would move into a new house I always chose the smallest room and I always put.
Interviewer,The least amount of stuff in it and i i appreciate I appreciate this concept of like I want to figure out how to unlock.
Dorsey,Everything i'm born with because i know that's all I need all I need is everything I'm born with.
Interviewer,Like i i don't need any of these objects I don't need any of these technologies I think I think of Twitter as insanely.
Dorsey,Useful but i think of most technologies as a crutch to point back to what we're inherently capable of and in Twitter's.
Interviewer,Case you know i think it represents the global consciousness I think it's the closest thing we have to tapping into a.
Dorsey,Global consciousness and to be able to not just see what people are saying but what they actually think the sentiment.
Interviewer,Behind it and i inherently believe that we have that power internally and I I believe that Twitter's one of Twitter's.
Dorsey,Role is to remind us of the potential and you know if meditation can get me to a point where I can where I can.
Interviewer,Experience that and feel it would you know which which it hasn't some way it's and got me more in tune to my instinct.
Dorsey,Into my into my gut and like my feelings and I proved I I mark those moments of instinct and I I marked them with enough.
Interviewer,Weight mental clarity and weight whether it be through journaling or just considering it deeply that when the.
Dorsey,Event does happen that i had an instinct about I can tie it back right now that's cool and that's and that has that has.
Interviewer,Shown me like this these technologies you know these rings that we're wearing they're.
Dorsey,Just reminders to me and crutches of what we inherently are born with and have the natural ability to do so and.
Interviewer,They're mirrors and if we can approach them in that light instead of something that drives us which I think you know.
Dorsey,Tristan you know accurately articulates if we we will be able to develop a healthy relationship with them we're.
Interviewer,Going to start any new technology we're going to start by a codependent relationship and then when when you get.
Dorsey,Aware of the power and you get to aware of the reflection the reflection is what becomes the interesting part and it's.
Interviewer,Reflection back on you and your consciousness in your awareness and anything that builds self awareness any.
Dorsey,Practice i mean any tool any object is is something that I want to invest in and and so I keep my life fairly sparse.
Interviewer,Because i think it'll be distracting otherwise do you canonize this in any specific like spiritual perspective that.
Dorsey,Guides your life i grew up catholic and and my parents are pretty devout Catholics and my uncle's a priest you.
Interviewer,Know every christmas we go back and he says Mass but I was I was the one in my family that left st. Louis and I was the.
Dorsey,One that was never confirmed by choice and I I get my sense of spirituality through connection and you know what.
Interviewer,Twitter represents his spiritual to me like tapping into the consciousness the you know the the the larger organism.
Dorsey,Whether it be the the plan at the universe the the social consciousness is what is what is what drives me and it's.
Interviewer,The it's the answer i like to get at you know and the question that I like to ask and so that's where I feel like the flow.
Dorsey,And that's where i feel most alive is when I I feel like I can tap into that and like you know I go down to Big Sur a.
Interviewer,Lot and Fixer like we look at this amazing fortune here in San Francisco being able.
Dorsey,To travel two and a half hours away and go you know to this place that you immediately feel is mystical because of.
Interviewer,The redwood trees on this dynamic coast that goes down a thousand feet to the ocean where you see whales and and and.
Dorsey,You just feel this this connection and this wisdom and I I think that's so so powerful in such an important reminder.
Interviewer,Like today is my day where i don't you know Saturdays is my day where I don't think about work at all with exception.
Dorsey,In this conversation but it's at a different level I I just clear the day completely to you know walk outside or.
Interviewer,To go down to big sur or to be with my best friends I have dinner with them ideally once a week and just laugh and.
Dorsey,Have some wine together and they just had a baby so that's all another new sense of joy and I need a lot of that.
Interviewer,Balance because that that is my spiritual connection at the moment it's just like feeling that that connection.
Dorsey,Is tangible way as possible and you you know you mentioned you know my path of like you know think about designing.
Interviewer,Jeans and botanical illustration and i took a thousand hours of Massage Therapy along my path of becoming an engineer.
Dorsey,And a ceo because i i grew up writing programs and it's so damn abstract you're so much in your head and you're.
Interviewer,Not using your hands and every time i realize I'm just like my dreams were me programming my dreams it's just such a.
Dorsey,Weird experience where i would have a stream where I was programming the next part of my dream and it was so lucid but.
Interviewer,It was so it wasn't grounded so i would always shift towards something that I loved.
Dorsey,Like botanical illustration and just drawing or something that would solve a need because I was developing carpal.
Interviewer,Tunnel and i didn't just want to get a massage I wanted to learn the the why behind it and then the.
Dorsey,Annex behind it so i could fix myself and but all these variations these side pass these Forks in the road have always.
Interviewer,Brought me back to building technology because and added depth and enriched building that technology because I'd.
Dorsey,It's just where i feel my creativity most yeah I know you had an interest in public transportation and like urban.
Interviewer,Planning early days i feel like you should get together with Elon and solve the traffic problem wait you guys.
Dorsey,Together he's trying to get the traffic to Mars yeah well he's going underground too that's sure you know that's sure I.
Interviewer,Can't help but think that there's this weird meta parallel between like your own personal path towards broadening.
Dorsey,Your consciousness and and you know raising your awareness and and and growing as a as a human being and the.
Interviewer,Kind of hive consciousness that is Twitter and the commitment to kind of raising the vibration of that like the.
Dorsey,Interplay between those i think is super interesting yeah I yeah I think um in that sense like you know back to our our.
Interviewer,Conversation around meditation it's the the observation is not just that we are external observers but we are part of.
Dorsey,This is some of the very act of observing is changing the system as well and we we have a responsibility to.
Interviewer,Really reflect the essentialness of humanity and and and being that reflection on the world for all the good.
Dorsey,And all the bad i mean that there's a lot of power to seeing you know how people think in ways that make us feel.
Interviewer,Great and also things that are super uncomfortable because we we need to be able to acknowledge those things we need.
Dorsey,To be able to acknowledge in person order to have a conversation about it and then there's no other path towards.
Interviewer,Evolution and making something better unless we can talk about it and and yeah so it's all recursive it's.
Dorsey,All recursive and the more i realize how recursive this world is I think the better our Nets just get but at the same.
Interviewer,Time it's easy to go down to a very very abstract path and I get that and I you know we have to balance practicality.
Dorsey,With it but in that balance is is something really magical and sometimes we we discover something really magical.
Interviewer,And sometimes we we kind of get to get ourselves distracted yeah you know this this nonviolent communication this this.
Dorsey,This concept have you heard of and it's just you know kind of a meditation on how we how we communicate and utilizing.
Interviewer,Words like should as as things that kind of restrict the growth mindset and immediately going towards solutions in.
Dorsey,Our speech versus presenting more of needs and feelings and I you know it it's amazing how if you just change a.
Interviewer,Few words in your dialogue it changes a relationship with the person you're having a conversation with or gets to.
Dorsey,Something much deeper in the conversation so there's a there's a there's a really good the book is.
Interviewer,Nonviolent communication there's a there's a good audio book read by the author called speaking peace which is.
Dorsey,Sometimes corny at times because he picks up the guitar and sings but it's the substance and the framework and the.
Interviewer,System and the science behind it is real there's a lot of glad it's not violent in terms of the person that you're.
Dorsey,Communicating with but also with respect the self it's mainly yourself yeah it's mainly yourself saying the word you know.
Interviewer,We should cecily violent because it's holding you to a standard that you feel you can't meet or you can't you can't.
Dorsey,Learn from you you can't there's no path towards towards learning when you set this immediate expectation but and.
Interviewer,That's just one example of the framework so it's a that that has been fairly enlightening just I.
Dorsey,I love looking at how we use language and you know one of the things that I've been over years been trying to convince.
Interviewer,Both my companies around is like we have this way this word in technology called users and way back when when Howard.
Dorsey,Schultz was on the square board the ceo of Starbucks he pulled me aside one day he's like why do you call your customers.
Interviewer,Users oh my god good question I don't I don't know where it came from but we've always called him.
Dorsey,That and then i started researching it and you know it was it was that it was coined back in the early 80s when.
Interviewer,Actually earlier in that in the 70s when people were using mainframes and it was to represent an account someone who is.
Dorsey,Using the time on a mainframe and then the people who were really good like the engineers of the system administrators.
Interviewer,Kind of it developed this level system of amun super admin and you're a user and the user is stupid and we can't.
Dorsey,Trust what they do so it became this term losers oh you se RS and then when models like Google came to be they know.
Interviewer,You know they had no way to refer to their that they don't have a direct customer or relationship with the.
Dorsey,Exception of advertisers but a lot of you know the value of something like Google and something like Twitter is.
Interviewer,People coming to pay them with their attention and that there's no you know monetary exchange as you would assume.
Dorsey,With customers but there is a exchange of value they're honest in attention so they called that a user of a system as.
Interviewer,Well so you use google you use user of Google the problem with the word is that it creates this abstraction layer so we.
Dorsey,Have you know 330 million monthly active users on Twitter and once you say that it's this abstract thing you'd if you.
Interviewer,Say we have 330 million people then you have more of this empathy for or who you're serving and who you.
Dorsey,Ideally want to serve i look at it through this different lens as somebody who's in in recovery we got like a user.
Interviewer,As somebody who's an addict right well that's that's another thing is it's a very niche as as negative.
Dorsey,Connotation to the word so and and it breeds addiction as well so like we're you know in square we never use the word.
Interviewer,User we use customer we use seller we use buyer as a word we use individual and it just at least creates more.
Dorsey,Potential for empathy you know not gonna do it alone but and I'm trying to get Twitter more and more there as well mmm.
Interviewer,So where do you see twitter 5-10 years from now like if you have your druthers and you're able to implement all of.
Dorsey,These changes that you would like to see you know what is it what does it look like.
Interviewer,Um i think number one that we become known as you know we truly serve our purpose of serving not the public.
Dorsey,Conversation but the global public conversation that the predominant conversations on our service are the.
Interviewer,Existential conversations of the planet and you know in you vols recent book 21 lessons for the 21st century he talks.
Dorsey,About some of the existential conversations being climate change displacement of work through artificial.
Interviewer,Intelligence economic disparity these are conversations that no one nation state can solve alone it requires all of.
Dorsey,Humanity to work together to actually make an impact on great so I believe you need platforms like Twitter to host that.
Interviewer,Conversation to arrange the conversation to enable the conversation to live and iterate and to evolve and I want to be a.
Dorsey,Service that people at least have first consideration for learning from those existential global conversations and.
Interviewer,Also being able to participate in them and we've seen evidence of that so that that's number one number two in serving.
Dorsey,The public conversation public conversation we have a desire and it is a desire it you know it it's not.
Interviewer,It's it's a responsibility of all of us in the world but it is a desire for us to promote health into that conversation.
Dorsey,And i want us to be known by that i want us to be known like if you engage in public conversation on Twitter you.
Interviewer,Should expect civil dialogue and debate and to learn something and you should you should if you don't know how to get.
Dorsey,Into a conversation in that way we're going to teach you and we're going to teach you through the incentives as well.
Interviewer,And and that leads to the third point i want to have a strong point of view within the network itself around.
Dorsey,Redemption and rehabilitation and teaching people how to converse like I'm trying to learn right now like we are.
Interviewer,Ultimates as a company we're ultimate students of conversation and like word we're distilling all of our learnings.
Dorsey,Right into the product so that everyone can benefit from it that sounds super idealistic idea and again back to back.
Interviewer,To the stereotypical silicon valley but like we have to have these aspirations we're not going to get to 99 percent of.
Dorsey,It we're going to get to 80 percent maybe unless but if we can get to that milestone I think will improve the lives.
Interviewer,For you know a few people at least and and maybe maybe that spreads and and maybe that pushes but like I think right.
Dorsey,Now we're just we have such a binary view of the world of on platform off platform instead of like going back to.
Interviewer,What we were talking about earlier like how do we how do we put the growth mindset into Twitter like how do we.
Dorsey,Enable people to come to it and learn from it and that to me is is the is a potential of technology and I think.
Interviewer,We're gonna be taught a lot by people growing up only knowing that I can have a conversation with anyone in the world.
Dorsey,At any point i think those fascinating that like my my friend's newborn who's only four months old.
Interviewer,He's growing up in a world where he only knows touchscreens exist he only knows that I I could have a conversation with.
Dorsey,Literally anyone and though in the world instantly he's growing up to a world that has a you know growing potential.
Interviewer,For a global currency like bitcoin and native currency to the Internet that's not controlled by any central bank or.
Dorsey,Nation-state and you know therefore reflects a global citizenship in a very foundational way that is.
Interviewer,Powerful and the more we can listen to that experience of like you've only known this what do you do with it like.
Dorsey,What's the next step on this and is so exciting yeah it's exciting there is an idealism that that that is you know.
Interviewer,Venturing through everything you just said but it's it's beautifully articulated and you know I hope that we.
Dorsey,See all of that come to fruition you know I worry about you know the base nature of us as human beings and this.
Interviewer,Ticking clock that we're facing with global climate change like these are you know pressing matters that need redress.
Dorsey,In in the short run unless let's be eyes wide open about it let's see it truly and it is there are some scary things.
Interviewer,That all these technologies enable but i don't know any other way to get over them but sharing them eyes wide open and.
Dorsey,Seeing them eyes wide open like talking through them last question self-serving question because the.
Interviewer,Genesis of twitter came out of odio which was initially intended to be a sarcastic plot all right come full.
Dorsey,Circle here we are in the midst of this Golden Age of podcasting the mainstream adoption of this of this form of media.
Interviewer,Is you know penetrating to newer and deeper levels which is really cool and exciting and I really you know I believe.
Dorsey,In this medium you know as a very potent means of really having meaningful conversations and I love it to death but.
Interviewer,If you were to start a new company today to disrupt this podcasting platform or perfect it or you know solve problems.
Dorsey,That you see as somebody who's a fan and a consumer of vodka do you have a sense of what that would.
Interviewer,Look like yeah I mean I would I would first focus on starting with the problem of how do.
Dorsey,We provide economic incentive but that to me is like the biggest unlock and I think right now we only have tools of.
Interviewer,Attention and advertising and i think some of the contribution models are just in their infancy and you know things on.
Dorsey,Patreon and what sam is doing in terms of his own explorations and we have some you know varying experiments and.
Interviewer,Decentralization but i would go after that problem first I would and I would pair deeply with the podcasting platform.
Dorsey,I would i would figure out the economic incentive first and foremost and that they be on the same plane and I would.
Interviewer,Look specifically to cryptocurrency yeah you know I think there's a lot certainly in the ability to you know transact but.
Dorsey,I think this concept of what an ic o and initial coin offering at least points to it doesn't offer today but at.
Interviewer,Least points to like someone could buy equity in your success you know buy equity and the more reach you have they.
Dorsey,Actually have economic incentive and they then because what's interesting about that is it aligns incentives your.
Interviewer,Listeners incentives are aligned with your incentives and that you want to have engaging rich conversations that.
Dorsey,People find valuable and valuable enough that they're sharing you are rating your podcasts or whatnot and in IC o at.
Interviewer,Least points to a path towards aligning those incentives and to me like that's the unlock is like how do we get.
Dorsey,Alignment of incentives between distribution of the podcast and the economic incentives that that allow it.
Interviewer,To grow and to thrive or just maintain some people don't want to clear the presents but I want to spend 50% of my.
Dorsey,Time on this and in order to do that in you do 50% less of another thing that I make money for to you know provide for.
Interviewer,My family so that's what it all comes down to so that's number one is a you know attack the problem of.
Dorsey,Economic incentives and solve it in such a way that is on the same surface as a distribution platform in a second I.
Interviewer,Would look at is how do we go how do we look deeper into indexing what's in a podcast our search tools today are so.
Dorsey,Weak so weak i mean like i we take a search voice exactly but we can but no can alright no one's been ones doing a.
Interviewer,Filter i no one's built it and the things I think are exciting like we've had so many keywords in this.
Dorsey,Conversation right like from you know from meditation to impossible to or and if I could type or speak that word and.
Interviewer,Find all the conversations about or or could just pull up the the 30-second clip of you talking about this and it.
Dorsey,Would live somewhere on the internet and be catalog exactly but also crawl cross-referencing with all the other.
Interviewer,Conversations around ora or too so to go deep in the media to allow that to be queried and then once you have that then.
Dorsey,You can do some cool things like how do you expand your reach you know that as you look at the world the biggest way to.
Interviewer,Expand your reach is translation mm-hmm so automatically translating no matter what language you speak I can hear what.
Dorsey,I need to hear no matter what language they speak and and there's a technology can solve this today but no one's put it.
Interviewer,Together in one platform so economic incentives smeared with distribution and then going deeper into the into the.
Dorsey,Content and allowing more accessibility through translation or kind of a the trio of things I would look at to come.
Interviewer,Together if i were to create one today oh do 2.0 we gave up too early we gave up too early well yeah it was a little.
Dorsey,It was ahead of its time but to be fair it just wasn't where your interests lied at the time either.
Interviewer,That is awesome yeah our interests lied with like you know one button push publishing but we were all afraid to.
Dorsey,Talk it like with our voices where we're at we'll be on the keyboard at that time.
Interviewer,But we were we weren't podcasters we weren't like you we we didn't enjoy the sound not that you voice but it was also.
Dorsey,Early it was early thank you thank you so much it was great we didn't even talk about.
Interviewer,Square or bitcoin really or crypto or anything like that so maybe there's a lot there talked you into doing this.
Dorsey,Doing another round to focus on me well we'll come back after a significant launch yeah cool um really appreciate.
Interviewer,Your time thank you super fascinating i said that that was the last question but I have one more I've now had I had bids.
Dorsey,On the podcast now i've had you i've been doing this podcast for six years I've written three books am I gonna get.
Interviewer,That blue cheque ever i'm still not verified I don't know what I got to do yeah it's we're in such a weird state.
Dorsey,With our verification program not that I don't care but I just think it's funny yeah no no but let's see what.
Interviewer,We can do but we we need to move that whole program away from like this blue badge and more towards credibility.
Dorsey,Around the topic yeah well it the the idea originally was that it was legitimizing that somebody you know.
Interviewer,Actually was who they say they are and that applies to journalists and professional athletes so that people.
Dorsey,Aren't out there mimicking them but then it became it got co-opted into this status thing yeah and it's it's also.
Interviewer,Just to coarse-grain it's at the account level and so we will want to do ultimately I was like you know how do we.
Dorsey,Establish credibility within a topic space and authority domain expertise with a pretty credible and my topics I.
Interviewer,Know you are i know you are and like right now we just don't have the framework to our so well check for now.
Dorsey,And unfortunately it has created this like in this to class discussion but yeah I'm really upset by and I think.
Interviewer,It's unfortunate but here it is all right man till next time so nice stack thank you brother.
Dorsey,All right so that happened i thought it was pretty cool what do you guys think it's not often that you get to sit down.
Interviewer,With somebody who has literally changed the world so I just want to again thank Jack for taking the time to share his.
Dorsey,Life with me and with all of you guys and I just got to say that that experience this experience of spending.
Interviewer,Basically the better part of an afternoon with jacket it really did change me I left his house that day.
Dorsey,Thinking much more deeply about the level of intentionality that I bring to my day you know I'm a busy guy like a.
Interviewer,Lot of people i'm prone to stress and anxiety and distraction and I found the fact that somebody with such an insane.
Dorsey,Level of responsibility has so effectively and mindfully stripped away the non-essential distraction to.
Interviewer,Prioritize deep thinking and self-care and truly feed is hunger to be constantly learning and involving and I.
Dorsey,Think that's impressive it stayed with me and I hope it left you considering the level of intentionality that that.
