i am so excited to be here with jim

mckelvey and jack dorsey

square's two co-founders to talk about

um

all things square and how it started

what the origination was

and how we're thinking about the

developer community so for those of you

who don't know

square started because jim who owns a

glassblowing factory

uh was unable to process a payment and

was really bothered by that

understandably about losing customers

and started pairing up with his pal

jack and they came up with this solution

um so i'd love to hear from the two of

you

um how you first connected before square

even was born

so um jack came to work for me

at a company that i actually still have

um but

at the time we were uh very poorly

managed and

supplemented our bad management with his

uh mother's product which was uh

chocolate covered coffee beans which we

would chew

up and uh keep the staff awake so marcia

dorsey was effectively our dealer

um and we found one day that her son

liked computers that's all we knew

and so my partner invited john invited

jack to come over

to work with us and he happened to show

up in the middle of this

chaotic mess and uh pulled an

all-nighter with us the first night

so we sent him home at five in the

morning and i guess i'll let jack finish

the story since i think it goes on from

there

well i got yelled at by my mom she um

she hated jim um cursed his name

to this day but has forgiven him for

some things

but no i might

my parents always encouraged

me to follow my own path

and competing was one one big part of

that and

uh jim's company and that work was

a great way for me to experience

what i ultimately wanted to do which was

programming and i was super early

in the programming computers at that

point another story

some of you may not know is square's

very first customer

was a woman named sherry who owned lily

bell flowers in san francisco

and when jack and jim finally had a

prototype for their hardware

they approached her at a market and

asked her if she wanted to try it out

uh taking credit card payments she

showed a little bit of hesitancy and

wasn't quite sure but just as they were

having that conversation

a customer a potential customer walked

up to her um and said that he didn't

have any cash but he would go

get someone come back and so they waited

around and waited around and lo and

behold

the customer never returned and so that

really

helped just fuel even more so the need

to create

this hardware and provide this to

sellers who are trying to capture every

type of payment

um so i'd really love to hear how does

this kind of customer centricity

lead to innovation well i it wasn't one

time that we did that like

we went on a cherry multiple times

um and asked her if she would try or

work on and she

repeatedly said no um

until the point when she lost the sale

and that was the biggest insight we we

originally thought that we were building

a

credit card reader that plugged in the

phone and had an easy

app that got you to the visa or

mastercard or

acquiring gateway but ultimately what we

learned in that moment

and it we didn't i don't think we

realized it in that moment but what we

learned

over time was it wasn't about building

the credit card reader is about making

the sale

helping installer make the sale if we

focused only on building a

little plastic device that plugged into

the headphone jack and built some

software around that would be a very

very small not very impactful company

but because we focused on a deeper

problem

which was how do we help us all and make

the sale in the first place

we expanded our entire universe of

solutions so a credit card reader is one

solution that point of sale is another

solution

because it allows someone to see their

entire business and

get analytics around how they're doing

and make better decisions

lending is another solution

which came in the form of square capital

and so on and so forth so by by going a

little bit deeper into

the observation what we're seeing we

created something much more valuable

than

what we started with yeah it was also

interesting

when we got the first ipad uh

because instead of being restrained to

you know this much screen area we had a

full ipad's worth

and so that naturally led us to thinking

about all the other things that

our customers had to do we had some

customers at that point but not very

many

um at least not compared to today and

it's really

interesting if you think of payments as

this

wonderfully honest form of communication

you know what you spend your money on

are things you value

what you think spend your money on is is

almost as important as what you spend

your time on in some ways

and so it's a really interesting insight

into what matters for a business and if

you start connecting to that

it naturally leads to a very rich

ecosystem

that's awesome uh talk to me about how

you engage with the developer

communities

as you're building up square were there

certain forms that you all

used or communities that you contributed

to how do you think that's changed if

any uh

to today when we first started we didn't

i mean we consciously decided not to

engage with the developer community

because we

you know we had we had a bunch of

experience with apis in the past and

like how

much um they could potentially be abused

and given that we were dealing with

money

and moving money around we want to make

sure we had a lot of control

over how our system was working

and we'd have enough people staff

engineering resources to make sure that

we could build the right constraints

um to start so we we didn't really start

with the developer community until

a few years in um and

again it was a conscious choice our

first focus was

one specific customer which was a seller

who otherwise would not be able to

accept a credit card

and we just stayed focused until we had

a much stronger base and a greater

understanding of where to go from there

and then as we got the right engineering

talent

and we understood like what we were

building

and we understood like what the right

endpoints were

we started building out the developer

community

and um a lot of it came from

you know just making sure that anything

we build internally

ultimately could we export it externally

like we should be a client of our own

platform

ideally and that's how we

originally started building the the

system and

you know in many cases we succeeded in

some cases we failed but

we're up we're able to learn very fast

and

build a platform that i think

you know not only exposes a bunch of

new functionality to the world

especially around commerce for sellers

but also encourages entirely new ways of

doing commerce and doing business and

that's just on the seller side we have

much more work to do

on the cash up side which is super

exciting as well

i'd also add that you know there's sort

of an inherent respect for the

development community because both jack

and i are engineers

so it's sort of odd to have a company

founded by two technical

folks but um you know i remember back

even when jack was working with me

almost 30 years ago he was contributing

uh to the open source community he was

writing for linux i remember uh

twiddler the uh corded input device that

you wrote a driver for

um and uh you know that

plus open source has been an area of you

know sort of

deep respect and so i think although we

kind of came to it late

uh i think we came to it well and i

think you see that respect in the

products that square offers and the way

we treat developers

i want to switch now to talking about uh

support and

and how we think about the interactions

that our sellers have with us

as lauren mentioned i have the privilege

of leading the customer success team

here at square

so my team knows definitely how critical

it is that we are providing great

experiences to our sellers

and helping them through really critical

time sensitive initiatives

um that are really challenging to their

business so i'd love to hear from you

what connections does square enable for

its sellers

so i i think the most important thing

that square does for the sellers is it

makes

much of the tedium invisible in other

words if you use square if you're part

of our ecosystem

and you're running your business you can

spend just a little more time focused on

your business

as opposed to worrying about accounting

withholding and you know paying off this

loan and managing all these various

connections

and one of the great uh tragedies

that people experience is they're good

at something they've got this skill and

they say oh i'm good enough i'm going to

open a business

and then when they open that business

they realize that they don't get to

actually do the thing they're good at

because they're

buried with all this other stuff and so

what we've always tried to do with

square is

is just sort of make those problems go

away and

uh you know jack and always jack and i

always discussed in the early days

how the ultimate success would not be

famous but would to be invisible to

actually be this utility layer that

didn't get noticed and i think we still

aspire to that and to the extent that

people use our products without even

realizing how much is going into those

products it's a big win

i have anything to add there no i mean

our the name of our company kind of

indicates what we want to be

which is plain um

out of sight foundational pouring

we we didn't want to put our brand

before

our customers ultimately whether the

customer be

our seller or a developer

we we wanted to fade into the background

as much as we could

and we chose the name accordingly it's a

boring

brand by design um

and uh you know when we were first

talking to our designers and brand

people

they got so upset and insulted that we

wanted to build a boring brand because

their work is anything but but it takes

a lot of work to build

something that is so a brand that is so

foundational

and um nondescript and invisible

that it is apparent we had a lot going

for us and just

our hardware the shape of our reader

was our name the

the structure of our first ipad register

indicated the same shape even though it

wasn't exactly that

so we relied a lot upon

what people put on top of their counter

to reference

our brand more so than having a flashy

name or something that was truly in your

face

yeah if you're excited about your

payment system it's probably negative

energy

that's true very true uh jim i'd love to

hear how do the connections that square

creates

uh fit into the notion of the innovation

stack

so i was confounded by something that

happened at square which is that we

survived an attack by amazon when we

were still

a startup and i couldn't answer the

question

how did we survive and so what i did was

i went on this

it was basically a two year research

quest looking at other companies that

had been in the same situation

and i discovered something that was

really interesting which was

that all the companies that had been in

similarly

deadly situations and had survived and

thrived

were all focused on very very small

customers and enabling people who had

essentially been excluded from the

market

and this was true in banking it was true

and furniture was true and

in transportation and i found hundreds

of examples of

of this phenomenon and and when i sort

of dove down into it what i saw

was that at the core with something i

sort of had to come up with a name for i

called it an innovation stack and it's

it's the mess that you have to create

when you're doing something new

and that was sort of the big insight of

the book which is that

square because we were trying to serve

customers who were basically excluded

from normal rails of commerce as as i

was

you know as a small glassblower but you

know as my friends were

like i know it was to be left out and

then when we started to

build tools for these people what we

discovered was that

the entire payments ecosystem assumed

that people like

our customers weren't there it just drew

the line it

said we're not going to serve anybody

below this line um

and so what square does we started

building new tools for ourselves first

to make these connections and that

collection of tools became an innovation

stack

and i saw this pattern again and again

and again so that's why i wrote the book

was because

it's this very powerful message which is

to say that

by serving the underserved you can

create something that's so powerful

that it can you know withstand an attack

from a company like amazon and

ultimately grow it into something that's

very very significant

thanks for that one of the reasons i

personally love working here at square

is that we're a mission driven

organization with a strong purpose

believing that the communities we serve

are our most important foundation

so i'd love to hear from the two of you

on um how do the connection square

creates um connect with the communities

we serve or how

should they

well i i don't think it's any different

from our customer focus like we have to

we have to be in tune with like who

we're serving and those people

are in tune with a particular community

and those

communities might intersect with a bunch

of other communities that we're not

aware of

so i think the simplest answer to your

question it's just like to be very

customer focused

and one of the challenges in building

square early on was

you know jim had a glass factory and

would blow glass and sell it but it

wasn't

his every single day like the people

we were serving they were trying to

build coffee stores and they were flight

instructors and there were

flower carts they're going out every

single day and selling something

so we weren't our customers

and when you are building something

where you are your customer

the next step is fairly obvious when

you're not the customer

the the next step isn't as much so you

have to observe

a lot more you have to talk with our

customers a lot more

you have to understand what they're

trying to do

and not take direction from them because

if you take

direction from them you tend to get into

a

a situation where you're building

something for a very specific

niche instead of something that's more

broad-based

so it's observing patterns listening

learning like what connects all the dots

and then

adding our own opinions on top of it and

then building

ahead of our customers expectations so

we to really build up a muscle of

getting better at talking with who we

serve on a more regular basis and that's

why we put

an emphasis on customer service early on

in the company

jim was often found in the headphones

he's

wearing right now on the phone with

people who are angry at us

or in rare cases thrilled with us

and um in every one of those

conversations we learn

something and enough of those

conversations informed decisions going

forward

yeah having seller dna at the core of

the company was super helpful

uh for instance square didn't hold any

focus groups yeah there were like no

one-way mirrors

um in our early days and i still think

today

um we stay in touch by a very organic

connection to people

and what their lives are like and how

they run their businesses and how

intertwined those things are and

you know one of the things that we saw

during the pandemic which i was super

proud of

was how quickly square responded to this

outcry i mean companies were being shut

down

little businesses were like wiped out um

but the thing about little businesses is

they're incredibly adaptable

as long as you give them the tools they

need and square was literally on a

cadence

of releasing a new product on a daily

basis sometimes

partially you know partial releases in

the middle of the day it was it was so

wonderful in the you know time of the

tragedy to

see a company that was still connected

that closely to its customers they

couldn't respond that fast

uh well as we talked about at the

beginning of this session square was

born out of gym being unable to process

a payment um

so how is our developer platform an

extension of that initial spark

and what does it mean for square now to

have third party developers helping

ensure that sellers never miss a payment

i think it's less about that and more

about we

realize it's a self-awareness that we're

not going to be able to build everything

and our value is only as good as

who chooses to use us and what how they

choose to own

what we build in their own way so

in some cases it's it's very much you

know consumer focus where

i'm gonna use what you have and i'll

customize it my own way

based on the tools that you give me as

you go a level deeper developers come in

the mix

and it might be a small business that

has four locations that

hires an independent developer to

do something that the software doesn't

do but

um the functionality in the api allows

or

you go a level deeper than that and you

create an entire company based on

the platform but it should scale to

every

you know every foundational level along

that

so uh it's you know how do we how do we

build a platform that enables people to

as they get more sophisticated with

their understanding of what they want

they can build

with complete optionality with complete

freedom

without having to think about us at all

and you know i think in both gemiini

our cases like as we've learned about

technology we've been able to go deeper

and deeper and deeper and deeper

and as the technology unfolds gracefully

you can make it more powerful

and as people make it more powerful

square becomes more viable to

those developers those customers and

also to the world so

the more we can open up the more we can

um

we can we can give back uh in whatever

way

the the more people we're going to be

able to serve ultimately

jim anything to add there only that you

know the

the humility that you have to have if

you start dealing with

massive numbers of customers um is is

not lost on

me or this company um

the the needs of the individual

businesses these are really very

specific

and um i love the fact that we've got a

developer community right now that's

helping us meet those needs better

because as jack said we can't build for

everybody but we can give an api and

expose

the things that we need to do uh to make

them work and i was literally

in a place a couple of weeks ago where

somebody had uh

they were not in the united states but

they bought the square hardware

because our hardware was so awesome that

they were using the hardware

uh because it was the thing that served

their need in a little community that

had been just

like devastated by the pandemic and i

was happy to see that

you know in that case they were able to

pick something from our stack and make

it work

that's great well we're down to our very

last question and it's a big bold

question

i'd love to hear from the two of you

what is the 5

10 and even 100 year plan for square

um well i

believe that anyone who has a firm

understanding of what

the next five years or 10 years or 100

years looks like or

how they might build is probably wrong

i think the more important thing is to

understand the trends

and i think the trends that will affect

us the most will be

artificial intelligence will be

cryptocurrency and bitcoin

having a native currency for the

internet will be

regulatory um issues both defensive and

proactive by various governments around

the world those are the things that

will impact our company our business our

customers the most

um and it's not a question of like

having a perfect roadmap or a vision for

the next five or ten years

it's more about being agile enough to

understand

this is the trend it's obvious

here's what we're going to do with it

are we going to

utilize it to our advantage are we going

to react it

react to it and block it in a particular

way are we going to ignore it

at whatever cost it's it's that

understanding

that i think is the most important and

um for us

over the next five ten years it's to me

those are the biggest trends

ai cryptocurrency bitcoin

and um regulatory

yeah i would just say that you know the

core of this is humility

the thing that you want to not do is

think you know what the future's gonna

hold

because if you do that you'll end up

making decisions and then you

tend to cling to your decisions uh when

evidence tells you otherwise

uh and we've seen that you know in the

last year uh

played out uh i i have to really

compliment jack because before it was

trendy

to do remote work uh jack was at the

board of directors saying we're gonna

have remote board meetings and all of

our board members were like no no no

we'll miss the dinners and

you know larry summers gives great hugs

you know and we didn't want to have this

um

you know we didn't want to have our

party broken up but jack was adamant

that we needed to to do this and then lo

and behold we got a pandemic

and we don't miss a beat um uh

the other thing i think is important and

it's something that i watch uh

through you know these little proxies is

is what's our cadence of shipping

product what's a cadence of getting

solutions out to customers and i've seen

that cadence you know sort of

tick up continually over time and that's

so exciting

because what companies typically do is

they get comfortable

and then they go oh yeah we're just

going to sit here and ride it you know

like when we started square we really

looked for innovation in payments

and we found nothing like the preceding

decade was this

complete blank as far as stuff that was

done

uh and i'd say since then um square and

companies

you know that have been inspired

hopefully by square have have

really taken that innovation up and i

just love the fact that we got a

developer community

because that's just so many more brains

on the problem

although i i will say like that the year

the year we started was a very

auspicious year because

um 2008 2009

is when the global banking system

collapsed

and we emerged from that and also

bitcoin

and all of cryptocurrency emerged from

that moment so

there was something in the air where the

financial system was ready

to be questioned and we had

a few answers and satoshi had a few

answers and

others had more answers as well but

there was something special about that

time that i think we'll carry forth

for the next few decades that you know

we're gonna

we're all gonna learn from and i think

will uh impact the world in a positive

way

couldn't agree more very excited to see

what's come down the road

uh well thank you so much jack and jim

for participating in this session

and for all of you that are viewing it

from home we appreciate you taking out

the time to hear from

square and our co-founder

you
