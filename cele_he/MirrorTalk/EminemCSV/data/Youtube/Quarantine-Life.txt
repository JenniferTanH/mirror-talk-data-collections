sway in the morning shave four

five man uh we had to get these two guys

on

man the two co-founders of shave four

five

we got the one and only eminem on the

line with us right now

and paul rosenberg his partner in crime

i

am uh offline off mike paul and i was

talking about

quarantining and i'm quarantining with

my daughter man how's quarantine going

for

you this [ __ ] sucks


this [ __ ] is terrible like i i you know

i've been writing

and working out

[ __ ] you know just doing doing what

i don't know like the fact that there's

no no sports on right now

is really bothersome

so it's like you know we don't

there's there's not even anything that i

mean aside from the jordan documentary

that's

that's even like

gives you a little a little sense of

normalcy like watching

you know just watching [ __ ] like that

like you try to just like i try to keep

the

try not to watch too much news

because this [ __ ] is like

panic mode all the time yeah and it's

stressful to watch

you know it's like i want to see what's

going on but at the same time it's like

you know i don't know man we're living

in some

unprecedented times right now yeah man

uh

what you think of that jordan doc

it's incredible this [ __ ] is crazy bro

it's incredible

and it's it's it's it's you know it's

only two episodes in but

man that [ __ ] is like

i don't know it's like nostalgic city

yeah

yeah i i love hearing um

like i always wanted to know the inner

workings of dude's mind like his work

ethic you know what i mean

we used to get on the basketball court

and call out his name

like i'm jordan you know but we really

didn't know his work ethic like

that part is kind of insane you know in

a good way though

like when you could kind of unravel how

the greats

became great yeah you know then you find

out they might not be the most likable

person but you can't always get your

cake and eat it too you want him to be

great

he might not be the most likable person

but he's striving to be great that's

that part right there i love seeing

yeah i think that anybody who is uh

you know at the top of their game at

whatever they do whether it's athletics

or anything

has to put the time and have the work

ethic you you don't get to be that

without it

yeah yeah man it's the same thing for

rap it's like it's

you know it takes a certain amount of

talent but it also takes

it's probably three four times the work

ethic

versus the talent or or it's probably

you know i mean in some cases it might

be equal but it's but you

you don't get one without the other yeah

yeah

that's true you got to work hard paul

what you work hard at paul will you

paul rosenberger yeah i i am

here um trying to perfect how to

live life at home having two kids and

make sure that they are

um learning and in school um

while maintaining some sense of you know

running business

and uh being a a person

the human being that's what that's what

i'm working hard at

well that was beautiful dog yes

man i wanted to ask you uh em you ever

you ever get a chance to meet michael

jordan

um not in person but

i talked with him on the phone one time

and we had i don't know paul if you

remember this but we we were

we were talking about doing some kind of

shoe

like together yeah it was one of the

collaborations one of the collaborations

and

i was on the phone with him we were

talking and and

like everything was cool like he's super

cool like

and everything was good until we get to

the end of the phone call and i said

yo man when are you gonna come to

detroit so i can dunk on you


and it was cricket and he was like

i don't remember exactly what he said

but i i think he just kind of

was like like laughing

yeah and i remember getting off the

phone

going oh my god i think i might have

just blew it

because it was to me in my head it was a

complete it was a total joke right

it's like you know it's it's it's so

ridiculous for me to think that i

i could dunk on jordan right so in my

head

it's you know one of those things that

you think is going to be funnier

in your head than when you actually say

it

so i don't know what happened after that

but

paul did i call you i i can't remember

who i called right after that but it

might have been paul

i don't know i think you you felt kind

of mortified by it

and and um i think i was pretty sure

that

that mike knew you were joking and um

you know

you guys have continued to do business

with with one another

in a few ways since then so i'm sure

it's all good

man it was like it was one of those

things like

it was one of those things that in my

head just would be so ridiculous he has

to know i'm joking

but when i got off the phone i remember

thinking i don't think he knew i

knew i was joking because you know he's

very

i mean watching this documentary like

he's

very competitive right yeah so it's like


i like like i don't know if he would

have if he if he would have um


said when are you you know when are we

gonna battle

i don't know what i would have said but

i would i probably would have uh

probably would have laughed the same way

he did it been like

you know but i feel like i would have

known he was joking yeah

mike mike might have some bars though

you don't know but yeah that's that's

what i mean

that's the other thing like he might

have actually heard about

my game in basketball right

and he might be like yeah yeah this

actually might be possible

you think he heard about your game

though i'm pretty sure he did

yeah it brings girls i mean you've heard

of it you've heard about it haven't you

yeah yeah we played once and yeah i

remember you got a nice game to be quite

honest with you i

not mike jordan nice though bro

yeah i'm like i'm like one step down

yeah

one step yeah from from georgia oh boy

yeah

speaking of i'm gonna tell

watching him in in his work ethic like

it's just so incredible just to know

like

he wasn't he was born with talent

obviously right like he had the talent

but he had to hone his craft

and watching it and and watching the

talent go with the work ethic

like it's it's incredible man it's it's

like

i don't know i that's what make the

greatest degree

i know yeah like it sounds like

like you in terms of the rap game it's

guys like you

and jay or e40 or snoop these you know

guys have been around

y'all y'all just didn't happen to hang

around like it's that work ethic

and then even him not even responding to

you duncan is that competitiveness like

that's the favorite thing i got out of

the dark too is how competitive he is

yeah you don't you don't see that in

yourself like you you spent your like

let's say the last two albums

responding to people who called you out

whether it's

talk show host podcast host or or mcs

you don't have to do

it but you still calling out mcs

that call you out and i feel like that's

that competitiveness in you no matter

where you reach in your career what

would that person say right yeah no no

no it's it's definitely there's

definitely some some truth to that and

there's some elements of that that

they go into what i do but man just

watching that guy like

in midair like switch the shot

you know what i'm saying like yeah and

and have that extra little

thing where he can hang in the air that

long

and do something different you know like

if he sees the defenders coming up

a certain way and he goes around him

or behind the basket like it's [ __ ]

incredible man it's just uh


it's a it's he is a uh phenomenon

no pun intended uh paul rosenberg and

eminem are on the line

um em let me ask you about this some of

the things you've been doing bro i think

um we've been talking about them on the

air

you know i told all our listeners to

citizens

that that i would call and and to see if

you could kind of elaborate on some of

the things you're doing

uh first of all i notice uh marshall

mathers

foundation has been doing a lot with you

know

providing food and providing meals to um

health care workers at the hospitals and

um you guys are providing hundreds of

meals

even at the uh can you talk about that

um

providing these spaghetti lunches for

people and some of the healthcare

workers

how did that happen man what made you

want to do that well me and

me and paul me and paul have actually

just been talking about

you know what what what are some of the

ways that

we can do our part and and try to help

out and mom spaghetti was one of the

things that came

up so we had talked about doing that

um and we talked about

the uh the dj

the dj thing that paul could probably

elaborate on a little better than me but

basically

what we're trying to do is is

paul you want to go ahead yeah no i was

just going to say that

there was a time um you know when this

all started happening where marshall

called me and said you know what

okay what are we gonna do how can we how

can we do

um you know what we do to help help

people out

um and then one of the things that that

i noticed was that

there was um a lack of uh attention

focused on you know making the front

line healthcare

workers feel good and positive just put

a smile on their face so

we reached out to um the guys that at

union joints which is a uh

group in michigan that we've done some

work with before

we did the mom spaghetti pop-up with us

back in detroit and um

when we put out the revival album and um

we did some

some mom spaghetti pop-ups on the road

in 2018. of various festivals etc

so we reached out to them and said hey

could we do um you know

what we did on the road for for some of

the frontline healthcare workers

and they sprung into action and said

absolutely

um so we went and visited some hospitals

on monday

uh and we're going to continue to do

that throughout the next few weeks um

just you know anything to to pitch in

and

um you know make these make these men

and women feel good about themselves for

a minute

uh so that's that's one of the things

we've done and then the other one was um

you know a lot of people were talking

about how djs

have been affected um by the fact that

they can't go out and earn a living

and you've got guys who you know play

clubs and um

you know or or parties or you know strip

clubs or

what wherever they play uh uh and

earn their living they just can't all of

a sudden can't do it

so um we thought about like

maybe we can create some sort of program

to give them you know some

some small release and and again uh

put a smile on their face so uh we have

this this program that we're launching

um now and

it's called love your dj and

we basically are offering michigan you

got to be a michigan resident because we

can't offer it to everybody so we're

going to start with michigan and the

first 500 people

uh who submit a mix via soundcloud

are going to be eligible for 313 dollar

cash payment for 313 for the area code

and the mix just has to you know fall

within a certain set of guidelines which

which is all going to be available

um online and then we're going to select

the best of that group of of dj mixes

and we're going to program

and love your dj mix weekend uh starting

may 2nd

where the entire weekend is going to be

programmed by these mixed submissions

um and that'll be sort of a you know for

lack of a better description of grand

prize

oh [ __ ] so 500 the first 500 djs in

michigan are eligible for 313 dollars

and right uh which is incredible uh

because

djs really don't have a way of getting

money right now

uh why why was it important for um

to like help out the dj's well that was

one of the things that we were talking

about

that you know i i mean obviously our our

field that we work in is music right

yeah so that was one of the first things

that came up when me and paul were

talking like

you know how are dj's going to make

their money

you know right they're the backbone of

what we do

right and so this was a way to just kind

of

um just like get just i mean how long

like how many times would y'all be well

i know you probably haven't thought this

far out but this is kind of incredible

uh how long will you be willing to do it

like it's a time limit we'll see how

this one goes there's

i think they have um i can't remember

how many days

it's all it's all in the rules but they

have a certain amount of time to submit

the mix

um and then we're gonna do this first

weekend and we'll see how it goes you

know i mean uh

hopefully we'll get all 500 um slots

filled up quick

and then we can move from there and

maybe maybe open it to a broader

audience but

you know a little bit of a test run so

we'll see we'll see how this one fly

and then the best ones the incentive too

right paul is the best ones that

that we get we'll actually put on the

air

you know i'll say 4-5 so the contest

begins today and it ends wednesday april

29th

at noon so djs that are tuned in if

you're in the state of michigan

uh you got to go sign up so you could

qualify to have your mix played on the

station

and you could win some money 313 dollars

uh and then people can go to

siriusxm.com

forward slash stream free paul

yep okay uh man that's [ __ ] dope man

um what i'ma do is send my mix in i'ma

mail it to somebody in michigan and then

have them mail that in to y'all

probably won't get it though will we

paul

like well he'll have to have his people

call our people and then you know what

we'll hook you up if it's uh you know if

it's good enough like

okay well you know i've been i've been

working on it uh

now this is really dope man i love what

you're doing and i say it all the time

anybody who's in a position

to help out others right now and taking

that initiative which you don't have to

i commend so even with the mom spaghetti

um initiative and passing out you know

food to health care workers these people

aren't paid enough as it is and they

sacrifice and they putting themselves at

risk every day

and then even giving back to the

community the hip-hop community because

djs can appreciate it

and then also giving them an opportunity

to be on the station

i think that's dope um and then man are

you doing a playlist or something a

quarantine

playlist that that people could tune

into

yeah which i'm still i'm still kind of

working on so i

paul i sent you some stuff yesterday but

uh

i got a few more things that i want to

add to it but uh

yeah it's basically you know what

um how would i describe it

well it's called music to be quarantined

by right yeah

so it's like what what what uh you know

what i want to

what what i want to hear basically

so i recommend people listen to as well

right uh

hey em let me ask you bro cause you know

i've known you a long time man

and quarantined for most of the country

seemed like something new

but because of your fame and the status

you've had

it feels like and i could be mistaken i

could be ignorant

but this kind of seemed like you've been

there was a time in your life where you

were already self-quarantined

because of the fame because of the you

know the public fanfare is that fair to

say

yeah i mean for for sure there's there's

something there's

there's something to be said about that

like it's you know it's uh

but it but it's not the same it's not

the same when you can't do

a lot of your regular routines and [ __ ]

and and you know

going to the studio is like my my

outlet you know and it's it's

you know i can't we we can't really get

in right now and do much so

i've just been writing you know but yeah

the to to a certain extent

yeah you know famous definitely over the

years

kind of already had me quarantined but

it's the fact of knowing that you can't

go really go out

and you can't like we can't move like

how we how we normally move and

you know there's so it's it's not just

the same

it's not just the same thing for me yeah

every day you know what i'm saying that

it always is there's something to be

said about

knowing that you can't go out and do

certain things like because the truth is

if i wanted to go out

i can do certain things right there's

certain things that i'm able to do

regardless of the fame or not that i

still can't do

and like i said it you know we were

talking about

what what to do right now and it's like

the fact that that

when you're home and you can't even

there's not you can't even watch sports

like

you know there's no boxing there's no

[ __ ] there's no baseball there's no

nothing

right so it's just like you can watch

the news

or you can bury yourself in netflix you

know

but uh i just been burying myself in the

pad

you know because and and like i said we

started reading rock kim's book i saw

the crook

the crooks corner interview and if if if

people

ain't seen that you need to go watch it

the rock cam interview

that that king crook did on crooks

corner is incredible

and especially especially

if you know and understand rock kim like

and have studied them like i have like

it's incredible for me to watch

something like that

and just you know he he's he drops a lot

of jewels in that man


you know i saw and i saw what king crook

did with you too um

and i thought it was good because i know

you guys got a different kind of

relationship

being family i was listening to the i

will track

off the album that had king crook royce

and joelle and you on it

then um verses that you guys all spit

you know what track i'm talking about

yep okay um did how does that work was

those pre-recorded verses so that was

just

because it feel like every time y'all

get together y'all make great songs

but you mention boxing it's like a

boxing match

yeah you know you know how was that

bringing that song together

well it was i mean it's it's kind of

just like we

we just we do what we do right like like

us getting on a song like especially

like in the

in the when we were when we were doing

the slaughterhouse albums

it was the same thing it was like

getting on us getting on a song with

with anybody from slaughterhouse was a

problem

right and and


rappers like king crook and joel ortiz

man

they're a [ __ ] problem yeah right so

if you're gonna get on a song with them

you gotta

you need to [ __ ] bring it and

that's one of the things that that that

to me is

you know it's it's it's so dope that

that you know crook is doing

crooks corner right now too but

people who might not know about crook

need to look up some of his music

because he's a [ __ ] problem

he's one of those dudes that it's

nerve-wracking to get on a song with him

royce too

same thing yeah that uh

the allegory was uh [ __ ]

uh that's that that one might that's

royce's bible

album you know like just

listening to like i i still listen when

i'm listening to that

album man i'm i feel like i'm i'm

halfway in a lecture hall but also i'm

in euphoria for a dude who just loved

lyricists

yeah you know i i wonder too like i

when i know we ain't talking a minute

but there's certain things i was curious

about because i'm a big fan of don

toliver

and i was a big fan of um juice world

both of which you put on this project

and i didn't even realize you knew those

dudes

you know um speak on juice world you put

them on a godzilla joint

um man what was that experience like

with that kid

well it's it's crazy because the the

whole way that that came about like

um you know i've it we're talking about

the crooked interview like i was

explaining you know

explaining to crook like because i'm

sure that he does the same thing

like you know us us being in the game

for a certain

amount of time it helps us i think that

as

as as artists and just as hip-hop

connoisseurs to pay attention to what's

out

right and pay attention to all the new

[ __ ] that's coming out because

you know a lot of these kids coming up

man they've they've

they've studied the greats and you can

tell

and and just watching them is is

is incredible because you know you you

you might get to push back on certain

sides of the argument about hip-hop like

okay

uh nobody's really saying lyrics anymore

and this

but but that's [ __ ] because a lot of

these kids coming up

and i i i you know i i mentioned

kendrick and cole a lot i know they're

not kids coming up anymore

but but they came before or

after us right but they've studied all

the greats and you can tell

because it goes into their pen and uh

you know i just i me personally i just i

don t oliver's dope as [ __ ] uh

juice world man it's like like his his

freestyle that he did

like um when he went on tim westwood and

rap for like an hour straight


was incredible especially

for coming off the top of the dome you

know what i'm saying because a lot of

people

just can't do that and they don't know

that there's a or they might not know

that there's an art to that

like to be able to be able to do that

so you know i keep my finger on the

pulse of everything that's out because i

don't want to get

you know swept away with the tide

because if you don't keep up with the

times like like we were talking about

the work ethic like it's

i swear to you it might be harder to

maintain it than it actually was to get

it

so like getting to the place where i was

in the

very beginning of my career right

i know how hard i worked to get there

but i i swear i feel like it i worked

just as hard and if not harder

just to be able to maintain a skill set

you know

yeah you you always like i i find it

having known you so long i i i really i

keep asking you this because i find it

fascinating how you respond

like you're still ready to battle

anybody you know and

it don't matter who it is that critique

you

do do you do you find enjoyment in that

like oh okay this is oh [ __ ] that's my

motivation right

yeah i'm not gonna lie i i that

that's the kind of [ __ ] that i kind of

live for is

is that not saying that i live for

conflict but

my competitiveness you know is

is uh you know

i don't know how to say it i'm i'm i'm

i'm not looking for it but i'm always

ready for it

you know when when you're a kid we were

kids growing up on hip-hop

like me in detroit i didn't know

the stories behind certain things

right so this new beastie boys

documentary is coming out

so i got a chance to watch it yesterday

and they you know they had sent it over

uh which was super cool of them to do

and just hearing old stories like that

man it's just like

and just like how you know i think about

when we saw run dmc on tv like like

seeing them like even even when they

show like old clips of

when they first were coming out right

when it when run dmc was first coming up

it was like man they're so cool right

like like run swag and just

d like how they're doing it right now

you know when i see clips from back then

i feel like

this [ __ ] still looks cool today like

you get the story you get the context

but yeah but knowing the story of how

the [ __ ] originated to me is

just it's so intriguing to me like i

love

stories like that i remember i

i remember one day one day i uh i hit

red man because

i was like i asked him i i was listening

to you know i collect tapes

and just trying to get the you know in

first nostalgia purposes but i also play

the tapes

right because it's just something that

you know reminds you of a kid and

whatever

so i'm playing the tape and i remember

uh on the illegal album

uh jamal said

uh jamal said uh what the [ __ ] did he

say

uh something about uh got a quote from

my man read

it says tonight's the night or whatever

and it was an ad-lib on there

so i was like i just asked him i checked

i hit him up i was like yo

red did you say uh was that you on the

ad lib there because

and he was explaining the story and i'm

like yo that's why i love

old stories like that because it'd be

it'll be the [ __ ] that i always wondered

as a kid

but now it's like i know a lot of these

guys

so i want to you know i try not to fan

out too much but

but sometimes like i just love little

jewels like that

did you ever see the uh unsung epmd

yeah bro oh my god yeah like this

like headbanger yeah like how that song

was made and like what happened at the

video

shoot and the you know the tension it

was on it because him and

like eric and paris were going through

some things but it was like

but uh just knowing those stories

because when when when we're kids man we

just see it on tv we just see the

actual finished product product we don't

see we don't know what the story was

behind

any of the [ __ ] at that time right so

when you grow up and you learn

oh that's what was going on during that

time oh that [ __ ] is crazy

like that to me is the the the best [ __ ]

yeah bro uh man next time we talk man i

wanna i'm gonna ask you about a bunch of

songs that in your repertoire that

that you produce and you can give me

some of the backstory on that i love to

do that

okay you down with that yeah paul you

down paul

like like four flat tires sway you know

that the way i am

the real quick story i will tell you

about that is

that that i

i remember being on a plane i got on a

plane

and i was thinking it is this this flow

in my head

and then all of a sudden the piano

started coming

to me then and then and then and then

and then

and then and i just kept repeating the

the the melody so i didn't forget it

and i kind of wrote the song on the

plane

and then had to make the beat afterwards

so and and i remember i i didn't know

how to like

i had to ask dre how to do it because at

that point in time like i was still

learning how to produce

right so i needed to make the idea come

to life

so i remember and i was actually on the

way out to la

um at that time to record with dre

so that was one of the things that i

brought to him and i was telling him the

idea so we just had to

keep the keyboard player play to play

the melody

and then he had a bunch of drum sounds

up on his uh

on the drum machine and i just started

tapping and

and uh that's kind of how that came

about

oh [ __ ] uh man i know we got to go

but dre man um just even having that

access

if i'm trying to think

nobody is done with drake has done what

dre

has done but who's a producer

that you really like put on a pedestal

maybe not like dre

but if anybody could do a versus with

dre who you think it could be like

could it be diddy could it be jermaine

dupri could it could it be molly mall

who you think

it could be to just go song a song with

dre

i know bro you know i mean you know i'm

gonna be a little biased anyways but

no there are some amazing producers

though man that could

could uh definitely

definitely uh be on his level you know

close to that level mm-hmm who you think

i don't even know how

how to say it you know i'm trying to be

politically correct but

i think that uh you know dre is in in in

his own

class as far as there's only one direct

man he's in the class by himself yeah

but but you know but molly mom man

that dude has a lot of [ __ ] hits

a lot of hits and uh he's done a lot of

classic [ __ ]

as well as dre has you know

yeah think about like the symphony

you know um all the ll records he

produced man that that dude has done

so much marley mall would be great man

and then i think the other thing people

get to know who he is that don't know

that should know

how important that dude have been a

hip-hop you know from rakim eric b

roxanne juice crew all of that all of

that stuff

uh yo um congratulations on uh well i
