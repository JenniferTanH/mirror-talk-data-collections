Interviewer,It's just a matter of what round you know I'm saying it like they come from humble beginnings you know I have to had.
Eminem,In order to be the champ i'll have to add to get beaten a couple of times yeah learn yeah yeah boxing is hard man it's.
Interviewer,Hard like i've been boxing for like 13 years just sparring just messing around I mess around with Emanuel Steward.
Eminem,And he's the best yeah yeah all the champions back then yeah Cronk Jimmy that was just so  a yes man.
Interviewer,Anybody was coming down here to see the fighters and stuff yeah down there he was the man back then yeah.

Eminem,Remember the amateur the frame for the Olympic those guys were really grateful yeah yeah man in an Emmanuel was like he.
Interviewer,Would this was like 12 13 years ago right so he would he would come over he would show me the basics and it took a.
Eminem,Lot for me to look it took a long  time for me to just learn the basics right so then he started like a.
Interviewer,After a couple months of us doing it and they were just like you know up-and-coming kids and stuff like they.
Eminem,Would you know didn't just you want to spar with em they're like okay cool I got a funny little story so he's.
Interviewer,Bringing his boxers and this is we're probably like six months in and he's bringing his boxers like every week.
Eminem,Right and i'm getting my ass whipped but I'm at least I'm staying with him right I'm getting some good hits in I feel.
Interviewer,Really good about myself so one day he comes over and he brings his boxer from crunk and I'm in the house and I.
Eminem,Remember like i was on the phone or something so when I came out the dude that he brought had his headgear on.
Interviewer,Right and uh and i'm like oh okay i guess he's ready so I put my strap on my headgear we're going at it he kicked the.
Eminem, me up so after we're done we go like three rounds right I don't think I got one hitting after.
Interviewer,Three rounds he takes off his  head gear and I said man how old you he said 14 I'm done yeah man um it's.
Eminem,Funny when you said it cuz some fighters just um they mature early they may be 14 15 they may be the best day ever being a.
Interviewer,Night anymore yeah that's just how it is mics with people they they mature they only.
Eminem,Peak at a certain age i paint they're looking my twenties and stuff some people peaking at 30 some people.
Interviewer,Peaking at teens it's just i feel like if you hit me I probably die like right now like I still feel like you can I.
Eminem,Still feel like you could get in there and just  people up wow I don't even have them anymore they mentality feel.

Eminem,Punch a  yeah I saw recently we 90 was showing me the video you did where you.
Interviewer,Was just  around and you was trying to show these dudes how - yeah yeah and how you jump to the side real.
Eminem,Quick jump to the other side like man he could get in there right now and  up anybody well cuz they make this fight.
Interviewer,You know you can fight at any age any age fighting and fighting yes you can do forever so you have to desire to do it.
Eminem,Fighting's all about spears you want to do you could do that in the age yeah but it's like but but nobody nobody knocked.
Interviewer,People out in the way that you did like people people got knocked out by other fighters but it was like when they got.
Eminem,Knocked out by hew they got knocked the  out yeah that's how I looked at every time I heard somebody knock come.
Interviewer,Out my life gets better yeah my life gets better yeah and so I love hurting people that yeah cuz my life is getting.
Eminem,Better and i'm getting a  girl I'm getting imagine I'm getting the plane I'm getting the boat I'm getting.
Interviewer,Whatever i want so hurt and is beautiful and my perception of my life at the time yeah but it's like to be a fighter.
Eminem,Though it's like you got a it takes a special kind of person it takes a special kind of commitment you don't say.
Interviewer,It's almost like you almost have to give you happiness up to accomplish your goals.
Eminem,Right because you when you do anything if you want to be the best garbage can.
Interviewer,Collected in the way time you want to be the best in the world at anything it's gonna be disappointment.
Eminem,Yeah a lot of competition and it's gonna be guys that peak a younger age that he's gonna blow you away with either kid.
Interviewer,And then you're gonna do it i gotta blows you away when he's old guy here and then it's going to come to the time.
Eminem,When you're experienced enough then that's me you know you start blowing anybody's everybody gifts their time.
Interviewer,Yeah yeah but it's like you're right though because like like from me rap is like a 24/7 job and it takes a lot of.
Eminem,Dedication right and you just stay sharp with the pin and stuff like that but it just takes it's a different kind of.
Interviewer,Discipline to do that you know what i'm saying like and the end and the balls to get in the ring and fight in the first.
Eminem,Place that listen know why i hate to have anybody gets in the  ring you just think about it as human beings.
Interviewer,When fighters do we avoid all of our life getting into a fight and that's what a guy that every day of his life he.
Eminem,Fights every day with life and we avoid that  yeah it's humiliating if you're not on the right side and if.
Interviewer,You're not fight and he's still went intimidating yeah you're gonna get hurt you know some people avoid fighting just.
Eminem,It's not normal people are not supposed to fight building a structure to fight a hand and I've developed the fight even.
Interviewer,For boxer they break that's what we have to wrap him up in everything is not human beings are not designed to fight.
Eminem,Yeah we do it all this just part of our DNA to kill one another just DNA who you are as part of a any form of murders is.
Interviewer,A form of self-hate yeah you know i mean you kill another person so it's just it's just nicked me and stuff how you.
Eminem,Feel about yourself yeah it's interesting though it's like you know boxing is just like a like coming up.
Interviewer,When i was a kid i got my ass kicked a lot I fought I lost I fought I won you and I'm saying and it was it was a night.
Eminem,And there was a time it was a point in time where I started getting enough fights and winning enough fights that I.
Interviewer,Felt confident until i started learning some of the fundamentals of boxing and I'm like I don't know  I know.
Eminem,Nothing like we all believe in here that if you get involved with boxing it's a tough man sport boxing is not a.
Interviewer,Tough man support a tough guys gonna get hurt in boxing I talk funny at the end of the day yeah understand them this is.
Eminem,A thinking man sport only the smartest one yeah when you get a certain level yeah only.
Interviewer,The smartest would tough guys man this is not a tough man sport yeah no I shot you look man I I also know you got a.
Eminem,Heart so it's like you  somebody up and then feel bad later yeah and you'd be late because out you know you'd be.
Interviewer,Nice to him after the fight like i don't like I hate you during this fight and then I don't hate you anymore and I.
Eminem,Actually feel bad cuz you might die now that's who you are that's know that's our fear yeah right there with vicious.
Interviewer,Be ferocious to the fact that we've lost before and we've been disappointing before we don't want that feeling.
Eminem,Anymore yeah the foot the fact that took that we have to go back to Brownsville you have to go.
