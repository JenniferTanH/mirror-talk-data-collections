when the album first came out music to

be murdered by and I was like okay

sometimes I like to trip off people's

reactions and and I didn't get the

young ma line when she was like you can

lead this earth I'm in rake mode

why is it richer than you leave this

earth rake mode and it just flew over my
 head and I was like damn I

didn't even get that mm-hmm and

like you reversal I will when you said

that I got the John Wilkes this who I'm

in the booth like a bruh I go ham for

dead presidents I got the ham from a

bruh ham like I got the a bruh but I

didn't get a bruh like a bruh like I

missed that no I was like how did I

miss that

goddamn yeah I mean that's what happens

like that Ohio scheme you did that

was crazy and it took me like two

listens to get to Cincinnati

yeah you know what I'm saying lying I

was like wait a minute since then since

anadi

yeah oh sure this thing for address yeah

I saw I saw some people got there and I

was like kind of sometimes I don't know

if you ever be sitting around writing

some in your life man nobody's

gonna get this yeah and then you're

like oh well let me just try it and see

if anybody does like but that's that's

the like that's kind of a beauty of

wordplay was like sometimes people ain't

gonna get it the first list and they'll

get it the second third fourth fifth

listen it's gonna take a lot of lessons

for the new one that you just drop music

to be murdered by the line it's so many

lines in your phone

what's up y'all sure man can crook it

I'm live and dr. Dre's lab right now you

know what I'm saying and um I could

spend the whole episode giving you know

props to the man across the road for me

you know his achievements are just

incredible you know I mean um what are

you doing worse he's oh you thought my

meat yeah you're saying I got the homie

in the house one of the greatest of all

times Marshall Mathers thank you thank

you thank you for being here brah

absolutely appreciate your time man um

let's jump into it man let's talk about

music to be murdered by Islam inspired

by the 1958 release from Alfred

Hitchcock with the same title what made

you do that well it was actually Dre had

the sample like years ago right and he

made a beat to it and one day just

popped in my head I can't remember why

so I hit him and I was like yo what did

whatever happened to that beat and he

was like I was still around so but the

beat was the beat was different I just

updated a little bit with some drums and
 right but like that was but it was

based off that that I started thinking

like you know the whole concept is crazy

like music to be murdered by like I

wonder if I could play off this whole

Alfred Hitchcock thing and and then Dre

started hitting me with ideas it was

like yo you need to listen to this album

that he has so he sent me a link to that

and I started listening you know I was

like yo okay I could face this whole

album off of that Wow there was actually

some stuff that didn't make it on there

that I was trying to get on there but we

couldn't really work it out with the

sample clearing but I had it even more

intertwine and it was and we wanted you

know pick and choose the best pieces to

put on there just first sampling issues

and but uh samples Yeah

right

when I was stuck in traffic for like

three hours listening to it over and

over and over and I caught something new

every single time and it's like this is

gonna it's gonna take you know to about

twenty twenty-one or some for

everybody really gets all of and I'm

talking about avid fans yeah you know

then like when you write in that type of

on that level you know like you said you

say you just put it in anyway even

knowing that it could slip by people's

radar yeah I feel like I feel like you

know there's a certain there's a certain

kind of fan it will get that and there's

a certain kind of fan it might just be

the average listener who doesn't you

know they like hip-hop and and it sounds

good something sounds good to them right

but they might not understand exactly

what we're doing how dope it is yeah but

well but but that's what's dope about

those reaction videos and also the the

people who break down the lyrics and

they show you like okay he was hitting

these syllable schemes right here every

single syllable there's five syllables

there in hor seven right and he was

hitting these right here and he started

a new syllable scheme rhyme with that

syllable scheme and then came back at

the end and Ryan with the you know I'm

saying I think that that helps people

like really understand the genius yeah

it's only enough for one joint stopping

the limo hop in the window shopping the

demo gunpoint

yeah the outer rhymes are two syllables

the inner rhymes of five syllables yeah

that's in my opinion what makes you want

to do this a long time yeah but that's

to me my opinion back to you because

when we did the what the was it my

house like this is this mean Royce

chuggabug this all the time we're

like crooks to me on the song

alright but uh but we joke about that
 all the time cuz it's like you and

him to me make verses that even if you

laid them first

they're unstoppable so it's like I can

only hope to tie mmm at best that's

because we must be a compliment from you

dying bro when you did in my house the

lights out or utility

in the facility physical life out to

wipeout I forgot the next scene but it

would utilities in different like he was

rhyming all that right like that

was like and and and and being able to

keep it going like that's what I think a

lot of a lot of the average listener

sometimes might not understand that we

did this you know because some people

don't catch the syllables they think

that were you know rhyming you know my

house the lights out utilities in the

facility like house rhymes and out

rhymes right they're not catching the

full scheme yeah yeah they're not

catching them my house lights out

digital life spouts wipeouts like

there's two there but then there's

utilities and the same thing it's like

that's the that's the beauty to me of

the craft of M scene is that that's

important to you oh yeah yeah because

it's it's and I know it's important to

you because it's what makes rap fun

right right so sometimes we might not we

might not have a we might we might be in

the mood to like not even not to write a

song that might not have a message to it

why not really be saying anything that's

important right but it's more about the

craft and we're just trying to go as

hard as we can go you know and I think

that that to me is what makes it fun

right it's being able to you you know

when you thought of it

hey bruh I'll go ham for deaf prisoners

like you feel something right when you

think of that your little that's

come okay yeah yeah alright let me let

me figure this out let's go down with

this scheme and figure it out but that's

that's to me man is beauty of uh of this

culture um younger make a lab come about

I was very surprised to hear her on

there you know me she's been doing

damage yeah all around well he put out

ooh

yo she's dope that kind of started

following a little bit and then it was

like I started watching every video she

put out why and I was more so like

intrigued by her persona like how like

she just carries herself like a star

right right like she's just like

charisma right right but she also had

the bars and I was like man like this is

like like she's really got bars like I

was so then I I just went down the

wormhole of like to eat freestyle she

did right and then she did flex and how

she was just calm murdering it on flex

right but she barely even raised her

voice yeah like she was just calmly

killing it I was like oh my gosh she's

so I just reached out I was like you

know I want to I want to put on an album

in like I'm gonna do something with her

and hit her up and I was like yo I want

I said I got just intro to the album and

then I want you to be the first thing

that people hear after that you know I'm

saying like gave it up Ali oh yeah crazy

yes she just went in yes he murdered it

is that what you do you go down a rabbit

hole with different artists when you

when you start liking them and you go

down to Wormold kinda it's funny because

I usually spend I mean this has been

this way for a while I usually spend

like an entire Saturday if I'm not at

work I'm not at studio I spend like an

entire Saturday going through everything

this out

you know I'm saying like checking out

everything Wow yeah I hear that

on Saturday so y'all better bring you

our best never know who listening

you know for real man um Black Thought

like I feel like you guys finally gave

us what we wanted a collab you know what

I'm saying

um how do L did that happen well I had

been wanting to do something with him

and I just never found the album or the

song that I felt like would be good to

get him on it was worth you know I'm

saying like this might be right up his

leg jinan made the beat right so Royce

put a verse on it and then q-tip had to

hook and when I heard the hook I was

like my my

and I was like me him accounting from

the same era you know saying so this

might work right so I just hit him up to

Royce asked if he could send him the

track right and he says help me magic

yeah I'm a magic that was a collab that

hip-hop has been waiting on for long yo

his Funk Flex freestyle was just

like oh my god I'm in here for 10

minutes yeah crazy crazy

would but again is what we love about

this music right is because especially

as a competitive rapper right we're apt

to be we're competitive rappers right

we're not just like we're in it we do

this this is what we do and it's like

inspiring to hear that but it also

like kind of gets you like yeah

yeah like gives you anxiety right but

it's like but at the same time you kind

of get pumped up about it and be like oh
 every time something new comes out

like that you're always like like my

mindset is like you know I gotta try and

top that right right right you know Sam

and then you go do it um first of all

congratulations man

ten number ones on Billboard 200 that's

already booked you know I'm saying I

gotta put that out there man highlight

how does that feel don't like you know

I'm saying did you ever imagine that you

have ten number ones ever ever in the

history of my life like I could never

like imagine like like for me what was

what's crazier about it that to me is

like being able to meet my childhood

idols being able to sit down with LL

Cool J right my favorite rappers of all

time ever when I had when I made the

relapse album right he sat in the car in

the truck and we drove around and he

listened to the whole album and I was

sitting there thinking to myself like I

don't I don't even know what to say

cuz I don't want to play myself like I

don't want to like bow before we

before you got the truck I was like yo

man I just want to say like like what

you mean to me man like and I was trying

to like not make it come off snappy but

I was just like yo man I like I'm I'm a

stand of you know saying like this but

but just to sit there and be like all

right 15 16 year old marshal thinking

that that could actually happen one day

when I'm will be sitting in the car ll

is gonna be sitting around in the car

with me and he's listening to my album
 out of here Wow like that to me

like meeting Dre was like holy is

that what kind of keeps you grounded

like your love for the culture I mean is

that like you know after a huge amount

of success you know it would be easy for

you to be a different type of person you

know saying like what keeps you grounded

I just think I mean I I'm so I'm so in

love with this artform right and I'm so

passionate about it because it's really

the only thing that I ever was good at

you know I'm saying like like aside from

basketball I'm amazing at that but

that's the one getting buckets yeah okay

but uh nah it just you know I I just

love it

I love I love to watch like you know

like the why bein Corday's come up and

you're like oh he's gonna be the

next you know I'm saying like it's the

same why when I listen to one of

your songs I don't really want to cuz it

gets like I get anxiety but I have to I

mean I not that I don't want to but

they're man I mean it's nerve it's
 nerve wracking every time you

and Royce you know and I think because

that you know we're also in this circle

together kind of in its lake but it's

like like y'all are the rappers you want

him on the rappers that out that I get

anxiety being on a song with because I'm

like man I got a I gotta push

the pen rap is like tec-9

right right he's so proficient

right no another word to say you know

I'm saying like he's so like man he

craps out every syllable every one every

single one every rhyme scheme

like it's just like you're hearing

twenty different things that rhyme with

each other in succession absolutely yeah

and I'm sure you hate this too late to

be like well yo you don't understand

what we're doing right right right right

sometimes some people really don't

understand what we're doing they don't

understand it I mean and I get it

sometimes if I listen to something that

you may I'll be like damn either why

didn't I think of that or you know damn

I said something kind of like that but I

don't say it like that and then it's

like okay I can't say that now because

he already just said it you know what

upset yeah that's always crazy man ah

it's a new era man like I always wanted

to know like what's your perspective on

people with longevity such just self

adjusting to the new era of hip-hop you

know I'm saying yeah that's that's you

know that's another one of the things

that make it fun too is like being able

to watch like Cole and Kendrick come up

and seeing how how great they were right

off the bat and it's it's like you start

my god I mean aside from them like I pay

attention to everything that's going on

you know I'm saying like right now all

the new I try to stay up on you

know who's doing what flow patterns that

kind of because it's always

interest it interesting to me like the

baby like I never know where his rhymes

are gonna land right you know I'm saying

and that is so interesting to me

cuz he does it so well it's the same

thing with you and Royce it's like I

don't know I don't really know where

this is gonna go and and when I get on a

song with with you or him I know what

I'm gonna get in the sense of the bar

it's gonna be but I don't know what I'm

gonna get what what style what you don't

I'm saying I don't know I can't predict

right

a flow pattern I can't never do anything

it's the same thing if I get on us

getting on the track with Kendrick I can

never tell what the he's gonna do

right cuz he is such a chameleon of

styles and he can do any pretty

much anything right any any so

proficient at it he's so good at it

and you don't know what you're gonna get

that to me is like a top-tier lyricist

because it's like you don't you can get

your ass kicked any day you know I'm

saying like certain rappers get on a

certain song and it's like it just

depends on ya just like you I mean you

probably inspire countless you know

stupid bars when people know okay I got

to get on a song with em you know I'm

sayin I mean they just know you know I'm

very surprised if you ever have done a

song with every time I listen to a song

that you've done with another artist

it's always one of their best verses you

see what I'm saying it's like you

inspired them to push their pin like

that you know I mean and that's got to

be something to walk in the room and

just change the energy absolutely

absolutely

I mean but it's you know it's it's a

craft that you know we've I don't know

if I've mastered it yet but it's but I'm

still trying to figure out like as

long as I've been in the game I'm always

trying to figure out new flow patterns

and you know I'm saying like new cadence

isn't we're trying to still trying

to always get it right you know cuz it's

like I up make an album I don't always

get it right I don't get it always get

every song right I don't always get

every delivery right you know those one

of the things I'm just always trying to

improve you your toughest critic

absolutely I mean you're probably yours

right yeah

cuz it's like cuz because you know that

you can't sit down with the pan and just

rhyme the last word of every lie you

said that's not fun

yeah not fun I was like I cool yeah you

know meaning and your love for hip-hop

is just evident you know I'm saying like

even the t-shirts you choose to

sometimes I sit back and I see a picture

of you rocking my pleasure

you feel me yeah that's what I'm saying

like like you I think you had like lock

him Shabazz oh yes he serves you don't

say and a lot of people don't even know

you know who that called themselves hip

hop heads might not even know who that

is on your shirt that's what you doing

purpose I mean it is something I do want

a because I love it cuz it's fun for me

like it makes me feel like a kid again

it's like oh I got you know I got

just help them cover like like think

about we're not thinking like iconic

album covers NWA's first album cover

audio two's first album cover like the

color scheme of that like holidays

wearing the airbrushed shirts right

right right like having that on a shirt

is a it's dope to me but it's also like

maybe if I'm doing a show and some of

the younger fans don't know who this is

they'll go back and you know look at go

back and say okay who is that on this

show

yeah and go back in and and be like oh
 yeah cuz lock him Shabazz was
 nice I'm brought in rare I walk

in the square a pure righteous man and

being that much of a you know a part of

the coachee history books are gonna

definitely put you as one of the

greatest of all time how do you feel

about the concept of white rappers being

a guest in a house a hip-hop well I mean

that's the funny thing I I don't know if

I've got a chance to say this yet but

the funny the funny is like I with

with the whole beef of a certain person

right I never said I wasn't a guest

right like I'm absolutely a guest like I

never said I wasn't right and I never

said I was king of anything right like I

had a song called Kings never die but it

wasn't me saying that was one of the

beats that Khalil sent me with the hook

on it that was the concept but a song

and I'm like I can't say I'm the king of

hip-hop right right let's say so I threw

Run DMC in there J and Master J you know

saying like life and was trying to like

because I never want to be like I don't

even

for the king of hip-hop who the is

the king of hip-hop yeah

like is there a king of hip-hop like I

don't know like I feel you on that

people would say people would say just

because you sell the most records

doesn't mean you're the best just

because you can rap 40 million syllables

doesn't mean you're the best

like I care more about rhyming the

syllables mmm you know I'm saying like

like I more about the craft than any of

the other and then that shows you know

sound like and it goes back to those who

know you know I mean if you know you

know and I just don't I don't get it

sometimes you know I mean I watch these

rap media so-called critics and some

music journalists and so many of your

bars and your messages goes over their

heads and you know they like even with

the content conversation I mean you've

been having contests that's day one you

got songs to prove it it's like

sometimes I'm late what what is content

what are you wanting to talk about think

about the first time you heard Rock him

right so when people make these lists

and he's always on the list mm-hmm but

he's also always on my list because to

me greatness is not only how well you do

something but if you were the first to

do it

Rakim was the first person that I heard

that started taking using like inside

rhyme schemes right and coming back at

the end and hitting that you know saying

so he did something that hadn't even

been thought of yet

original yeah it was like and he

single-handedly pushed the genre forward

to be more complex lyrically and and

then and birth Kane and G rap

right right

and man like I like those two will

always be on my list too because like

Kane was doing confused and lose abused

and bruised the crews who choose to use

my name wrong will pay dues oh man come

on

nobody was doing that nobody that was

every single word

he said grind and he just made a

sentence with it that made sense you

know what I'm saying every person who's

a fan of hip hop might feel like hip hop

is about something different hmm right

it ain't about lyrics it's about how

good you you you flow in your cadence

right right or it ain't like but it's

it's or or it's just about the beat is

dope and just having a message over it

that could be what your opinion of what

hip-hop is about my opinion is hip-hop

is about lyricism and the greats who we

put up on the pedestal right that's what

they were about and that was the the

beauty of us being able to learn how to

do it and learn from them right yeah do

you ever agree with any of the top 50

list they circulate on the internet have

you seen one that you'd like oh yeah

that's accurate I've seen a couple of

them why feel like okay that's kind of

accurate I'll never want to come off as

preachy or be like you know you don't

understand what we do we're so much

smarter than you no it's not about that

but we do the craft and we do rap at a

certain level where we know late game

recognize game right right like you can

appreciate Jordan because Jordan was

like a spectacle to see right

it was just like holy right but I

don't even know yes what he was doing

just like mechanics if I hire somebody

to fix my car I'm not gonna hire a

painter my iron mechanic I'm Akay knows

what he's doing under the hood yeah you

know what I'm saying and I can't explain

what he's doing and you can be like yo

that's the best mechanic I've ever seen

right like I saw I saw what does it call

my extra expert opinion with math Hoffa

right right right right

and it was the episode where they were

talking about the verse that I did on

the fat joke thing and I was like these

are the guys these are the guys who if I

was coming up like as a rapper or just a

fan of rap or whatever I would want to

hear from them because they do this too

right you know I'm saying so it's like

game recognize game like like I don't

know if if this guy is the best mechanic

in the world oh you know what

I'm saying it's not my thing

but someone who is a mechanic might be

like y'all this guy is he's the

goat yeah exactly

changing your muffler then we come and

argue with that guy yeah no he's not

yeah go yeah again it's like you don't

want to sound too preachy and be like

you just oh you know we're so much

smarter than you you don't understand

what we're doing like it's not about

it's not about that but it but at some

point it's just like I can't take your

list seriously if they don't have you

want it they don't have rice on it I

can't take it serious I can't take it

serious because it's like you don't you

don't know really know what you're

talking about so I can't even get mad at

I can't get mad at you I think that a

lot of times when people make these

lists they're mistaken the greatest

rappers for their favorite rappers so

what they mean to say is these are my

favorite rappers these are my personal

favorites right right Jay nas they're

always gonna be on that list

right right you always gonna be on it on

some peoples all right doc I've never

seen a list without you on it well I

mean yeah yeah well you might not be

where you deserve to be that's it that's

in my opinion that's how I feel when

people don't put you and Royce there

because the longevity how good you guys

have consistently been to be able to

keep it up to this level you know what

I'm saying and like we're not youngins

in this game you know I'm saying so it's

like we've we put our time in but still

even even to this day when I hear a new

song by you or a new rhyme scheme I feel

like he's still he's still figuring this

out like in other words you're you're

trying you're trying to figure out a way

to make this verse better than anything

you just did prior to it right one each
 verse is like that's how I feel

when I listen to you I'm like oh he's

still with different flow

patterns you know I'm saying like look

and cares about it and cares about it in

the pockets and like I don't never I

don't ever know where your rhymes gonna

fall out and I don't know how many

syllables you're gonna hit but

but that's the other thing is like when

people are like we don't care about the

Super Bowls know that you know you

need to because that's the craft

of doing it yeah a CMC yeah it's up to

you it's up to you like how you know

whatever you whatever you feel you know

but like I think that people are just

sometimes mistaken best emcees for their

favorite rappers speaking of favorite

rappers Trench stretch trench

I don't see on a lot of lists either

yeah that is infuriating to me

because I think that again we was

talking about like Rock Emma did

something that never been done and can't

get something Angie rap did something

had never been done

Treach did do to me I think I think what

happened with Treach and this is just in

my circle of friends that we talk about
 one of the common things said is

well he did OPP and he did hip-hop a

rake right right but he was still

rhyming his ass off on those songs right

right but he also did something to me in

my opinion that like his there was a

time period probably between 91 and

about 95 where every damn near

every rapper in the game was true was

following him right and trying to do

what he was doing absolutely dressing

like him you know you know I'm saying

the whole the whole moving like him

exactly

and he was getting on songs and

smoking everybody and it was like yo

when I heard yoke the joke of my

heart sank my heart saying cuz I was

like I'm never gonna be this good wow I

might as well quit I didn't write a

rhyme for the entire summer I said this

on the ice-t documentary but this is

real I didn't write for an entire

summer and proof was like proof was like

yo man he's good but you gotta keep yeah

like you know what I'm saying right I

was just like but I'll never be that

good by the time he got to wickedest man

alive mmm I was like I quit I don't want

to do this anymore you got a favorite

treasures I got a lot of fish my my when

I heard him dude it when I heard him

yoked the Joker when he was like oh

fuzzy dirty dizzy does he get the fixing

these women by blistery you ain't ready

for the Freddie your rap he can't kill

me I step into your dreams you feel me

slicing your life away just like my mic

today I eat you the cycle where I'm

ripping right away

man he was kidding reg I there are there

are some in this genre that have not

even caught up to that all this time is

past and and those verses are so

timeless to me right like you got people

what we do talk to the bunny Sonny he's

the man bugs the dog with the money

funny that you should mention that's my

family they're covered

what's up to my cousins and my sisters

that my warner brothers birds of a

feather flock to fail to be together no

matter what your whatever and never

found who's better you mean he see them

him those are others he's gifted us with

one pluck initiate the trouble those who

disagree or maybe feel the need in front

it show me your whole entire crew

cashews and I'm a running on it maybe yo

yeah I was just like goddamn yeah he was

what he did was he did wordplay he did

compound syllables multi-syllable

rhyming and he did it in different

styles right he never had to listening

to go back and listen that first album

he never did the same style twice hey I

loved his image I loved what he was

about he look cool you know I'm saying

and you you he you believed him right he

was believing he looked apart he acted

the part he was the part right so that's

why I think a lot of rappers just kind

of started going and I did like with my

writing in shape but it's time the

second album came out I sounded just

like him mmm someone just like trench I

sound like

Kuji rat like there's so many errors

that I sounded like other rappers you

know saying but like it that's what we

do more kids yeah we get if we get

influenced you know I mean and we're

inspired what you think about Royce

that's a producer man is that weird it's

really weird it's really I told

him yo years ago years ago when we first

met I was like yo I was like you should

I said because the way he was picking

his beats and like his ear form I was

like yo why don't you just make beats

cuz when I first started making beats

and learn how to do it you can control

what you make right so it's like making

the song like lose yourself and sitting

there from like the beginning of the

like down to the end of a the completed

song right like can make that trajectory

go wherever you want it to go right both

of us were kind of so far still focused

on rap right but he was like think he

rather put his time into the pin but

kept telling him like even years later

like yo man I'm telling you you'd be

good at it and he started doing this
 and then I didn't hear from him for

a couple months and then he started like

hitting me off with beats and I was like

yo this is crazy

that's crazy did you go and learn one

yeah and then I was like what the

like bro huh how did you get this good

this quick man but I you know amen

yeah yeah uh same thing with me man I

went over there he like I'm making Beast

now crook

I wasn't for real he started making a

beat I was like then let's just kind of

dope I went outside to smoke a cigar and

I started thinking of a 16-bar rap yeah

and I said I'm thinking of a rap to a

Royce beat yeah and I went back in there

like yo I'm doing the new album with my

little brother's family business you

want to UM produce the whole thing he

was like you think I'm ready for

something like that I was like yeah I

think you ready let's get it you know

understand and that's what we came over

and played you yeah man oh man you just

said lose yourself I went down the

wormhole myself looking at your producer

credits hmm you know I'm saying and I

talked to hip-hop fans every single day

on Twitter you know that's one of the

things I do I engage what am I asking

questions rap questions do you feel like

cuz I don't so do you feel like your

name is mentioned enough in the

producers conversation

no I don't know I'm kidding

III don't I mean I don't know I I I love

to make beats right and over the years I

had learned how to produce and probably

made some of my biggest songs right and

was just doing what felt right and I'm

saying but but I'm more so like I it's

fun for me to make beats but it's not as

fun as rap is right right and I'm saying

like so it's like but yeah I don't know

I mean I I mean because people like

y'all rappers who make beats top five

and I'm like yo you got to put him in

there you know I'm saying and then some

of them don't even realize how many

songs that you have produced you know I

mean and that they they know and love

the song they just didn't know that you

produced it that's crazy to me I'm

saying like that's crazy to me um I

don't even understand how that even

happens you know I mean like I think you

rap so well that it kind of just sucks

all the oxygen out of the conversation

hmm I mean it's it's it's interesting

like the first album you know like I was

sitting there with the bass Brothers and

Jeff vast like played instruments right

like he played the guitar he played the

bass he played the keyboards and all

that I knew this music better than

they did as far as like what did she

sound like right I'm saying right so I

would just sit in there on the drum

machine and I had to have somebody show

me how to work it keep the metronome

going and and uh what started

coming out of those sessions and I've

sometimes I'd be like like yo okay what

was that chord okay try it what if he

tried that now go up with it right and

then I hung them cuz I don't know how to

play instruments so I'll be like I would

just hum a lot of well you know and

that's how I started making the beats

and Dre was like yo you're producing

that's producing

who knows like it is oh okay cool you

know the saying like and just fell into

you know yeah like it's funny like I was

thinking the other day cleaning out my

closet

that's that beat was actually a beat I

was making for Bazaar really yeah and

then I don't remember what happened but

I ended up taking the beat and I was

just like cuz sometimes if someone's

there yeah like as I'm making the beat

and they start wanting to write to it I

usually just give it to him and and I

don't remember what happened with that

but uh and they're just became the

stadium mover yeah I'm saying like

that's one of my favorite songs to watch

you perform

really yeah I'm saying some of my early

early was really rough like was

really rough late but it was like a lot

of times late and I in this from coming

up in Detroit like proof had to connects

right so proof used to know J Dilla

proof used to know everybody who was

anybody right so and I don't remember

that phase where like rap was going

through a phase well I mean it still

does it but just there was kind of a

phase in like the mid late 90s where

like if you could get a chick to sing on

your song right and you know I'm saying

like an actual singer chick and proof

would come over with new music and

mandilars making the beats and he's got

chicks all over his hooks and right

I'm like what the there's like so I

would start like thinking of like hooks

like that you know I'm saying and being

like well someone else could sing this

and I'll just lay it for right now for

right now and then it ended up becoming

a thing where I was just like it

I'll just leave it no I did good

decision guardzilla man I gotta tell you

that's one of my favorites right now I'm

saying my favorites always changed when

I listen to albums right now I'm

with Godzilla heavy every day all day

you know

that is crazy I mean the the

cadences and all that like absolute

murder the beat who did that beat da I

said is crazy man oh all right Peter

juice world you know I mean that kid was

amazing yeah you know on that when that

joint favorites change it was out the

juice to man like y'all he that kid was

so talented man he like his freestyle

he'd you know westward we're at for our

look what though funk and I mean he was

like like I he might have been written

mixing a little bit of written in there

with but the way he was free stood like

that's the that's the that we used

to try to do at the hip hop shop was

like try to work on our free Styles

right but be able to slip in and out of

written when you need to you know I'm

saying if you've got a certain punch

line you want to get to to take her take

out this dude right so it to be so young

he like mastered that so quickly

yeah it's really sad man that like his

potential was so off the charts very I

tweeted one time you know I like this

juice world kid and you know I got some

real hardcore boom bap type hip-hop

lyricist fans that follow me to an

airline juice whirl he uses auto-tune

and I'm like yo I dropped a link to that

Westwood freestyle like y'all don't even

talk to me just watch this right you

know I'm saying he definitely had it man

um it's crazy that some of these kids

out here I think that inspired by you

know you you know um J you know I'm

saying and they want to really get that

pan moving oh yeah I was gonna ask you

do you have a favorite you have any

favors on a new joint oh my oh oh joy Oh

every single one it's like ya know every

single no I mean you know I

it's funny when like you know when

you're making an album and it's like you

know sometimes you got ideas already

sometimes you feel like I don't know if

you ever feel like this but it's like

sometimes I just feel like I don't feel

like having a message in this one you

know I just want to go is hardly

as I can you know and then sometimes

like you know I'll get in a certain mood

and be like okay like if there's

something that I'm passionate about like

this is making me either angry or

excited or whatever it is right you know

I might get the idea to do a song about

it like darkness song like when I want

to say something when I feel like I

really has something to say I'm gonna do

it

the darkness joint did you ever feel

like you might get some kind of backlash

from all this gun politics um you know

the right side saying they want to take

your guns left side saying you know we

need more gun control did you feel like

you would get any backlash from you know

I mean I figured I would get some but

it's kind of like you gotta just I'm

more so care about what I believe in

right and whoever else gets

pissed off people like that's this

is this is my view on it and this is my

take it might not be your take so what

about the person who is stockpiling his

house with a hundred and fifty

guns

right like what whatever war they're

waiting for I don't know what were you

waiting for it you need that kind of

Arsenal I think there's also something

to be said I know there's avid gun

collectors and like that but

there's something to be said about

somebody who's buying that many

guns I just don't have a record of it or

you know like there's I'm not on record

as having a you know where I'm able to

get flagged right so it's like the the

whole message of that song was saying

what about the person that it's the that

hasn't you know I'm saying is the first

is gonna be the first time they flip out

in the Arsenal to do it with yeah what

about that guy yeah there's no stopping

that guy right and that's what is when

it's like okay when you when you start

calling for like background checks and
 like that instead of the actual

problem right you know we got to do

something with the gun laws yeah people

start to get like no you can't take our

guns you can't take our guns I'm not

saying that so when you talk about

things like that I would say that that's

content I probably would say that

your critics would say that you just rap

about rapid hmm I just put words

together they just run that's what I do

unless it is crazy man but to me again

yeah you got damn right that's what I do

like a competitive rap like and

sometimes I just want to have fun with

it sometimes I just want to make a song

that might not be about right but

for those who can respect how hard I

push the pen right like you know you get

pillows so what you do you can you can

wrap that mini you can say that many

words that fast you're not saying

anything you're not saying yeah it want

me to say it takes a skill level to do

that and I feel like they're not

respecting that part of the game you

know what I'm saying it takes a it takes

a phenomenal skill level to rap at the

speeds that you wrap at syllables within

those you know I'm saying it's not like

you like then I'm over here then I'm

over there then I'm over here then I'm

over there you know some people fool

people yeah I mean they're just gonna

flow in that I'm gonna buzz it down then

I'm gonna buddy's like oh you're

saying like you actually are putting you

know syllables punchlines

metaphors within that you know cadence

and people are I just think a lot of

times when a rapper says oh he's just

rapping about rapping or he's too rapid

e-wrap it usually comes from a rapper

who can't rap that well a lot of people

diss what they can't do

hmm so it's like if I can't do that I'm

gonna just I'm just gonna sit on it yeah

I'm gonna sit on it and make it like it

ain't that good anyways right and then

people buy the narrative yeah yep and

then you know it might maybe it makes

the person feel good with whatever is

going on inside them I saw some dude I

don't remember where I even seen this

what show it wasn't like what site it

was on or whatever some dude was trying

to trash Jake Jake oh about middle child

and was saying oh I just fell off at the

end it was like and I'm like what the
 are you talking about like I can't

take you serious you could take that

right right

and then it's like sometimes you'll be

like yo would you listen to that and

then you say this is trash like that

that I I can't respect your opinion I

can't yeah they're probably the ones

responsible for these top 50 list that

go around like people like that we all

know saying yeah I mean I mean I know

it's your opinion but your opinions

wrong for sure yeah

100 speaking of top list dog is your top

nine that you named on till I collapse

still the same yes and no yes because

well what's happened since then is like

you know I'm saying it's coming from a

place of experience we know what it

takes basically like you just said um

then why didn't I think of that every

time yeah I'm saying like the rapper

that makes you go fall ah yeah well you

know it was right there damn yes like

sometimes it could be an easy line and

you'd like that line is it it seems easy

to think of but it wasn't the arms in

and it was like why did it that

this is what I do for a living how come

I missed that line you know

they're saying like I hear that a

lot yo you know what I want to mention

too I just thought about this when I got
 this is funny pun intended when I

got for the your booty is

heavy-duty like diarrhea yeah a lot of
 for that line right pun intended

but it's like wait Oh manage its trash

yours Trish I'm just being stupid like

it's sometimes you ever think of a

punchline is like it's just supposed to

be stupid right that's supposed to be

it's a stupid line and sometimes

I throw those in there too just like

just to get a reaction out of people to

get a laugh whatever it is you know I'm

saying it ain't that serious but it's

like oh man he sucks cuz he said like

yeah they pick out one thing oh yeah

because and that just let you know how

good you are because they'll go through

okay you just said a hundred dope

ass lines and then they'll pick

one and say but hey he said this right

here and it's like you know you just

know that that person is a hater I never

was like play a couple lines and be like

I don't like that right like what they

said right there next line go by I like

that though

that's dope I never hated a song because

of one bar now if you know I'm saying

lever cuz now if I go back and listen to

all the classic music that I loved

growing up I'm sure I could find that

bar that at that you are saying but it's

just it wasn't that wasn't the point you

know I mean like it's just crazy now

that we have the internet and all that
 everybody has an opinion on well

everybody everybody's an expert that's

that's the thing that it's like you know

yeah that's why we listen to the fans

man the fans get you your fans

listen dawg I engage with your fans

every single day you know I'm saying

they hit me every day some of them leave

me sorry about that

now that's all good man they some of

them leave me like paragraphs in the DM

like hey man if you see Marshall can you

tell him you know um

so I'm just like you know hey man

whatever and they're really passionate

about you know supporting you I think

any artist would want to have fans like

you have you know I'm very grateful for

that

absolutely do you ever read any of the

comments online that they leave uh well

I went through phase of that for sure

you did and yeah and then I had to kind

of stop and put it all in perspective

and be like listen man like you know

just reading comments period right like

it just makes it like okay you realize

like you're you're not gonna please

everybody you just can't get into saying

like you can't you do this over here and

someone doesn't like it they want you to

do the opposite then you do the opposite

you please that person right or you

don't and this person hates it you know

I'm saying like it's it's very tough but

um no I agree with that it's kind of

like you know quarterbacks reading a

sports column you know I mean after

games you know there's Monday Morning

Quarterback yeah exactly so but like

like I said man these fans that you have

to hit me every single day um they asked

me if I can ask you a couple questions

what's your favorite food taco bandino

beets beets

so you got good good ass bullet put oh

you're talking like this kind of be like

damn your blood pressure is excellent

around this one yeah

beats not my favorite food is I don't

really have a favorite food okay let's

the favorite TV series mmm right now

currently power power yeah

about it yeah I wants power power uh do

you put me up on a walking dead

I was watching Boardwalk Empire all the

time and you is that the land one time

yeah it was like yo you gotta check out

Walking Dead and he was mean you said it

was some zombie I was like I don't

know if I could do this on BC and use

like no you gotta watch it then I got
 hooked on this yeah yes it

was a great great loss series

right there the wire I mean I've said

that many times but man that's like

cream of the crop

like those shows that like I don't know

it's like they'll never be another one

of those right right there are those

kind like Breaking Bad incredible yeah

man Breaking Bad was the how it

powers my though now for sure shout

out to 50 do you have any pets they want

to know that nope

do not know pets are you happy that's

the most the most number one asked

question that I got on Twitter is can

you please ask him if he's happy I'm

never happy never are you happy when you

angry you said something like that I'm

happy when I'm angry for sure

so when he gets angry he'll be happy so

you guys get that that's why I so

much happy now we're just talking about

too late like I want to mention this to

man cuz I'm sitting here like like we

was talking about the list and has it

changed I feel like all the rappers that

I said on their list will never change

right I don't know about the order I

don't even know if I should have put it

in an order like that you know saying

but sometimes it's like

sometimes you do things in the end it's

like it fits in the rhyme scheme so

you're like right like we was talking

about people who push the boundaries and

like like red man to me like you're not

like when it seemed like it was a time

in hip-hop where and this was like to me

it was like the late 80s early 90s where

every time a rapper came out with a new

album they would have best rapper for a

minute

I'm saying like like Boogie Down

Productions when by all means necessary

love criminal minded but by all means

necessary he was like the pinnacle of

like rap at that point in time was like

what the like and Redman came out

was so good right and then like when NAS

drop right maduk it was like this is as

good as it gets

right like this you can't get any better

like that was incredible and then Biggie

and then to me Redman when he made Muddy

Waters I was like yelling at that that

that was like that was like when he in

my opinion just pulled ahead of

everybody he just shot ahead like he was

like like the way he man the way he was
 I can't even think of him yeah he

absolutely smashed that even when I

first heard him on when I first heard

him to do the headbangers first the

headbangers what the headbangers and I

was like yo just doing here yeah it's
 fire who was this guy you know

saying oh yeah what the album is so

classic to me so classic to me because

not only was he rapping so good but it

was like his beats and everything he's

making good songs right right like that

first album he just came out the gate

making great songs and again in the

image everything you know I'm saying

like it was

cool to be read man like to want to be

read man like it was like that's read

man is just cool you don't say

like that man was the oh it still

is you can still go and that's what I

like I love you when when the guys from

that era still just they just

never lose it yeah because you can tell

he loves it that's what it takes

hello yep yo let me ask you man were you

ever a fan of Kobe absolutely I mean who

wasn't like I don't know how you could

not be I can't even like that it makes

me sick man it makes me really like sick

to my stomach to even try to grasp what

happened like yeah me too million nine

people man nine people many people that

really shook the world you know I'm

saying and I read and I asked you that

too because I feel like great people

have a lot in common

I feel like you have you know what he

had that killer instinct when you going

to booth that work ethic if he's showing

up two hours before everybody else

working on a shot I've seen you in a

studio you know working on a hook that

you know getting it down to the

last molecule in that
 you know what I'm saying like just

making sure that that is right man

your work ethic is incredible thank you

is that something that you developed

over the years I did mike is that

something like hanging around working

with dr. Dre like when did you develop

this this work ethic that's just like

robotic almost I mean that was before I

even got son was that you know I'm

saying like like me you know me and Dan

I knew cuz denial was like me and me and

him were so close like got really close

really quick right just because of the

things that we had in common and

everything right so we kind of just felt

like we don't have nothing you know I'm

saying like it's it

was a do-or-die situation like because I

there was nothing else I knew how to do

I'm saying so it was like a lot of times

like we used to have to we used to go to

this place called mo masters I'm just

gonna mow master studio and it would be

like you know ten dollars an hour

something like that and so we'd have an

hour basically what to get so so then I

make like we made sure we had to

beat I had the lyrics written and I

already knew this on my heart go in

there you know saying but but it's like

once I got a chance to once Dre you know

gave me that shot look I was like I

can't there's no turning back like I

can't you know I'm saying like right

all I needed was like that and yeah man

and plus I watched Dre do it like that

dude like still to this day is

constantly lives in the studio cuz he

loves it right right that's why we do it

because one of it I like to before I

close I like to give some sort of gym

get the guest to give some sort of gym

to like a up-and-coming artist s that's

trying to make it like you know I'm

saying you just described a picture of

you having to memorize your raps before

you go to the studio looking at the

clock on the wall no I only have so

much time in there I gotta get it all

out yeah I mean it's a real grind I

think sometimes the other coming artists

look at people's results and they don't

understand the work that it took to get

there yeah what would you say man to

kind of inspire some young artists like

what do they what do they need to do in

your opinion well I mean times are

different right so we got like the kids

you can make a studio quality

album on your laptop basically you know

I'm saying so based off that it's like

what I would say to the up-and-coming

like you know any new up-and-coming

rapper I would say that it is hard to

get it

and it's even harder to maintain hmm

right so it's like his hardest I worked

back then you know when you've made

thousands of songs and you're like what

the am I gonna rap about that I

haven't already you know I'm saying like

and you start once you like you you

start out with a blank canvas and then

you painted everywhere on that

there ain't no you know I'm saying like

so I that's it's one of the things that

I do it because I love it

so I put in overtime I don't it doesn't

bother me you know saying like it's fun

for me to do that so I would say that if

this is something you're passionate

about just give it everything give it

everything you know I'm saying like you

have nothing else there's nothing else

you if this is what you want it's got to

be what you want more than anything else

in this world right whether it's

whatever it is like if it's a sport if

it's a you know this sport you

know it's jewelry time that's what I say

every time uh man dog I like to thank

you man for giving me so many time a lot

of your time actually man absolutely

but yo I watch Chris corner I watch it

all the time it's dope to me

because like I a rapper of your caliber

to do something like this is just a it's

such a good concept because you're an

expert in this field you know I'm saying

I appreciate and I think that everyone

needs to know that who doesn't already

you know you shame that brought so many

as hard as you go with the pain men like
 I'm telling you this is top-notch

top-tier lyricist you Royce man it's

like like it's it's it's a I feel like

it's great that I know you guys man cuz

it's it's also like it's it's kept me

over the years to push my pen in to keep

going right cuz it's like likewise my

brother music to murder to be murdered
