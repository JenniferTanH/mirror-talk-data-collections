hi i'm tom foster inc magazine's editor

at large

i am thrilled that for this session of

the inc vision conference my guest is

none other than

mark cuban if you're here you probably

don't need me to list mark's

accomplishments but let me just say that

he

is a serial tech entrepreneur owner of

the dallas mavericks

star of shark tank and investor in

hundreds of companies both

shark tank companies and and other um

for years mark has also been an

important voice in the national

conversation in

in presidential politics in uh

uh how we go about opening up our

economy amid a pandemic

uh and around sensitive issues uh around

race and culture in the country and

economic inequality

um we're going to touch on some of those

sensitive issues today we're going to

touch on mark's entrepreneurial journey

and what we can learn from it

and i hope uh overall the con the

conversation will take us

uh in a place where we we can kind of

define mark's vision for the future

uh uh of business and entrepreneurship

and and this world that we're all

operating in

um so without further ado mark welcome

thank you so much for joining us

thanks tom thanks for having me on yeah

you bet um so

uh the vision conference as i was saying

is is meant to help the entrepreneurial

community

share ideas and and really sort of see

possibilities see where we're going when

i think about your career mark and and

really the career of most successful

entrepreneurs one of the hallmarks is

is an ability to sort of uh see around

corners to see possibilities in the

future

um in your case i don't think it's magic

but i'm curious sort of what the secret

is that that has helped you do that

i'm just always learning you know um

steve jobs famously said everything's a

remix and i i truly take that to heart

you know um typically with with almost

every new invention every new

business type whatever it may be every

new industry you try to create

it's it's an extension of something that

already exists in some manner

and you just find a new angle to to

provide it and so

you know if you're always learning if

you're always consuming information if

you're always asking yourself

you know how can i do this better or i

always ask myself with my businesses

you know how would i kick my own ass or

how would a competitor kick my ass

and how do i stay ahead of that if

you're always looking to push forward

then you know it's good you're going to

find new ways of doing things and create

new businesses and and you know new

opportunities

that's great i want to come back to some

of the the specific ways you've gone

about doing that

um but let me ask you first about um

something that was in the news just

recently um you made some headlines

you uh picked up delante west a a

troubled former nba star um you you went

out of your way to

find him at a gas station pick him up

take him somewhere safe wait till a

family member came and

and i believe now he's getting uh the

kind of help that he needed

um and i'm curious you know i

i less about the details of what

actually happened that night but your

perspective on

on why it's important that somebody in

your position

really go out of his way or her way to

to

help others who are really in need you

know the reality is for better or worse

we all make these little judgments in

our mind when it comes

to helping people you know is it you

know can i do it

do i have the skill set do i have the

time do i have the resources

and the reality is right now in this

pandemic sitting at home i have to time

you know and i have the resources and as

you know delante played for the mavs and

i was heartbroken when i saw the

the pictures of him you know begging for

money on

on corners and it just so happened that

one of the places where

the pictures came from is you know a

couple miles from my house so i went out

and started driving around to look for

him

um reached out to his mom i got found

somebody who had her phone number

and you know got his new number and and

started calling him

and for a few days he didn't return my

call and at one point he did and when he

did

i just said delante don't move and it

you know it wasn't like

i took this huge undertaking and it was

just it was really

pretty straightforward i went i got him

you know i stuck him in my car

and you know found a hotel room until

his mom could get there and and it is

his father-in-law and you know just try

to help and then once we got her there

you know his response to her was going

to be a lot different than to other

people

and we worked with um an organization

she had been working with and

she really had the hard part of getting

him on the plane and getting them down

to rehab

but we did that and so you know it was

just the right thing to do

it it was you know i hate to say it this

way but it was easy for me to do and so

why wouldn't i do it

take taking a slightly uh wider angle um

um lens at that uh

how do you think about your sort of

civic responsibility and the civic

responsibility of

of successful people and of of

businesses um you know we have we have a

community of entrepreneurs here

watching watching this show um what is

the civic responsibility to to reach out

and sort of

help those who are less fortunate than

us great question tom um

you know the business world has evolved

over the past three

four or five decades you know things

used to be

you know i remember when i first

graduated from college way back when

you know people talked about ibm and eds

and wearing a crisp white shirt and

you know a specific tie and you had to

wear a suit

you know and look the part always and

you know we were very

formal in the business world and over

the years that that's really changed and

we've come to the understanding that

really our our country our economy

really truly is only as strong as our

weakest links

and it took me a while you know because

look we all as entrepreneurs go through

this process

can i start a business you know how you

know starting the business getting going

um just trying to survive and then

hopefully having some level of success

and then

you know while you're trying to succeed

you're just in this grind

that consumes you and it's really hard

to look at the bigger picture

because you just want to survive and you

want to succeed and you want to take

care of your employees but

at some point as you reach different

levels of success

um when you're past that point of just

having to worry about can you pay the

bills

and and the reality obviously a lot of

people have fallen back to the point

where they're concerned about

can they pay their bills and during this

pandemic but if you get to the point

where you're past that

you have to start looking at the macro

issues and in looking at the macro

issues

you know we the community you know we're

mostly a consumer driven economy

and the the weaker the consumers are the

weaker our communities are

the weaker our cities are and the you

know the weaker

the people in those communities and

cities are then

the harder it is for any of us to do

business and so to me

i think you know we really have to start

understanding that capitalism

needs to be compassionate because you

know

there's just so many in this day and age

because of social media in particular we

get to see

people we never saw 50 years ago you

know

they're right in front of us and we

start to understand their impact

the innova when people aren't educated

you know

when kids aren't educated when kids

don't get proper education when they

can't eat when

they don't have proper housing when

there's not grocery stores and you live

in a food or medical desert

then we really are it makes it hard for

business to succeed

you know it makes it hard for us to grow

the economy it makes it hard for us to

succeed as a country and so to me you

know i've gotten to that point where i

can

say you know what you know let's think

about helping people because

this country has given me so much it's

time for me to give something back and i

think every entrepreneur does

needs to do the same thing at the scale

that's relative to them

right so you might have a small 5 or 10

15 person company

but you're you know you're really going

to be tied to a community at some level

what can you do to make your community a

little bit stronger because by doing

that

you know not only is it the right thing

to do not only you supporting the people

that support you

but you're helping the economy for the

future of your company

you know and as the bigger you the

bigger you get as your company your

company

the more you can do to help you know and

and when you find those times that you

can hire people that

you may not have hired before because

now you can invest in them to make them

smarter and better

at you know what it is you do in your

company you also start to open up

new doors for new opportunities i mean

it took me a long time to realize that

you know it's a lot smarter if i'm

selling to a certain community

it's a lot smarter and more efficient um

with more upside

to hire people from those communities

now they might not have the pedigree

that i might have hired for

in the past but by hiring people that

you know might might not have gone to

college or might not even have graduated

high school depending on the job and

training them

you get a very loyal employee that

understands the markets that you sell

into

better than you because you're probably

not connected to them the way you used

to be

so i mean that that's a long-winded

answer and a long way of saying that

you know the stronger your community is

the stronger you can make your community

the better business you're going to do

the more appreciative your customers are

going to be

and the stronger our country is going to

be as a result the phrase that keeps

coming to mind

to me as i'm listening to you talk about

all that is income inequality

you know we've all seen the stats where

uh you know what it's

for 50 years the highest earning 20

percent uh in the us have brought a

larger and larger share of our our

our country's total income um there are

various other stats we've all seen about

how

income inequality has become more and

more stark in the united states over the

past few decades

what is your take on on how that affects

the ability

for uh people to

realize the dream of entrepreneurship in

america realize the american dream

really

how how important is that issue as it

relates to entrepreneurship

you know it's critically important

because you know it

i've been in a situation where i you

know i was getting paid by the hours of

bartender

and you know had five roommates and you

know had my lights turned off and you

have that fear all the time

when you're just getting paid by the

hour and you know as opposed to where i

am now where i

you know i can invest in stocks and

bonds and companies and all the like and

i have appreciable assets

and so when when people are just getting

paid by the hour or just

have getting paid barely enough to get

by

they're not going to be able to increase

their net worth at all i mean we can

talk all we want about

um you know well you just need more

discipline to save and if you save more

you can invest more in

you know half the country almost half

the country is invested in mutual funds

or stocks but

you have to think about that other half

because income equality as you've

mentioned tom

is becoming a bigger and bigger problem

so the question becomes how do we deal

with that

and you know my first company micro

solutions when i was 24 years old 23

years old

um i started off because i couldn't

really afford to pay people as much as

they could get from other jobs

so i gave them stock in the company and

as it turned out my 80 employees all

made

good money when i sold my company you

know almost 20 percent of the the total

receipts from the sale of that company

went to our employees

and they were very happy and that worked

out so well

every company that i've started since

then the people have gotten

your stock or stock equivalents because

you know the harder they work the more

value they created in those companies

the bigger those companies came and when

it came time to sell them

they benefited as well and that's

something i take pride in but

you know as an entrepreneur you really

should

think very strongly about giving equity

to your employees

because you know not only will it make

them you know

take ownership of your company literally

and figuratively

but it really makes a difference in

their lives as you do better

and if you get to the point where you

have an exit

oh my goodness i mean it may be enormous

for them and it could be life-changing

not just for them but for their families

and their families families

and so if we're really going to address

income inequality

entrepreneurs ceos have got to look at

how do we

provide appreciable assets to employees

you know um if in addition to

equity i mean you know we've worked in

programs where

we've helped people get educations or

we've helped them buy homes so

you know anything you can do to help

your employees you know

invest in appreciable assets or receive

appreciable assets

that's how the income inequality gap

gets closed

because anytime someone's just working

by the hour it's just a flat salary

that you know barely lets them keep

their head above board

um we're not going to close that gap and

i'll add one more thing

you know um i went through we i'm half

owner of the american airlines center

where the mavs play the dallas stars we

have concerts etc

here in dallas and i wanted to make sure

that

all of our employees not only had a

living wage and we were able to get them

up to that 15

level and now even higher but i also

wanted to know if employees any of my

employees were on federal assistance

or any type of public assistance because

to me

the ultimate insult as a capitalist was

that

i wasn't paying my i was paying so

little to my employees

that they needed help from the

government the libertarian in me just

got sick to my stomach that that was a

possibility

now not all employees want to admit

they're on government assistance of any

sort

but at the same time i was able to go

through because you know we're all going

to have employees that

you know maybe make 30 thousand or forty

thousand dollars a year but

have four kids you know it doesn't

matter if they're 30 40 or 50 years old

but

you know with four kids forty thousand

dollars might be a good wage to someone

who's 21

but you know to somebody who has a

family of six

that's not going to work and so you know

what you can make the

the argument or we can have the

discussion well is it fair is it a pure

meritocracy

the reality is what was important to me

is you know

i can't live with myself if one of my

employees is on government assistance

and so i went and found those unique

circumstances and made sure they were

compensated in a way

that that made their lives work better

and in addition to the equity they were

receiving the company

and you know the response is was

phenomenal

my turnover rates weren't you know

through the floor

you know i'll give you the example that

microsolution is my first company again

i had one person leave the entire eight

years i owned that country company

and they came back and worked for me

after they left and so you can create a

culture

of gain for your employees and i think

it's important to do so and that's

really what compassionate capitalism

starts to address that's great great

answer

um i want to stay on on sort of

sensitive subjects for just a moment

longer

um a few years back i think it was 2014

or 15.

um you made some headlines at uh uh

conference yeah and um um you know there

was a quote about you know where you

you i won't even bother repeating the

quote but essentially your point was

that we all have ingrained prejudices

and one of the important things to do is

is to

recognize that we correct me if i'm

wrong here but to recognize that we have

ingrained prejudices

in order to be able to address them and

and move forward

um i feel like that point is um

more important this year than than maybe

ever before because of the really hard

conversations that are being had

um uh in the wake of the death of george

floyd and all the other things that have

gone on that have driven

um you know big national conversations

i'm curious what you see as the really

important

priorities within the organizations that

you own

that you run um to to recognize

you know the the the ways that they can

improve when it comes to diversity and

inclusion

what what are you guys doing to to look

to the future

you know i learned a lot since those

days when when i you know talked about

that um

you know to me back then you know trying

to understand my prejudices

i always looked at everything as a math

equation treating people equally was

treating people equally

what i said to tom i would say to sally

right because that's treating people

equally

but what i learned was treating people

equally does not mean you should treat

them the same because

everybody's different and you're not

recognizing

particularly in a business environments

the opportunities that come with those

differences

and so i've come a long way since then

and particularly as it applies now

um you know the reality is

that as a white person it's hard for us

to truly understand what it's like to

to face racism that doesn't mean white

people don't face difficulties and

adversity

of course we do you know it doesn't mean

that

you know whatever our ethnicity is our

religion that there's not times we

don't face um prejudice or even racism

of course we do but the reality is you

know

we have to start understanding the

problems

that those races face and in

particularly you know african americans

you know there there are just certain

issues that you know and talking to

my employees in in depth in ways that i

didn't do it when i was at that inc

conference

that i've i've come to understand that

you know

i there's lots of things that don't

happen to me

because of the color of my skin and

there's lots of things that do happen to

african americans and latinos and

and you know other you know people of

color um in lgbtq

because of who they are and we you know

it

you know harkens back to what i said a

little earlier we as entrepreneurs and

ceos

we have to start to address those things

because it's smart business

you know when when my employees um

african-american employees so i sat down

and talked to a bunch of of

people of color in our organization and

something that came up over and over

again

was the talk i'm like what's the talk

and the talk is when you're

african-american you want to talk to

your son in particular when he starts to

drive

and tell him how to respond if you get

pulled over by the police

things like you know if you can pull

over in a lighted area

if you can make sure somebody has with

the phone is videotaping it

always comply and do everything they ask

knowing that they're still

you know they they're still maybe racist

not and i'm not saying police officers

as a whole are racist but you're still

going to come across it

more often than not if you're

african-american and you have to adapt

to these things

you know and part of them part two of

the talk is don't be surprised if you

walk into the store

no matter how you're dressed and people

start watching you more closely then

they watch your they watch white

shoppers

these are the things that that are the

you know what happens with systemic

racism and

you know i think it's incumbent upon me

and my organizations

to start recognizing that this is an

issue that my employees face

and as long as they face that they're

not going to be nearly as effective

or efficient um or productive

because just having that natural fear i

mean you know imagine one of your black

employees going out and doing an errand

you know and getting pulled over or you

know doing something for work out on a

sales call

you know whatever it may be i mean and

having that fear

you know it's just there's so many

elements to it but

you have to be cognizant of what your

employees go through

and to me that that's just being a good

human you know

when when you can be more compassionate

be more

empathetic have a better eq things that

i was

awful at i'm not gonna lie i mean over

the course of my career i was go go go

go go go go ready fire aim and you know

if you know if i wasn't that that most

compassionate or empathetic person

that's okay because i'm on a mission

well you know we're in a different era

right now

and for an organization that doesn't

treat

their their employees with empathy that

doesn't recognize the differences

and the nuances of their background in

their race

people aren't going to want to work with

you people are going to want to get out

of there as quickly as possible and not

only your employees are going to

recognize it

but your stakeholders and your customers

are going to recognize that it all as

well

we've all dealt with organizations where

we just heard something or saw something

and we shook our head

but we didn't do something you know if

that is your organization

you're going to suffer and you're not

going to succeed over the long term and

so

again being empathetic understanding the

backgrounds and the needs of each

each individual really um is going to

make you a better entrepreneur a better

ceo and you're going to have a more

successful company

you're a prolific investor um and uh uh

in in in companies

um one of the things we've seen in

in um venture investing is that uh you

know there

there's a a vast under representation of

of uh communities of color of of

women of you know anything other than

white men

you know are are underrepresented um i'm

curious uh uh specifically as regards to

shark tank um what have you done

personally or what has the the shark

tank organization

done to try to think about equity

in in in that way well you can go to

mark cuban.com and see all the companies

i've invested in

and we we break them down by veteran

owned by women owned by

people of color because it's important

look i am so

thankful that old white baby boomers

are close-minded because and anybody out

there who's an investor

also should be thankful because it's so

idiotic

that it creates incredible opportunities

for me incredible opportunities for you

incredible investment opportunities

incredible hiring opportunities

you know i always want to invest where

people ain't right

i always tell people you know when

you're starting a company if there's a

thousand people doing this

same thing why would you want to be a

thousand and one

and there's so many undiscovered

incredible entrepreneurs

people of color latino you know um lg

btq that for whatever reason

you know vcs and other angels and seed

investors just ignore

i mean i actively solicit you know go

out and find them

you know and shark tank does the same

thing i i i think we're past

50 in terms of women entrepreneurs

coming on

and presenting to us and i know this

season women entrepreneurs people of

color

even during the pandemic we had some

incredible companies come on and get

deals

but for me i think i i've easily

invested over 50 million dollars in

people and women of color and

and disadvantaged communities because

it's just super

smart business and you know i've

co-invested

and you know helped found all the above

because

you know not only are there some

incredible people who have

who are overlooked but you know people

who

invest people of color able to sell to

communities that they understand

that an old white guy's not going to

understand or a white woman

is not going to understand for that

matter you know and i've invested in

women who

you know um understand their communities

and what they're selling a whole lot

better

um there's just so many examples of you

know i've got this guy noel doherty who

does

these twist combs they look like little

tennis racquets for for

african-american hair that let you poof

it up and shape it and all this stuff

he's killing it i if if i haven't made

10x on my investment from shark tank

it's about to happen you know and and so

just there's just example of

after examples um like that that

you know if you're able to invest if

you're able to partner if you're able to

acquire

if you're able to hire it just makes so

much sense because there's just so much

undiscovered talent that if you just go

look for it you can find it

um i saw a stat the other day maybe i

had one more thing there tom yeah

and i'm not saying you know what give

somebody a shot because they're black

give somebody a shot because they're a

woman give somebody

a shot because they're um latina

right i'm telling you if you look you

will find

talent that is incredible but is ignored

right it and i'm all about meritocracy

it's it's out there it's just that we

don't look for it right

and if you go look for it if you go ask

people about it you know maybe they went

to an hbcu so they

you know or a small public university so

they don't have the pedigree that gets

through

you know hiring you know um that gets

through recruiters or that the

recruiters like to find you know

they're out there to find and talking to

the recruiting offices at public

universities or hbcus

they're just incredible talent out there

that is better than the talent that you

hired

you just didn't put in enough effort to

go find the best um

let me change directions a little bit um

we we started out

um the conversation you said you know

one of the things you do is basically do

your homework you're

constantly learning um last time we

spoke a few months ago early on in the

pandemic you told me you were

spending a lot of time studying up on on

artificial intelligence on on ai

i'm curious what you're working on right

now is that still your big project what

are the what are the big areas that that

you're really investing your time in

for you know preparing yourself for the

future yeah ai you know

it's one thing to learn about ai and you

know i'm not an expert by a long shot

i'm not

out there creating you know trillion

layer models you know

um or anything like that but you know

over time

having become more literate in ai you

start

understanding what works and what

doesn't work and who does a good job and

who doesn't

and come and coming to the conclusion

that right now this economy

is an economy a i have and a i have nots

because doing implementing ai

successfully

is not cheap it's not easy so beware of

people saying oh i have this great ai

person

and for this the minimus amount of money

we can add ai to your company

or you know just invest in this because

i have this guy from mit

it doesn't work like that the cost the

overhead associated with the data

and the processing is enormous but we're

turning into

a country of ai haves and have nots and

if you look at the stock market

the companies that are just booming

right now in terms of stock

price even in the middle of this

pandemic and yeah you have to kind of

you know be a little critical just

because of the easy money element of the

stock market right now

but look at the amazons the netflix is

the unity's the

um you know go down the list the the

cloud players whatever it may be apple

netflix etc

right those companies have spent a

decade

if not more in some cases working on ai

and invested

billions whereas you know the inc 5000

is very difficult for them to truly

implement ai

you know you can use a chat bot that you

license you can use

you know salesforce.com or um other

you know sales mechanisms you can use

vid iq that

implement ai at some level to help you

but in terms of being an ai driven

organization

it's hard right now and it's difficult

to do it correctly

and i i just suggest that when you

try to do something in ai that you take

care

because whatever you think your budget's

going to be

it's going to be 10 times that and just

because something uses ai

and gives you a response or results

doesn't mean they're correct

right ai has to learn right it has to

get smarter over time

and so because it's so expensive and

companies want to implement it

it's very difficult not to just say well

this is a.i provided so

it must be right and i'm going to go all

in on it so you have to be very very

you have to be very very um not only

literate but aware

um and i have i don't have my book right

here it's

this one i'm reading right now called

competing in the ai world or something

like that

um and that's a lot about what they talk

about you know that not all ai

is right out of the box but you have to

start thinking about the future

and how you start implementing an ai and

but being careful how you do it and cost

conscious how you do it

can you give me an example or two i mean

as you just said right now you know

there are risks in sort of not doing it

right

and and also you know saying hey look

it's expensive it's hard it's

uh it it it's this concept

artificial intelligence that we hear all

around us

and yet can be kind of scary because how

do you use it

i'm curious you know in your businesses

in basketball in an arena in things that

one might not

think right off the bat are uh you know

have sophisticated artificial

intelligence uh applications

how how has that kind of technology

become really important for your

businesses

so in basketball it's non-stop use

i mean our you know trying to create a

predictive algorithm

that that takes um video from a game

or actually captures video in real time

and processes it um by

through computer vision and then

processing that through you know

machine learning or deep learning and

you know through pose estimation and

trying to predict what happens

if this is happening what's what's

something that we haven't considered

could happen or what's that what are the

elements

of a game that need to be considered you

know

i'll give you one specific example you

know

what how much space does a defense need

to cover

literally in creating the geometry of it

in order to reduce

um the points per possession by 0.1

right or 0.2

and you know and then you work backwards

to the speed of the players

and how does that compare to their

offenses ability what are the trade-offs

all this is part of the machine learning

analytics that we're trying to figure

out

um you know from a business perspective

um

i've got a kid ian mchugh that um

oh my god let's price something it's on

markqv.com i can't remember all my

companies anymore um

but what he does he uses machine

learning to to

in essence replace a b testing so

what is the best price you should charge

online

for a product and don't keep on running

this

you know real time analysis of your

gross margin dollars based off price

changes that you test

so you know if it's you know three

dollars then what happens if it's three

dollars and two cents what happens if

it's

2.98 and it works towards finding the

optimal pricing

but it keeps on retesting it all the

time and that becomes something

that is used through an api

to allow you to continuously test your

pricing

so those are two examples um

you know i'll give you one for last one

um with the mavericks

you know what when we're looking to sell

season tickets again when we're back

getting started again

you know what uh what what is

a customer identity pattern that we

should use

to give us the best the best percentage

chance of closing

a person um to be maverick season ticket

holders

you know so is it somebody that likes

flowers you know

if you know is it someone who likes

flowers and drinks tea

and you know takes the bus you know all

all these specific

elements and features that we look

forward to create

a pattern that allows us to determine

where we should look for our next

customer

and which one has the best chance of

closing we've we've talked in the past

about america 2.0 as a phrase you've

used

uh over over the last uh six months

really since the pandemic took hold

and by that i believe you mean you know

just sort of that we're going to come

out of this with a whole new set of of

of needs and opportunities um i'm

curious that as

you know you've looked at um our world

over the last six months

what are some of the opportunities that

that you have spotted

and really how has that that evolved

over time how are you what are some

things you're seeing today that you know

in april even or may you might not have

anticipated i think we've gone a lot

farther in the digital economy

than i expected we would you know um

everything that can be digital is

becoming digital right now

and we're finding this new equilibrium

where

things that we would have done going to

a mavs game going to a concert going to

a movie theater

you know in terms of entertainment we're

finding digital equivalents

you know the streaming business is

booming we're buying you know we used to

go to restaurants a lot more than we do

now

and but it's not like we're not eating

it's not like well i can't go to a

restaurant so i'm not having dinner

tonight

you know we're finding new ways to to

buy food you know

groceries being bought online is it you

know it's exploding people are buying

more things online they're getting

educated

you know cooking shows are going online

um

i've got one company from shark tank

alice's table as an example

they used to have they help women start

businesses

where they teach how to do floral

arrangements as one example and

that was all you know they'd you know

take a ballroom in a hotel

and sell tickets for 75 or whatever it

was and bring in

100 people to teach them how to do

floral arrangements and then they could

then in turn charge people for the

floral arrangements they do

well that all got shut down with covid

and they went online and started to do

it on a streaming basis

and so we're seeing a lot more people

become a lot more

efficient at doing this so they went

from being able to do a hundred people

in a ballroom

to on mother's day having 1400 people or

something like that

and a partnership with 1 800 flowers and

so

they they effectively pivoted their

delivery mechanism to being purely

digital

and it's grown in and people appreciate

it more and it's starting to to be a lot

more comfortable with that approach

now that has a bigger implication

you know there's this term creative

destruction you know when we got rid of

records we

we saw cds come along you know um and

then we saw

cds replaced by streams um in downloads

and that you know it was bad for people

in the record industry

you know i went to indiana and terre

haute was the rca's largest manufacturer

of records

a lot of people lost their jobs

unfortunately but you can make the point

that it was creative destruction

and so now we're trying to figure out

what part of the destruction is creative

and what part will come back to the way

it was before

and as entrepreneurs that's the hard

question we have to start answering

about our businesses

and that's where we need to start

looking for opportunities you know today

i was talking to somebody well actually

i was talking to myself

you know i just happened to be thinking

you know as we try to

look at at home where you know work from

home versus going back to the office

and the costs associated with the time

associated and the commute time

associated with it

is there a better way to bring people

together to be

creative like if i don't have an office

and

eighty percent of my you know work is

work at home

what can i do with that twenty percent

and my initial thought was well

there you know for working remotely

there's no reason why i couldn't bring

the office down to cabo right or bring

them

to miami and be on the beach or set

something up that's uniquely fun

you know over the summer when kids are

out of school or

you know put together you know things

that are just

you know vacation and fun and exciting

for my employees

because i don't have this office over

ahead so what is the balance in terms of

the cost for an office

versus the cost of doing special events

and special programs like this

you know if i have 20 people in one of

my companies why couldn't i take 20

people

to a vacation destination set up the

great broadband let's say

in the caymans it's the hedge fund

capital world so the broadband's great

you know once we start to get past this

pandemic that allows all these people to

work there

from for 30 days and bring their family

and just love every minute of it

or keep them in dallas going into an

office you know

what are the cost elements or what you

know what is the impact on my business

and

you know can i do something like that

that just completely changes the game

it's destructive to your commercial

office space

but how what's the impact on my

employees and all my business on on our

productivity in our results

you know is it better to do it that way

so those are the types of things that

i'm looking

at voice activation you know how much

more can i learn about alexa

because we're trying to be touch free

where we can do i need to reserve

key words on alexa so when we say alexa

dallas mavericks or alexa by mass ticket

someone else you know or buy

whatever you know buy a pet someone else

doesn't grab

that key word like maybe you know

someone grabbed a domain name in the

past

so just trying to think about those

those things are

keep me occupied but i think in terms of

america 2.0

we're seeing a lot of those things and

that creative destruction is going to

lead to companies

that are world-class companies great

advice um

we are running short on time i want to

ask you one quick kind of wrap-up

question here bringing it back to

the purpose of the vision conference

which again is sort of helping founders

see a way forward

can you take us out with one sort of

final piece of general advice

for founders who are um

trying to keep their eye on the future

in a very difficult time when there's so

much that's making you look at what's

right in front of you

you know what be nice make people happy

you know it seems to make perfect sense

just to keep your customers happy

to keep your stakeholders happy but

that's the reality

look one of my favorite sayings is sales

cures all

and the best way to sell is to really

educate your customers and make them

happy

and the best way to find out what makes

them happy is to ask them

and that's not to say you have to do

everything they ask you to do

but just by communicating you're going

to be better in sales

by communicating with your employees and

stakeholders your business is going to

be better

and then i i'd also add to what i said

earlier

look at the bigger picture when the

community that you work in

is thriving and the people around you

are thriving your brand is

going to thrive as well when people

don't feel good about you or your

company because you're trying to cut

corners

and look it's hard not to right now

because you might not have any revenue

you still have to look at the bigger

picture because if

you know the your customer base and

their economy doesn't thrive you don't

thrive

i think that's longer a little longer

than you wanted but i wanted to get it

all in

that's great uh mark thank you so much

for joining us

thank you everybody for being here at

the inc vision conference um

thanks again thank you thank you as always
