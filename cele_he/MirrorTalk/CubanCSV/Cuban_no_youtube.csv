Interviewer,How would you explain what NFTs are and how they are valuable?
Cuban,"It's just a digital collectible. Period. End of story. A collectible can be anything you want to collect. I collected CDs, I collected DVDs, you used to be able to buy and resell CDs and buy and resell DVDs and LPs. Now, it's just a digital version of all that. It's not complicated, it's not anything fancy, and the beauty of it is there's no hassle factor. I got some of my cards here. See this guy here? That's the original No. 77, that's not Luka , that's Jake Voskuhl the original No. 77 on the Dallas Mavericks, the one and only. A true collector of cards would be mad at me for not having it in a case and not having it all wrapped up. So, if Jake Voskuhl had a moment, I don't have to worry about any of those things. When you deal with physical collectibles, you have to worry about grading it, storing it, packaging it, shipping it, receiving it, valuing it... and the evaluations are not efficient whatsoever; one card store is going to evaluate it differently, one website is going to evaluate it differently from another. With NFTs, because it's all digital, the marketplaces are becoming a lot more efficient. They're not all the way there yet, but they're getting there and you take away all the hassles of physical ownership."
Interviewer,People who are new to NFTs always ask
Cuban,Dumbest question ever!
Interviewer,How did you first hear of NBA Top Shot and NFTs?
Cuban,"I don't even remember, but my first step was I went to a site called Mintable.app and I just started minting them. Then, I took a GIF of me walking into the Mavs arena to work out and I decided to post it for sale. I did 10 or 20 for the equivalent of $25 ETH. As I was going through setting it up, I'm thinking to myself, 'Nobody is going to buy this sh*t. Nobody.' Then, I saw this part to set up a royalty  and I'm like, 'You're kidding me!' This is the first time with digital content or goods at all that you can participate in the resell market so that's when I was like, 'I have to learn more about what's going on here.' So, I did my little GIF and I sold 20 for $25 each and then they started reselling and reselling, and I kept getting these transactions in my wallet for more and more money. I learned very quickly that I needed to learn what NFTs were all about because this could change how things were marketed, this could change how digital content is monetized and how IP is monetized. So, that's when I started digging in and that led me to Top Shot."
Interviewer,"Do you think we'll continue to see the NBA embrace Top Shot even more and if so, what could that look like?"
Cuban,"Of course you're going to see it. And it really comes down to what players do and that's the unknown. I'm trying to get Luka to sit down for lunch with me because we already got it set up to do an auction for a non-game NFT that he could do just him smiling or we got some that are drawings of him. Who knows how much people are going to bid for that if it's a Luka-authored original NFT? It could be on Top Shot, if there's a program there for players to do that, or it could be off of Top Shot. So, we'll see what players do;  that, and we'll see that extended to teams. We're trying to figure out how to use blockchain for ticketing and once you start doing that, you can start offering NFTs or moments from Top Shot as part of your ticket and create incremental value in a hundred ways and that becomes immediately tradable and sellable, etc. So, there's all kinds of iterations that these things can offer that are just crazy."
Interviewer,"We've asked you before what kind of business you'd start if you were back at square one and you've always said that you'd do something related to artificial intelligence. Now that this blockchain and NFT industry is taking off, would that be your new answer?"
Cuban,"That's a great question. So, AI has the bigger payoff right now, but it's a lot harder. Blockchain is the path of least resistance because as complicated as it sounds, it's not. So, trying to understand how blockchains work, . There's tons of competition. Top Shot uses Flow from Dapper Labs and that's one version of a blockchain. Ethereum's got theirs, Bitcoin's got theirs; there's a zillion different blockchains right now and each of them have their different pluses and minuses. So, there are challenges there. It's like the early days of the internet when everyone had a website. At the beginning, everyone thought it was hard to set up a website and companies found a high school kid who learned HTML and JavaScript to set it up for them and then they realized it was easy. This is the same thing. There's a lot of opportunities to take blockchain and smart contracts and create Web 3.0 versions of things that are being done now. Crypto is really changing a lot of things, the centralized finance. If you own Ethereum or Bitcoin or some other things, you basically make money as your own personal banker lending money, borrowing money, arbitraging it."
Interviewer,Most of these NFTs will fail and be worthless years from now.
Cuban,"Oh, of course."
Interviewer,"So, how do you decide which NFTs you're going to purchase? And why are you bullish on Top Shot specifically?"
Cuban,"Well, it's kind of spray-and-pray to a certain point. You know some of them aren't going to work and what I use to determine  is the size of the community. It's almost like Dogecoin. It's not that Dogecoin has any intrinsic value other than having fun. It's just there's a community of Dogecoin-lovers that really have fun with it and are just insane about it. And that's what I look for; the community of buyers. Beeple has insane, rich buyers; he just sold something for $69 million! 3LAU sold something for $3.3 million! King of Leon did $2 million worth of stuff. So, what you look for is really rabid, strong communities and Top Shot has the biggest, most rabid community right now. You can go to cryptoslam.io and you can see all the information. There's 122,000 buyers for Top Shot and there's nobody else even close. That tells you the community is there, and it's just starting; 122,000 is bigger than everyone else, but it's tiny versus the future market so this is only going to get bigger."
Interviewer,What are some moments that you're going after?
Cuban,"One thing to consider is that pandemic games are going to start being scarce in the future because we're going to be getting away from  and the pandemic will be weird, particularly to kids 5-10 years from now. They'll see these games without any fans and I think those will have added value."
Interviewer,"If you could create any Top Shot moment of your choice, what would it be? It can be a moment featuring you or anyone you'd like."
Cuban,"Oh, when the Mavs won , there's a picture... There's 30 seconds left and it's so stressful because you just never know when a lead will disappear. You can be up 10 points with two minutes to go and you can't be satisfied. But we got to the point where we were up 10 with 30 seconds to go and I just let out this big sigh of relief. There's a picture of me alongside Brendan Haywood and Deshawn Stevenson and some of our staff and I'm just holding onto them and screaming at the top of my lungs. That would be my Top Shot moment."
Interviewer,Your 2003-04 season opener was against the Lakers (and it was Karl Malone and Gary Payton's debut). I don't know if you remember what about that game was so unique....
Cuban,"The trash-can uniforms! We had brand-new uniforms that we thought were so cool, but we'd never had them on during a game. Well, when the players played in them, the sweat made them look like trash ! We never wore them again; that was the one time! That was not meant to be. It was brutal. We got destroyed. I was so pissed. I was just like, 'Toss these uniforms. Get them the hell out.'."
Interviewer,Does every company need to be on social media?
Cuban,"Yes. Not every company needs to post on social, but they need to be acutely aware of what is being said about them."
Interviewer,What's the biggest mistake you see marketers making today?
Cuban,Chasing trends rather than thinking through what the best solution is for any given product.
Interviewer,What's one piece of advice you'd give to entrepreneurs trying to scale a business quickly?
Cuban,Sales cures all.
Interviewer,What's the #1 marketing tool that's made the biggest difference in any of your businesses over the past 2 years?
Cuban,"2 years ago it was influencers, now it's organic video."
Interviewer,Can you clarify what you mean by organic video?
Cuban,Telling stories on video that include your company and what it does.
Interviewer,What's the one business lesson you learned when you started out that you still use today?
Cuban,"The one lesson I have learnt that helped when I was 12 years old and when I was 16 till today is that sales cures all. There has never been a business that ever succeeded without sales, and as the CEO, as a founder, and as an entrepreneur, if I can sell, I am always going to have a shot to survive, and I am always going to have a really good shot to succeed."
Interviewer,What is the biggest sacrifice you have to make when first starting a business?
Cuban,"When you are starting a business the biggest sacrifice that you probably don't expect is that you don't own your business; your customers own it, and you'll be holding on to them 24X7. If you are not, you are not going to be in business for very long."
Interviewer,What's the biggest misconception that new business owners have?
Cuban,"I think the biggest misconception that new entrepreneurs and new business owners have is that they think it's better than a 9-to-5 job because they can control their own hours and they are in control of what goes on. This couldn't be further from the truth. When you start a company, all hours are business hours, and I think you tend to think very quickly that your 9-to-5 job was easy compared to the hours in your own startup."
Interviewer,Is your day now 9 to 5?
Cuban,"My days are never 9 to 5 but I have always been very fortunate that even when I was broke and doing a startup, I loved what I was doing and the hours would go by so quickly because I was so consumed by it then, and now too. I may not be in the startup life from the perspective of, 'okay, my back's against the wall, I'm sleeping on the floor, or I am broke', but I want to win. I am competitive, I am always in, and I am always trying to learn. Whether it's one of my businesses, or a business that I have invested in, I am always trying to make it better."
Interviewer,Do you have a process of selecting a business?
Cuban,"When it comes to selecting a business I don't really have a process. I just try to be opportunistic, and look at the skills of the entrepreneur or the uniqueness of the business, and the competitive landscape. I will see how much I can help and what is going to take to get to the Promised Land to make a lot of money."
Interviewer,Can one have a good idea and a bad pitch?
Cuban,"We see so many pitches and some people think that if it is a bad pitch, the idea, the opportunity, and the company have no chance, particularly on Shark Tank, but that's just not the case."
Interviewer,Can you have a bad idea and a good pitch?
Cuban,"Yes, the other side of the equation is where even if it's a great pitch, it doesn't make for a good business if you don't know what you are doing. Even if you make it sound good, you still don't know what you're doing."
Interviewer,What are your top two tips for an entrepreneur about to give a pitch?
Cuban,"The two things that an entrepreneur needs to know, whether pitching to Shark Tank or anywhere, is"
Interviewer,Has being on Shark Tank changed the way you do business at all?
Cuban,"The thing that I have learnt with Shark Tank and really has changed my method of doing business over the past 10 years is 'nice pays off'. I don't know if I was always the nicest guy when I did business, but I was never mean, I never tried to steal, or take advantage of anybody, and I have always tried to do win-win deals. But sometimes I would get angry or ornery if I didn't think things were progressing the way I wanted them to. And just having seen all the entrepreneurs come through, and all the experience and the heartbreaks they have had, I have learnt the value of nice. Nice is so undervalued and it makes doing business so much easier. It makes the result so much better when you are just nice."
Interviewer,Does each season of Shark Tank have a different feel?
Cuban,"Each season always has a different feel. We have different guests, and as time goes on all the entrepreneurs have a better feel for what we like or what we don't like because they have watched the show so much. The deals get bigger and the companies get more advanced, so yes every season is just a little bit different and a little better."
Interviewer,Shark Tank is about to reach its 200th episode. How do you feel about that?
Cuban,"It is crazy the show's 10th season is about to air the 200th episode. I came on as a Guest Shark in Season 2. I thought, 'I'd do my three episodes and the show will be gone. It will be a great experience and maybe I would pick up some interesting businesses'. So when I was a Guest Shark, I bought every single thing that came out. I didn't think it would last, but here we are, in the 10th season and 200th episode. It has been a phenomenal ride. I hope it goes on forever."
Interviewer,"Mark, I appreciate you being here. I want to get your reaction to this report as it came out."
Cuban,"I mean, I didn't know, and I don't have an explanation. You know I can give you lots of reasons, but they don't matter. It was my responsibility, and I have to be accountable for it."
Interviewer,"I think it's hard for some people to reconcile because you are respected as a smart businessman. You have a television show, and your billing on that television show is that you're a great businessman. So how do you match that up with what you're telling me here?"
Cuban,"In hindsight, it was staring me right in the face, and I missed it. I wasn't as focused on the business as I should've been. You know when I talk about being actively involved, I could tell you every salary of everybody, every NBA player over the last 15 years. I would talk to Rick and our coaches over the years, and be there at practices, and be there on the basketball side, day in day out live it. If I was in our business office five times in 15 years, that was a lot, you know. It's embarrassing to say. There were people who I just hadn't met and hadn't talked to."
Interviewer,"There are a lot of emails of you asking about ticket sales and marketing, so there are business-side functions you were very involved in."
Cuban,No question. It all ties back to the basketball
Interviewer,"I want talk about the CEO, who is one of the large focuses of this investigation the dozen or so women who were victimized by Terdema Ussery. He was the man who was the Mavs' CEO for 15 of the 18 years that you owned the team. And I want to read off some of this"
Cuban,I didn't know that.
Interviewer,How do you not know that when you buy the team? It was in the newspapers. It was on the radio.
Cuban,"Yeah, I mean, I literally did not know it. This was in 1998, and I was running Broadcast.com, which I was sleeping and breathing. I was a season-ticket holder and went to games, but I had no idea. From the time I talked to Ross Perot to the time I bought the team in January of 2000 was less than six weeks. Should I have done due diligence? Should they have disclosed it? Yes. You know, it was just this was a dream come true. And you know, should I have interviewed Terdema to make sure he'd be a good CEO and there weren't issues? Yeah. And I didn't. I was just excited to buy the Mavs. It just never dawned on me that within my own company, within the Mavericks, that no one would reach out to me."
Interviewer,"But do you understand why? With this public presence you projected as being this tough boss, and then also with him being kept in that position for so long?"
Cuban,"Look, we did a lot of things wrong. And I wasn't there to oversee him. And so, yeah, everybody has every reason to question me. But I just wasn't there. And that was my fault."
Interviewer,"When you read through the report and you really read the details of things that you hadn't known about before, what stood out to you as the most difficult? Of what people had to go through?"
Cuban,"Just the pain that they had to go through, at my company. It was the same way I felt when I stood in front of Mavs employees for the first time, after this came out. And I apologized to them. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this was happening right underneath me. The pain that people went through, the pain that people shared with me as this happened, the tears that I saw it just, it hurt. And the way I felt is nothing compared to the way they felt. I have to recognize I made a mistake, learn from it and then try to fix it."
Interviewer,"Was there a person who talked to you, or sat across from you or someone who you've read about, that it stuck with you?"
Cuban,"It was just the looks on people's faces when I was sitting when I first met with Mavs employees after this happened and I didn't know how bad an actor Terdema was. And so I didn't know the degrees of everything. But I could just see it in everybody's face. And these are people that I barely knew, which is just bad enough that it just tore me apart. I mean, there's no other way to explain it."
Interviewer,"The Sports Illustrated article comes out. You're quoted right away. You said, this stuff isn't acceptable. This matters to me. Also though, investigators found that through an intermediary, you reached out to Terdema Ussery. And the message you had passed along to him is don't worry I won't throw you under the bus."
Cuban,"Well, context matters."
Interviewer,That's why I'm asking about it.
Cuban,"Right, so when it first happened, like I said, I had no idea how bad it was. I talked to two people who I asked to go to Terdema's former assistant, and I said, Look, pending everything that happens with the investigation, I don't want to get in a PR shouting match. And it wasn't like we were trying to hide anything, because I told investigators that I did it, you know."
Interviewer,You can understand how that sentence doesn't sit well when you read it on a piece of paper.
Cuban,"I know. I understand that completely. But again, that's why I was very forthright when the investigators I volunteered that to them. It wasn't about them asking me."
Interviewer,One of the other employees that I know  talked to you about is Chris Hyde. He was a high-ranking ticket sales official within the company. And again I'm just going to read this so I get it right
Cuban,"Yeah, I didn't know about that."
Interviewer,"You were notified about the pornography on his computer. In 2008, there was an email trail for that. And you wrote him an email saying, Hey, you better stop this or I'll fire you."
Cuban,Yes. On the spot. Right.
Interviewer,Did you ever follow up to see if he had stopped it?
Cuban,"Well, I got reports back saying he was on probation and that he was being dealt with. So I just assumed it was being dealt with. I didn't have any reason to think otherwise."
Interviewer,"So three years after that, after that email exchange with Hyde, one day he left the office for a two-hour lunch and, again, I'm going to just read this to get the details right"
Cuban,"Obviously, that's a huge mistake on my part. I was under the impression that the first issue with pornography was resolved, and obviously wasn't. And I also said if anything happens again, he's fired."
Interviewer,Wouldn't this qualify?
Cuban,"Well, that was three years earlier, and I hadn't had any follow-up. From my perspective, there were no other issues. But, again, in hindsight, it was stupid on my part."
Interviewer,"I mean, when you read it in black and white, and I say it sitting here across the table and say it for you..."
Cuban,"No, it's ridiculous. I messed up. I should have just fired him on the spot. It was a huge mistake. There's no way to downplay it, and if someone showed me this from another company and asked me to read it, I would say you can't make a bigger mistake, because that destroys the whole culture of your organization. And every time I go talk to people about business, I talk about culture. I don't have any excuses. I'm not trying to justify it. It's just I made a bad mistake, and it's not the only one I've said that I made."
Interviewer,"I do want to ask you about Earl Sneed, who you just mentioned. And frankly this is the one I have to tell you, Mark. I've known you for years and years, and when I read what happened here, I can't put together how the person I know and I've talked to for a long time OK'd a lot of this stuff. And for people who aren't familiar, Sneed was the team beat writer for the Mavericks' team website."
Cuban,One of them.
Interviewer,"And he was arrested outside the office, right at work, for beating his fiancée so badly he left her visibly bruised and with a broken wrist. She went to the hospital for it. He pled guilty to that in court. And you not only didn't fire him, you offered to pay his legal expenses."
Cuban,"Well, no... OK, that's not from my the information I had was just coming from Earl."
Interviewer,"His fiancée emailed you directly also, though, according to the investigation."
Cuban,"Right, the information I had, though, came, you know... I sent it back to H.R. And then the information I got was from Earl. And again, one to multiple mistakes applies here"
Interviewer,"There was a second incident though. He then started actually dating a fellow co-worker. And because you guys hadn't even suspended him or anything, the women in the office didn't know that he was someone who had beaten up his fiancée and who had broken her bones. And the other Mavericks employee... he got violent with her. She came to work the next day with visible bruises and swelling in her chest and face and arms. And she said she didn't feel safe in the office. And again, you guys didn't fire him. And this is where I break down again on why."
Cuban,"Again, in hindsight I would have done it differently. But, young African-American man, and this is 2014, and I had a decision to make. And the decision was, do I just fire him? And my fear and it's documented in the report, and talking to the investigators my fear if I just said, 'OK you're fired,' what are you going to do next? And what happens to the next person? And that's what I was thinking to myself. And so I set a series of rules for him, that he had to be accompanied. He had to go to counseling, and there were a variety of things to keep an eye on him."
Interviewer,I know I'm not the first person to point out to you that you could have removed him from the workplace and still gotten him counseling.
Cuban,"In hindsight you're exactly right. I'm just telling you what I thought, and I said the same thing publicly, and I said the same thing to investigators"
Interviewer,"Now that you have gone through all of this, what message do you now know that this sent the other women in the office?"
Cuban,"Oh, it was horrible."
Interviewer,"You basically told them, 'Hey, one of the guys in this office can hit you and we will still keep him here, coming to the office and sitting next to you.'."
Cuban,"I was tone deaf. And I have no excuse. I should have known better, or I could have done better. I've learned. There's just no other way to put it."
Interviewer,"In talking to you and reading all this, it does seem like another real lesson that you have absorbed through this is that it's not just about these specific behaviors, it's about the environment you set up. As recently as the beginning of this calendar year, the report details that in your business office 70 percent of the employees were male. Only 30 percent were female. There were zero women who were at the executive level to where they would be in the top-level meetings. There were zero people of color. And that even the women who did work there their salaries were not competitive with the commensurate men who did those jobs at other NBA franchises. What kind of environment do you think that set up in your business atmosphere? About the worth of women?"
Cuban,"Obviously not a good one. And once it came to my attention, we immediately jumped to fix it. It wasn't acceptable. It's not something that's going to happen going forward. We immediately stepped in and brought in a CEO who brought all of this to my attention. And I gave her carte blanche to do what she needed to do because it's not right and it's not even good business. And so we were doing everything possible to fix it."
Interviewer,"One of the things the NBA announced today is that you personally will donate $10 million to women's organizations, and that is going to strike some people as very significant, because the maximum the league can fine a team owner is $2.5 million. So that's four times that amount. It will strike some people as, 'Hey, this guy is a billionaire. That's not that significant at all. Didn't lose his team. He didn't lose any of the more basketball-related things.' What do you think of that decision?"
Cuban,I think more important than the money is the example we can set. Because there hasn't been anybody who really has had to go through this and set the tone. What's the right way to respond? And what's the right thing to do? And so the goal even more than the money is for me to get out there and teach others from my experiences.
Interviewer,Was there any point throughout this where Adam Silver discussed with you selling the team?
Cuban,No.
Interviewer,Was there ever a point you considered it yourself?
Cuban,No. I don't run away from my mistakes.
Interviewer,I know the day the Sports Illustrated article came out you addressed the Mavericks employees at the office. There are former employees mentioned in this report who felt they had to leave the company. Things were so bad they had to leave the profession because they couldn't get another job after unceremoniously leaving your company. Have you called to talk to any of them to apologize?
Cuban,No.
Interviewer,Should you?
Cuban,"Well, I don't know the circumstances. I don't know any of the individuals themselves because of the way the report is structured."
Interviewer,"If one of those employees wants to identify herself and come to you to get some closure, are you open to that?"
Cuban,"Yeah, I talked to the investigators because, again, I don't know what promises they made. I just don't know if I'd be the right person to try to solve it."
Interviewer,I wouldn't be surprised if somebody would like to talk to you personally.
Cuban,I'm not closing any doors yet. I just don't want to violate the privacy.
Interviewer,"Hey, this is Stephen Dubner. Hey Mark Cuban, how's it going?"
Cuban,"Great, Stephen Dubner, how are you?"
Interviewer,"Great. Nice to talk to you. Congrats on Luka, do we say Doncic? How are we saying his last."
Cuban,Doncic.
Interviewer,"Doncic, yeah."
Cuban,Thank you.
Interviewer,"Congratulations. Yeah, he looks amazing."
Cuban,We hope he is.
Interviewer,"So let me ask you this. You're roughly 60 years old, you grew up in Pittsburgh, which is one of the best sports towns. I'm just curious, in a nutshell, how you think pro sports has changed since you were a kid."
Cuban,"Oh my goodness. That's a big question. It depends on which sport, it depends on what city. Depends on whose perspective. I think in a lot of ways it hasn't changed but in a lot of ways depending on what city you're in, your teams have come and gone, are better or worse. And it just depends on perspective."
Interviewer,"Okay, let's pick a team. Let's pick the Steelers of your childhood and my childhood. Guys like Rocky Bleier and Andy Russell, even Franco, well maybe not quite Franco, but these guys would typically work an off-season job, and they weren't making money to retire on. And now, obviously, the economics are a lot different, but the economics are a lot different on the business side as well. There's just been tremendous, tremendous, tremendous growth and I guess I'm curious, as sport has become such a massive and global business, whether you think that's basically made the product, the games, better, worse, different. How so?"
Cuban,"I mean I think it's made it better because it's an incentive for more people to become professional athletes. For all the stories of athletes working in the summer there's the Whizzer Whites of the world and other athletes who chose not to go into professional sports at all. And so now the money creates enough of incentive. But again, tha, that's just part of the equation. Now there's other issues there's CTE for hockey and football, there's, soccer is much mor,is a much bigger sport in the U.S. than it used to be when I was growing up. It wasn't even a varsity sport when I was in high school. And so a lot of things have changed."
Interviewer,You're best known probably for two things
Cuban,"Oh my goodness. Most of my other sports interests are driven through technology, whether it's Synergy Sports which does cataloging and video of all things basketball. Sports Radar, which is an information service for sports. Unikrn, which is delivery for e-sports. It allows for tokenized betting for e-sports right now. What else? Axon, which does neural development so that athletes can improve their neurological responses to stimuli and their physical responses as a result. Another company that uses virtual reality and like a Wii-like technology to help kids and athletes and professionals improve their dribbling skills and other basketball skills."
Interviewer,"Now, I would say of everything that you just named there if you were to rewind the tape to 40 years ago or 50 years ago when you were a kid, most of those would have been somewhere between unimaginable and not feasible. I mean tha, that's one direction in which sport has just blown up in terms of technology. Again, do you see the technology and we hear all the time about how the data revolution is changing the way the game is played. I'm curious whether it's really having as big an impact as we'd like to think or imagine."
Cuban,"Oh yeah, absolutely. Analytics obviously has helped in terms of team strategy but that's actually become a relatively efficient market because all teams are involved and they're all hiring smart people to do mostly the same things. And then there's bioanalytics, where we're becoming smarter about the body, nutrition, sleep, genetics. There's just so many elements involved with bio analytics that it's a never ending improvement cycle."
Interviewer,"So, in terms of turnarounds, franchise turnarounds, your team, the Mavericks, have been one of the most drastic. When you came in, I guess the nine seasons before you arrived, the Mavs winning percentage is about 40 percent."
Cuban,"Yeah, we were awful."
Interviewer,"And since you've been there, about 70 percent, so that's really remarkable. So we could either say I mean if we're going to try to draw a causal relationship, we could say either Mark Cuban is one of the best owners ever, or he was really lucky to intersect perfectly with Dirk Nowitzki's career, or five, ten other things. Can you just talk about what you did that you think worked, and what are the other factors that led to that success?"
Cuban,"Well, hopefully the two aren't mutually exclusive. I think sometimes when you're dealt a good hand, not screwing it up is a talent. But I think what I did was try to change the culture. Because like any work environment, you can have really really talented people but if they don't like coming to work, or they don't like working together, then you're not going to get optimal results. And so what I came in, the previous owner nickeled and dimed everything, didn't recognize that the players were the key to the organization. We did things like spend more money on computer repair and training than we did on medical issues, and development for our players. And so I just changed that. I just flipped the script and said, look, my job is to provide the resources to put everybody in a position to succeed. And if I do that good things will happen. And so we had Dirk. We had Steve Nash. We had Michael Finley. The same three guys were awful the year before I got there."
Interviewer,What was the mental state of the organization in the building when you came in with that losing record that year?
Cuban,"Get me out of here everybody, it was a way station if you couldn't get a job somewhere else you came to the Mavericks. When players were traded here they just couldn't wait to get out."
Interviewer,"Your last couple seasons, though, have been fairly stinky at least by Mavs standards, so much so that you got a high draft pick this year. So what happened?"
Cuban,"What happened is guys get older. Guys get injured, and so you play it out as long as you can, as best you can and we try to respond and rebuild as quickly as possible. And hopefully this summer with our draft picks and and anybody we sign in free agency, we'll be able to do that and start fighting our way back."
Interviewer,"You've been fined a few times by the N.B.A., most recent one was 600k for talking about that it was essentially in the best interest in the team to lose to get a higher draft pick. I'm just curious. You're worth about 4 billion from what I've seen. Do you care much, I mean is that strategic outspokenness?"
Cuban,"In that case it wasn't. More often than not it was. In that particular case I was being interviewed by Julius Erving and I just fanboyed and said the wrong thing. Seriously. Julius Erving was my boyhood basketball hero. I mean yeah he was the one guy I looked up to, and it was the first time I'd met him. And to give you an idea of how much of a fanboy I am, of Julius Erving, when I was a kid, The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh, an old basketball movie was being filmed at the Civic Arena. And I took a bus down there just to see him jus, just to be able to see Julius Erving. Not playing basketball, just to see him. And then when I first bought the Mavs, I was at an N.B.A. All-Star game, I think it was in Philly, and I took a picture with Dr. J. He didn't know he was in the picture. It was me having someone take a picture with him in it, with me smiling. And then when he asked me to do his podcast it was just like yeah. And so I was trying to be too cool and tried to impress him, and when I start talking about being a player's owner he said he would have liked to have played for me as an owner. Then I had to show off, and that's when I said the wrong thing."
Interviewer,What was it about Dr. J as a player that you loved so much?
Cuban,"Oh, just his athleticism, his winning attitude, his uniqueness on the court and off. He had a certain style that he didn't take any prisoners and he was who he was without regrets. And I always admire those qualities."
Interviewer,"And this was also the A.B.A., which was the upstart league. I sense that you've kind of identified with upstarts throughout your life?"
Cuban,"Yeah, I would I would say underdogs more than upstarts. Maybe they're one and the same in a lot of instances. But it's not like I expected all this to happen. And so every step of the way I would try to just keep on grinding and and try to accomplish what I could accomplish and go from there."
Interviewer,I am curious who your favorite Steelers were.
Cuban,"Oh Franco Harris, Mean Joe Greene, Jack Lambert."
Interviewer,"Any dark horses, any, any more obscure guys?"
Cuban,"Joe Gilliam, the first black quarterback. Who else, let me think. There's a guy named Tunch Ilkin that."
Interviewer,"Tunch Ilkin, sure, he's still broadcasting for them."
Cuban,"Oh is he really? Yeah. So Tunch came from Indiana State and we had a mutual friend and so when he came to the Steelers I would go hang out with him and some of the Steelers and, to tell you a quick story, one time we went out with Jack Lambert, Steve Courson, Tunch Ilkin, Lynn Swann to a place in Green Tree, Pennsylvania. Horrible snowy day. I had a nasty old 1977 Fiat X1-9 which is a tiny car. And they got up, left earlier before I did. I go out to find my car in the snow, and they literally had picked it up between them and carried it up and put it on a hill, so that I had to go and figure out how to get it through the snow down the hill back into the street."
Interviewer,"Alright. So you did not become a professional athlete yourself, but you went one better and became a billionaire. And the story for people who don't know it, it reads like fiction. So can you just briefly tell us that story?"
Cuban,"I would tell you we started the streaming industry. There was a point in time in the early '90s where the Internet was becoming functional, and one of my buddies from college was like we've got to be able to use all this new Internet stuff to be able listen to Indiana basketball. And so I was like okay, I'm a tech guy. Let me see if I can figure it out. And I had just sold a few years earlier my first company, which was a networking company, so I was familiar with the technology and had a little bit of money. And so I went to work. Bought a PC, a 90 megahertz Packard Bell, an ISDN line, and just started figuring out, and we created a website called AudioNet. Fast forward a few years we go public, it's the biggest IPO in the history of the stock market. And what you probably don't realize is we dominated all things audio and video on the Internet. There was nobody close. As dominant as YouTube is today, we were that dominant then. We had a unique opportunity that when we sold to Yahoo, if they would've kept on doing what we were doing, even after the the stock market bubble had burst, there would be no YouTube. There might not even be a Google. I mean they chose the direction, and they chose to de-invest when Google chose the opposite, to invest. And that changed the course of history for streaming."
Interviewer,"So that was nearly 20 years ago, that was '99, that you sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo."
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"Can I ask you to speculate a little bit, maybe not looking 20 years forward but maybe five or ten? Big live sport events are in some ways keeping the legacy broadcast networks alive. They are one of the few destination points for watching TV these days. I'm really curious, the streaming companies and companies like Amazon that have streaming as well, they have so much money now that I'm guessing, I mean they could buy the leagues if they wanted to, So I'm really curious to know what you see the future of watching sports looks like. And will it be kind of, gradually changed so that we won't even notice so much, or you think it will be radically different than now?"
Cuban,"I think it'll be gradual but it'll be different for a couple of different reasons. One, one of the reasons sports is still so prevalent on traditional television is it's a destination. If you want to watch the Mavericks, if you want to watch the Pirates, if you want watch the Penguins, the Dallas Stars, whatever, you have to go to traditional TV, and that's one of the keys to retaining the customers, the subscribers that they have. Particularly for older viewers, which leads to a big question that'll drive some of this at some level. When people turn 40, 50, 60, do they start consuming more television or will millennials, as they age, stick to traditional digital over-the-top? That's the unknown question because you stil, for over-the-top, you still have to do work. You still have to choose from 20 apps, 30 apps which is more annoying than going through a DirecTV programming guide. And so those things have to improve dramatically, I think, before the older consumers switch from traditional television. All that said, one of the challenges for over-the-top is that there's an unlimited number of choices. When you go on Charter, Comcast, DirecTV, AT&T, whatever, you've got 250, 300 choices maybe. And that might be daunting, but it's still somewhat manageable. When you go online there's a zillion choices. There's no limit to the number of choices. You can spend a day in YouTube, so destination content is much rarer. There aren't a lot of hits online, and even when you see YouTube stars or Instagram stars, they have to create content every single day, and the same applies to Twitch. Ninja has got to be playing, there's a thing from Ninja, the guy who's the Fortnite superstar, that when he didn't broadcast one day, he lost 40,000 subscribers. So it's a whole different beast."
Interviewer,"Right. Let me ask you this. Let's look at individual sports or leagues especially with the future of the way the material's distributed, and the future of those games or leagues themselves. So let's pretend that you have the choice of three stocks to buy, and I'm going to make yo, I'm going to make you buy one, sell one, and hold one. And the three are going to be N.F.L., U.F.C., and we'll say a basket of e-sports leagues or games, Overwatch."
Cuban,"I'd take e-sports. Yeah if it's against those three, I tak, I buy e-sports, sell N.F.L."
Interviewer,Right. Okay. And hold U.F.C. for now. Okay. Let's get into both of those a little bit. First of all why sell N.F.L.?
Cuban,"I just think CTE creates a problem so participation has been dropping the last few years, and will continue to drop more. And I have an 8-year-old son there's no way I'd let him play tackle football. My brother lets my nephew play high school football but he's not that good. So it's not like he's got a future in football."
Interviewer,"Right. What about the political stuff that's happening, mostly the anthem protests? Do you think that's legitimately hurting football, or is that more of a sideshow?"
Cuban,No that's short term. that's short term.
Interviewer,"Okay, so you think CTE is the biggest barrier that'll."
Cuban,Yeah becaus.
Interviewer,That'll.
Cuban,"A parent if you don't want your son playin, daughter I guess, I don't want to be gender-specific. But if you don't want your child playing contact football, then you diminish the viewing in the house. It's like, I don't want my son to get excited about watching football. And in reality, it's crazy because, ""Hey let's watch a Cowboys game, let's watch a Steeler game."" When I was growing up, it was a certainty. That's what you did. Now he'd much rather play Fortnite or do other things than watch football."
Interviewer,"So how do we explain, though, the success of U.F.C., especially given the concern over the N.F.L. and the decline of boxing? I mean boxing used to be the biggest sport in America and it went."
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"It was hurt for a lot of different reasons obviously, but, But what do you think U.F.C., the league, has done or the sport has done that the N.F.L. maybe isn't doing as well?"
Cuban,"I think it's just different, because it's individuals and individuals can make their own choices. You don't need a lot of participants. In any given U.F.C. fight there's 10 matches, 20 guys, and so you don't need the number of participants that you do obviously for football, where there's 53 guys on a team, and 32 teams and then college football, high school football, et cetera."
Interviewer,"Right. OK. And you're buying e-sports. So say why and especially explain to people who can't get their mind around it at all. What is the appeal of watchin, I mean especially Dallas where you are has become really a hotbed."
Cuban,It's become a hub. Yeah.
Interviewer,"Yeah, I mean there's arenas, stadiums being built and so on. So why do 20, 50,000 people want to go to a stadium to watch other people play video games?"
Cuban,"Because once you understand the game it's lik, once you play, you understand the nuances of the game and it's aspirational and educational. And so if you like to play League of Legends, it's hard. But one of the ways to get better at League of Legends is to watch other people play. And to learn the nuances and to learn the strategies, particularly given that they change the rules every 90 or 120 days. And so because of that, the e-sports teams have got to practice hours and hours and hours a day. So it takes a real skill, it's a real sport, and if you like it, watching it is entertaining, educational, aspirational. And you also have to realize that anybody in front of a PS2, Xbox, PC watching these kids that play, in their mind, just like maybe we watched sports growing up, it's like hey if they can do it I can do it. And so that's the aspirational part of it as well. There's no physical hurdles. You can be 4-foot-1 or 7-foot-1, and if you've got the hand eye coordination and the the brain processing speed, anything's possible. You could do it too."
Interviewer,"One of the investments you mentioned, Unikrn, is a company that facilitates betting on e-sports. Can you just tell us a little bit about how that'll work and whether gambling on e-sports is maybe a little bit more susceptible to match fixing than other sports, or not necessarily."
Cuban,"Yeah I don't, First let me start there. I don't think it's more susceptible at all because it's much more difficult. Most e-sports are multi-dimensional chess where there's so many pieces involved that it'd be nearly impossible. There's two billion different chess moves and there's probably exponentially more in League of Legends. And why Unikrn? Just becaus."
Interviewer,Yeah and how does it work? I mean what kind of access will we have to what kind of bets?
Cuban,"Well you realize, gambling is legal in 118 countries. And so right now for e-sports in those countries, you can just go bet on who wins and different prop bets just like you could any other sports."
Interviewer,"Let me ask you about American pro sports leagues. So you're an N.B.A. owner. I don't know too much about how ""the league"" works. I know a little bit more about the N.F.L., but in the N.F.L. the owners are essentially ""the league."" Is it much different in the N.B.A. or is it pretty similar setup?"
Cuban,"No, not really."
Interviewer,Okay.
Cuban,"No, not really. Yeah, not really at all. I think the biggest difference between the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. is the emphasis put on talent. In the N.F.L., they sell the N.F.L. In the N.B.A., we sell the talent, the players. We promote the players and they promote themselves because it's mutually beneficial. I think with the exception of just a few star, this is just my opinion, the N.F.L. appears to look at their players as being more fungible. There's 53 of them. You're going to rotate X number through every year, and honestly, if the entire Steelers team was in a mall or the entire Dallas Cowboys team was in a mall, maybe two or three of the players would get recognized and so, it's a different world."
Interviewer,"That's partly cause they're helmeted, yeah? But it's more than that. Right?"
Cuban,"It's not, Yeah, it's not just cause they're helmeted."
Interviewer,"Okay. So given that the leagues operate, there's obviously a lot of differences, roster size, number of games, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But let's assume that for the sake of argument that all four major sports leagues in America are pretty similar in that they have, it's a membership and once you're in you're in. And it's pretty hard to lose money as a professional sports team because of the way revenues are divided."
Cuban,"No, that's not true at all. No, that is not true at all. Oh, hell no."
Interviewer,Give me an example.
Cuban,"I can't throw out names, but yeah."
Interviewer,Well how many N.B.A. teams in a given year are going to lose money?
Cuban,More than you think.
Interviewer,Really?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"So even with the revenue-sharing, with all the broadcast and other monies distributed evenly, and with a salary cap that guarantees that you don't have to overspend a certain amount, you're saying tha, How do you lose money? Is it by lacking gate revenue?"
Cuban,Yeah. Lacking revenue period. Just like any business.
Interviewer,"Right. But what's the major variable, is it gate revenue or is it broadcast revenue?"
Cuban,"Gate, broadcast, players, all the obvious things."
Interviewer,"Right. Okay. So that said, leagues in major American pro sports are more protected than let's say European soccer, right?"
Cuban,"Right, cause there's no relegation, yeah."
Interviewer,"Exactly. Do you thin,and it's always funny because our capitalism is more cutthroat than theirs. They're a little bit more socialist but we have the slightly more socialist setup. Which do you prefer, I guess I'd like to know."
Cuban,"Well it depends where you are, right? If you already have a significant brand like Real Madrid, you, because you can spend more money than everybody else. And they put some limits on how much money teams can lose and how much debt they can have and that's impacted things. But if you're on the bottom and you can buy a team inexpensively and you think you've got a secret formula that can get you into the Premier League et cetera. Then that's the position you want to be in if you're on the top and there's nothing that's going to impact your revenues and you're a global brand and you generate licensing and other incomes globally. You want to be at the top. The N.B.A., we're a global brand, but the Dallas Mavericks get one thirtieth of anything sold, whether it's in China or Germany or San Francisco. We don't control the generation of revenues for ourselves except in our local markets."
Interviewer,"In what league in U.S. sports do you think players, the athletes, have the most leverage and the least leverage?"
Cuban,I'd say the N.B.A. and the N.F.L.
Interviewer,N.B.A. is most and N.F.L. is least?
Cuban,Yeah. Without question.
Interviewer,"And does that have to do with roster size primarily, or does it go beyond that?"
Cuban,"Roster size, injury, contact sports. The number of college football teams providing talent. The fact that they go four years so you get to se, or most of them go four years, so it's easier to evaluate talent."
Interviewer,"Right. Speaking of college football, what's your overall view of the N.C.A.A.?"
Cuban,I think it's worthless.
Interviewer,"Yeah. Obviously there's a lot of incentive to keep it as it is. A lot of people are benefiting, although you could easily argue that the one set of people who should be benefiting, the people who are actually providing the physical labor are are not benefiting very much. If you could blow it up entirely, what would you do? Would you have football attached to college at all, would you make it some sort of a D-league instead?"
Cuban,"Yeah, I don't mind having it attached to college, but I would make it an independent entity, so that it would operate independently. Look, if I wanted to create a League of Legends team, that's not N.C.A.A. bound, so I can pay players if I choose or incent them. I can let them have a job, right? Let them go get a job, let them practice as much as they need to. Much as I could if I wanted to create a band and I went to Indiana University, my alma mater, and foun, which has a great music school, and found the best musicians for the band I want to put together, I can pay them and they can stay in school. They can practice together as much as they want. That's the hypocrisy. If you want to be a professional athlete, you can't practice your craft as much as you would like. There's limits to coaching and playing with your teammates. There's limits on jobs you can take. There's there's so many different things that are bound in stone that it just doesn't make sense. And so there's reasons why they evolved to where they are, but it's time to take a whole different look."
Interviewer,Yeah. Do you know Domonique Foxworth?
Cuban,"No, I do not."
Interviewer,"He was the number two of the N.B.A. Players Association for a while. He was the president of the N.F.L. Players Association. He was a player, he was a cornerback, played for I guess Denver, Atlanta, then Baltimore. So he's an interesting guy. A career cut short by injury, but he cashed out because he had insurance. And now he's kind of mid-life, early 30s, and he's looking back and trying to figure out how to help the next generation of athlete do better. He told us that he thinks it would be in the best interest of players to dissolve the unions, the N.F.L.P.A., the N.B.A. Players Association, because that would put the leagues in violation of labor laws, and it would give players the power to negotiate better deals and to make more money."
Cuban,"Every time there's a lock, Look I'm not a C.B.A. expert, I can't get into details. The N.F.L., there's a long history of labor unrest and the first thing they do is dissolve the union."
Interviewer,"Well, let's say that for a minute you're not on the ownership side at all and that you're either with you, let's say you run the biggest sports agency in the country, or maybe are associated with players in some way."
Cuban,"Let me slow you down right there because if I do anything relative to the C.B.A., I'll get fined again. And while I like you, it's not strategic right now."
Interviewer,"Basically you like me fine but not as much as Dr. J is what you're saying, but that's alright, I can."
Cuban,Exactly.
Interviewer,I can accept that.
Cuban,Appreciate that.
Interviewer,Let me ask you this
Cuban,"Yeah I think it'll lead to our franchise valuations doubling, literally, because there's a lot more reasons for people to pay attention, a lot more reasons for people to watch. And that's good for our bottom line. People will attend more and watch more hours of N.B.A. basketball. And same for all professional sports."
Interviewer,"All right, I got a quiz for you, or a riddle. I know you're a very smart guy, I won't be surprised if you get this right. Home field advantage exists in every sport all over the world. What would you say is the primary driver of home-field advantage according to academics who've studied this?"
Cuban,"My guess would, and it's not home-court, home-ice advantage doesn't necessarily hold true. Like in hockey, it doesn't hold true. So, I would tell you probably the energy and, so there's a couple of things. One, I know there are studies that say that the officials give benefit to home teams across all sports. People have tried to argue that that's not the case. Whatever it is, it is. And then there's the energy of a crowd. I mean, crowds do make players play harder. And then I'd also say there's just the comfort of playing in a place that you're used to shooting and playing in, hitting in, fielding in, et cetera."
Interviewer,"So what the academics argue is that it's basically unconscious ref bias. That they're not rooting for the home team, obviously, but that basically the crowd's sentiment puts the refs unconsciously in that moment."
Cuban,I think Justin Wolfers wrote that.
Interviewer,Justin wrote about race actually. Most of the studies about home field advantage come from soccer where there are some nice little instrumental variables that you can use to determine.
Cuban,"And plus, depending on the level of soccer, where you're playing, Yeah there's concern for their lives."
Interviewer,"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah like one of the best pieces of evidence came from measuring soccer played in stadiums where there was a running track around the field. So the refs are literally 20 yards further from the crowd, and there the home field advantage is much less so. But that said, you are probably most famous, as an owner, for, I don't know if you want to call it working the refs, but communicating with the refs. Just talk about that, how it evolved and how successful you think it is."
Cuban,"It's funny. Everybody's wired differently and when I play basketball, and by the way I just got done playing basketball and I've just had a Diet Coke up against my Achilles. So, I've been a basketball junkie my entire life. Everybody's got something and for whatever reason when I got to the Mavs, I just looked at the officiating, and it just drove me nuts because my attitude has always been that the three officials in basketball, no matter what the level, have more impact than 80 percent of the players on the court. And that's why it's always driven me crazy. And when I first got in and started doing my homework, one of the things that was conventional wisdom is that games weren't officiated the same in the first minute as they were in the last minute, and that just drove me nuts. And the more I got to know, the more I got to learn. Then I started to understand how officials at all levels manage games and deal with certain issues. And it wasn't always about making the right call throughout the game. And so that just ticked me off. And that just led to everything else. And so was it worth it? Yeah, I think it has been, because I can tell you that things have changed dramatically. At various times they've changed dramatically for the better. At various times personnel changed and it got worse. So we'll see what happens this season."
Interviewer,Do you think that your input on that has changed the way N.B.A. games are refereed now? At least more consistency?
Cuban,"I don't know if there's more consistency, but yeah."
Interviewer,"What are the channels by which it's worked? Have there been actual committees where you sit down and say, listen this is plainly going on and it's not right, not fair, not transparent?"
Cuban,"No, it's not even like that. It's not like I come in and say this ref is biased or this guy's got a problem. Couple of times I've done that, and it's been investigated and it's been fixed. And it's not like Tim Donaghy, it's just little marginal things. But in any event, what has changed in m, The thing that I have always harped on the most is from all my experience in business, you always want to get the best possible manager. And where I've seen a lot of companies make mistakes is they'll take their best salesperson and make them a sales manager. Well, just cause you're a good salesperson doesn't make you a good sales manager. And so using that analogy, just because you were a good referee or just cause you were good in management somewhere in the N.B.A., doesn't mean you're the best person to be in charge of the officiating group. And that's been my biggest battle, that they promote people not because they were the best for the job but because they were there. Or they promoted refs into positions of authority, not because they were great managers or not because they could get great results, but because they used to be good refs, and those guys wanted to keep on working. And so that's where I had the greatest amount of problem and that's where I think I've had the greatest impact."
Interviewer,Gotcha. There's another piece of research that argues that a lot of N.B.A. coaches are bad strategically when it comes to sitting players in foul trouble. That if a player is good enough to sit because you're worried about losing him then is his value is actually greater by playing. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on that and if you've ever talked to your coaches about that.
Cuban,"No, I agree. Because, going back to the refs, even the refs know how many fouls a guy has. And so they understand that if it's a toss-up call and it's a gray area call, they're probably not going to call it. And players are smart enough to adjust. Now on the flip side when you know a great player has three fouls in the first quarter, you're going to go at him and try to get that fourth foul, because there is a point of diminishing returns. And so typically if it's two fouls, I'm fine if Rick keeps them in, and Rick's gotten to that point. If it's again a qualified depending on the opponent, right? Because the value of that player is relative to the time, the score, and the opponent. And so if the numbers say keep him in, I'm fine with keeping him in."
Interviewer,When are you finally going to buy a Major League Baseball team?
Cuban,Never.
Interviewer,What happened?
Cuban,"Never. Oh, well two things happened. One, they didn't want me in. And two I had, my kids got older and they're too much fun. 162 games, my wife would divorce me."
Interviewer,Why didn't baseball want you in?
Cuban,"Because they knew I'd try to change things. I just did an interview with C.C. Sabathia and he was like ""What would you do differently?"" One I would teach all our guys to bat flip, every time they hit a home run, because you got to just change things up. These unwritten rules are ridiculous and the fans pay the bills, you gotta give them a reason to come. Two, I'd push for the designated hitter in both leagues so that pitchers in between innings can go right to the bullpen and warm up or do whatever they needed to. And that way when you come back on the field, you don't throw any warmup pitches, you go right into pitching and there's no throwing the ball around the infield and the outfield. You just go right in. The breaks aren't the breaks, and you go right up to bat and you reduce an hour off the game."
Interviewer,It is pretty weird. It would be like in the N.B.A. between every dead ball there's like lay up practice again.
Cuban,"Yeah, exactly you get to get shots up and everything to get your rhythm. And so there's so many ways you can speed up the game. And I would have been pushing for them and talking about them and they didn't want to see that."
Interviewer,Yeah. What would you say have been your most significant changes to the way basketball is played since you've owned the team?
Cuban,"Oh, little things. Things like the Clear Path Rule. I changed it because I showed them the math was wrong. That it used to be one shot and the ball, I changed it to two shots and the ball. Different replay things. Now, with the latest collective bargaining agreement, there's a thing called the cap-room exception. So it used to be when a team had cap room you just had your cap room. Now there's a $4.4 million exception that I pushed to get through in our collective bargaining agreement in 2011. And so that's been a big change, and I'm sure there's other things that's just what comes to the top of my head."
Interviewer,The effect of that exception is what then?
Cuban,"So, if the Mavericks have $25 million in cap room this year and we use that cap room to sign three players and fully use it, we still have one exception where we can sign one or more players for up to $4.4 million dollars. And the logic was you want to incent teams to have cap room and to try to improve their teams, and one way to improve the incentive was to create this cap room exception."
Interviewer,"Right. All right, last question. Where is LeBron going?"
Cuban,I don't know and I can't comment on other teams' players.
Interviewer,Dallas is not a team I've heard mentioned at all. Should they be?
Cuban,"Who knows. Who knows. Like I said, you'r, I'm not ready to get fined again."
Interviewer,Basically I'm no Dr. J. I've learned my lesson I stand down.
Cuban,I would never say that.
Interviewer,"That said, I very much enjoyed it and I really appreciate your time and I wish you the best of luck this season."
Cuban,I appreciate it.
Interviewer,"Hey, you going to run for some office at some point?"
Cuban,"Yeah, I'm going to run to the bathroom right now. So I don't know, we'll see what happens in the midterms."
Interviewer,"But would you enjoy, do you think, the presidency would that be a job that, I mean just in the abstract, is it a job that you think."
Cuban,"Could I do the job? Yeah. Would I enjoy it, that's hard to say. The challenge isn't doing the job, it's the process to get there. The definition of poor parenting is having kids eight, 11, and 14 and running for the presidency."
Interviewer,"Yeah but just think how cute they'd be on the posters. I mean that's a real, I mean if you want to just talk pure strategic exploitation of your family that would be pretty."
Cuban,"No, I'm not a pimp. When it comes to my kids, no. It would be the exact opposite."
Interviewer,"All right, well whatever you do, I wish you continued huge success and I thank you very much for the time."
Cuban,Thanks I enjoyed the interview.
Interviewer,"Mark, good to have you with us."
Cuban,"Thanks for having me, Steve."
Interviewer,"You're in the media business, so let's ask a Shakespearean question. Whither media? One question, but you've been involved in so many aspects of it."
Cuban,"It's a great question. Everywhere. I mean, you obviously have lived and breathed the media your entire life. And, you know, as we've become more and more digital, we've evolved to expand from just beyond to Internet to mobile devices. And, you know, it's interesting, because we're have a Renaissance in computing power. Used to be, we got excited about what would happen on a desktop and that created video and other opportunities. We got excited about faster Internet. Now, with mobile devices of all sizes, from phones to iPads and other tablet type devices coming, you know, media isn't about picking up a newspaper at the airport or stopping at the newsstand. It's using whatever device you happen to have with whatever time you happen to have available to you to consume. And I think that's great for media, overall, because it means we're consuming so much more."
Interviewer,"You've made some observations about how, if something is free, be prepared to die."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And if you're No.1, be prepared to be upendedpreempted, as you put it."
Cuban,"Yes, sir."
Interviewer,Can you explain?
Cuban,"Sure. You know, there's a consciousness that goes with all technology. You know, there's again, going back in history, when I started working with PCs, there was those who used PCs and those were, you know, old-school, and paper-driven. But people paid for software. People paid for content. And then, over time, it evolved to once the Internet hit and the marginal cost of delivery of content in other items was free, because, you know, one more bit in your bandwidth pipe didn't really cost you anything, we started to see people give away content, in particular, for free and there were companies that were built on delivering whatever it is. It could be search results as content. It could be aggregating information, a la Drudge Report or some others. And they made their living based off of advertising around that content."
Interviewer,"YouTube, you think is something of a villain, in terms of live video on the Web, as you said, 10 years, what's to show for it?"
Cuban,"Well, no, it's not so much that they're a villain, I think they've created a misconception. Yeah, they are a villain, you know. In their own way, right, you know."
Interviewer,"You're an entrepreneur, you can get  with that."
Cuban,"I can get away with that, yeah. When you buy a market, right, there's some villainyI don't have the right word, right, but there's going to be a bad guy. And in YouTube's case, they, you know, I've always felt they stole content. You know, and Viacom feels the same way; they've sued them for it. But the, I think the bigger picture now, while they're litigating that in court, is that You Tube has subsidized the bandwidth of the Internet. You know, five years ago, if somebody would've said, Steve, we want to post this video online, the conversation then would've gone to, Well, how much is going to cost us? Where are we going to host it? Where are the servers going to come from? Now,  anybody who wants to post video online, it's presumed to be free."
Interviewer,"So, talking about Google, Google TV, and all of that, you've made the point, they're going into it."
Cuban,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,And you made the example of House.
Cuban,"Right. One of my favorite shows, right."
Interviewer,"And if Google puts up a kids thing, instead of what they perceive as a rival."
Cuban,"Right. Well, yeah, I mean, with Google Television, Google's kind of taken Microsoft's place as the dominant player in the current leading technology, if you will."
Interviewer,"Taking online. How, on advertising, how do you get real revenues from that, when you have networks, exchanges, where they try to commoditize everything?"
Cuban,"You don't. You really, really don't. I mean, it's the unwritten lie. You know, that, well, if I create a website, and I generate enough pageviews or have unique users, then I'll just be able to sell advertising. But the reality is, you know, there's unlimited inventory. Anybody can create it, so there has to be some value proposition, whether in the quality of the content or just sheer, absolute numbers that allow you to generate revenue."
Interviewer,"So, even if you have unique content, it's, in the old days are old days. A year ago."
Cuban,"Yeah, weeks ago, yeah."
Interviewer,You get a premium for it. You think the squeeze is going to be in the opposite direction?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,It's just pennies instead of dollars?
Cuban,"Yeah, no question. Just because great content is subjective, obviously. You know, you always hear people talk about the music business, which is the ultimate a la carte business."
Interviewer,"How do you get paid for content? Especially now, we consider, like, bread and butter, it's free."
Cuban,"Right, right, right, right. You know, there's an interesting lesson going on right now, with Facebook and Google. One of the most unique lessons of Facebook is that most of its stuff's not indexed in Google. And it's doing just fine. You know, 500 million unique users, yet you know, Google's, and I don't mean this to sound like, let's just, you know,  step-on-Google interview. But when they're."
Interviewer,Why not?
Cuban,"Yeah, why not, huh? But when they're the dominant player, I mean, just like we used to talk about Microsoft all the time."
Interviewer,Exactly.
Cuban,"But, you know, Google's stated intent is to index all the world's information."
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"Now they're, like the commercial says, There's an app for that. And that's information that Google no longer has access to. So how does that transition to media? Well, the fear always was if I'm not participating with Google, I'm not going to have access to all those people. That's disappearing. So between Facebook, who generates probably more usage outside of it than maybe even Google for a lot of scenarios, for a lot of content, Twitter, which generates a ton of content. I know my own blog, Twitter generates 90% of the referrals that I get. Google is just a de minimus amount. And so now we're starting to see that there are other sources. And, you know, we're starting to see a greater influx of real-time data being created by media sources as well."
Interviewer,"So it's not like Easy Pass, you know, pay 10 cents for this or pay 90 cents for another?"
Cuban,"Because, you know, if you're interested in good content, your time is of some level of value, in trying to determine whether it's worth it to pay a penny or not, just going through the process makes it not worth it. So, there's got to be an, that's why Amazon is so dominant. Your credit card's already there. It's easier just to, I mean, I'm spoiled, I'll order shampoo and shaving cream and everything, and it'll just show up because it's just easier than getting in the car and doing whatever."
Interviewer,"Sort of like cable, you do it once a month, and that's it."
Cuban,"And it's there, yeah. And it's simple, exactly. Great analogy. And I think newspapers have got to put themselves in the same position. That's kind of the chicken and egg right now. I don't think the difficulty's going to be getting people to pay. I think it's in how you get them to pay. And it may well be that like the cable analogy, where it's already bundled, and you pay one bill, and you know, it's cheaper than if you had to do a la carte."
Interviewer,"So instead of maybe a site, you have an app?"
Cuban,"Well, an app is going to be one part of it, but you've got to get people to use the app. But I think you might even glom on to what other people are doing. So, you might say, Amazon, what are you selling? Netflix , would you like to include newspapers as part of it? You know, for an extra $1.00, you get access to these 15 newspapers, then we just pay back the newspapers per turn, just like Netflix does with movies. And so, you go where the credit cards already are. You go where the perceived value is greater than the incremental."
Interviewer,"So it's not content, it's marketing."
Cuban,"It's both, right? But I think you've got to get there, but it's got to be easy. It's got to be the path of least resistance."
Interviewer,"And, so, just to be philosophical for one second, what you see unfolding against the monster Google as the alternatives are coming?"
Cuban,They're here.
Interviewer,They're breaking them up.
Cuban,"Right. And it's really a question of how to package and market, and make it so that it's the path of least resistance. Because Google has always been so fast and so easy, it was the path of least resistance to get to news."
Interviewer,Path of least resistance.
Cuban,That's the difference.
Interviewer,"And you keep emphasizing with things like Facebook or Twitter, enjoy your dominance,  other things are coming along."
Cuban,"No question. You know, we're, mobile is changing everything. You know, we're in a boring stage of the Internet, if you will, where it's a utility. Ten years ago it wasn't a utility. If you put together an application on the Web, there's a very good chance it was going to break. And, you know, five years ago, if you started, you know, when, look at Twitter, it still breaks sometimes."
Interviewer,So it's not going to go the way of wire lines?
Cuban,"No, it's not going to go the way of lines, but there's a lot of change. I guess the bigger point is, the philosophical side is, the rules are going to be rewritten again because of how we integrate mobile devices into our lives. Not just outside the home, like we use them today, but inside the home as well."
Interviewer,Where's that leave cable?
Cuban,"I think cable's in a good spot, right? Because they're the better packages of television, which I don't think goes away. One of the driving forces that I think people miss all the time is big-screen televisions are the No. 1 consumer device. You know, when I started HDNET in 2001, a 40 inch, you know, plasma that was, you know,  wasn't even 720p, was $12,000."
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"Now, on the way over here, I'm reading on, you know, in the back page of one of the newspapers that you can get a 40 inch television for $398, and a 32 inch all hi-def, HDMI, all the fanciest of the fancy, right?"
Interviewer,Wow. You're a great entrepreneur.
Cuban,I try.
Interviewer,"Well, the economy."
Cuban,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,"Washington doesn't seem to recognize, if you don't have entrepreneurs, you don't get innovation ."
Cuban,"Well, I mean, you obviously know, you have been talking about that better than anybody."
Interviewer,"So what's the most alarming trend you see right now, and do you see correctives coming along?"
Cuban,"Well, the most alarming trend is that Congress thinks they know what they're doing, when everybody knows that they don't. And you get a bastardized solution, as a result. And you know, the more pages in the bill past probably 100, the more the law of unintended consequences is waiting, just to kick everybody in the butt, and the whole economy."
Interviewer,Sort of a perverse Moore's Law.
Cuban,"That's exactly right. It's a very perverse Moore's Law. And so, I've always been of the mindset that the American spirit is what sets our country apart from every other country in the world. You know, we're just raised that there's a unique opportunity for any one of us should we decide to take advantage."
Interviewer,The idea of taxing so-called carried interest.
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,Not a good idea.
Cuban,"Actually, I'm going to disagree with you. I like the idea of carried tax and carried interest because I like to say short-term, but there is no such thing as a short-term tax, right?"
Interviewer,"So, if you own the U.S. government, like you own the Mavericks, what would you do to unleash the entrepreneur?"
Cuban,"I would do a couple things. One, I would say that any equity investment in a company with 25 or fewer employees, held for, pick a term, three years or five years, when you sell it, it's tax-free."
Interviewer,Reduce the capital gains.
Cuban,"Reduce the capital gains, but with a holding period. Because I think part of the flipside of where we have some problems is money in this country now has become fast money. It's become traded money, as opposed to shareholder-driven, as opposed to enabling capital. You know, over the past 10 years, you know, there used to be a progression."
Interviewer,"This gets, how do you revive the IPO market? I mean, especially for smaller companies?"
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"Your $25 million, $50 million?"
Cuban,There's nothing.
Interviewer,"No bankers, investment bankers interested?"
Cuban,It's funny you say that.
Interviewer,So Sarbanes-Oxley kills small businesses  unnecessary expenses.
Cuban,You are exactly right. You're exactly right.
Interviewer,And why do you think that is?
Cuban,"I just think the money is gravitated towards fast money. And, you know, I think the hole has been created, because investment banks, once they started going public, in particular, they just went to the biggest, you know, wherever they could find the biggest money. As much leverage as they can get as quick and as fast. Look, if I'm Goldman Sachs , and I have a whole quarter's worth of trading days where I don't lose a penny, I make money every single trading day, would I rather do that, or take the next Broadcast.com public? Or any small company public? Would I rather spend the money on going out there, and evaluating companies?"
Interviewer,"So let's say on banks, instead of 30-to-one, you're now restricted like a real bank, 11-to-one, 12-to-one. You have a stable dollar, so you don't get the juice of stability of trading in commodities and currencies."
Cuban,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,"You lower tax rates, or give holidays for certain periods of time."
Cuban,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,"You think boutiques, like what you're talking about, can rise up and fill the void that the big ones have left out there?"
Cuban,"Yeah, because there's going to be guys like me."
Interviewer,"Like going against a big retailer, if you have a boutique, people will pay up for specialized services?"
Cuban,"Absolutely, positively. What's happening right now, Steve, and it's really just over the past 12 months, there's kind of a groundswell that's, I don't want to say underground, but it's not being covered by the mainstream media, of companies like one called Y Combinator, which is just a little angel funding, where it says, You know what? We're probably not going to invest more than $100,000 in you, it may only be $50,000, it may be $25,000. And you're going to give us some preset amount, 10% of your company, and we're going to help you grow."
Interviewer,So a version of micro-lending?
Cuban,"Yeah, only micro-VC, if you will, right? But now, these things are springing up everywhere. Myself, I posted a blog post called The Mark Cuban Stimulus Plan about a year ago, right? And I just started getting these great ideas out of the woodwork. I thought, I'm probably, I think, nine in the past 12 or so months, where I've invested $250,000 or less and just found these great companies. And you can do it now because the cost of technology, you know, even when I started Broadcast.com, just to get a basic PC was $3,000. Now an iPad or a PC or a laptop is $400, and has 10 times the power."
Interviewer,So give some of the things you invested in. I love the name Naked Pizza.
Cuban,"I'm not going to touch that. Naked Pizza's a perfect example. I posted The Mark Cuban Stimulus Plan, I got an e-mail, and they were, like, You know, when the Mavericks play the New Orleans Hornets, you've got to come try our pizza. We think you'll like it. And I did. It was, like, I got to eat a whole pizza that I loved for under 800 calories. And I'm, like, You just convinced me that the product's worth it, right? And so, the guys are, busted their butts, bust their butts, but they were, because they'd taken out some loans, because there were some other elements that they kind of got ahead of themselves, they needed a small infusion of capital."
Interviewer,Wickler?
Cuban,"Yeah, we have Wickler, it's just a very simple company that any public auditoriums, or bars, restaurants, that have big crowds, they face an issue with the fire marshal. And you see, like, people standing with these little clickers."
Interviewer,"Right, right."
Cuban,"Out at the front door, which is ridiculous, right? It's, you know, you can't even do it. So Wickler has a system where it automates that whole process and then with password driven, it connects right to the fire marshal, just to say, Hey, we've got a big crowd, just so you don't freak out, and B, feel free to come in and take a look at our numbers, online, as opposed to you getting in your truck and driving out there and making a big stink. And we're also looking at another company to complement that, it's called Motion Lift, that has a camera that has some really cool software that identifies through heat and visuals, the difference between bodies and live people and other devices, right?"
Interviewer,"So, in essence, it's like the '70s, terrible decade, but you had Southwest Airlines ."
Cuban,Yep.
Interviewer,"FedEx , Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, all of these things."
Cuban,"Absolutely. Yeah, and look, Oracle with Larry Ellison, Microsoft with Bill Gates starting in New Mexico out of his parents' house. You know, Michael Dell."
Interviewer,"So the takeaway is, if the government just stepped aside and, if there's a need, entrepreneurs like you are going to find a way to fill it."
Cuban,"No question. The hard part is, you know, they're so far in, or so far up our, you know, how do you get them out, right, and what's the progression?"
Interviewer,How do you shoot the elephant?
Cuban,"That's exactly right. How do you shoot the elephant? And, you know, I'm not smart enough to have."
Interviewer,Maybe I should say donkey.
Cuban,"Either way, both, how do you shoot both? How do you get that wild game out of the living room?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. Mark, thank you very much."
Cuban,"Thank you, Steve, I really enjoyed it. It was a great interview."
Interviewer,Good fun. You're terrific.
Cuban,It was a fun interview.
Interviewer,How did you develop your entrepreneurial mindset?
Cuban,"I've always been competitive, goal-oriented and self-sufficient. It's like I tell my kids, 'you have to go figure life out... ' My dad was the same way; neither of my parents went to college and so it was like, 'we can't help you... if you want to do this, you're going to have to figure it out... ' and that's how I got started. I realized early on that I had to develop confidence in selling- whether it was selling garbage bags door to door, or anything else. Learning to sell took away some of the fear and gave me confidence to start any kind of business."
Interviewer,How did you get over the initial fear of starting a business?
Cuban,"Fear depends on your context, and how much you think you have to lose. You may be young or broke and have nothing to lose. In that case? Either you figure out a way to get something, or you don't get it. Simple. That's like Shark Tank one of the reasons I do the show is because so many kids and families watch it- and it helps people get over that initial hesitancy to start a business. There was a time I was living with 6 guys in a 3-bedroom apartment; what did I have to lose? If a failed, I was still broke and if it worked? Maybe I wouldn't be broke. As I got more successful, I had to be more prepared and I think that is where people fall short. Everyone has ideas, everyone goes to Google to look up ideas to see if anyone else is doing it... . They'll run it by friends... and then stop, dead stop... because they're afraid people might look down on them if they fail or because they think they need to go out and raise a lot of money in order for it to work. Here's the thing you need to just get out there and try it. Taking that first step is your biggest competitive advantage; most people won't do it."
Interviewer,Why is sport used so often as an analogy for business?
Cuban,"Business and sport are both about competition. You're not working in a vacuum, and you can't go back to the start when you're losing. If I figure out the strategy and get way ahead of you, you can't just start-over. In sport, like in business, there's someone out there trying to take it all away from you. Your competitors aren't sat there thinking, 'you know what, let's just split the marketplace... ' they're saying, 'you know what, if I have a chance to take 100% of the market, and I can do it legally, that's exactly what I'm going to do... '."
Interviewer,How do you maintain your focus in business?
Cuban,"In business, you can drown in opportunity. When things are going well, you stay with it no-one wants to quit anything that's fun and going well. it's when things start to slow down, or you're worried about competitors or have uncertainty... then you start to think, 'I'm an entrepreneur, I can start something else... ' and that's the biggest challenge for any growing company you hit that first resistance, or any other challenge, and start thinking 'do I pivot because this is harder than I thought? Or do I dig in?' it depends on your responsibilities... . I've always thought about my employees and customers first, I can't let them down and they always bring my focus back. I never want to be the guy who says, 'yeah, I wanted to do this, but I didn't have the perseverance to stick it out... '."
Interviewer,How do the best businesses stay competitive?
Cuban,"Being an entrepreneur doesn't mean you have one shot, or one idea, or start one company. Just look at Amazon what makes them the best company in the world is that they keep inventing things to make their business better, and they know how to create product. Sometimes it doesn't work, like the phones, and then other times its revolutionary, like AWS or their delivery service."
Interviewer,How are you able to successfully enter multiple markets and industries?
Cuban,"One of the greatest skills you can have as an entrepreneur is loving to learn. I read all day, and my kids have taught me how good YouTube is as a learning resource to get additional knowledge that I wouldn't have utilised before."
Interviewer,What does philanthropy mean to you?
Cuban,"I've been very fortunate; my next dollar isn't going to change my life; it is what it is from a marginal value and utility point of view. That's obviously not the case for other people and so I look for points where I can leverage that dollar to work- I like to find people or groups in need, and rather than creating a charity or working through a charity, I'll pay their bills. I like to have a direct impact and try to be very efficient. In my experience, when you work with larger charities, efficiency can drop considerably."
Interviewer,What do you hope your legacy will be?
Cuban,"My biggest legacy is my kids. Beyond my family? I haven't done my best work yet I have a long way to go. I'm proud of the success I've had in business, I've reached a lot of goals that I never thought I would, and my life feels unreal, like a dream. I may not look 25 years old, but I feel like I am, and I know I haven't done my best work yet."
Interviewer,How concerned are you about this whole situation?
Cuban,"Well obviously, very concerned, but it's not necessarily about basketball. Obviously this is much bigger than basketball. I'm concerned about will my kids have school or not, I'm concerned are we all doing the right thing because this is obviously new territory, this is certainly a black swan event in my experiences, and so basketball actually becomes secondary. But in terms of basketball, as I said earlier, nobody at the Dallas Mavericks is an expert on infectious diseases or their spread, and so this is not a situation where you fake it to your make it, or try to sound or act important. The NBA has hired people with expertise in those areas and they're working with people from the government and other expert areas, of other people with expertise. And so we have to defer to them. And that's exactly what we'll do. If the NBA, effectively if one player, two players, whatever it is already have it, we'll have to act accordingly. And I think the NBA made the right decision."
Interviewer,"Mark, this evening on ESPN you mentioned something about your concern for some of the employees, the part time people that work here. Could you reiterate that?"
Cuban,"They get paid by the hour and this was their source of income. And so we'll do some things there, we may ask them to go do some volunteer work in exchange. We've already started the process of having a program in place and I don't have any details to give, but it's certainly something that's important to me."
Interviewer,This is all transpired so rapidly. What are your feelings right now?
Cuban,"And so it's stunning, but we are where we are and we have to be smart in how we respond. We, again as I just said, this is people's lives at stake. This isn't about basketball, this isn't about the Mavericks, this isn't about, when do we start, or do we start, or how do we start? This is a pandemic, a global pandemic, where people's lives are at stake and I'm a lot more worried about my kids and my mom who's 82 years old, and talking to her and telling her to stay in the house, than I am about when we play our next game. Look, we have a lot of flexibility, I don't want to speak for Adam or the NBA, but in terms of the NBA basketball side of this, we have a lot of flexibility because there's nothing that happens after June 12th when we typically end our season."
Interviewer,Did you have any concerns about playing in a packed house tonight?
Cuban,"No, I didn't, I didn't really, I was actually shocked that we had so many people, to be honest. I was half expecting it to be half full. The good news is that you could tell by the screaming and yelling, it was a very young audience. And so that probably makes a lot of sense. But no, I didn't have any reason to believe that anybody put anybody else at risk. And we tried, last week we tried to be proactive. You saw we handed out all the Purells to everybody. That's not going to stop everything, but at least we can try to take a little bit of action to try to minimize where we could."
Interviewer,Coming out guys.
Cuban,"Well let me say one other thing, because I know it'll come up and JJ, you can feel free to, in terms of what we told the players, we told them to be very vigilant, that this is not a situation where the season's ended. Go do what you're going to do. We expect you to stay in Dallas, and the NBA told us that we'll continue to practice and do rehab and continue to do work. And I was very specific as was Coach, to say who you talked to is very important. If bringing people in from out of town because you have downtime. No, that's not going to work. That you have to be accountable to the people you're dealing with and who you know for your own personal safety and obviously for everybody else's. So this is not a vacation. This is effectively self quarantining everybody because we, again, it's our responsibility to be vigilant, and the players are in a unique position because wherever they are, people want to come up to them."
Interviewer,"Was selling Broadcast.com to Yahoo the smartest business move you've ever made? If not, what was the smartest thing you've ever done in business?"
Cuban,"From a financial standpoint, it obviously is. But I would put teaching myself networking and becoming one of the first local area network integrators and developers in the country up there as my best business decisions."
Interviewer,"While on the topic of Yahoo, give us your assessment of CEO Carol Bartz . Will she still be Yahoo's CEO this time next year?"
Cuban,"No idea. I like Carol. She has the balls to do what is necessary, once they figure out what that is. However, like every mature technology company, they are looking for the next big thing, and it's not easy to find or create."
Interviewer,"You described yourself at the UBS conference in December as an all-around troublemaker. Indeed, you seem to relish the role of antagonist to traditional media, to basketball referees. What is it that you find so gratifying about being a pain in the ass, for lack of a better term, to authority and/or the established way of thinking/doing business?"
Cuban,"I love to challenge conventional wisdom. I'm a big believer that in business and in politics, when everyone is doing the same thing, none are probably as effective or successful as they could be. Typically it's not prudent for people within those industries, parties, or organizations to stand up and challenge the incumbents. It is usually a formula for losing a job, customer, or endorsement. My businesses are usually built around challenging conventional wisdom, so I tend to gain by taking the other side. It's been very profitable and entertaining for me."
Interviewer,"Before your most recent blog posts, you had a quiet spell."
Cuban,"This is going to sound crazy, but I think they all are. I don't think there are media companies that are ignorant about technology any longer. It's not like everyone in media companies is 75 years old and out of touch. The Internet has been around a long time now. Those 50-somethings running media companies have been using the Internet and earlier technologies since they were 20-somethings. This shit ain't new no more. The challenge for media companies is to balance hitting earnings-per-share numbers for shareholders or debt holders and finding money to invest in new technologies and create new business opportunities. Sure, they have lost subscribers and advertisers and advertising dollars, but many have managed to hang on, and some have thrived."
Interviewer,You recently said that cord-cutting is a way for people to say they want more TV. Can you explain your reasoning?
Cuban,"I always have to crack up when I hear people bragging about how they cut the cord, then they go on to discuss what they watch...all shows that were paid for and branded by virtue of their appearance on a linear TV network. They don't realize that they aren't saying they can live without TV. What they are saying is that they are willing to save money by waiting to watch the same TV shows everyone else is watching. That isn't anything new. That is the whole reason windows for content licensing exist. You can get any content for less just by waiting."
Interviewer,"Continuing with that thought, what do you think Comcast ultimately does with Hulu, the popular video-sharing site?"
Cuban,I think it stays alive to serve the purpose it has been serving all along
Interviewer,"You own the Dallas Mavericks NBA franchise, and you've been involved in the bidding for the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and MLB's Chicago Cubs, as well an investor in the nascent UFL. Are you just the typical free-spending billionaire sports fanatic or do you see a value proposition in owning sports franchises?"
Cuban,Right now most sports franchises that try to win are vanity assets. They aren't great businesses. There are structural problems in every major sports league that have to change for them to become good businesses.
Interviewer,Will there be an NBA or NFL lockout next season? What do you think are the key similarities and differences between the NBA and NFL negotiations?
Cuban,Can't comment unless you want to pay the fine.
Interviewer,"Prior to LeBron James' announcement that he was going to the Miami Heat, you predicted on your blog that he would stay in Cleveland, writing, The sports world is full of uncertainties. When in doubt go for the love. Nearly halfway through the season, what are your thoughts on fan reaction to James' choice and how the decision has worked out for him?"
Cuban,"His choice is his choice. I don't think anyone outside the state of Ohio has a problem with the choice. It was how he handled it. It turned him into a villain. But given that the Heat are playing the best basketball in the NBA right now, it has worked out very well for him and I'm sure he would do it all again if he had the chance."
Interviewer,"On your blog, you've been outspoken about how a la carte media businesses will have a hard time surviving because they are easily disrupted by technological innovation. What are your thoughts on The New York Times' pay-wall plans and News Corp.'s iPad-only newspaper, The Daily?"
Cuban,"As long as everything behind the pay wall is free to paper subscribers, it absolutely will work. They are assigning a value to their Internet content and offering it for free to the people who pay them the most money, their subscribers. None of those subscribers are going to feel upset they are getting something others cannot get. The pay wall will make the subscription decision easier. Compare it to the bundled services that cable and telcos offer. A bundle of cable TV and telco services worked well. Add to it wireless cell service and it worked even better. Bundles of valued services work."
Interviewer,"Apple, Google, Netflix, and others are all moving aggressively into streaming movie and TV content and are in active licensing negotiations with providers of that content. Do you think that one of these companies will decide to just buy a movie studio or production company outright to both give them control over their own library of content as well as the capability to produce new content instead of just striking licensing deals, particularly if the terms offered by the incumbent content creators is undesirable?"
Cuban,"Buying a library of content will open the door and allow them to test some things, but they very quickly fall into the trap of every content originator, paying the money to produce new content. That's a new business that is very, very difficult and expensive. There is a ton of competition, and competition increases costs. YouTube is having a challenge making money, and everyone gives it content for free!"
Interviewer,What are your thoughts on what's in store for the economy and the stock market in 2011? Are we headed for a double-dip recession? Jobless recovery?
Cuban,"I have no idea. Neither does anyone else. So my advice is to be careful. Whoever tells you they know what is coming is lying to your face. Always remember that in the stock market, no matter what you are buying or selling, there is someone else on the other side of the trade. They aren't making the trade with you because they want to lose money or leave money on the table just for you. They think you are a moron for doing the trade."
Interviewer,"You've been in a battle with the SEC over allegations of insider trading in the sale of shares of Mamma.com. In 2009 a court dismissed all charges against you, but last year an appeals court reinstated the case. Where do things stand now?"
Cuban,I can't give any details but I'm told the Office of the Inspector General is coming out with a report. You might want to check with them. But I can't wait till it is over. It will be my longest blog post and I will lay out every detail of what it's like to be chased by a conscious-less bureaucratic machine.
Interviewer,"If you could be any fictional character, who would it be and why?"
Cuban,None. I like my life better.
Interviewer,I'll ask him about winning in sports.
Cuban,"I said, Would you sell the team? he said, Yeah. I said, What's your price? and I didn't negotiate."
Interviewer,Winning in business.
Cuban,It wasn't about how much money I had. It was about how hard can I work and what can I accomplish.
Interviewer,And what it takes to make it big on Shark Tank.
Cuban,"I want it to sink on you very, very hard. So it just reverberates through your whole body. What was my last question to you?"
Interviewer,"Would I take the 90,000 for 40 percent?"
Cuban,"You had a chance to close, didn't you?"
Interviewer,"Tonight, Mark Cuban for the hour and Mark Cuban was a man who wears many hats, the Dallas Mavericks owner, acts as TV chairman even Shark Tank investor. There's a lot to talk about tonight. And Mark joins me exclusively. Welcome to you."
Cuban,"Thanks, Piers."
Interviewer,"Let me start with you. Now, I watched you last night and there's this amazing moment, you know, there's your team beating the Knicks in the last second, it was a typical kind of Cubanesque movement. And I thought there this guy who - when you were at 19, 20, you didn't have a dime to rub between you, right? And there you are the billionaire owner of a basketball team beating the Knicks in their own backyard. What did that moment feel like for you?"
Cuban,"It's amazing. I mean, that's one of the beauties of owning a sports team when you get to run out the court, you know, and there's a buzzer beater jumping up and down with everybody else and the cops aren't chasing you. So, it's surreal. I mean, it's an amazing feeling."
Interviewer,Do you pinch yourself sometimes?
Cuban,"Everyday. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I'll just look around and my family and, you know, just everything that's going on and just it's crazy. It's amazing and I try to never take it for granted."
Interviewer,"Your story is extraordinary, Mark, because you go back, you were living in Pittsburgh, your first job was working in a bank, the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh ..."
Cuban,In Pittsburgh. Yeah.
Interviewer,"... and the real young you realize that this sort of bank structure, the hierarchy is limiting."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Tell me how you dealt with that.
Cuban,"I got a job working at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh and I would send notes to the CEO on the, right? I'm working on these systems conversions where they were converting from old traditional systems to new digital systems and I would read articles thinking, Oh the bank have benefit from this."
Interviewer,Because you were basically not observing the bank structure.
Cuban,"No, I was a wasn't going through my ..."
Interviewer,You and I know you're a tough a guy.
Cuban,"I just went right to the CEO. I mean it's like no big deal. I mean the whole point when you go to work for somebody I thought was you do all you can to make the company more profitable, no limits and I realize I wasn't going to be a very good employee then."
Interviewer,Was that the moment when you thought I'm going to leave this place?
Cuban,"That was one of many. They basically after I started just doing pretty much what I wanted to do, they kind of shuttled me off and said, OK. Spend sometime here ... and they kind of - and I just quit. I've only been there for nine months and then that's - I went back to Indiana for a little bit back to Bloomington for a little bit of time and then went down to Dallas and the rest is history."
Interviewer,And it is a remarkable history. And you got to Dallas and you got no money still ...
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"You get together with five mates. You're living in this small place, right?"
Cuban,"Well, I mean I had a car, a 1977 Fiat X1/9 with hole on the floorboard where I had to put oil and like every 60 miles and literally I had to be careful not get dizzy and fall asleep because I could see all of the light the road go by in the hole on the floorboard."
Interviewer,You had a rule when you out with the old gang. Nobody could spend more $20.
Cuban,$20. Yeah.
Interviewer,So you'd all go and buy horrible cheap $12 ...
Cuban,"It was great. stuff like that and we walk around like we are moguls, right? We'd walk around with this bottle champagnes, drinking out of champagnes, and P. Diddy thought it was cold drink and say drink it out of the bottle. We were away ahead of the curb because it was cheap and we thought we were cool."
Interviewer,"Having no money, what was that feeling like for you? What did it to you? What did it make you want to be?"
Cuban,"You know, it was no big deal that was - I mean, I had a blast when I was poor but because I always I was always motivated, I was always competitive and so it wasn't like I said, Well, you know, I'm sleeping at the floor ... so that's my motivation. My motivation was always I want to be rich and retire. I want to have all my time. I realized back then that time was my most valuable asset. And I think my dad really drilled into me that you have to appreciate everything in life."
Interviewer,"Your dad was obviously a pivotal figure in your life. When he gave you advice, did he give you advice or was it more the way he conducted at himself?"
Cuban,"A little bit of both. He never gave me business advice. My dad did upholstery on cars. If you had a rip in your car sear, you know, you'd bring it to my dad or he'd go to McDonald's and saw up rips in the upholstery there less denied an accident as he was putting staples into a car seat and he never really never understood business and so it wasn't like I can ask him for business, but he gave me great life advice."
Interviewer,"Going back to Dallas. There you are, you're all living this party life on mega resources and you start to do a few things entrepreneurly. I bet all your mates are doing crazy jobs ..."
Cuban,Right. Right.
Interviewer,... bartending or whatever. Your first dabble into real business is what?
Cuban,Starting a business or working?
Interviewer,You went to work with one where you've got this huge deal. I love this story.
Cuban,Right. Right. Right.
Interviewer,Where you managed to do with deals. You were working with a small business.
Cuban,"Right. So I'm working for this software company and one of my jobs was to come in and sweep the floor and open up the store and so I had closed this deal for $15,000 and with 10 percent commission so I was making $1,500 that was huge."
Interviewer,Huge for you. Life changing.
Cuban,"Enormous, right? And so I called my boss, Michael Humecki and I said, I'm not coming in. I've got Barbara all set to cover opening up the store and sweeping the floor and all that. and he said, No. I need you to come in. and I said, I got a close this deal. My customer is expecting me. and so I went and picked up the check thinking I hand this guy $15,000 check, he's going to love me for it and he fires me. Keep the check."
Interviewer,Why would he fire you?
Cuban,I have no idea. I have no idea.
Interviewer,Did he give any reason?
Cuban,"I don't remember. I don't remember. I, you know, he was a guy that was and I learned a lot from Michael. I learned to do the opposite, right? Because he was really into puppet circumstance, I'm the president, you're not. This is how a president operates. This is what the president wears. He would tell me, you know, You should buy us suit here. This is where it looks good. You should buy clothes there. That's where it looks good."
Interviewer,"And the big deal, the massive one that made you a billionaire. In the build up to that, tell me how you were feeling as a businessman?"
Cuban,"You know, it started when we went public. And so, you know, we started basically the whole streaming industry. We didn't start streaming software but we took it and turned it into a business where we had a million people a day coming in and listening to audio and watching video. We, you know, started doing, you know, the popup videos and the lead videos but, you know, the intro ask before video. We started ..."
Interviewer,"Was there a kind of eureka moment for you personally when you thought, OK. This is how I can become a billionaire.?"
Cuban,"Yeah. So OK, I can tell you a story. Our office was at 2929 Elm Street and we had 15 employees at AudioNet and I remember sitting and talking every we would have people come in around the world from around the work to AudioNet or the site then saying, This is changing my life, I feel like I'm back home. People who were in Korea, in Thailand, the Aleutian Islands would e-mail us or call us and say, Oh my God, this is amazing."
Interviewer,"Were you technically, yourself very, very savvy or ..."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,...or did you just have really smart guy ...
Cuban,"No. No. No, it wasn't me. I sat I've never sit in the second bedroom of my house. I bought ISDN line, a Packard Bell computer for $3,000, a router and I taught myself all the HTML stuff I needed to do to put together the website which wasn't hard to do."
Interviewer,You taught yourself this?
Cuban,"Yeah, but that's easy. That's not a big accomplishment but I ..."
Interviewer,You make it sound easy.
Cuban,"Well, it is. It is."
Interviewer,I couldn't do that.
Cuban,"Yeah, you could. I mean, that wasn't the hard part. The hard part was figuring out how to get streaming to work with an ever growing number of users in an internet infrastructure that didn't support it. And so putting in into servers, connecting the servers, knowing understanding the networking which is what MicroSolutions Company did. We were one of the first Local Area Networking companies in the world."
Interviewer,"Secure that moment, the moment you were naked in front of computer and you become a billionaire what do you do? I hope this is clean, this better be clean."
Cuban,"Again, because at that point in time the market was so crazy I didn't know if it would last."
Interviewer,"If I could say to you, OK, Mark Cuban, I can let you relive the best sex you've ever had in your life or that moment when you're naked in front of your computer watching yourself become a billionaire, which one would you take?"
Cuban,I'm taking the naked in front of the computer every time. Because with that billion dollars I could buy all the great sex I could ever want at the time.
Interviewer,Let's take a short break. Recover up our composure I think and come back and talk more about this. I want to know what happen after you become a billionaire. You started to lead I guess the dream of many billionaires. You go and buy sports teams.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Exactly. Buy fast cars, very hot women, not a lot ..."
Cuban,"Yeah, I loved it."
Interviewer,Do you think it was true to reality?
Cuban,"I think there was some embellishment and I know that because I've talked to some of the characters involved. But I think that at its heart it was very true that once you get going, you know, it's addictive. And it sells people self, and I, you know, it wouldn't surprise me that 90 percent was exactly how it went down."
Interviewer,I interviewed Jordan Belfort recently and he said a very interesting thing about how he's learned morality became chip to him. I want to play you that. Listen to this.
Cuban,"And that was easy, right? It's like when you're a kid someone says, Hey, you want to do a little bit pot? You can make some extra money. And either you say yes or no, right? Particularly when you have no money people are coming up to you and pitching you stuff like that. Just say no, right? Either you kept confidence in your self and you know you can do it the right way or you can't. And so that's never been like temptation for me but I can see it's like in sales we talk about incentives, right? And just managing people and I always talk about, what if you give somebody a Cadillac and say, If you don't hit your goal you lose the Cadillac."
Interviewer,That's a really interesting thing. I haven't heard that before.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is that something you've done with your own style with this?
Cuban,"Yes. Yes, because I want them to give them the incentives upfront because they don't want to lose it, you want to ..."
Interviewer,And do you take away the cars?
Cuban,You have to otherwise you have no credibility.
Interviewer,How do you feel when you do that?
Cuban,"It's like you had your chance, you know, what are we going to do fix it? I don't want to ... MORGAN"
Interviewer,That perhaps have an unobtainable trophy ...
Cuban,"Well it's a multi step process that says, one, I have confidence with you that you can reach these goals. Two, I'm going to put you in a position to succeed. Three, you agreed that I'd put you in a position to succeed. So we're agreeing that this is the reward. And if you don't reach your goals, I'm taking away the reward. Do we all agree on this yes or no? And if the answer is yes, let's do it. So there's not hidden agenda they know it up front."
Interviewer,"And Jordan Belfort when I interviewed him. At the end, he just sold me pen which is seen from the movie with DiCaprio and he sold me a pen. And it was fascinating how he did it. He said he didn't try and over sell me a pen if I didn't really want one. He said he had to identify a need in me, in other words have you thought recently in the last few months about having a pen? And if you get a yes, then he goes into full sales mode."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is that good sales tactic?
Cuban,You always want to put yourself in the shoes of the person you're selling to. That's always what made me successful.
Interviewer,Do you carry a wallet?
Cuban,"Yeah, I carry a wallet."
Interviewer,I asked Warren Buffet. You got any?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,What do you have in it?
Cuban,"It's a good question. I've got some credit cards, a debit card, driver's license, I've got some cards from some folks, I've got my doctor's, I've got my IU alum card, I've got my insurance card. MORGAN"
Interviewer,Not dissimilar to Warren actually. Do all of you billionaires basically have in fact the wallet looked the same. It is like a billionaire wallet club?
Cuban,"Yeah, actually there is, you get it after you learn the handshake. But you know what? I'm always upset because I've never been invited into the Trilateral Commission. You know, I thought I made all this money, I qualify right? I thought the government ..."
Interviewer,"When you see other billionaires, I'm always curious about this, is this like a little billionaire banter, you know, that you guys on?"
Cuban,"It just depends if they're friends or not. So I'll tell you, I've got a buddy and he which I basketball with and he just sold his company and he crossed the billionaire mark. And we just sat down there, had a big old smile I saw him two weeks ago and he was like, I think maybe I should buy a sports to him, all right."
Interviewer,"When people say that money, you know, money won't make you happy."
Cuban,True.
Interviewer,But isn't there an element to that money alleviate one of the life's stresses?
Cuban,It relieves a lot of stress. That's different to make you happy.
Interviewer,Because you've known having no money?
Cuban,"Oh yeah, look..."
Interviewer,"You could be better having it, right?"
Cuban,"Oh, it's always better having, yeah."
Interviewer,But it's not an equivalence for getting happiness?
Cuban,"No. If you are miserable, when you are poor, you're going to be miserable when you're rich because you still have the same issues and the same stresses. You don't like, I've come home, I can't tell you how many times. I've come home with a date and the lights were turned off."
Interviewer,What is the single best thing about being a billionaire?
Cuban,"Just more control your time, more control, you know."
Interviewer,"Well, being alterable or accountable to be?"
Cuban,"That's exactly right. I don't wear a watch. There has been damn good reason for me to wear suit, you know."
Interviewer,This wasn't good enough?
Cuban,"No. It was good, I mean, tennis shoes all the time, right. It's just I have controlled my life and I get, you know. It's so I guess I've been able to tell other people what they need to do and not having to worry about them telling you what to do."
Interviewer,"Let's take a break. Because of course one of the things you do as billionaire was you bought a basketball team, like you did. The Dallas Mavericks. Let's talk about sports when we get back."
Cuban,Sure.
Interviewer,I want to know why sport business is winning. Is it the same in both? I suspect it probably is.
Cuban,"I've been a basketball junk this long. As I can remember, five years old, and the very first season tickets I've ever owned for any team ever were the Dallas Mavericks. And I was a season ticket holder before I bought the team and they were horrible."
Interviewer,She said like Don't call the owner.
Cuban,"Yeah, basically."
Interviewer,How does someone like Mark Cuban make someone offer they can't refuse?
Cuban,"Basically, I said, Would you sell it to me? and he said, Yeah. I said, What's your price and I didn't negotiate. I just wrote in the check."
Interviewer,Right away?
Cuban,Pretty much.
Interviewer,"You just said, Here you are."
Cuban,"I said, Yeah, let's do it and then, you know, he was in the paper works. We had to do the paper work and..."
Interviewer,And no haggling moment?
Cuban,Not really. No.
Interviewer,You just said this is it.
Cuban,"It was the highest price paid for sports team. And he also have to realize that that point in time, I still the stock market was still crazy, right. This was January of 2000. So like like the day before, the stock my Yahoo stock went up enough but to pay for the whole team. And so, it was crazy. And so, I felt a little bit like funding money and I was just like, why not?"
Interviewer,"Has it been everything you hope it would be, owning the Mavericks?"
Cuban,"It's different. It's a lot different. And when I saw it, it would be because I don't really own the team financially own the team, but all of North Texas owns the Dallas Mavericks, you know."
Interviewer,"And lots of issues babbling around big professional sport in America right now, probably the leading one is this issue of gay players both in basketball and football and it will happen to every sport obviously. You know, Jason Collins, obviously a big ground breaking moment there. We've also got this young college player who's come out before he's even made the drop but yet. What is your view generally about this issue and sport in America given that so many people in the sports, themselves, feel so uncomfortable about it?"
Cuban,"If for non-event, no. It actually literally is a non-event. Ever since Jason came out and it was it Robbie who's the MLS player, Robbie Rogers I forget his nickname and were friends is terrible. It's changed with radically how many states now allow gay marriage, you know, and people has become so accepted that it's a non- event and I think it's just in a span of 6, 12, months, it's changed dramatically and so..."
Interviewer,"Even in Arizona, this week, we've seen effort by lawmakers to kind of make it illegal again to just be gay, you know."
Cuban,Right. I think that's crazy.
Interviewer,It was like you have to right to refuse to serve people if you do suspect them for being...
Cuban,"That's the craziness of politics. That's not the real feeling of the population. I mean, I don't you don't just just how we deal with people anymore just changed. I mean, people don't unless you're running for office and you really need to have a strong Republican constituency voting for you. Real people aren't that way. And so, I think we've really come to the point where in the real world and real life, we don't care and that's the beautiful thing to say, you know. And you don't you never run into people. It's not an issue. No one says to me no one has contacted me and say, If you get a gay..."
Interviewer,Is it generational?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,And in a sense anybody over 40 probably still has a slight hang up historically about this?
Cuban,I think it's older than that.
Interviewer,Maybe say 50?
Cuban,Yeah. Because...
Interviewer,"Yeah, and certainly my generation, I don't think why. It's probably 50, right?"
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,And anyone under 50 and certainly under 40...
Cuban,Doesn't care.
Interviewer,... just doesn't really care either ways. CUBAN
Cuban,"Nobody died, didn't, you know, no one got checked out in the shower and had problems, you know. And so, he actually was the perfect guy to change everything."
Interviewer,"What about guns in sport? A lot of NFL players in particular like to have the gun around them. And basketball turn off to a last night's game. The Knicks guard Raymond Felton was arrested on gun charges. And there's been a lot of these stories in the last couple of years. And obviously, I've had a the whole position about gun control probably because I'm not American and therefore don't quite see the culture in the same way, but what about that? What about the fact the sportsman believing they need a gun?"
Cuban,"I think that's anecdotal. I think Raymond, it's unfortunate what happened. I don't really know the guy, but he was stupid, right? You know with at the Mavs, we make a point to ask all of our guys, do you want a gun? Is it registered? What states it is registered? You're not allowed to travel with it no matter what. We prefer you don't carry it in your car no matter what..."
Interviewer,"So, you've implemented your own version of gun control?"
Cuban,"Well, it's not no, I don't want to make it seem like gun control already."
Interviewer,What would you call it? Gun safety regulations?
Cuban,"Gun safety. Yeah, just gun awareness."
Interviewer,Some safety rules.
Cuban,"That's right. We just want to make sure that whatever the rules are for the state we're in, we're following the rules and you're not traveling with it, whatsoever. Now, is it possible that one of my guys might do something that I'm not aware? For sure. You know, when you're dealing with 18 to 35-year olds, it is what it is, right? But as far as I'm concerned, as long as it's registered, as long as they're playing by the rules, as long as you don't travel with it, OK."
Interviewer,"If you took that attitude generally to America, if everyone had that in you, you must save a place."
Cuban,I think so.
Interviewer,And that there's a quite sensible proposals. It's part of the problem calling it gun control. Do a lot of Americans hate that word control?
Cuban,"Yeah, because I think a lot of Americans feel threatened that their rights are being taken away. And gun control of the Second Amendment has become something that we feel intrinsically you have to fight for and I don't think guns are really the issue. I think it's more an issue of where we threatened by government and where do we feel at risk from government. And if you're going to fight back, what better amendment that you get rally behind in the Second Amendment. And so, I don't even think it's about guns. I think it's more about standing out and saying, Look, you're going to have to pry it from my cold, dead hands because I'm protecting the constitution."
Interviewer,Let's take another break. Let's come back and talk about Shark Tank. It's a huge hit.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,You're a huge hit on it. You're terrifying in many ways on that show.
Cuban,"No, not really."
Interviewer,No sharks are going to be fetching to you. And we'll discuss it after.
Cuban,"In your particular case, the Shark Tank is about failing. It's about taking your business to the next level. You're about to talk all of America one of the biggest mistakes sales people make. When they have a deal in front of them, you should just shut up and take the deal."
Interviewer,Hallelujah.
Cuban,Instead of keep on selling and you kept on trying to sell.
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban on ABC's Shark Tank zeroing in on some prey. It looks like he's being totally surprised here. Well, very Mark Cuban. We're also surprised but you were surprised, I mean..."
Cuban,I was shocked.
Interviewer,You're a very confident guy. Everything you touch basically turns to go. CUBAN
Cuban,"But do not necessary that's why I disagree, right? If not, you can't ever think that the people are useless. The beauty of the show..."
Interviewer,As a business person.
Cuban,As a business person.
Interviewer,Can they not be useful?
Cuban,"No, no. Because when you quit your life on the line, if you have the balls to say, you know what, I'm going to start this company. Every single person in this world has that one idea that they think is going to be brilliant and they get call excited and then they do nothing. The fact that they were able to stand up and do something with the idea, so they get credit, right? Now, when they..."
Interviewer,"And you see, a lot of time, I do agree with you. And every time I agree with you, so I remember again, doing America's Got Talent, I can remember they keep, no, I don't really admire you just the stand and they're telling me..."
Cuban,"So, that would be different."
Interviewer,Auntie Nellie said you could sing because you can't...
Cuban,But that that's just putting a...
Interviewer,And my job is to stop this dream dead any...
Cuban,That's what you're thinking.
Interviewer,"... that's just never going to happen. I'm helping them by saying, you can't sing."
Cuban,I don't disagree there. That's the thing.
Interviewer,"So you must have some people with that you think you're no good? How do you link get out of business, don't be something else. CUBAN"
Cuban,"No, you have to do so much just to start that business because you're not getting on the show unless it's a real business. So, unless at least to have a chance. Now, will I crash people? Yes, but not people who are putting good honest effort out there. If they bias me, if they're arrogant, if they're into something that I think is abusive or taking advantage, then I will nail that hell out of them, right? No problem doing that."
Interviewer,What is the kind of idea that you really love?
Cuban,Something that's differentiated. Something that's unique. Something that can grow I think into something that's big. Those are my favorite.
Interviewer,What is the kind of idea that you really love?
Cuban,"Something that's differentiated, something that's unique, something that can grow, I think, into something that's big. Those are my favorites."
Interviewer,"What kind of thing over the years, if you feel yeah, that that talk the shows about?"
Cuban,SURFSET Fitness is a perfect example. So this company comes in and once the former and the other his girlfriend and he wanted away to workout and also learn how to surf out of New Hampshire. We're going to learn to surf in New Hampshire in the winter.
Interviewer,"Talking about left field, you're dancing?"
Cuban,That's far out of left field.
Interviewer,You know what?
Cuban,That's what they took to shut me down.
Interviewer,You know why I'd like watching you on that show because it made me feel better about my dance.
Cuban,"I can't believe. Hey, I just have my hip replaced."
Interviewer,You know? You want that.
Cuban,I had my hip replaced.
Interviewer,Jerry Springer was a lot worse than you.
Cuban,"Oh there's a lot, lot worse than me."
Interviewer,And I love Jerry but I have to discuss this with you.
Cuban,"So, right there is doing the waltz whenever it was. I just have my hip replaced and so I was like, Please stay on one piece, please stay on one piece. And then, I do this jump at the end and then I landed and I didn't fall apart. And I was fired up. So, it was a more of victory."
Interviewer,"Do you have even now, Mark, do you get, you know, those moments when you wake up in the morning, you know, late at night and some and an incredible idea comes to you?"
Cuban,Yeah. I hate it now. I hate it because I have so much going on that I don't have...
Interviewer,Giving the time.
Cuban,"Yeah. I don't have that piece of dinner. It really takes a special motivation just to say, I don't give a damn, I'm going for it right. And you can't see bearers. People always say, You're such a risk taker. I have to take a risk. You know, I do the preparation, I do the work, and then when you're prepared, you can bust through to any wall."
Interviewer,And you're a father?
Cuban,"Yeah, that's makes it all."
Interviewer,Let's take a break and talk about fatherhood.
Cuban,Sure.
Interviewer,I want to know what kind of dad you are. I suspect you're a smiling assassin.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Son, I fully support you, son, if you come first."
Cuban,Exactly.
Interviewer,I'll ask him about winning in sports.
Cuban,"I said, Would you sell the team? he said, Yeah. I said, What's your price? and I didn't negotiate."
Interviewer,Winning in business.
Cuban,It wasn't about how much money I had. It was about how hard can I work and what can I accomplish.
Interviewer,And what it takes to make it big on Shark Tank.
Cuban,"I want it to sink on you very, very hard. So it just reverberates through your whole body. What was my last question to you?"
Interviewer,"Would I take the 90,000 for 40 percent?"
Cuban,"You had a chance to close, didn't you?"
Interviewer,"Tonight, Mark Cuban for the hour and Mark Cuban was a man who wears many hats, the Dallas Mavericks owner, acts as TV chairman even Shark Tank investor. There's a lot to talk about tonight. And Mark joins me exclusively. Welcome to you."
Cuban,"Thanks, Piers."
Interviewer,"Let me start with you. Now, I watched you last night and there's this amazing moment, you know, there's your team beating the Knicks in the last second, it was a typical kind of Cubanesque movement. And I thought there this guy who - when you were at 19, 20, you didn't have a dime to rub between you, right? And there you are the billionaire owner of a basketball team beating the Knicks in their own backyard. What did that moment feel like for you?"
Cuban,"It's amazing. I mean, that's one of the beauties of owning a sports team when you get to run out the court, you know, and there's a buzzer beater jumping up and down with everybody else and the cops aren't chasing you. So, it's surreal. I mean, it's an amazing feeling."
Interviewer,Do you pinch yourself sometimes?
Cuban,"Everyday. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I'll just look around and my family and, you know, just everything that's going on and just it's crazy. It's amazing and I try to never take it for granted."
Interviewer,"Your story is extraordinary, Mark, because you go back, you were living in Pittsburgh, your first job was working in a bank, the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh ..."
Cuban,In Pittsburgh. Yeah.
Interviewer,"... and the real young you realize that this sort of bank structure, the hierarchy is limiting."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Tell me how you dealt with that.
Cuban,"I got a job working at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh and I would send notes to the CEO on the, right? I'm working on these systems conversions where they were converting from old traditional systems to new digital systems and I would read articles thinking, Oh the bank have benefit from this."
Interviewer,Because you were basically not observing the bank structure.
Cuban,"No, I was a wasn't going through my ..."
Interviewer,You and I know you're a tough a guy.
Cuban,"I just went right to the CEO. I mean it's like no big deal. I mean the whole point when you go to work for somebody I thought was you do all you can to make the company more profitable, no limits and I realize I wasn't going to be a very good employee then."
Interviewer,Was that the moment when you thought I'm going to leave this place?
Cuban,"That was one of many. They basically after I started just doing pretty much what I wanted to do, they kind of shuttled me off and said, OK. Spend sometime here ... and they kind of - and I just quit. I've only been there for nine months and then that's - I went back to Indiana for a little bit back to Bloomington for a little bit of time and then went down to Dallas and the rest is history."
Interviewer,And it is a remarkable history. And you got to Dallas and you got no money still ...
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"You get together with five mates. You're living in this small place, right?"
Cuban,"Well, I mean I had a car, a 1977 Fiat X1/9 with hole on the floorboard where I had to put oil and like every 60 miles and literally I had to be careful not get dizzy and fall asleep because I could see all of the light the road go by in the hole on the floorboard."
Interviewer,You had a rule when you out with the old gang. Nobody could spend more $20.
Cuban,$20. Yeah.
Interviewer,So you'd all go and buy horrible cheap $12 ...
Cuban,"It was great. stuff like that and we walk around like we are moguls, right? We'd walk around with this bottle champagnes, drinking out of champagnes, and P. Diddy thought it was cold drink and say drink it out of the bottle. We were away ahead of the curb because it was cheap and we thought we were cool."
Interviewer,"Having no money, what was that feeling like for you? What did it to you? What did it make you want to be?"
Cuban,"You know, it was no big deal that was - I mean, I had a blast when I was poor but because I always I was always motivated, I was always competitive and so it wasn't like I said, Well, you know, I'm sleeping at the floor ... so that's my motivation. My motivation was always I want to be rich and retire. I want to have all my time. I realized back then that time was my most valuable asset. And I think my dad really drilled into me that you have to appreciate everything in life."
Interviewer,"Your dad was obviously a pivotal figure in your life. When he gave you advice, did he give you advice or was it more the way he conducted at himself?"
Cuban,"A little bit of both. He never gave me business advice. My dad did upholstery on cars. If you had a rip in your car sear, you know, you'd bring it to my dad or he'd go to McDonald's and saw up rips in the upholstery there less denied an accident as he was putting staples into a car seat and he never really never understood business and so it wasn't like I can ask him for business, but he gave me great life advice."
Interviewer,"Going back to Dallas. There you are, you're all living this party life on mega resources and you start to do a few things entrepreneurly. I bet all your mates are doing crazy jobs ..."
Cuban,Right. Right.
Interviewer,... bartending or whatever. Your first dabble into real business is what?
Cuban,Starting a business or working?
Interviewer,You went to work with one where you've got this huge deal. I love this story.
Cuban,Right. Right. Right.
Interviewer,Where you managed to do with deals. You were working with a small business.
Cuban,"Right. So I'm working for this software company and one of my jobs was to come in and sweep the floor and open up the store and so I had closed this deal for $15,000 and with 10 percent commission so I was making $1,500 that was huge."
Interviewer,Huge for you. Life changing.
Cuban,"Enormous, right? And so I called my boss, Michael Humecki and I said, I'm not coming in. I've got Barbara all set to cover opening up the store and sweeping the floor and all that. and he said, No. I need you to come in. and I said, I got a close this deal. My customer is expecting me. and so I went and picked up the check thinking I hand this guy $15,000 check, he's going to love me for it and he fires me. Keep the check."
Interviewer,Why would he fire you?
Cuban,I have no idea. I have no idea.
Interviewer,Did he give any reason?
Cuban,"I don't remember. I don't remember. I, you know, he was a guy that was and I learned a lot from Michael. I learned to do the opposite, right? Because he was really into puppet circumstance, I'm the president, you're not. This is how a president operates. This is what the president wears. He would tell me, you know, You should buy us suit here. This is where it looks good. You should buy clothes there. That's where it looks good."
Interviewer,"And the big deal, the massive one that made you a billionaire. In the build up to that, tell me how you were feeling as a businessman?"
Cuban,"You know, it started when we went public. And so, you know, we started basically the whole streaming industry. We didn't start streaming software but we took it and turned it into a business where we had a million people a day coming in and listening to audio and watching video. We, you know, started doing, you know, the popup videos and the lead videos but, you know, the intro ask before video. We started ..."
Interviewer,"Was there a kind of eureka moment for you personally when you thought, OK. This is how I can become a billionaire.?"
Cuban,"Yeah. So OK, I can tell you a story. Our office was at 2929 Elm Street and we had 15 employees at AudioNet and I remember sitting and talking every we would have people come in around the world from around the work to AudioNet or the site then saying, This is changing my life, I feel like I'm back home. People who were in Korea, in Thailand, the Aleutian Islands would e-mail us or call us and say, Oh my God, this is amazing."
Interviewer,"Were you technically, yourself very, very savvy or ..."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,...or did you just have really smart guy ...
Cuban,"No. No. No, it wasn't me. I sat I've never sit in the second bedroom of my house. I bought ISDN line, a Packard Bell computer for $3,000, a router and I taught myself all the HTML stuff I needed to do to put together the website which wasn't hard to do."
Interviewer,You taught yourself this?
Cuban,"Yeah, but that's easy. That's not a big accomplishment but I ..."
Interviewer,You make it sound easy.
Cuban,"Well, it is. It is."
Interviewer,I couldn't do that.
Cuban,"Yeah, you could. I mean, that wasn't the hard part. The hard part was figuring out how to get streaming to work with an ever growing number of users in an internet infrastructure that didn't support it. And so putting in into servers, connecting the servers, knowing understanding the networking which is what MicroSolutions Company did. We were one of the first Local Area Networking companies in the world."
Interviewer,"Secure that moment, the moment you were naked in front of computer and you become a billionaire what do you do? I hope this is clean, this better be clean."
Cuban,"Again, because at that point in time the market was so crazy I didn't know if it would last."
Interviewer,"If I could say to you, OK, Mark Cuban, I can let you relive the best sex you've ever had in your life or that moment when you're naked in front of your computer watching yourself become a billionaire, which one would you take?"
Cuban,I'm taking the naked in front of the computer every time. Because with that billion dollars I could buy all the great sex I could ever want at the time.
Interviewer,Let's take a short break. Recover up our composure I think and come back and talk more about this. I want to know what happen after you become a billionaire. You started to lead I guess the dream of many billionaires. You go and buy sports teams.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Exactly. Buy fast cars, very hot women, not a lot ..."
Cuban,"Yeah, I loved it."
Interviewer,Do you think it was true to reality?
Cuban,"I think there was some embellishment and I know that because I've talked to some of the characters involved. But I think that at its heart it was very true that once you get going, you know, it's addictive. And it sells people self, and I, you know, it wouldn't surprise me that 90 percent was exactly how it went down."
Interviewer,"I interviewed Jordan Belfort recently and he said a very interesting thing about how he's learned morality became chip to him. I want to play you that. Listen to this. JORDAN BELFORT, THE REAL-LIFE WOLF OF WALL STREET"
Cuban,"And that was easy, right? It's like when you're a kid someone says, Hey, you want to do a little bit pot? You can make some extra money. And either you say yes or no, right? Particularly when you have no money people are coming up to you and pitching you stuff like that. Just say no, right? Either you kept confidence in your self and you know you can do it the right way or you can't. And so that's never been like temptation for me but I can see it's like in sales we talk about incentives, right? And just managing people and I always talk about, what if you give somebody a Cadillac and say, If you don't hit your goal you lose the Cadillac."
Interviewer,That's a really interesting thing. I haven't heard that before.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is that something you've done with your own style with this?
Cuban,"Yes. Yes, because I want them to give them the incentives upfront because they don't want to lose it, you want to ..."
Interviewer,And do you take away the cars?
Cuban,You have to otherwise you have no credibility.
Interviewer,How do you feel when you do that?
Cuban,"It's like you had your chance, you know, what are we going to do fix it? I don't want to ... MORGAN"
Interviewer,That perhaps have an unobtainable trophy ...
Cuban,"Well it's a multi step process that says, one, I have confidence with you that you can reach these goals. Two, I'm going to put you in a position to succeed. Three, you agreed that I'd put you in a position to succeed. So we're agreeing that this is the reward. And if you don't reach your goals, I'm taking away the reward. Do we all agree on this yes or no? And if the answer is yes, let's do it. So there's not hidden agenda they know it up front."
Interviewer,"And Jordan Belfort when I interviewed him. At the end, he just sold me pen which is seen from the movie with DiCaprio and he sold me a pen. And it was fascinating how he did it. He said he didn't try and over sell me a pen if I didn't really want one. He said he had to identify a need in me, in other words have you thought recently in the last few months about having a pen? And if you get a yes, then he goes into full sales mode."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is that good sales tactic?
Cuban,You always want to put yourself in the shoes of the person you're selling to. That's always what made me successful.
Interviewer,Do you carry a wallet?
Cuban,"Yeah, I carry a wallet."
Interviewer,I asked Warren Buffet. You got any?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,What do you have in it?
Cuban,"It's a good question. I've got some credit cards, a debit card, driver's license, I've got some cards from some folks, I've got my doctor's, I've got my IU alum card, I've got my insurance card. MORGAN"
Interviewer,Not dissimilar to Warren actually. Do all of you billionaires basically have in fact the wallet looked the same. It is like a billionaire wallet club?
Cuban,"Yeah, actually there is, you get it after you learn the handshake. But you know what? I'm always upset because I've never been invited into the Trilateral Commission. You know, I thought I made all this money, I qualify right? I thought the government ..."
Interviewer,"When you see other billionaires, I'm always curious about this, is this like a little billionaire banter, you know, that you guys on?"
Cuban,"It just depends if they're friends or not. So I'll tell you, I've got a buddy and he which I basketball with and he just sold his company and he crossed the billionaire mark. And we just sat down there, had a big old smile I saw him two weeks ago and he was like, I think maybe I should buy a sports to him, all right."
Interviewer,"When people say that money, you know, money won't make you happy."
Cuban,True.
Interviewer,But isn't there an element to that money alleviate one of the life's stresses?
Cuban,It relieves a lot of stress. That's different to make you happy.
Interviewer,Because you've known having no money?
Cuban,"Oh yeah, look..."
Interviewer,"You could be better having it, right?"
Cuban,"Oh, it's always better having, yeah."
Interviewer,But it's not an equivalence for getting happiness?
Cuban,"No. If you are miserable, when you are poor, you're going to be miserable when you're rich because you still have the same issues and the same stresses. You don't like, I've come home, I can't tell you how many times. I've come home with a date and the lights were turned off."
Interviewer,What is the single best thing about being a billionaire?
Cuban,"Just more control your time, more control, you know."
Interviewer,"Well, being alterable or accountable to be?"
Cuban,"That's exactly right. I don't wear a watch. There has been damn good reason for me to wear suit, you know."
Interviewer,This wasn't good enough?
Cuban,"No. It was good, I mean, tennis shoes all the time, right. It's just I have controlled my life and I get, you know. It's so I guess I've been able to tell other people what they need to do and not having to worry about them telling you what to do."
Interviewer,"Let's take a break. Because of course one of the things you do as billionaire was you bought a basketball team, like you did. The Dallas Mavericks. Let's talk about sports when we get back."
Cuban,Sure.
Interviewer,I want to know why sport business is winning. Is it the same in both? I suspect it probably is.
Cuban,"I've been a basketball junk this long. As I can remember, five years old, and the very first season tickets I've ever owned for any team ever were the Dallas Mavericks. And I was a season ticket holder before I bought the team and they were horrible."
Interviewer,She said like Don't call the owner.
Cuban,"Yeah, basically."
Interviewer,How does someone like Mark Cuban make someone offer they can't refuse?
Cuban,"Basically, I said, Would you sell it to me? and he said, Yeah. I said, What's your price and I didn't negotiate. I just wrote in the check."
Interviewer,Right away?
Cuban,Pretty much.
Interviewer,"You just said, Here you are."
Cuban,"I said, Yeah, let's do it and then, you know, he was in the paper works. We had to do the paper work and..."
Interviewer,And no haggling moment?
Cuban,Not really. No.
Interviewer,You just said this is it.
Cuban,"It was the highest price paid for sports team. And he also have to realize that that point in time, I still the stock market was still crazy, right. This was January of 2000. So like like the day before, the stock my Yahoo stock went up enough but to pay for the whole team. And so, it was crazy. And so, I felt a little bit like funding money and I was just like, why not?"
Interviewer,"Has it been everything you hope it would be, owning the Mavericks?"
Cuban,"It's different. It's a lot different. And when I saw it, it would be because I don't really own the team financially own the team, but all of North Texas owns the Dallas Mavericks, you know."
Interviewer,"And lots of issues babbling around big professional sport in America right now, probably the leading one is this issue of gay players both in basketball and football and it will happen to every sport obviously. You know, Jason Collins, obviously a big ground breaking moment there. We've also got this young college player who's come out before he's even made the drop but yet. What is your view generally about this issue and sport in America given that so many people in the sports, themselves, feel so uncomfortable about it?"
Cuban,"If for non-event, no. It actually literally is a non-event. Ever since Jason came out and it was it Robbie who's the MLS player, Robbie Rogers I forget his nickname and were friends is terrible. It's changed with radically how many states now allow gay marriage, you know, and people has become so accepted that it's a non- event and I think it's just in a span of 6, 12, months, it's changed dramatically and so..."
Interviewer,"Even in Arizona, this week, we've seen effort by lawmakers to kind of make it illegal again to just be gay, you know."
Cuban,Right. I think that's crazy.
Interviewer,It was like you have to right to refuse to serve people if you do suspect them for being...
Cuban,"That's the craziness of politics. That's not the real feeling of the population. I mean, I don't you don't just just how we deal with people anymore just changed. I mean, people don't unless you're running for office and you really need to have a strong Republican constituency voting for you. Real people aren't that way. And so, I think we've really come to the point where in the real world and real life, we don't care and that's the beautiful thing to say, you know. And you don't you never run into people. It's not an issue. No one says to me no one has contacted me and say, If you get a gay..."
Interviewer,Is it generational?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,And in a sense anybody over 40 probably still has a slight hang up historically about this?
Cuban,I think it's older than that.
Interviewer,Maybe say 50?
Cuban,Yeah. Because...
Interviewer,"Yeah, and certainly my generation, I don't think why. It's probably 50, right?"
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,And anyone under 50 and certainly under 40...
Cuban,Doesn't care.
Interviewer,... just doesn't really care either ways. CUBAN
Cuban,"Nobody died, didn't, you know, no one got checked out in the shower and had problems, you know. And so, he actually was the perfect guy to change everything."
Interviewer,"What about guns in sport? A lot of NFL players in particular like to have the gun around them. And basketball turn off to a last night's game. The Knicks guard Raymond Felton was arrested on gun charges. And there's been a lot of these stories in the last couple of years. And obviously, I've had a the whole position about gun control probably because I'm not American and therefore don't quite see the culture in the same way, but what about that? What about the fact the sportsman believing they need a gun?"
Cuban,"I think that's anecdotal. I think Raymond, it's unfortunate what happened. I don't really know the guy, but he was stupid, right? You know with at the Mavs, we make a point to ask all of our guys, do you want a gun? Is it registered? What states it is registered? You're not allowed to travel with it no matter what. We prefer you don't carry it in your car no matter what..."
Interviewer,"So, you've implemented your own version of gun control?"
Cuban,"Well, it's not no, I don't want to make it seem like gun control already."
Interviewer,What would you call it? Gun safety regulations?
Cuban,"Gun safety. Yeah, just gun awareness."
Interviewer,Some safety rules.
Cuban,"That's right. We just want to make sure that whatever the rules are for the state we're in, we're following the rules and you're not traveling with it, whatsoever. Now, is it possible that one of my guys might do something that I'm not aware? For sure. You know, when you're dealing with 18 to 35-year olds, it is what it is, right? But as far as I'm concerned, as long as it's registered, as long as they're playing by the rules, as long as you don't travel with it, OK."
Interviewer,"If you took that attitude generally to America, if everyone had that in you, you must save a place."
Cuban,I think so.
Interviewer,And that there's a quite sensible proposals. It's part of the problem calling it gun control. Do a lot of Americans hate that word control?
Cuban,"Yeah, because I think a lot of Americans feel threatened that their rights are being taken away. And gun control of the Second Amendment has become something that we feel intrinsically you have to fight for and I don't think guns are really the issue. I think it's more an issue of where we threatened by government and where do we feel at risk from government. And if you're going to fight back, what better amendment that you get rally behind in the Second Amendment. And so, I don't even think it's about guns. I think it's more about standing out and saying, Look, you're going to have to pry it from my cold, dead hands because I'm protecting the constitution."
Interviewer,Let's take another break. Let's come back and talk about Shark Tank. It's a huge hit.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,You're a huge hit on it. You're terrifying in many ways on that show.
Cuban,"No, not really."
Interviewer,No sharks are going to be fetching to you. And we'll discuss it after.
Cuban,"In your particular case, the Shark Tank is about failing. It's about taking your business to the next level. You're about to talk all of America one of the biggest mistakes sales people make. When they have a deal in front of them, you should just shut up and take the deal."
Interviewer,Hallelujah.
Cuban,Instead of keep on selling and you kept on trying to sell.
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban on ABC's Shark Tank zeroing in on some prey. It looks like he's being totally surprised here. Well, very Mark Cuban. We're also surprised but you were surprised, I mean..."
Cuban,I was shocked.
Interviewer,You're a very confident guy. Everything you touch basically turns to go. CUBAN
Cuban,"But do not necessary that's why I disagree, right? If not, you can't ever think that the people are useless. The beauty of the show..."
Interviewer,As a business person.
Cuban,As a business person.
Interviewer,Can they not be useful?
Cuban,"No, no. Because when you quit your life on the line, if you have the balls to say, you know what, I'm going to start this company. Every single person in this world has that one idea that they think is going to be brilliant and they get call excited and then they do nothing. The fact that they were able to stand up and do something with the idea, so they get credit, right? Now, when they..."
Interviewer,"And you see, a lot of time, I do agree with you. And every time I agree with you, so I remember again, doing America's Got Talent, I can remember they keep, no, I don't really admire you just the stand and they're telling me..."
Cuban,"So, that would be different."
Interviewer,Auntie Nellie said you could sing because you can't...
Cuban,But that that's just putting a...
Interviewer,And my job is to stop this dream dead any...
Cuban,That's what you're thinking.
Interviewer,"... that's just never going to happen. I'm helping them by saying, you can't sing."
Cuban,I don't disagree there. That's the thing.
Interviewer,"So you must have some people with that you think you're no good? How do you link get out of business, don't be something else. CUBAN"
Cuban,"No, you have to do so much just to start that business because you're not getting on the show unless it's a real business. So, unless at least to have a chance. Now, will I crash people? Yes, but not people who are putting good honest effort out there. If they bias me, if they're arrogant, if they're into something that I think is abusive or taking advantage, then I will nail that hell out of them, right? No problem doing that."
Interviewer,What is the kind of idea that you really love?
Cuban,Something that's differentiated. Something that's unique. Something that can grow I think into something that's big. Those are my favorite.
Interviewer,What is the kind of idea that you really love?
Cuban,"Something that's differentiated, something that's unique, something that can grow, I think, into something that's big. Those are my favorites."
Interviewer,"What kind of thing over the years, if you feel yeah, that that talk the shows about?"
Cuban,SURFSET Fitness is a perfect example. So this company comes in and once the former and the other his girlfriend and he wanted away to workout and also learn how to surf out of New Hampshire. We're going to learn to surf in New Hampshire in the winter.
Interviewer,"Talking about left field, you're dancing?"
Cuban,That's far out of left field.
Interviewer,You know what?
Cuban,That's what they took to shut me down.
Interviewer,You know why I'd like watching you on that show because it made me feel better about my dance.
Cuban,"I can't believe. Hey, I just have my hip replaced."
Interviewer,You know? You want that.
Cuban,I had my hip replaced.
Interviewer,Jerry Springer was a lot worse than you.
Cuban,"Oh there's a lot, lot worse than me."
Interviewer,And I love Jerry but I have to discuss this with you.
Cuban,"So, right there is doing the waltz whenever it was. I just have my hip replaced and so I was like, Please stay on one piece, please stay on one piece. And then, I do this jump at the end and then I landed and I didn't fall apart. And I was fired up. So, it was a more of victory."
Interviewer,"Do you have even now, Mark, do you get, you know, those moments when you wake up in the morning, you know, late at night and some and an incredible idea comes to you?"
Cuban,Yeah. I hate it now. I hate it because I have so much going on that I don't have...
Interviewer,Giving the time.
Cuban,"Yeah. I don't have that piece of dinner. It really takes a special motivation just to say, I don't give a damn, I'm going for it right. And you can't see bearers. People always say, You're such a risk taker. I have to take a risk. You know, I do the preparation, I do the work, and then when you're prepared, you can bust through to any wall."
Interviewer,And you're a father?
Cuban,"Yeah, that's makes it all."
Interviewer,Let's take a break and talk about fatherhood.
Cuban,Sure.
Interviewer,I want to know what kind of dad you are. I suspect you're a smiling assassin.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Son, I fully support you, son, if you come first."
Cuban,Exactly.
Interviewer,"The right of passage in the Cuban family, taking Jakers to his very first baseball game, right Jake? Yeah, that's good. Take off your tongue."
Cuban,"I do, too. I do, too."
Interviewer,Let's make some think about money and why it doesn't involve entitlement.
Cuban,"And that, you know, my daughter came home not long ago and she said, Dad, I'm mad because one of my friends came up with a business idea before I did. And so, you got to help me come up with a business idea now. And she was all excited then. You know, like any 10-year old, she got off and heard she was distracted, so get back on it."
Interviewer,"I've avoided politics too much because I think it's it can be quite tedious and then as good as somebody like you, but on a widen note, leadership seems to be in a vague form of paralysis in Washington generally in the moment. When you look at as an American, what is the answer to get through all this?"
Cuban,"I think we're in a transitional time. I mean, in an arrow where social media has changed, how media in general, right. It used to be there are three networks and there were seven networks, and then as long as you communicated through them, you can reach everybody. Now, people don't read the newspaper. They don't all watch the same news show. They, you know, there's the old saying that, If it's important to me, it will find me."
Interviewer,"It struck me that probably most people in Washington when they heard, what's that being sold in $19,000 billion. What is that?"
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"And be how can that be worth that money? I guess you or other people going, that probably quite shaky..."
Cuban,Yeah. I mean it makes...
Interviewer,...right?
Cuban,"... perfect sense, right."
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"So in one hand, you have a..."
Interviewer,Because you're familiar with that medium and how it will work.
Cuban,"And I use the app, right. I mean, look, if you're going to keep up with what's happening in the world today, if you're going to try to be a leader, if you're going to try have any impact on society, business, politics, wherever it may be, if you're not keeping up with what's going on from a technical perspective, you lost because, you know, the world isn't going to be run by people who control metal anymore."
Interviewer,"Why not put one in else's Snapchat, clearly because all my kids love it and like I'll tell all my friends."
Cuban,"It's interesting. So Snapchat is becoming a little social network. You know, I had all my problems wit the SCC and everything and so, I'm gearing people towards the zero footprint life, whether it's my kids, my business associates."
Interviewer,Right. Exactly right.
Cuban,"You know, after the conversation, it's gone. And I think the same things happen with text. That's why I wrote Cyber Dust. That's why I think everybody's mode of communication is going to change. And WhatsApp, one, they get app example, Cyber Chats and other so, I mean, Snapchat, Cyber Dust, it's only going to happen more and more."
Interviewer,"Well when we come back, I'll talk to you about the future. You only got it. You got the brain full of this, kind of thing."
Cuban,"I got two of them. I have my Samsung Note 3 which I like because it's big. I type, I get a thousand e-mails a day so let's me respond. And then I've got my back up phone, the iPhone, which I like because there's just certain apps that are only on the iPhone like Cyber Dust right now. Cycloramic everywhere. So there's all kinds of cool stuff. You got to keep up with everything."
Interviewer,You're a Mac guy or a PC?
Cuban,"All of the above. I mean I try to learn everything. I've got a Windows Surface Tablet. I've got a Mac. I've got a PC. You know, whatever it is. If I'm going to stay ahead, you know, there's always some 12-year old trying to kick my ass."
Interviewer,Go for it.
Cuban,And I've got to stay ahead.
Interviewer,I do have 15-year old kid. He was kicking my ass on the show. He was brilliant. Smart guy. CUBAN
Cuban,"Sensors and personalized medicine. It's not even close. Right now, we put everything into Google and expect to respond. Those days are disappearing. There's going to be sensors on our skin. I've got companies I'm investing in that literally put a little patch on and it tracks from the moisture, from the perspiration, and from the heat, just all these different things that proactively tell."
Interviewer,Amazing.
Cuban,Yeah. It will be totally different.
Interviewer,"What should I do brag, Mark Cuban?"
Cuban,Yeah. Whatever.
Interviewer,It's been great to talk to you.
Cuban,Always fun.
Interviewer,"Your book, How to Win at the Sport of Business"
Cuban,Really enjoyed it.
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban, remarkable man. That's all for us tonight."
Cuban,"I do, too. I do, too."

Cuban,Always fun.
Interviewer,"Your book, How to Win at the Sport of Business"
Cuban,Really enjoyed it.
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban, remarkable man. That's all for us tonight."
Cuban,There you go (laughs).
Interviewer,"That's well said, Skip. This is the shark tank and we want to start by finding out what is your, you may have more than one, but what's your biggest issue with Skip?"
Cuban,"It's not just Skip. Its sportswriters and sports media in general, where everything is generalities, right? ""Excruciating pressure"", what the hell is that, right? You know, ""need leader""."
Interviewer,It was excruciating pressure....
Cuban,Meaning what?
Interviewer,"Meaning that you personally watched up close and personally what Lebron went through against your Dallas Mavericks, and was it not the biggest collapse of a superstar we've ever witnessed on a finals or championship stage?"
Cuban,"No, I mean first of all its a team game. Right? You guys like to talk in complete generalities where no one can question you, right? You don't ever use facts, you don't ever use substance."
Interviewer,I don't ever use facts? That's all I use on this show.
Cuban,"""Excruciating pressure""? ""Undeniable"" this, it's just all generalities."
Interviewer,There's never been a star under more pressure going into a finals or championship series or game than Lebron James is under after nine years and three league MVPs.
Cuban,"First of all, you have a presumption that people care what you say. They don't. When guys."
Interviewer,That's fine. That's your opinion.
Cuban,"No, no, I'm talking about media in general. When guys get ready to play and they're in the locker room, they're not thinking ok well what's written, what's going to be written, what's being said, I mean, they're getting prepared. And if you've got a good coach and you've got a good culture, then guys are ready to play no matter what,like you guys were just talking about, you know, ""Miami just wanted more last night,"" that is just such horse-you-know-what, right. It's not that Okalhoma City didn't want it more, I think Miami was better prepared to play the game than Oklahoma City in terms of adjustments and changes, and now if you want to talk about double-teams and how they were used and whtether they should have played zone, um, what defensive structure was in place, that's a valid conversation. But just saying ""they wanted it more,"" that's ridiculous."
Interviewer,Ok.
Cuban,"When you're Kevin Durant, or yo'ure, uh, Derek Fisher, and you're Russell Westbrook, etc, and you're at that close out game, there's nobody who wants it more. It's just a question of who executes better and then you decide why."
Interviewer,"Who played harder? in the last games. Miami did, every game.. Lebron played harder than Kevin Durant did four straight games."
Cuban,"That is the most ridiculous thing any sportswriter has ever said. Now, if you think when Kevin Durant walked off the court he thought, yeah, I didn't play quite hard enough, right? Now you can say he wasn't put in a position to succeed, you can say they didn't run the right plays, they didn't get the ball to him on the block enough. And if you were smart you'd come out and you'd have substance. You'd say you know what, this is how many plays they ran to him on the block. Here's how Miami defended it. Now you can also argue the Pat Riley way is always the same way, all the time. Miami played it the same way all the time, and then we can have a discussion about adjustments. like last year, did we play harder than the Heat, is that what you think it was?"
Interviewer,"No, I don't. I think Lebron disappeared, and shrank in crunch time of the fourth quarter. I can just show you the numbers of what he didn't do in every fourth quarter."
Cuban,Wo we get no credit for not putting him in a position to succeed. RIght. We played the Heat.
Interviewer,"He put himself in, all he did was stand out on the perimeter."
Cuban,Now how do you think we defended that? WHy do you think he was standing out there?
Interviewer,"Uh, uh, you didn't have to defend him."
Cuban,"Oh right, so no matter what we did, he was just going to stand there and do nothing?"
Interviewer,That's all I saw. That was a lot of it.
Cuban,"That's exactly right, ""that's all you saw.""."
Interviewer,Hope that Dwyane Wade saves the day for him.
Cuban,"You're exactly right. That's all you saw. You didn't look. Right? I mean, that's a complete insult to us, to say you know what, the adjustments that we made-."
Interviewer,What did you do to force him out there?
Cuban,"We had different, we had like six, seven different types of matchups in our zone, and we played man-to-man, and we had a variety of different switches, right? So we knew that ninety percent of the shots were going to come from the left-hand side, right. We knew that if you gave him room from the left, he was going to drive. We didn't have the ahtletes that oklahoma city did, so we had to plan differently-."
Interviewer,Sure-.
Cuban,"So we need to make sure we pushed him out, away, and that we gave him different looks every time he had the ball, because just making, just forcing him to make a decision, to think about what he had to do, taking the time to read, are we in a zone, what type of zone we in, how are we matching up, what kind of rotations are we in, making him think forced him to pass around the perimeter, which gave us a chance to adjust. Now they're smarter, they're a better team this year, they deserved to win this year, but you know, that's the way we played it. So it wasn't just Lebron. Lebron actually played it right more often than not. He made the right pass to the right guy, who didn't make the right play. And that's exactly what we wanted"
Interviewer,They had several Steve Kerrs.
Cuban,"They had everybody stepping up and they deserved every bit. You know, so you talk in generalities."
Interviewer,No I'm not.
Cuban,"Yeah, you are."
Interviewer,"You spewed out some generality about players don't care. Let me tell you for a fact, and you can verify this, Stephen A, Lebron James listened to what I said for about, what, eight years? Because that's all I heard. He said I was his Howard Cosell. (Cuban smiles). And this year for the first time to his credit, he tuned out all the noise, that's all we saw was, he's reading The Hunger Games trilogy before the games. He's meditating on the bench before the games. He tuned us out."
Cuban,This is a Skip Bayless special. Lebron lost last year because he was paying attention to Skip Bayless. Lebron won this year because he wasn't paying-.
Interviewer,No.
Cuban,That's what you just said. Did he not just say that? (laughs).
Interviewer,"Here's what he didn't do against you guys. He let you off the hook, because he didn't do what we saw him do for four straight games. He didn't drive through your zone, and slash it up and dish. He didn't post up at all. This was a new deal, this was a new post-up game we saw this year from Lebron. He shredded the Oklahoma City defense because he drove and he dished."
Cuban,Ok. What kind of defense-.
Interviewer,He wanted to be a pretty jump shooter against you guys and it played right into your hands because he's a below-average jump shooter from the perimeter.
Cuban,"Ok, Skip, so when he was on the post, what were the different defensive schemes that Oklahoma City ran last night?"
Interviewer,"They had, they used Sefolosha on him, they used Durant on him-."
Cuban,When he was in the post what were the different defensive schemes they used?
Interviewer,Ibaka was supposed to come hard.
Cuban,Was supposed to come hard?
Interviewer,"And he did not come hard, he let Lebron get to the rim repeatedly, and Perkins was nowhere to be seen."
Cuban,I just asked a simple question.
Interviewer,And I just told you.
Cuban,"No, you said ""so and so was supposed to... ,"" no they, they doubled from down, right, and they doubled, and they passed and they hit their shots, when they kept on doubling, they changed, right, because they passed it out and Mike Miller hit the open shot. But that's just one example."
Interviewer,Did he get in the lane against you guys last year? Not at all in the fourth quarter.
Cuban,"Why do you play a zone, Skip?"
Interviewer,"Well, again, I've seen him slash up any kind of defense, when he feels like it. He's a freight train! You just said you don't have the athletes that they have."
Cuban,"Right. And that's why we played more zone than possibly Oklahoma City did. Because we had smarter players that are not necessarily as athletic. But the thing about the Miami Heat, they play the Pat Riley way. RIght? They play the exact same way, all the time. And I thought this series was going to be about adjustments. Oklahoma City felt like they had to do it a certain way, you know, it just didn't work, right? But it certainly wasn't the way we played them. So if you want to sit here and discuss ... let me put it another way. Every team tracks everything these days. So in game, we have five guys tracking what happens in a pick and roll situations, what happens in a post-up situation with Lebron, what happens with Lebron's posting and we run this type of zone, that type of zone. So you know in game exactly what the percentages are going. And if you are paying attention, you know those things as well. Oklahoma City didn't seem to make the number of adjustments they needed to make."
Interviewer,I agree.
Cuban,"And if you go through and look at the stats that I'm sure they have, that's what surprised me."
Interviewer,"Well you can throw all those stats out the window because, as Doc Rivers always says, it's a make or miss league."
Cuban,Yep.
Interviewer,"You won the championship last year because Dirk started making shots like he's never made 'em before. He played as tall as he is. Seven feet tall. And Lebron and Dwyane Wade started missing shots, or whoever else you want to throw in the equation."
Cuban,"No, actually, actually, we put Dirk in a position to succeed because we knew what Miami was going to do. They didn't make a lot of adjustments, they kept on playing the Pat Riley way. That increased our confidence as the game went by, as the games went by, right? So when we got to game four and everything was still the same, we knew we were going to win."
Interviewer,Are you criticizing the Pat Riley way?
Cuban,"Last year I was, this year it was perfect."
Interviewer,What was different?
Cuban,Last year versus this year?
Interviewer,Yeah.
Cuban,"They made their shots, and I don't think that they were, there wasn't as many adjustments against them."
Interviewer,Right. That's where I was going. Your club made the adjustments throughout the series. How surprised were you that Oklahoma City did not.
Cuban,"You know, I don't want to say anything about Oklahoma City because it's not like they had all season to work on these things."
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"RIght? We had the advantage of a full season where we played in, in, um, Chicago preseason last year, we played a whole game in nothing but zone. Nothing but zone. Because we knew we were going to have to go to the zone as our way to mix things up. And if you look at the..offensive results against our zone, you'd see, it was good. This year, because we had new guys, we didn't have as much time to practice, Okla-Indiana, same thing, why didn't they play zone? You don't have time to practice zone in a lockout shortened season when you don't practice. And I'm sure Oklahoma City faced the same thing. It's nice to say they could put in a zone, but if you don't have time to work on it, they can't. And I think that gave Miami a huge advantage."
Interviewer,So bottom line
Cuban,"I think we did a great job of taking him out of the game. Maybe he could have done more, but I think he played a Magic Johnson game last year against us and he needed other guys to step up and they didn't."
Interviewer,"Of all the things that have been said, I take issue with just one thing the great Mark Cuban had to say. I'll address that in a second though. I know we've got to go to break."
Cuban,"Yeah, I'm not going to play around with Lamar but let's put it this way. If a guy can't be part of our culture, you get rid of him."
Interviewer,"No, no, no, no. I'm not asking that question... I wasn't even asking, I respect the intricacies of that. What I am saying to you is that everybody and their grandmother could see that Lamar Odom didn't want it."
Cuban,"But we're not talking about a game in the middle of the season, right?"
Interviewer,"But I'm not talking about a game in the middle of the season, I'm talking about from the time that man got traded to Dallas he was miserable because he wanted to be in LA. What I'm saying is you can tell the difference. In other words-."
Cuban,I get your point. I get your point.
Interviewer,That's all I'm saying.
Cuban,"But you're in a close-out situation of the finals, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"And by the time you get to that point..the guys you put in, it's not like they were running the same rotation, both teams shortened their rotation. So the guys who are in the game, are the guys who are committed to play. Now if there's a guy that you don't think is in to it, or you don't think deserves to play, you're not going to play him."
Interviewer,"But there are times, and I agree with your assessment, what I'm saying is within the context of highly competitive competition, in terms of effort I totally agree with you. But what I'm saying is when you look at Lebron and you take into account all the suffering he has endured over the last several years, because of the expectations that weren't lived up to, because of the way he'd been maligned and ridiculed or what have you, if you're Kevin Durant, sure you're going out there and you're giving the same level of effort, but because you're seen and perceived as a relatively quiet, humble dude that everybody-."
Cuban,"It's a team game, so that comes down to are you putting your players offensively and defensively in a position to succeed. It's not a question of effort."
Interviewer,"My only... the only thing I'm addressing is that when somebody makes a statement about somebody wanting it more, it doesn't speak to effort per se sometimes, sometimes it speaks to a level of desperation one has, as opposed to one lacks."
Cuban,"Again, it's a team game. The worst thing ... perfect, perfect analogy. Because on one hand, wanting it bad enough, make it happen, making the shots, being the shot maker. You know what they call that? They call that hero ball. And you know what the number one killer of a team that's trying to come back-hero ball."
Interviewer,Russell Westbrook.
Cuban,Anybody.
Interviewer,"I'm just saying it happens, that's all I'm saying."
Cuban,"Again, it comes down... Look, I think the most underrated element in the NBA is coaching. Coaching matters."
Interviewer,I agree with that.
Cuban,"The hardest position to hire in all of sports is the head coach. It's harder to find the right coach than it is to find the right players. And so, to say somebody just wants it more, was out there, you know, who wants it more than Perkins? Just look at his face!"
Interviewer,I guess what I'm trying to say is you're taking it as somebody being maligned. What I'm saying is that sometimes it speaks to the level of desperation one may have. That's all I'm saying. But that's neither here nor there.
Cuban,But I think desperation's not the way to play the game.
Interviewer,"Right or wrong, I'm saying it happens, and as a reporter you're not beyond the pale to point that out. That's all I'm saying. But the other point I want to get to is this. You sat there and said media members, we don't know anything. Let's address this."
Cuban,"No, I said when you're talking in generalities, when you're talking in generalities, right. When you talk in general, when you talk in specifics and you've done your homework, everybody's going to respect what you said. If you take the time to call the guys and find out their position, and you're reporting what they tell you, guys are going to respect what you said. When you start talking about ""excruciating pressure"", what the hell is that!"
Interviewer,He just explained what it was.
Cuban,Absolutely. (laughs).
Interviewer,"So what I'm saying to you is, that's right, so what I'm saying to you is, if we talk to a player, and he wants to talk off the record, but doesn't have the courage to talk on the record. If you want to talk to a coach who's giving you this tidbit of information, but you can't! Please don't use this! I'm saying it happens. What I'm saying is, there are too many reporters that are proven, that have proven their level of credibility, simply because of the information, not only the information that they've acquired, but also you know they're talking to folks, and sometimes they're protecting them."
Cuban,"Two different things. One is just reporting what guys will say. And if you get access, you get a report, more power to you, that's great, that's doing your job. And then there's effort. There's effort around all the other elements of the game. There's going in... this Disney, this is ESPN, you have more resources than any team ever had. Look, every team, or most teams, you can go in there, and we've got ten guys breaking down tape, breaking down elements so we know exactly what's going on, internationally."
Interviewer,"What you just broke down, listen, we've had analysts all over ESPN, nobody has said what you just broke down about what you did to the Miami Heat last year in the NBA finals."
Cuban,But all you had to do was look at the tape. That's the point! The tape is obvious.
Interviewer,"Time out, wait a minute, Mark. Well listen, did you know it before you became an owner and you were inside those locker rooms? You had access!"
Cuban,"What I am saying is you don't need access to go down and sit down and break down a tape, so everybody's talking about officiating, right? Right? And I'm not going to say one way or the other, but all you have to do is watch the tape and score it."
Interviewer,"Wait a minute. You have analysts all over various networks throughout this country that have watched it and break stuff down and they still don't know what you know because you own the team and the coach is literally showing you what he's doing. They might not show it to somebody else. So even though you might break down the tape and see certain things, some of the nuances."
Cuban,I don't agree with that statement.
Interviewer,"Come on, come on!"
Cuban,I can watch other teams play.
Interviewer,"I'm telling you what coaches been telling me, because I don't know. I'm telling you what coached told me, so if I'm wrong, I'm wrong because they gave it to me."
Cuban,"I can watch other teams's games, right, and breakdown what they're playing, how they're playing it, I can look at officiating and know if it has an impact or not. And all I have to do is take notes. All you have to do is watch the tape and take notes."
Interviewer,You still haven't answered my same question
Cuban,"My point is it has nothing to do with access and everything to do with effort. If it was important to me, and if it was part of my job, to understand the nuances of the NBA game, before I bought the team, I would have done it."
Interviewer,"I'm sorry, I got news for you, primarily, our primary responsibility is results. I will explain it to some degree, but I could really give two cents about why you went 15 and 67. If you're 15-67, you stink. Your record stinks!"
Cuban,So I stand by my point. My 2.5 year old will sit there and break down tape and he knows more than any of you guys about the NBA.
Interviewer,You might say that....
Cuban,Thank you (laughs).
Interviewer,"... but what I'm saying to you is this, if we're on the air and we've got forty-five seconds to two minutes to talk about a subject, what do you want us to do?"
Cuban,"Ok, you're making my point, Stephen A."
Interviewer,"No, I'm not."
Cuban,You're making my exact point.
Interviewer,I don't think so.
Cuban,"If you're saying you just don't have the time to do it, just say you don't have the time to do it."
Interviewer,"No. What I'm saying is as you break it down and explain it, it comes down to bottom-line results. I've seen many analysts broke it down before, but at the end of the day we're never going to understand what you understand, because you have that level of access."
Cuban,"Ok, so I don't disagree that access can add color to what you see ...."
Interviewer,Content. Substance.
Cuban,"Well, context, right? To what you see on the tape. No question about that. But my point is if you don't watch the tape, you don't know all the questions to ask. And if you surprise a coach, by saying why did you do this, why'd you do that, what was the circumstance that led you to make this choice, then I think you'd get better responses."
Interviewer,Are we out of time? Can Mark stay?
Cuban,I like to do what I like to do.
Interviewer,"Ok. But you didn't attack the referees publicly, and potentially turn them against your Dallas Mavericks. You didn't insult the rival Heat fans and maybe get them to scream a little bit louder at the Heat home games. I liked that Mark Cuban, and I thought that helped that you stayed out of the way of your coach and your players and you let them do what they did best. You were in the shadows a year ago."
Cuban,"I wasn't. Just because I didn't talk to you guys didn't mean I did anything differently. I got to tell you, there was only one reason I didn't and that's because I was superstitious. RIght? You know? The minute I didn't talk to the media one game, we won. And so there was no good reason...."
Interviewer,So it was all superstition?
Cuban,A hundred percent.
Interviewer,It worked. I thought it really....
Cuban,Never. Never. They know me better.
Interviewer,Ok.
Cuban,"In terms of my role, when things are going wrong somebody's got to be out there taking the bullets. When things are going right, you step back, right? To me it was important to let Donald Carter lift the trophy because he was in ill health."
Interviewer,I liked that.
Cuban,It wasn't me talking when Stuart Scott had the mic; I handed it right to coach Carlisle.
Interviewer,You avoided the spotlight.
Cuban,"I didn't avoid anything, right? To me I was just doing what I thought was right. And that's the way I was trying to do it. It's not that I love the spotlight. You guys know, I turn down a whole lot more interviews than I say yes to."
Interviewer,Yes you do.
Cuban,I rarely say yes.
Interviewer,Yes you do.
Cuban,"But there's things that I like to do, Shark Tank, ABC, Friday nights. Um (laughs)."
Interviewer,We like that. Nice plug.
Cuban,"So it's not about limelight, it's about doing the right thing."
Interviewer,Is that not out of character for Mark Cuban last year?
Cuban,"No, no, trust me, it's not out of character."
Interviewer,"Ok, if you're superstitious and it worked will we see more of that forward?"
Cuban,"Depends what works. If I talk and we win, I'll talk more."
Interviewer,In other words you're wearing the same shirt that worked in game four....
Cuban,You have no idea! (everyone laughs).
Interviewer,"Alright, fair enough."
Cuban,"No, that's you Skip."
Interviewer,No. No.
Cuban,"That's you. You're the contrarian, right?"
Interviewer,"Nope, I'm right."
Cuban,"That's your sphiel, right. If you say A, I'm gonna say B. If you say...."
Interviewer,"I say exactly what I believe, is that not correct?"
Cuban,"No, he believes it."
Interviewer,What I am saying is you will find what you feel differently about somebody.
Cuban,"But, but yeah...."
Interviewer,I don't know if I agree with that.
Cuban,"He's making my point for me. ""He says what he believes."" Which is a whole lot different than knowing the facts. I rest my case."
Interviewer,"Ok, was I ever inaccurate in my constructive criticism of Lebron James over the last seven years on this show?"
Cuban,I don't know.
Interviewer,"Ok. He agrees, you say I was accurate with it. You thought I over stated it."
Cuban,"Of course. But I think the difference between us is it doesn't matter what I believe. In my own mind. I don't care what I believe, right? If it's something I believe, then I still want to know what the facts are."
Interviewer,But you're an analytical guy.
Cuban,That's just the way I look at it. I'm not saying it's good TV.
Interviewer,"Skip is analytical... Skip looks at numbers, but I think oftentimes, and this is the beauty of Skip Bayless, the numbers may tell us something. What he loves to do is tell us, fill in the blacks, what the numbers don't tell us."
Cuban,"Let me give you a perfect example, right. (picks up a traditional NBA box score from in front of Skip). This is a traditional basketball box score, right?"
Interviewer,That's what it looks like.
Cuban,"You know, it's the most worthless piece of information in all the NBA."
Interviewer,You find no value in those numbers whatsoever?
Cuban,None. There's the obvious points scored....
Interviewer,triple-double means nothing?
Cuban,It depends on the rest of the game.
Interviewer,How often do you read those?
Cuban,Who's the guy who threw the ball off the backboard?....
Interviewer,"I agree with that point. I often say numbers lie. He throws at me he averaged 30 and 10 or whatever, all these Lebron numbers are. Yeah, but what happened in the fourth quarter? It doesn't show in here, unless you look at the fourth quarter box. You happened to open the third quarter box."
Cuban,"But here's why I find I have a problem. Right? Because the numbers are the numbers, these numbers really don't tell much, the traditional boxscore. Because it leaves out one hundred percent of the context. Right? If a guy has fifty points, you know, and a guy takes thirty shots and maybe even has a triple-double, it's the old line, give me the ball, I'm open. But you got to know, there's a reason why you're open, right? Because you can't shoot."
Interviewer,"Ok, I circled one number in this entire box. One number I circled. This is the third quarter. When Oklahoma City collapsed and allowed, what was it, a 19 to 1 run."
Cuban,Right?
Interviewer,"The point guard took nine shots in that quarter, so that'd be 36 for a game. He made two of them. He shot 4-20 for the game. That's a pretty significant number."
Cuban,What story does it tell? (turns to Skip).
Interviewer,"It says, he shoots too much. It says they're in need of a pure point guard. A floor leader. Somebody to settle them down and get them better shots. That he's more, if you look at it over time, he's far more cold than he's hot, because he scored 43 on 36 shots in the previous game, as you know, and everybody's like, oh wow, Russell Westbrook, it's Westbrook or bust."
Cuban,"What I'm telling you it's telling you nothing, right? Because you don't know what offense is being run, it doesn't really tell you who was on the court, or who was on the court against him, for much, I guess for this game you would because everybody played everything, right. You know, were they sagging back and daring him to shoot, right? Look, you talk about what the boxscores will or won't tell you. If he's shooting too much, and you said over the course of the series he hadn't shot very well, and in other series he hadn't shot very well, then you're saying Oklahoma City did the exact right thing because Mike Miller hadn't hit a shot the entire series, so they were right just to leave him open, right? You got to adjust. It doesn't give you the context for adjustments, is what I'm saying."
Interviewer,"I'll buy that. I like Mark Cuban, he's a contrarian."
Cuban,"No, not at all. And I've been pretty much apolitical my entire adult life. But this election is obviously quite different than previous presidential elections. So I just thought - I thought it was necessary to jump in and use my voice."
Interviewer,Why?
Cuban,"The prospects of Donald Trump being president just scare the hell out of me. And that's coming after having initially, you know, supported him and hoped that he would be 180 degrees different from what he turned out to be."
Interviewer,"I mean, am I wrong? I seem to remember there was a time when you offered to be the running mate for either of them."
Cuban,"Oh, sure. Yeah, a lot of that was a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I didn't really expect that to happen. But, you know, there was a time when Donald first got into the race where I would talk to him on the phone."
Interviewer,"I think a lot of people will notice we've gotten this far in the conversation, and I'm not sure you've actually mentioned Hillary Clinton."
Cuban,"Haha. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, talking about her - she's smart. She's pragmatic. She is a policy wonk. She's had a lifetime of dedication to service. Now, that doesn't mean I agree with all of her policies. But without question, I think she can be a good president."
Interviewer,Is she trustworthy?
Cuban,"Yes, absolutely - 100 percent without question. Now, relative to Donald Trump, it's even a bigger dichotomy. Donald Trump I wouldn't trust as far as I could throw him."
Interviewer,Is being successful in business good preparation for being president?
Cuban,"I don't think it's a requirement to have a life in public service to be the president. But at the same time, the skillset that at least I've gotten - and I'm only speaking from my personal experiences - I think, would be very valuable."
Interviewer,Is it true that you offered to play Donald Trump in Hillary Clinton's debate preparation?
Cuban,"No, I was never asked. But I did offer in a made-for-TV. No, just kidding haha."
Interviewer,"Even if you're not helping to prepare Hillary Clinton for the debate, would you give her any advice on how to - if I might put it this way - provoke Donald Trump?"
Cuban,"Oh yeah, that's easy. Yeah, I mean, look, Donald Trump has got unlimited number of insecurities. But the No. 1 one thing, I would say, is his insecurity with his intellect. There's a reason why he always refers to where he went to college and, you know, that I'm a smart person."
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban from Dallas, thanks so much for being with us."
Cuban,"Thanks. I enjoyed it. Thanks, Scott."
Interviewer,"So Mark, there's been a lot of interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing over the past several years. We all saw how IBM's Watson Supercomputer dominated on Jeopardy. And now we're seeing a new technology take hold, something called #RPA that is gaining momentum. What do you think about the future of Artificial Intelligence, and where the industry is headed?"
Cuban,"You know, I've said it before and I'll say it again. In 10 years a liberal arts degree in philosophy will be worth more than a traditional programming degree. What is happening now with artificial intelligence is we'll start automating automation. Artificial intelligence won't need you or I to do it, it will be able to figure out itself how to automate  over the next 10 to 15 years. Now the hard part isn't whether or not it will change the nature of the work force, it will. But, the question is, over the period of time that it happens, who will be displaced? Marc Andreessen used to say that software is eating the world. Now, I believe, automation is going to eat the world."
Interviewer,"Wow, finally some good news for those liberal arts and philosophy majors! So, if that's going to happen, what are people who lack tangible skills, such as the philosophy majors you mention what are they going to do in this new era of automation?"
Cuban,"Well, I wouldn't say they don't have tangible skills. Knowing how to critically think and assess from a global perspective, I think, is going to be more valuable than what we see as exciting careers today which might be programming or accounting or those types of things. And frankly, the speed at which we're seeing automation permeate the workplace, scares the s- out of me. However much change you saw over the last 10 years with the iPhone, over the last 20 years with the Internet, over the last 30 years with PCs, etc., that is nothing. Nothing! We'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than in the last 30."
Interviewer,"So forget those typical 'safe' majors and study something you really enjoy, something you can be passionate about. Because many of those safe career paths are going to be automated. Is that what you're saying?"
Cuban,"I would tell people to follow their passion, even if it's in something that doesn't have an obvious job prospect but teaches you how to think. Look, I was passionate about baseball until I realized all I had was a 70 MPH fastball. I'm a realist so I gave that up and started focusing on things I could be really good (and competitive) at. And the more I worked at it, the better I got. I realized, nobody quits anything they are good at because it's fun to be good at something. But a lot of jobs are going to go away a lot faster than anyone imagined, even if you are good at it. Being able to learn and think...that's the future."
Interviewer,"Okay, so you believe automation is coming at an even faster rate than we've seen before. But didn't you revoke the credentials of two ESPN writers (Mark Stein and Tim MacMahon) who cover the Mavericks in 2016, because of your concern that they were relying on automated game reports that could (and would) eventually replace human-generated content? What's the story?"
Cuban,"While it may seem counter-intuitive to ban someone from covering us as a way of stopping automation, it really was my only option. I was worried about a lack of high quality in-depth coverage of every game, combined with an increased reliance on wire services. Instead of having a dedicated reporter, we saw data fed into algorithms and game summaries spit out and I think that is a long term problem for all sports. If I did nothing and the trend towards more and more games being covered by wire reporters continues, then it could get to the point where it was too late. So, I felt like if I didn't do it then, I wouldn't have a chance to stop or slow what I felt was a negative trend for the Mavs and the NBA. When a fan goes to a Mavs page and the only coverage is a wire service or eventually an automated summary, one highlight and a tweet, that hurts all stakeholders."
Interviewer,"For more information on the AP partnership with Automated Insights (that Mark is referring to above), see https://automatedinsights.com/customer-stories/associated-press/."
Cuban,"Automation is coming at us faster than ever before, and there are trillions of dollars to be made in artificial intelligence. I believe the first Trillionaire will be someone who masters AI. If you are not getting up to speed on Deep Learning, Neural Networks, etc. you will lose."
Interviewer,"Okay, so let's talk about your investment philosophy and the kinds of companies you like to invest in. Any thoughts you'd like to share."
Cuban,"Sure. You know, when I'm making an investment, whether on Shark Tank or elsewhere, I look for businesses that are unique and make me wonder 'why didn't I think of that'? I've invested in several startups...one is Genetesis, a medical device company in Ohio that uses noninvasive biomagnetic imaging to diagnose chest pain. I'm also backing a 3D printing firm called Fabric8 Labs that uses a Stereo-Electrochemical Deposition (SED) process that can produce objects in solid metal. I'm invested in companies related to sensors, (Motionloft), medical startups Biomeme (personalized medicine), Unikrn (online esports betting site) and others."
Interviewer,"Great, thanks. Any final thoughts on how the Dallas Mavericks can leverage automation technology even crypto?"
Cuban,"Well, we're accepting Bitcoin and Ether cryptocurriences to pay for tickets this season. As far as tokens, we will be taking tokens originated by companies (with whom) we have business relationships. We want to make our products and services how and where our customer want to buy it. As long as we can hedge or exchange the payment method and it works with our payment gateway, we will accept it as payment. I believe that blockchain technology will be at the core of most transactions in the future."
Interviewer,"You guys already have a special symbiotic relationship with all the 3D stuff, what can we expect going forward?"
Cuban,"The interesting part is that this is the natural evolution of the digital revolution. For the past I-don't-know-how-many years, it's been a move from large to small, smaller HD, smaller internet, smaller portable devices but the reality is, you can go bigger too. Not only do you go bigger, you go with dual-channel, tri-channel, as many channels as you want. And a natural extension now that you're getting digital projection into the theaters is 3D, bigger screens, and more unique experiences. And Bud at Cinedigm, who's the leader in 3D technology and distribution, and HDNet, Landmark Theaters, and some of the other companies we have, we're really trying to work hard together."
Interviewer,"Mark, you own Landmark Theaters and you just bought a stake in Carmike Theaters. Will you be converting those theaters over to 3D technology? How intricate of a process is it?"
Cuban,"Eventually all the theaters will be able to support everything digital. The reality is, bits are bits. You can transform any type of content into digital and Cinedigm's already got the network operation center to be able to distribute those bits. So now the question is trying to figure out the best content to get people out of their homes and into theaters to experience something completely new."
Interviewer,Has there been a little decline in traditional theater-going experiences?
Cuban,"Actually not. You know, people talk about social networking. We congregate around various topics on the net we're all on Facebook or MySpace or whatever it may be but one of the ultimate social entertainment experiences is going to see movies."
Interviewer,"From a technical standpoint, what goes on from the production end during a live event?"
Cuban,"It's not like, ""Well are we going to the game or should we watch it in 3D?"" This is just completely different. It's a completely different experience. From a technical perspective, trying to get all the synchronization done and understanding the differences in direction it's a whole new medium. When you're watching a game, it's not like, ""Well, I'll watch it on the big screen at home or I'll go see it in 3D."" It's like, ""Oh we're gonna trip out and go see a movie or whatever in 3D."" It's a whole different experience."
Interviewer,On whether he takes his success for granted.
Cuban,"Every day, I look in the mirror and I just make sure I don't pinch myself so I don't wake up."
Interviewer,On his success after selling tech company MicroSolutions.
Cuban,"I literally retired at 29 with a lifetime pass on American Airlines, and my goal was to party with as many people as possible."
Interviewer,On becoming an entrepreneur after getting fired from two jobs.
Cuban,"Those back-to-back experiences confirmed what I already knew, that I was a (bad) employee."
Interviewer,On the fact that his purchase of a G5 airplane was the largest known online purchase.
Cuban,"It was $41 million for an airplane. I can tell you without hesitation, it is really good to be able to do that."
Interviewer,On owning the Mavericks.
Cuban,Everybody thinks that we are in the basketball business. It's an NBA game; we're not in the basketball business. We're in the business of creating unique experiences.
Interviewer,On his relationship with former NBA Commissioner David Stern.
Cuban,"We get along great. And the few things we didn't agree on, he had the authority to fine me on."
Interviewer,On whether or not he will vote to oust Clippers owner Donald Sterling.
Cuban,"You'll find out. I know how I'm going to vote, but I'm not ready to comment on it."
Interviewer,On how to keep bigotry out of the NBA.
Cuban,You don't. There's no law against stupid.
Interviewer,On stupidity in general.
Cuban,"I'm the one guy who says don't force the stupid people to be quiet, I want to know who the morons are."
Interviewer,On bigotry in general.
Cuban,"I know I'm prejudiced and I know I'm bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I'll move to the other side of the street. If I see a white guy with a shaved head and tattoos, I'll move back to the other side of the street. None of us have pure thoughts; we all live in glass houses."
Interviewer,On how to fix the national economy.
Cuban,"Until you fix the student loan bubble, we don't have a chance. Everything else is shifting lawn chairs on the deck of the Titanic."
Interviewer,On the TV show Shark Tank.
Cuban,Shark Tank sends a message to everybody that the American dream is alive.
Interviewer,On the companies he's funded on Shark Tank.
Cuban,They're all my babies.
Interviewer,On why he still works.
Cuban,I love to compete. Somebody out there is competing with me and I want to kick your.
Interviewer,What are your latest projects?
Cuban,"Besides the Mavs, there is HDNet and HDNet Movies (http://www.hd.net/)Magpictures.com, HDNetfilms.com, 2929ent.com, LandmarkTheaters.com, for theentertainment biz. Then in the internet space, Goowy.com, Box.net, redswoosh.net, icerocket.com with more to come."
Interviewer,"In the 1990's there was a tech stock boom, then bust. Now, with the IPO of Google and other major developments, are we in the midst of a second tech boom?"
Cuban,"No question about it, but its completely different than the '90s. Today, anyone with 500 dollars can buy an incredibly powerful PC and get a fast net connection and startup an Internet business. Back in the '90s, startups worried about raising money first, then having a workable idea second. Today, most startups don't want or need money. They can hit the groundrunning and have an impact. Once they can determine the scale of the opportunity, they look to raise funds."
Interviewer,What do you foresee as a big tech innovation ten years from now?
Cuban,"I have no idea, and I don't even pretend to know."
Interviewer,"With your ownership of the Mavericks, do you consider owning a sports team a good investment, or something you do for love of the sport?"
Cuban,It could be a good investment if I didn't care about winning. But winning a title is more important than making some more money.
Interviewer,"A while back, your gift to your then fiancée was highly publicized. What is your philosophy as to gifts? Are you under any special pressures?"
Cuban,I don't have a policy. I just do what I think is the right thing to do.
Interviewer,"With your private business, you have to pay employees the fair market value. With the NBA, there are salary caps. Do you find that frustrating?"
Cuban,"No. Not at all. The NBA has to take into consideration the health of the league as a whole. So the caps work. In all other businesses, your competition is trying to put you out of business. Things wouldn't work too well in pro sports if I were trying to put the Spurs or Lakers out of business. Instead, I just want to kick their ass on the scoreboard."
Interviewer,What do you consider a splurge?
Cuban,Eating a quart of ice cream in one sitting.
Interviewer,What do you consider a complete waste of money?
Cuban,Trying to be fancy. I don't get into the place settings or chandeliers or paintings for the sake of having things because I can. I just like the things I like and go from there.
Interviewer,Are you involved with any charities?
Cuban,"Yes, but the only one I disclose is the Fallen Patriot Fund (www.fallenpatriotfund.org). I try to do things because I think it's the right thing for me to do, not because I get recognition."
Interviewer,"Do you feel you enjoy your money more than such people as Warren Buffet, who refuses to drive new cars or to throw out used soap?"
Cuban,No. I'm sure he has his splurges and things he loves to do. Renting out a baseball field and putting together a game isn't something you can do with money you save from soap conservation.
Interviewer,"Other than your tech business and the Mavericks, do you have other investments?"
Cuban,"I love the Internet and how it impacts the delivery of content and information. What people are calling, Web 2.0, AJAX interfaces, software written using practical approaches like Ruby on Rails. Anything that can be run with fewer than 5 people and can be nimble, aggressive and impactful are the types of technology businesses I love. The kind I hate are the ""I'm the smartest guy on the planet"" type applications. DRM, video compression and the like . There is always someone smarter and I'm not good enough to know which person I'm talking to. The also ran, or the best ."
Interviewer,"You are very ""hands-on"". How do you know when it's time to delegate?"
Cuban,"When I trust someone and feel that I can learn something from them.With your tech business, you are the boss. With the NBA, you have to work within a consortium."
Interviewer,"What advice do you have for people who have to ""work with the system""?"
Cuban,"Don't do what I do. I'm a terrible employee. I don't do well ""in a system"". I guess my real advice is to do your homework and understand what your goals are. It's easy to speak up, it's hard to figure out how to pay for the kids' stuff when you are fired."
Interviewer,"You have taken a very visible role in the media, as evidenced by your sitting in the stands and not in a box. How do you achieve the privacy you need in your life?"
Cuban,"I know where and when I will have private time, either alone or with family. I have places I can go where people have known me and are used to seeing me. Then there is everywhere else, where I have to realize that there is a very good chance that someone is going to take a picture. I just look at it as a good problem to have. I would rather be in this position, than where I have been in the past, wondering how I'm going to pay the bills."
