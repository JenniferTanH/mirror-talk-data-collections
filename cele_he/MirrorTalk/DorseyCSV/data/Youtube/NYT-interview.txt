I know you're having to jet

over here to talk to us there's so much

to talk to Jack about both at Twitter

and at square I want to start on Twitter

but I want to move to square because I

don't know if everybody here appreciates

the square is on its way now to actually

being bigger than then Twitter and I

want to understand how that even factors

into your thinking and where that

company is going but given that it's in

the news I do want to start with Twitter

I want to start with this as everybody

saw the news last week you eliminated

president Trump's account on Twitter and

there's some people I know who are

applauding and other people who may have

other views but just take us inside the

room and help us understand what

actually happened and why it was so easy

for something like that to happen

an employee who on this person's last

day to Kapaun themselves to deactivate

the account and there are a number of

things that came out of this for us

first should never be possible so we

started looking into the controls that

we have in place and what we could

improve and where we have weaknesses and

where we have gaps second just the you

know particular policies around what

agents have control over and what they

don't the account was not removed it was

not suspended it was deactivated which

is a very different state than what you

would assume so it was not deleted it

was put in a state waiting for the owner

to come back to it and reactivate it

did the owner yes otherwise the

president yes he came back to it he came

back to take him back to it and what had

it and he reactivated it so and did they

call you we we have conversations we

have conversations

real quick you have no no you you have

policies and we're talking Monica

earlier Facebook about policies about

divisive hate speech things that can be

said and can be unsaid or not said on

Twitter and there was a moment at which

you kicked rose mcgowan off briefly

things like that a couple people emailed

in today actually a couple we even put

it on Twitter for me to ask you this

what would the president have to say on

Twitter to be kicked off well so first

and foremost we um we hold every single

account to the same standard to the same

rules and to the same policies where we

haven't been great is showing the

interpretations of our policies as it

pertains to enforcement if an account

were to publicly attack or harass a

private citizen

for instance we would take action and we

would of course have conversations with

the party involved in the abuse or the

harasser I think you said things about

certain people so we do we do have a

clause in our Terms of Service that

unfortunately we did not have publicly

stated but we operated internally which

is one of those caps that I'm speaking

to around newsworthiness and public

interest and keeping content up because

of it because it is of public interests

because there is reporting on it because

it is a record of an action and this is

a subject subjective evaluation by us

and we work really hard to make sure

that we are listening to voices and

specifically the journalists on our

platform to determine news worthiness

and to determine what is public interest

and what's not public interest in some

cases were going to get it wrong but as

their peers have said like this is

something that is evolving this is

something that's moving very very fast

we're trying to learn as quickly as

possible and the only way we know

how to help build trust in our process

is to be transparent as possible around

how we're thinking and I when it give us

a high grade at the moment but we do

have the intention internally in the

company to fix that and it's flexing a

muscle that we haven't had to flex or

weed in it flex in the past around being

very open and being very transparent now

the company has been transparent in many

degrees in other ways requests for

information from governments for

instance we have established a

transparency report which is

industry-leading but we haven't been

consistent throughout all of our actions

and and that doesn't inspire trust and

and that causes people to make

assumptions that are probably incorrect

against our intentions so we're just

trying to make those intentions clear

we're trying to close the gap between

policy and interpretation of policy and

enforcement and it's real work and it's

work that requires engineering

it requires legal aspects and what one

policy question last last week there

were the hearings and all the companies

sent lawyers they didn't send the CEOs

did you think about wanting to go was

there was there a conversation about

whether whether whether you or others

should go absolutely and I would I would

be happy to stand up and represent our

company at any point and we want to make

sure that we are sending our experts and

people who are familiar deeply with the

knowledge and can speak to that and

Shawn or GC was that person if I was

called specifically I would go and I

would get prepared and make sure that I

understand every single aspect of what

happened and what we're doing about it

more importantly but we want to make

sure that we were showing not only you

know the you know our understanding of

what happened in our investigations and

by the people who actually led them but

also by the people who can run with the

work and push it and make the changes

okay so I want to know a little bit

about your life which is you are now the

CEO of two companies and as I meant

and square gets a lot less attention in

all of this but how do you manage both

of these things in a personal basis

daily basis yeah I mean it's um it's

evolved as as things do I I am when I

started I just took in as much as

possible and then I figured out what I

need to focus on and what mattered and

where I need to prioritize and both

companies are in very different phases

Square is something I built from day one

and I know every single detail of that

system and Twitter I had to learn a few

things in my absence and I had to

understand why we made decisions and

what the principles were and and how we

might how we might change those or how

we might evolve those so both required

very different answers both companies

are right across the street from one

another so it makes a little bit easier

but I benefit from number one a lot of

structure number two realizing that it's

not about the amount of time I spend at

one thing it's about how I spend the

time and what we're focused on and are

we focused on the thing that truly

matters the most and is it most

important are we ignoring everything

else at least for now and then three do

we have the right team around to do the

work and to make the decisions and move

things forward and Square had been

building that team for a long time and

we we had to do some research to Twitter

throughout the company and it just it

takes time it takes time for a team to

gel it takes time to understand how to

collaborate with one another and

meanwhile we have a lot of other things

that were not expected that I was coming

into that we had to deal with and we had

to we had director okay so here's what

I'm going with this it feels to me like

Square is your baby really your baby

Twitter's your baby too but Square is

appearing like it could really be on

this remarkable ride is there ever a

moment at which you think you're going

to have to choose your children

I well I don't have children right now I

am part of two amazing companies and my

goal is to make sure that we are

building something that outlives me and

that endorsed and that continues to

serve generations beyond me and that

means I need to build structures that

aren't dependent entirely upon me that

need that means I need to recognize

leaders who can succeed me that means we

need to get our decision-making rigor

and process and understanding into the

v-very DNA of our companies and as I

said both companies are in different

phases of that tell us about where

Square is going and the reason I reason

I ask is I'm used to new we all know

Square you go to a go to a store or a

coffee shop and and and either slide it

in we had all sorts of taxi drivers are

now using it as well or they've been

using it for years but you recently

bought a bank and you you you mayn't you

look like you're on the way to becoming

a bank that it's gonna be a different

business am I wrong

well we didn't buy a bank like we didn't

buy a license either we applied applied

for a license for an ILC which isn't a

futon company and and that process takes

about a year so we're not through it yet

when nothing has been confirmed or or

completed but the reason we did that is

because we have this really amazing

business called Square Capital which

gives out loans to sellers and owning a

bank charter allows us to be more

efficient in that but it also allows us

some freedom to make bigger moves or

different moves in the financial space

and you know more and more we've

realized over time that now when we

started the company we thought we were

building a credit card reader a lot of

people to accept credit cards but then

we realized that we were actually

building a tool that helped people

participate in the economy because they

were losing sales because they connect

up credit cards and as we thought about

that more we looked more and more

towards financial services instead of

just hardware or point-of-sale and

Square Capital came out of that

installment which is

humor product camera or that squirt cash

came out of that and that is a big part

of our future I believe is to continue

to serve an underserved audience that's

who we're serving in the early days of

sellers and I believe we have a huge

opportunity to do that with individuals

as well most of Silicon Valley though

tries to run away from regulated

businesses so that's why I was curious

about the banking piece of this and to

the degree that if you get involved in

the banking piece does it therefore

affect the other pieces right regulation

isn't always a negative and we also have

to realize that regulation evolves and

you know a big part of our role is to

help educate the right way regulation

might evolve and what we've learned and

what we can invent what we can do what

we can build that can give access to

more people and that is our focus is

this word access access to the financial

systems both from a seller and

individual standpoint so when we first

started the company we were questioned

by our banking partners and by their

regulators and and said no hundreds and

hundreds of times until we could show

the intent and we could show that we

could reach a broader audience and we

could reach an audience that wasn't able

to participate in the past and that was

good for everyone and we had to change

some things to do that we didn't want to

force people to go through a FICO score

a credit check to start accepting credit

cards it didn't make sense to us it

didn't make sense to them so we changed

that model and we went from a merchant

acquisition process that only accepted

thirty to forty percent of those who

applied to 99 percent of those who

applied so we constantly questioned the

regulatory but we also realized the

benefits to it is that it does have

protection not just for our customers

but also for our industry and we need to

do our work to make sure that we're

showing solutions that that of all

thinking there's been a lot of folks in

Silicon Valley we've tried to think

about how do you rewrite the FICO score

what is it how do you get the new

algorithm taking other new pieces of

data to try to let the unbanked

Bengt what have you done on that meaning

how does it work

we've just questioned a bunch of the of

the fundamentals I mean I think a lot of

the reason why we found so many people

left out of accepting credit cards in

the first place is a lot of our banking

partners just had inertia around

understanding identity and changing the

system and these are very old legacy

systems that work and they're

predictable and they don't fail and when

you build something new there's an

element of failure there's an element of

risk and you have to manage that and it

creates a lack of momentum so we just

wanted to take that on and question that

and make sure that we are understanding

new forms of identity and and we're

agile around it so I think the what we

brought to bear was not a specific

solution but a mindset of agility to be

open to different forms of data whether

that what's the data give us an example

of what are you seeing that you're

you're you're willing to give somebody a

loan that a traditional bank would not

even look at that person well I think

first and foremost Square is unique

because our square capital is unique

because we actually see their business

so they use our register they use our

payments they enter all their employees

into our system we see all their

customers we see their competition we

have a very deep understanding of how

they're doing

and who they are and we don't make a

judgement until we have a pretty strong

understanding to make that at risk risk

assessment so our own data is one thing

we're seeing because we built our

platform in such a way that we are the

tool that's being used to run the entire

business so we have an advantage that

others mostly do not but outside of our

walls we look at you know how sellers

are engaging with Yelp or Facebook or

Instagram or Twitter or all these

signals that people are sending around

the world and of course other other

aspects that that are available to us

but a lot of our assessment comes from

our own understanding our own data so

you have a product called square square

cat

competes with something called venmo

some of you may know that but it's

recently the numbers have been off the

charts

with your business but there's been a

big question of how these type of

transfer payments that are coming among

each other whether there's actual money

meaning how are you gonna make money

doing that yeah so I've been really

really proud of square cashes progress

it's consistently broken into the top 20

free apps in the iOS App Store which is

a huge feat for a finance app it's

consistently been the number one above

our competitors run though and PayPal

over the past few months and the way

that we've done that is we haven't seen

it just as peer-to-peer we've evolved

past peer to peer and we've realized and

we've observed that people are using it

as a spending device and the more

ability we add and the more capabilities

we add to spend it in more places the

more adoption we see in the more

retention we see so what we've done it's

quite simple and intuitive we started

with the most critical thing which was

sending money between 10 people and then

we moved on to issuing a card that could

be used online and offline why the big

banks haven't figured this out I mean

why is JP Morgan Chase not been able to

do a square cache or a venmo they were

trying but they haven't they haven't

gotten there I don't know but I know

what has worked for us is focusing on

our strengths simplicity is a strength

speed access to funds the strength

building something that feels cohesive

is a real strength building something

that is self serve where you don't have

to talk with anyone or or engage with

any system outside of just downloading

the app and getting getting going is a

real strength so that's the formula that

works for us in the suicide and the

individual side and we've just wanted to

do it we've wanted to make it happen we

didn't want it we don't want to wait for

it happen we wanted to make it happen we

took on that mindset and I think 80% of

our success is just willing it into

existence and pushing through every

barrier that we found in order to serve

people in a different and unique way

we've had a raging debate all day up

here on the stage about Bitcoin and

cryptocurrencies and since you're here

and wishes a Ken Chenault was here

earlier today also in the payment space

of sorts what's your take both on

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is it is it

is it a fraud is it the next Enron or is

it is it here to stay and very real I

think it's easy to get lost in the

superficial aspects of it and the

surface level and ignore all the amazing

technology underneath

I think the Bitcoin white paper is one

of the most seminal works in the past 20

years in computer science I think it has

impact far beyond currency I think as

impact on trust as impact on identity

but it's a continuation of

decentralization we saw a

decentralization work with the internet

we saw a decentralization work with data

in the cloud we saw a decentralization

work with compute more and more with

platforms like AWS and GCP and we

continue to see it in one of the last

fundamental utilities that we use as a

society which is the ledger it's a

decentralized ledger and that has

extreme power so I want to make sure as

a company and this is not just square

but also Twitter that we're looking at

technologies like the blockchain my

cryptocurrency and learning from it and

learning how we can apply it to create

new experiences or create new

efficiencies or to do things that we

were always trying to do but were

hampered in the past because of X or Y

or Z but now we suddenly have this

amazing accelerator that we can apply in

a very unique way so you expired but you

accept Bitcoin we accepted Bitcoin in

2014 and then 1/2 a lot of our sellers

at the time we're selling things like

incense and candles and it turns out

people in 2014 weren't using

coined it by incense and candles so we

didn't see very many transactions but we

learned a bunch from it and we've

integrated that thinking and I III think

it's I think it's fascinating so I would

not get caught up in the trap of writing

it off because of the surface level

aspects of it I would look really deeply

in the technology and how we can use it

to improve things and and you know

improve another form of communication

around the world which is how we

transact and how we trade money there's

the the traditional competitors to your

business but I'm curious and I've always

been curious why you're wearing an Apple

watch - why do you think Apple hasn't

hasn't gone into this space and owned it

and do you think an Amazon where some of

the companies and weren't probably not

even thinking of will ultimately be

where you are or try to be Amazon did

try and we're very aggressive and

competing with us through price and we

saw some customers go over to them and

then we saw those same customers come

back to us and you know I think we you

have to focus on your strengths and our

strengths there was cohesiveness you

were not just building a register we're

not just building payments we're not

just building a loan product we're not

just building payroll all of them work

together and we've taken this approach

of what is the most critical need for a

seller and just go after them line by

line by line and make them work so that

there are no seams and you know you

don't have to think about connecting

them at all so you download one up and

you're done so we just haven't seen that

approach but certainly Apple and Amazon

could go after the same thing but this

is our focus this is our DNA and you

know when we get to partners with with

companies like like Apple who we've

learned so much from and Square only

exists today because of Apple

we're honored and and we learn and you

know we we hope to contribute to the

ecosystem that they created that made us

even possible in the first place I want

to sneak in to questions from the

audience before we have to

say goodbye so let's bring up the lights

if we could well while we're getting the

microphone by the way 140 characters are

280 these days where you live in both

both yeah what are you gonna have read

you think under 140 under 140 okay we

have a couple people a couple hands

right here in this in the friend Claudia

Rojas capital bringing it to the theme

of playing for the long term can you

speak to the value of founder centric

companies or founder run companies in

the public markets and perhaps their

greater capacity to plan for the long

term and so here I'm thinking about face

book under Mark Zuckerberg Tesla and

Netflix and then of course your own

experience as a founder I have a very

great fortune of being on the board of

the Walt Disney Company which was also a

very strongly founder led company and

the founder has died and the company

thrives and what Walt was able to do to

imbue his values and his creativity and

his direction into the company lives on

and you feel it in every single thing

the company does every single

conversation at the board level all the

way down so I have the fortune of being

on that board because I get to learn how

to do that I as Lorene said death is

life's greatest invention we are all

going to die and that forces a bunch of

considerations around how we prioritize

our work but more importantly it puts

this this constraint upon us that if we

want to leave something that actually

has impact we need to make sure that

we're leaving something that isn't

dependent upon us living and there's an

independent pulse upon us being there in

the first place so that's what I aspire

to every single day I don't I think it's

a failure if I have to make a decision

there's something wrong with the

organization that we need to fix

whether it be

the people the context the organization

the the problem we're trying to go after

the articulation the fact that we might

be doing too much that's the criteria

that I started looking at when I'm

forced to make a decision there god

forbid our board has to make a decision

so that's that's how I'm measuring

myself is are we building a structure

that isn't dependent upon me is it a

dependent upon our current leadership

and ultimately isn't depend upon anyone

in the company today and that forces a

bunch of considerations that are really

hard to do but will allow us to

ultimately thrive and that's that's what

I want to build that's what I want to

leave behind you know what on that note

I'm gonna say thank you thank you for

the conversation so very much and let me

let me also say thank you to everybody

here it has been a tremendous day I want

to thank everybody for the questions for

sticking with us Jack Dorsey everybody

thank you we hope to all see you next

year right back here Thanks thank you
