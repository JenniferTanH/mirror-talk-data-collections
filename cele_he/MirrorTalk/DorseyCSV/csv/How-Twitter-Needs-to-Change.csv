Interviewer,What worries you right now?
Dorsey,You've been very open.
Interviewer,about lots of issues on Twitter.
Dorsey,What would be your top worry.
Interviewer,about where things are right now?
Dorsey,Right now.
Interviewer,the health of the conversation.
Dorsey,"So, our purpose is to serve."
Interviewer,the public conversation.
Dorsey,and we have seen.
Interviewer,a number of attacks on it.
Dorsey,"We've seen abuse, we've seen harassment."
Interviewer,we've seen manipulation.
Dorsey,"automation, human coordination."
Interviewer,misinformation.
Dorsey,So these are all dynamics.
Interviewer,that we were not expecting.
Dorsey,13 years ago when we were.
Interviewer,starting the company.
Dorsey,But we do now see them at scale.
Interviewer,and what worries me most.
Dorsey,is just our ability to address it.
Interviewer,in a systemic way that is scalable.
Dorsey,that has a rigorous understanding.
Interviewer,of how we're taking action.
Dorsey,a transparent understanding.
Interviewer,of how we're taking action.
Dorsey,and a rigorous appeals process.
Interviewer,for when we're wrong.
Dorsey,because we will be wrong.
Interviewer,Whitney Pennington Rodgers:.
Dorsey,I'm really glad to hear.
Interviewer,that that's something that concerns you.
Dorsey,because I think there's been.
Interviewer,a lot written about people.
Dorsey,who feel they've been abused.
Interviewer,and harassed on Twitter.
Dorsey,and I think no one more so.
Interviewer,than women and women of color.
Dorsey,and black women.
Interviewer,And there's been data that's come out.
Dorsey,Amnesty International put out.
Interviewer,a report a few months ago.
Dorsey,where they showed that a subset.
Interviewer,of active black female Twitter users.
Dorsey,"were receiving, on average."
Interviewer,one in 10 of their tweets.
Dorsey,were some form of harassment.
Interviewer,And so when you think about health.
Dorsey,for the community on Twitter.
Interviewer,I'm interested to hear.
Dorsey,health for everyone.
Interviewer,but specificalHow are you looking.
Dorsey,to make Twitter a safe space.
Interviewer,"for that subset, for women."
Dorsey,for women of color and black women?
Interviewer,Yeah.
Dorsey,So it's a pretty terrible situation.
Interviewer,when you're coming to a service.
Dorsey,"that, ideally, you want to learn."
Interviewer,something about the world.
Dorsey,and you spend the majority of your time.
Interviewer,"reporting abuse, receiving abuse."
Dorsey,receiving harassment.
Interviewer,So what we're looking most deeply at.
Dorsey,is just the incentives.
Interviewer,that the platform naturally provides.
Dorsey,and the service provides.
Interviewer,"Right now, the dynamic of the system."
Dorsey,makes it super-easy to harass.
Interviewer,and to abuse others through the service.
Dorsey,"and unfortunately, the majority."
Interviewer,of our system in the past.
Dorsey,worked entirely based on people.
Interviewer,reporting harassment and abuse.
Dorsey,So about midway last year.
Interviewer,we decided that we were going to apply.
Dorsey,a lot more machine learning.
Interviewer,a lot more deep learning to the problem.
Dorsey,and try to be a lot more proactive.
Interviewer,around where abuse is happening.
Dorsey,so that we can take the burden.
Interviewer,off the victim completely.
Dorsey,And we've made some progress recently.
Interviewer,About 38 percent of abusive tweets.
Dorsey,are now proactively identified.
Interviewer,by machine learning algorithms.
Dorsey,so that people don't actually.
Interviewer,have to report them.
Dorsey,But those that are identified.
Interviewer,are still reviewed by humans.
Dorsey,so we do not take down content or accounts.
Interviewer,without a human actually reviewing it.
Dorsey,But that was from zero percent.
Interviewer,just a year ago.
Dorsey,"So that meant, at that zero percent."
Interviewer,every single person who received abuse.
Dorsey,had to actually report it.
Interviewer,which was a lot of work for them.
Dorsey,a lot of work for us.
Interviewer,and just ultimately unfair.
Dorsey,The other thing that we're doing.
Interviewer,"is making sure that we, as a company."
Dorsey,have representation of all the communities.
Interviewer,that we're trying to serve.
Dorsey,We can't build a business.
Interviewer,that is successful.
Dorsey,unless we have a diversity.
Interviewer,of perspective inside of our walls.
Dorsey,that actually feel these issues.
Interviewer,every single day.
Dorsey,And that's not just with the team.
Interviewer,that's doing the work.
Dorsey,it's also within our leadership as well.
Interviewer,So we need to continue to build empathy.
Dorsey,for what people are experiencing.
Interviewer,and give them better tools to act on it.
Dorsey,and also give our customers.
Interviewer,a much better and easier approach.
Dorsey,to handle some of the things.
Interviewer,that they're seeing.
Dorsey,So a lot of what we're doing.
Interviewer,is around technology.
Dorsey,but we're also looking at.
Interviewer,the incentives on the service:.
Dorsey,What does Twitter incentivize you to do.
Interviewer,when you first open it up?
Dorsey,And in the past.
Interviewer,it's incented a lot of outrage.
Dorsey,it's incented a lot of mob behavior.
Interviewer,it's incented a lot of group harassment.
Dorsey,And we have to look a lot deeper.
Interviewer,at some of the fundamentals.
Dorsey,of what the service is doing.
Interviewer,to make the bigger shifts.
Dorsey,We can make a bunch of small shifts.
Interviewer,"around technology, as I just described."
Dorsey,"but ultimately, we have to look deeply."
Interviewer,at the dynamics in the network itself.
Dorsey,and that's what we're doing.
Interviewer,But what's your sense.
Dorsey,what is the kind of thing.
Interviewer,that you might be able to change.
Dorsey,that would actually.
Interviewer,fundamentally shift behavior?
Dorsey,"Well, one of the things."
Interviewer,we started the service.
Dorsey,with this concept of following an account.
Interviewer,as an example.
Dorsey,and I don't believe that's why.
Interviewer,people actually come to Twitter.
Dorsey,I believe Twitter is best.
Interviewer,as an interest-based network.
Dorsey,People come with a particular interest.
Interviewer,They have to do a ton of work.
Dorsey,to find and follow the related accounts.
Interviewer,around those interests.
Dorsey,What we could do instead.
Interviewer,is allow you to follow an interest.
Dorsey,"follow a hashtag, follow a trend."
Interviewer,follow a community.
Dorsey,which gives us the opportunity.
Interviewer,to show all of the accounts.
Dorsey,"all the topics, all the moments."
Interviewer,all the hashtags.
Dorsey,that are associated with that.
Interviewer,particular topic and interest.
Dorsey,which really opens up.
Interviewer,the perspective that you see.
Dorsey,But that is a huge fundamental shift.
Interviewer,to bias the entire network.
Dorsey,away from just an account bias.
Interviewer,towards a topics and interest bias.
Dorsey,Because isn't it the case.
Interviewer,that one reason why you have.
Dorsey,so much content on there.
Interviewer,is a result of putting millions.
Dorsey,of people around the world.
Interviewer,in this kind of gladiatorial.
Dorsey,contest with each other.
Interviewer,"for followers, for attention?"
Dorsey,"Like, from the point of view."
Interviewer,of people who just read Twitter.
Dorsey,that's not an issue.
Interviewer,but for the people who actually create it.
Dorsey,everyone's out there saying.
Interviewer,"You know, I wish I had."
Dorsey,"a few more 'likes,' followers, retweets."
Interviewer,And so they're constantly experimenting.
Dorsey,trying to find the path to do that.
Interviewer,And what we've all discovered.
Dorsey,is that the number one path to do that.
Interviewer,is to be some form of provocative.
Dorsey,"obnoxious, eloquently obnoxious."
Interviewer,"like, eloquent insults."
Dorsey,are a dream on Twitter.
Interviewer,where you rapidly pile up.
Dorsey,and it becomes this self-fueling.
Interviewer,process of driving outrage.
Dorsey,How do you defuse that?
Interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, I think you're spot on."
Dorsey,but that goes back to the incentives.
Interviewer,"Like, one of the choices."
Dorsey,we made in the early days was.
Interviewer,we had this number that showed.
Dorsey,how many people follow you.
Interviewer,We decided that number.
Dorsey,should be big and bold.
Interviewer,and anything that's on the page.
Dorsey,that's big and bold has importance.
Interviewer,and those are the things.
Dorsey,that you want to drive.
Interviewer,Was that the right decision at the time?
Dorsey,Probably not.
Interviewer,If I had to start the service again.
Dorsey,I would not emphasize.
Interviewer,the follower count as much.
Dorsey,I would not emphasize.
Interviewer,the like count as much.
Dorsey,I don't think I would even.
Interviewer,create like in the first place.
Dorsey,because it doesn't actually push.
Interviewer,what we believe now.
Dorsey,to be the most important thing.
Interviewer,which is healthy contribution.
Dorsey,back to the network.
Interviewer,and conversation to the network.
Dorsey,participation within conversation.
Interviewer,learning something from the conversation.
Dorsey,Those are not things.
Interviewer,that we thought of 13 years ago.
Dorsey,and we believe are extremely.
Interviewer,important right now.
Dorsey,So we have to look at.
Interviewer,how we display the follower count.
Dorsey,how we display retweet count.
Interviewer,how we display likes.
Dorsey,and just ask the deep question:.
Interviewer,Is this really the number.
Dorsey,that we want people to drive up?
Interviewer,Is this the thing that.
Dorsey,when you open Twitter.
Interviewer,"you see, That's the thing."
Dorsey,I need to increase?
Interviewer,And I don't believe.
Dorsey,that's the case right now.
Interviewer,(Applause).
Dorsey,WI think we should look at.
Interviewer,some of the tweets.
Dorsey,that are coming.
Interviewer,in from the audience as well.
Dorsey,Let's see what you guys are asking.
Interviewer,"I mean, this is generally, one."
Dorsey,of the amazing things about Twitter.
Interviewer,is how you can use it for crowd wisdom.
Dorsey,"you know, that more knowledge."
Interviewer,"more questions, more points of view."
Dorsey,than you can imagine.
Interviewer,"and sometimes, many of them."
Dorsey,are really healthy.
Interviewer,WI think one I saw that.
Dorsey,passed already quickly down here.
Interviewer,What's Twitter's plan to combat.
Dorsey,foreign meddling in the 2020 US election?
Interviewer,I think that's something.
Dorsey,that's an issue we're seeing.
Interviewer,on the internet in general.
Dorsey,that we have a lot of malicious.
Interviewer,automated activity happening.
Dorsey,"And on Twitter, for example."
Interviewer,"in fact, we have some work."
Dorsey,that's come from our friends.
Interviewer,at Zignal Labs.
Dorsey,and maybe we can even see that.
Interviewer,to give us an example.
Dorsey,of what exactly I'm talking about.
Interviewer,"where you have these bots, if you will."
Dorsey,or coordinated automated.
Interviewer,malicious account activity.
Dorsey,that is being used to influence.
Interviewer,things like elections.
Dorsey,And in this example we have.
Interviewer,from Zignal which they've shared with us.
Dorsey,using the data that.
Interviewer,they have from Twitter.
Dorsey,you actually see that in this case.
Interviewer,white represents the humans.
Dorsey,"human accounts, each dot is an account."
Interviewer,The pinker it is.
Dorsey,the more automated the activity is.
Interviewer,And you can see how you have.
Dorsey,a few humans interacting with bots.
Interviewer,"In this case, it's related."
Dorsey,to the election in Israel.
Interviewer,and spreading misinformation.
Dorsey,about Benny Gantz.
Interviewer,"and as we know, in the end."
Dorsey,that was an election.
Interviewer,that Netanyahu won by a slim margin.
Dorsey,and that may have been.
Interviewer,in some case influenced by this.
Dorsey,And when you think about.
Interviewer,that happening on Twitter.
Dorsey,what are the things.
Interviewer,"that you're doing, specifically."
Dorsey,to ensure you don't have misinformation.
Interviewer,like this spreading in this way.
Dorsey,influencing people in ways.
Interviewer,that could affect democracy?
Dorsey,Just to back up a bit.
Interviewer,we asked ourselves a question:.
Dorsey,Can we actually measure.
Interviewer,the health of a conversation.
Dorsey,and what does that mean?
Interviewer,And in the same way.
Dorsey,that you have indicators.
Interviewer,and we have indicators as humans.
Dorsey,in terms of are we healthy or not.
Interviewer,such as temperature.
Dorsey,the flushness of your face.
Interviewer,we believe that we could find.
Dorsey,the indicators of conversational health.
Interviewer,And we worked with a lab.
Dorsey,called Cortico at MIT.
Interviewer,to propose four starter indicators.
Dorsey,that we believe we could ultimately.
Interviewer,measure on the system.
Dorsey,And the first one is.
Interviewer,what we're calling shared attention.
Dorsey,It's a measure of how much.
Interviewer,of the conversation is attentive.
Dorsey,on the same topic versus disparate.
Interviewer,The second one is called shared reality.
Dorsey,and this is what percentage.
Interviewer,of the conversation.
Dorsey,shares the same facts.
Interviewer,not whether those facts.
Dorsey,are truthful or not.
Interviewer,but are we sharing.
Dorsey,the same facts as we converse?
Interviewer,The third is receptivity:.
Dorsey,How much of the conversation.
Interviewer,is receptive or civil.
Dorsey,"or the inverse, toxic?"
Interviewer,And then the fourth.
Dorsey,is variety of perspective.
Interviewer,"So, are we seeing filter bubbles."
Dorsey,or echo chambers.
Interviewer,or are we actually getting.
Dorsey,a variety of opinions.
Interviewer,within the conversation?
Dorsey,And implicit in all four of these.
Interviewer,is the understanding that.
Dorsey,"as they increase, the conversation."
Interviewer,gets healthier and healthier.
Dorsey,So our first step is to see.
Interviewer,if we can measure these online.
Dorsey,which we believe we can.
Interviewer,We have the most momentum.
Dorsey,around receptivity.
Interviewer,We have a toxicity score.
Dorsey,"a toxicity model, on our system."
Interviewer,that can actually measure.
Dorsey,whether you are likely to walk away.
Interviewer,from a conversation.
Dorsey,that you're having on Twitter.
Interviewer,because you feel it's toxic.
Dorsey,with some pretty high degree.
Interviewer,We're working to measure the rest.
Dorsey,and the next step is.
Interviewer,as we build up solutions.
Dorsey,to watch how these measurements.
Interviewer,trend over time.
Dorsey,and continue to experiment.
Interviewer,And our goal is to make sure.
Dorsey,that these are balanced.
Interviewer,because if you increase one.
Dorsey,you might decrease another.
Interviewer,If you increase variety of perspective.
Dorsey,you might actually decrease.
Interviewer,shared reality.
Dorsey,Just picking up on some.
Interviewer,of the questions flooding in here.
Dorsey,Constant questioning.
Interviewer,A lot of people are puzzled why.
Dorsey,"like, how hard is it to get rid."
Interviewer,of Nazis from Twitter?
Dorsey,(Laughs).
Interviewer,So we have policies.
Dorsey,around violent extremist groups.
Interviewer,and the majority of our work.
Dorsey,and our terms of service.
Interviewer,"works on conduct, not content."
Dorsey,So we're actually looking for conduct.
Interviewer,Conduct being using the service.
Dorsey,to repeatedly or episodically.
Interviewer,harass someone.
Dorsey,using hateful imagery.
Interviewer,that might be associated with the KKK.
Dorsey,or the American Nazi Party.
Interviewer,Those are all things.
Dorsey,that we act on immediately.
Interviewer,We're in a situation right now.
Dorsey,where that term is used fairly loosely.
Interviewer,and we just cannot take.
Dorsey,any one mention of that word.
Interviewer,accusing someone else.
Dorsey,as a factual indication that they.
Interviewer,should be removed from the platform.
Dorsey,So a lot of our models.
Interviewer,"are based around, number one:."
Dorsey,Is this account associated.
Interviewer,with a violent extremist group?
Dorsey,"And if so, we can take action."
Interviewer,And we have done so on the KKK.
Dorsey,and the American Nazi Party and others.
Interviewer,And number tAre they using.
Dorsey,imagery or conduct.
Interviewer,that would associate them as such as well?
Dorsey,How many people do you have.
Interviewer,working on content moderation.
Dorsey,to look at this?
Interviewer,It varies.
Dorsey,We want to be flexible on this.
Interviewer,because we want to make sure.
Dorsey,"that we're, number one."
Interviewer,building algorithms instead of just.
Dorsey,hiring massive amounts of people.
Interviewer,because we need to make sure.
Dorsey,that this is scalable.
Interviewer,and there are no amount of people.
Dorsey,that can actually scale this.
Interviewer,So this is why we've done so much work.
Dorsey,around proactive detection of abuse.
Interviewer,that humans can then review.
Dorsey,We want to have a situation.
Interviewer,where algorithms are constantly.
Dorsey,scouring every single tweet.
Interviewer,and bringing the most.
Dorsey,interesting ones to the top.
Interviewer,so that humans can bring their judgment.
Dorsey,to whether we should take action or not.
Interviewer,based on our terms of service.
Dorsey,WBut there's not an amount.
Interviewer,of people that are scalable.
Dorsey,but how many people do you currently have.
Interviewer,monitoring these accounts.
Dorsey,and how do you figure out what's enough?
Interviewer,They're completely flexible.
Dorsey,Sometimes we associate folks with spam.
Interviewer,Sometimes we associate folks.
Dorsey,with abuse and harassment.
Interviewer,We're going to make sure that.
Dorsey,we have flexibility in our people.
Interviewer,so that we can direct them.
Dorsey,at what is most needed.
Interviewer,"Sometimes, the elections."
Dorsey,We've had a string of elections.
Interviewer,"in Mexico, one coming up in India."
Dorsey,"obviously, the election last year."
Interviewer,the midterm election.
Dorsey,so we just want to be flexible.
Interviewer,with our resources.
Dorsey,So when people.
Interviewer,"just as an example, if you go."
Dorsey,to our current terms of service.
Interviewer,and you bring the page up.
Dorsey,and you're wondering about abuse.
Interviewer,and harassment that you just received.
Dorsey,and whether it was against.
Interviewer,our terms of service to report it.
Dorsey,the first thing you see.
Interviewer,when you open that page.
Dorsey,is around intellectual.
Interviewer,property protection.
Dorsey,You scroll down and you get to.
Interviewer,"abuse, harassment."
Dorsey,and everything else.
Interviewer,that you might be experiencing.
Dorsey,So I don't know how that happened.
Interviewer,over the company's history.
Dorsey,but we put that above.
Interviewer,the thing that people want.
Dorsey,the most information on.
Interviewer,and to actually act on.
Dorsey,And just our ordering shows the world.
Interviewer,what we believed was important.
Dorsey,So we're changing all that.
Interviewer,We're ordering it the right way.
Dorsey,but we're also simplifying the rules.
Interviewer,so that they're human-readable.
Dorsey,so that people can actually.
Interviewer,understand themselves.
Dorsey,when something is against our terms.
Interviewer,and when something is not.
Dorsey,And then we're making.
Interviewer,"again, our big focus is on removing."
Dorsey,the burden of work from the victims.
Interviewer,So that means push more.
Dorsey,towards technology.
Interviewer,rather than humans doing the work.
Dorsey,that means the humans receiving the abuse.
Interviewer,and also the humans.
Dorsey,having to review that work.
Interviewer,So we want to make sure.
Dorsey,that we're not just encouraging more work.
Interviewer,around something.
Dorsey,"that's super, super negative."
Interviewer,and we want to have a good balance.
Dorsey,between the technology.
Interviewer,and where humans can actually be creative.
Dorsey,which is the judgment of the rules.
Interviewer,and not just all the mechanical stuff.
Dorsey,of finding and reporting them.
Interviewer,So that's how we think about it.
Dorsey,I'm curious to dig in more.
Interviewer,about what you said.
Dorsey,"I mean, I love that you said."
Interviewer,you are looking for ways.
Dorsey,to re-tweak the fundamental.
Interviewer,design of the system.
Dorsey,to discourage some of the reactive.
Interviewer,"behavior, and perhaps."
Dorsey,to use Tristan Harris-type language.
Interviewer,engage people's more reflective thinking.
Dorsey,How far advanced is that?
Interviewer,What would alternatives.
Dorsey,to that like button be?
Interviewer,"Well, first and foremost."
Dorsey,my personal goal with the service.
Interviewer,is that I believe fundamentally.
Dorsey,that public conversation is critical.
Interviewer,There are existential problems.
Dorsey,facing the world.
Interviewer,that are facing the entire world.
Dorsey,not any one particular nation-state.
Interviewer,that global public conversation benefits.
Dorsey,And that is one of the unique.
Interviewer,dynamics of Twitter.
Dorsey,that it is completely open.
Interviewer,it is completely public.
Dorsey,it is completely fluid.
Interviewer,and anyone can see any other conversation.
Dorsey,and participate in it.
Interviewer,So there are conversations.
Dorsey,like climate change.
Interviewer,There are conversations.
Dorsey,like the displacement in the work.
Interviewer,through artificial intelligence.
Dorsey,There are conversations.
Interviewer,like economic disparity.
Dorsey,No matter what any one nation-state does.
Interviewer,they will not be able.
Dorsey,to solve the problem alone.
Interviewer,It takes coordination around the world.
Dorsey,and that's where I think.
Interviewer,Twitter can play a part.
Dorsey,The second thing is that Twitter.
Interviewer,"right now, when you go to it."
Dorsey,you don't necessarily walk away.
Interviewer,feeling like you learned something.
Dorsey,Some people do.
Interviewer,Some people have.
Dorsey,"a very, very rich network."
Interviewer,a very rich community.
Dorsey,that they learn from every single day.
Interviewer,But it takes a lot of work.
Dorsey,and a lot of time to build up to that.
Interviewer,So we want to get people.
Dorsey,to those topics and those interests.
Interviewer,"much, much faster."
Dorsey,and make sure that.
Interviewer,they're finding something that.
Dorsey,no matter how much time.
Interviewer,they spend on Twitter.
Dorsey,and I don't want to maximize.
Interviewer,the time on Twitter.
Dorsey,I want to maximize.
Interviewer,what they actually take away from it.
Dorsey,"and what they learn from it, and."
Interviewer,"Well, do you, though?"
Dorsey,Because that's the core question.
Interviewer,that a lot of people want to know.
Dorsey,"Surely, Jack, you're constrained."
Interviewer,to a huge extent.
Dorsey,by the fact that you're a public company.
Interviewer,you've got investors pressing on you.
Dorsey,the number one way you make your money.
Interviewer,is from advertising.
Dorsey,that depends on user engagement.
Interviewer,Are you willing to sacrifice.
Dorsey,"user time, if need be."
Interviewer,to go for a more reflective conversation?
Dorsey,Yeah; more relevance means.
Interviewer,less time on the service.
Dorsey,and that's perfectly fine.
Interviewer,because we want to make sure.
Dorsey,"that, like, you're coming to Twitter."
Interviewer,and you see something immediately.
Dorsey,that you learn from and that you push.
Interviewer,We can still serve an ad against that.
Dorsey,That doesn't mean you need to spend.
Interviewer,any more time to see more.
Dorsey,The second thing we're looking at.
Interviewer,But just on that goal.
Dorsey,daily active usage.
Interviewer,if you're measuring that.
Dorsey,that doesn't necessarily mean things.
Interviewer,that people value every day.
Dorsey,It may well mean.
Interviewer,things that people are drawn to.
Dorsey,"like a moth to the flame, every day."
Interviewer,"We are addicted, because we see."
Dorsey,something that pisses us off.
Interviewer,so we go in and add fuel to the fire.
Dorsey,and the daily active usage goes up.
Interviewer,and there's more ad revenue there.
Dorsey,but we all get angrier with each other.
Interviewer,How do you define ...
Dorsey,Daily active usage seems like a really.
Interviewer,dangerous term to be optimizing.
Dorsey,(Applause).
Interviewer,"Taken alone, it is."
Dorsey,but you didn't let me.
Interviewer,finish the other metric.
Dorsey,"which is, we're watching for conversations."
Interviewer,and conversation chains.
Dorsey,So we want to incentivize.
Interviewer,healthy contribution back to the network.
Dorsey,and what we believe that is.
Interviewer,is actually participating in conversation.
Dorsey,that is healthy.
Interviewer,as defined by those four indicators.
Dorsey,I articulated earlier.
Interviewer,So you can't just optimize.
Dorsey,around one metric.
Interviewer,You have to balance and look constantly.
Dorsey,at what is actually going to create.
Interviewer,a healthy contribution to the network.
Dorsey,and a healthy experience for people.
Interviewer,"Ultimately, we want to get to a metric."
Dorsey,where people can tell us.
Interviewer,"Hey, I learned something from Twitter."
Dorsey,and I'm walking away.
Interviewer,with something valuable.
Dorsey,That is our goal ultimately over time.
Interviewer,but that's going to take some time.
Dorsey,You come over to many.
Interviewer,"I think to me, as this enigma."
Dorsey,This is possibly unfair.
Interviewer,but I woke up the other night.
Dorsey,with this picture of how I found I was.
Interviewer,thinking about you and the situation.
Dorsey,that we're on this great voyage with you.
Interviewer,on this ship called the Twittanic.
Dorsey,(Laughter).
Interviewer,and there are people on board in steerage.
Dorsey,who are expressing discomfort.
Interviewer,"and you, unlike many other captains."
Dorsey,"are saying, Well, tell me, talk to me."
Interviewer,"listen to me, I want to hear."
Dorsey,"And they talk to you, and they say."
Interviewer,We're worried about the iceberg ahead.
Dorsey,"And you go, You know."
Interviewer,that is a powerful point.
Dorsey,"and our ship, frankly."
Interviewer,hasn't been built properly.
Dorsey,for steering as well as it might.
Interviewer,"And we say, Please do something."
Dorsey,And you go to the bridge.
Interviewer,and we're waiting.
Dorsey,"and we look, and then you're showing."
Interviewer,this extraordinary calm.
Dorsey,but we're all standing outside.
Interviewer,"saying, Jack, turn the fucking wheel!"
Dorsey,You know?
Interviewer,(Laughter).
Dorsey,(Applause).
Interviewer,I mean.
Dorsey,(Applause).
Interviewer,It's democracy at stake.
Dorsey,It's our culture at stake.
Interviewer,It's our world at stake.
Dorsey,And Twitter is amazing and shapes so much.
Interviewer,It's not as big as some.
Dorsey,of the other platforms.
Interviewer,but the people of influence use it.
Dorsey,to set the agenda.
Interviewer,and it's just hard to imagine a more.
Dorsey,important role in the world than to ...
Interviewer,"I mean, you're doing a brilliant job."
Dorsey,"of listening, Jack, and hearing people."
Interviewer,but to actually dial up the urgency.
Dorsey,and move on this stuff.
Interviewer,will you do that?
Dorsey,"Yes, and we have been."
Interviewer,moving substantially.
Dorsey,"I mean, there's been."
Interviewer,a few dynamics in Twitter's history.
Dorsey,"One, when I came back to the company."
Interviewer,we were in a pretty dire state.
Dorsey,in terms of our future.
Interviewer,and not just from how people.
Dorsey,were using the platform.
Interviewer,but from a corporate narrative as well.
Dorsey,So we had to fix.
Interviewer,a bunch of the foundation.
Dorsey,turn the company around.
Interviewer,go through two crazy layoffs.
Dorsey,because we just got too big.
Interviewer,for what we were doing.
Dorsey,and we focused all of our energy.
Interviewer,on this concept of serving.
Dorsey,the public conversation.
Interviewer,And that took some work.
Dorsey,And as we dived into that.
Interviewer,we realized some of the issues.
Dorsey,with the fundamentals.
Interviewer,We could do a bunch of superficial things.
Dorsey,to address what you're talking about.
Interviewer,but we need the changes to last.
Dorsey,"and that means going really, really deep."
Interviewer,and paying attention.
Dorsey,to what we started 13 years ago.
Interviewer,and really questioning.
Dorsey,how the system works.
