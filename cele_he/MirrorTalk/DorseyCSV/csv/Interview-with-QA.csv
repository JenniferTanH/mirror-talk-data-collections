name,line
Interviewer,So the format for today will be i'm gonna be doing a short interview with mr. Dorsey before we then open it up to.
Dorsey,Your questions from the floor so my first question is one that I asked you just ten minutes ago before I.
Interviewer,Realized i don't want you to answer what is the best thing about your job probably the best thing about my job is.
Dorsey,Just being able to see like the feeling you get when you are when you help create something and you actually see.
Interviewer,People interact with it and you see people use it whether it be you know in my case a program or a piece of hardware.
Dorsey,Or art when you actually see it on someone else's face and you and you see that interaction it's just uh it feels.
Interviewer,Electric so being able to to see people use our technologies and and to see our customers has been really something my.
Dorsey,Favorite is always when my my mom independently discovers something that I didn't have to tell her about and and.
Interviewer,There are two moments when the first thing is my parents were some of the first people on Twitter and we started.
Dorsey,With sms and my mom thought it was the it was the way to contact me and my family like she thought Twitter was SMS.
Interviewer,And she thought it was a private channel so she would and you can now search back to all of her first tweets and it's at.
Dorsey,Marsha dorsey you can search back to all of her first tweets and she was actually like yelling at my brothers and Jack.
Interviewer,When he coming home and all these other things and then she realized oh wait a minute this is public and then the.
Dorsey,Second time with with square is she her favorite coffee store and st. Louis Missouri some coffee started using us.
Interviewer,And she she went in and she she texted me she's like Jaka you know my favorite coffee store just.
Dorsey,Started using square and like i love when people just happen upon it rather than having to direct from my head go.
Interviewer,Look at what i made go look at what they did especially you know someone someone like my mom so it's always uh that's.
Dorsey,Probably the best part of the day is seeing how people seeing how people use it okay and with regards to kind of your.
Interviewer,Early career i read somewhere that one of the main inspirations for Twitter was um.
Dorsey,Taxi systems and how they have very short you know messages to convey where they are is that true yeah yeah I really.
Interviewer,Missed the boat on creating goober but i was a huge huge into dispatch and the reason why is and playing again back to.
Dorsey,My parents my parents i'm from st. louis Missouri st. Louis Missouri how many of you have been there st. Louis so st..
Interviewer,Louis has has had a has had a tough history and so in the 40s 50s and 60s a lot of people left the city and moved.
Dorsey,Out to the suburbs and my parents are always stood by the city and the metropolitan area is about 4 million.
Interviewer,"People and the city has dwindled down to about 350,000 people and it's extremely segregated North and South lines its."
Dorsey,Highest highest homicide per capita in the country we switch with Detroit and DC does those three usually but my.
Interviewer,Parents they grew up in the city they loved the city and you know for me it developed this obsession and fascination.
Dorsey,With cities as well and the way that really manifested for me for maps I was just obsessed with with maps and I would.
Interviewer,Get lost and i'm constantly just wondering what was happening at this particular intersection or what was you.
Dorsey,Know down the street whatnot and i had tons of maps of st. Louis and tons of maps of my other favorite city they had.
Interviewer,Never been to which is new york city my parents also had a police scanner always in a CB radio so we lived right next to.
Dorsey,The highway and I would always listen to the trucks and the and the police and fire trucks and.
Interviewer,The ambulances and eventually my parents got a IBM PC jr. and a Macintosh and I would actually take the information from.
Dorsey,The police scanner and plot it out on my paper maps I could actually watch the police cars move because there is.
Interviewer,Reporting where they are and where they're going or what they're doing but little by little the computer became.
Dorsey,This thing that was uh was amazing because they could actually build a map on it and I can make those I could put.
Interviewer,Dots on that map and i can make those dots move and I taught myself just enough programming to make that happen.
Dorsey,And and that's always been my approach in my life as I've never really had a desire to become an engineer I never had.
Interviewer,A desire to become a ceo or start a company or be an entrepreneur I learned whatever it took to move me to the next.
Dorsey,Step to unblock whatever i wanted to do and for me I wanted to see the city in any way and the computer was was the way.
Interviewer,To get there so taught myself had a program in C and eventually I had these maps of police cars and ambulances that.
Dorsey,Were riding around st. louis all from the police scanner and then I little by little found public databases that were.
Interviewer,Accessible on the internet of of historical movements that I could program in and then I learned to when I.
Dorsey,Was about 17 or 18 that this whole thing I was doing had a name and it was called dispatch so I found the biggest ditz.
Interviewer,Dispatch firm in the world which just happened to be in New York City and it was called DMS and I found I found their.
Dorsey,Website but they had no contact information no way to get in so I was pretty good at computers at this time.
Interviewer,And st. louis had a pretty strong underground hacking culture and I learned a lot from it and I figured out.
Dorsey,A hole in their website and i found their corporate email list and found the name of the CEO and the email.
Interviewer,Of the ceo and the chairman and they sent too many mails saying your website has a hole in it here's how you fix it.
Dorsey,And by the way i write dispatch software and they flew me out and I I joined EMS and suddenly I was working on dispatch.
Interviewer,For all of new york city which was amazing because the thing about dispatch for me is you could actually see how the.
Dorsey,City is working living breathing how it moves but unfortunately in that case was from a very vertical standpoint in terms.
Interviewer,Of city services and and twitter really was born out of a desire to see it from a personal level if if an individual.
Dorsey,Could report what they're doing and where they're going and what they're doing next and we could see that all in.
Interviewer,Real time what would that look like and so yeah in my my uh what's my fascination and and career really.
Dorsey,Started in dispatch was just high transactional always available low latency systems over deep deep deep deep.
Interviewer,And in the background in many places that people just didn't consider Asiya and with regards to Twitter when you set.
Dorsey,It up alongside you know the other co-founders did you have any idea where did he want it to get where do you think.
Interviewer,It might go were you hoping it would end up we are I mean we didn't really have any any idea and and that's not why we.
Dorsey,Were building it we were building it because we wanted to it was it was fun and and it was something that we we.
Interviewer,Wanted to see and i had my dispatch background and I've had a blogging background and biz joined up at blogger.
Dorsey,For a little while when he was at google and we all somehow ended up at OU do have joined oh do and became CEO I.
Interviewer,Joined about two months after that and then biz joins two months after that and the funny thing about that was no one.
Dorsey,There really cared about what we were building which was podcast and we just had no passion for it and.
Interviewer,That the business was not doing well the direction was was fairly weak so we we often went out and just thought about.
Dorsey,You know what what would we do and what would we want to work on and we had these these hack days where we would.
Interviewer,Actually try to implement some of these ideas and and Twitter was born out of born out or one of those but the.
Dorsey,Important thing about this we just had this amazing team but the wrong initial idea and when you have amazing people.
Interviewer,And really creative people you'll come up with something and and and really the desire was just to build something that.
Dorsey,We wanted to use on a on a daily basis and it resonated with us every day and and we were fortunate and that it.
Interviewer,Resonated with others too but there was no particular design or desire or goal around its success and I think it's very.
Dorsey,Hard to start with that as a as a barrier because it it ends up blocking the creativity ultimately from mine.
Interviewer,Stunning you went to college for a little bit then dropped out obviously to pursue your other girls did your time at.
Dorsey,College have any impact on the where you are today or was it just something that got in the way of your real passion I.
Interviewer,Think everyone learns in a different way and I was I was deciding because of this fascinates from City Heights cities I.
Dorsey,Also had a fascination with with leaders of cities and and mayors and I was deciding actually when I was entering in.
Interviewer,University should i go with a political science program or should I go with the computer science program I know most.
Dorsey,People don't compare the two but i did and I decided ultimately go down the computer science route because I imagine.
Interviewer,That if i went down political science and I went down the route of of trying to be a Marin to get into politics that.
Dorsey,I could write a law or a rule and i could probably see the effects of it within two to four to maybe eight years.
Interviewer,Whereas i could write rules and laws in a program and model it and see it within see the result of it within eight.
Dorsey,Seconds so the speed was quite attractive and and just this unbounded creativity and potential that's in front.
Interviewer,Of you when you when you program it's it's a weird feeling because um you you have this ability to just create.
Dorsey,Something from absolutely nothing and whatever you imagine you you can you can probably do and there's a real there's a.
Interviewer,Real electricity to that so in school i found that it was more driven towards an academic outcome than it was a practical.
Dorsey,Outcome in my particular program so i was learning a lot more I was at DMS when I was at NYU I was learning a lot.
Interviewer,More and moving faster than outside of the university then I was inside so I just decided that I'm going to I'm going.
Dorsey,To and the university part and just work on that on the external and get working on on what I want to build right away.
Interviewer,And i you know my my mom reminds me every week that I'd still have an opportunity to go back to school but I'm.
Dorsey,Learning a lot right now and i think it's a different answer for every single every single person and you have to.
Interviewer,Answer it only for yourself on that kind of point was it a really tough decision so you mentioned your mom and not.
Dorsey,Necessarily i don't know she still wants you to go back to University and was there a lot of pressure from your.
Interviewer,Parents when taking that decision or do you just go ahead and I'm more or less just went ahead and did it but they they.
Dorsey,Were not happy about i mean they come from a Catholic upbringing in st. Louis Missouri so my parents didn't finish.
Interviewer,High school and i was the first to even attempt going to college parents weren't all that well off so you know they.
Dorsey,Definitely had a lot of aspirations for me in that particular vein so there was you know there's a lot of.
Interviewer,Standard catholic guilt they couldn't went along with that decision but I got over it and I don't know if my parents.
Dorsey,Have and and he talked a little bit about politics as well and I read somewhere that your dream job was to be.
Interviewer,Mayor of new york city well aspirationally it was but I've realized that I feel like can probably.
Dorsey,Influence more with with these companies and I then I could actually being a mayor and I think that's generally been.
Interviewer,More and more the case these groups of individuals who are creating these technologies and creating these.
Dorsey,Movements and have just so much influence right now and it's not limited to any particular geographic or.
Interviewer,Political boundary and it's really it's really really exciting in that and that comes with a responsibility that forces.
Dorsey,You to mature very very quickly and again it goes back to like where are you learning the fastest and I just felt my.
Interviewer,My maturity and going down one particular route of life was was so much more accelerated than than another one.
Dorsey,And i think going down the political route and more of a mayor route I still love I I just don't think I'd be able to.
Interviewer,Do as much as i like and i i love my i love my freedoms and my my independence that would also be cut off so yes yeah.
Dorsey,Coming back to the companies you're involved with both with Twitter still as well as you'll see a square how do you.
Interviewer,Balance that is there ever a conflict of interest or just in terms of tying me how do you decide where the priorities.
Dorsey,Are well i am i spent a year where i'd actually did half and half and the intention was just to keep that to a.
Interviewer,Year and kept it to a year and that was really hard I started the week at square and on Monday and I would go to Twitter.
Dorsey,In the afternoon and then i would start Tuesday at Twitter and then there would go to square and that.
Interviewer,Junoon so i'd have this like snake through that felt like these you know 24-hour days at one company so i made it.
Dorsey,I made it work but it wasn't it wasn't the healthiest thing and now we we just have such an amazing leadership team in.
Interviewer,Place and and the potential is really in front of the company so I concentrate my time a lot more now on with our CEO dick.
Dorsey,So we have dinner every every tuesday night same restaurant same table usually the same food never the same.
Interviewer,Conversation which is always a good thing and then the food is good what is it it's a restaurant called Zuni yeah I.
Dorsey,Probably should not have given that name out but I did probably gonna have to find a new place now I'm sorry no that's.
Interviewer,My fault so i yeah and then i i just meet with members of the management team on Tuesday so I think there's actually a.
Dorsey,Lot of parallels between the two companies I think they're both working on something fundamental something.
Interviewer,Essential to a civilization and to humanity Twitter obviously working on communication and square working on.
Dorsey,Commerce both have been with us forever we commerce I believe actually was it was a predecessor we were trading goods.
Interviewer,And services before we're using language to trade stories and what's what's inching to me about both is if you if.
Dorsey,You simplify either one of them there's so much that's built on top of each that actually benefit and get easier for.
Interviewer,People and get better for people so i'd rather spend all of my time and my effort focused on the the lowest layer.
Dorsey,Of of what we have to deal with on a daily basis and I can't think of of anything more fundamental than.
Interviewer,Communication and commerce apart from health and education and obviously governance so I think all of those are.
Dorsey,On the I would always I would always choose to work in some dimension and in.
Interviewer,Simplifying those and so i see a lot of parallels between the two companies in that sense and that their fundamental.
Dorsey,And i also see that they both they both stand for a very clear purpose and they both stand for a leveling of the playing.
Interviewer,Field what was most amazing about Twitter was that we we designed it for for SMS so anyone in the world that had.
Dorsey,Access to you know just a shared or a five dollar cellphone could actually have a conversation with the entire.
Interviewer,World and you know someone with a with a five dollar Nokia could actually have a conversation with someone the $900 iPad.
Dorsey,And we see that almost every single day and it really makes the world feel small and we have we have some of the you know.
Interviewer,These really powerful individuals using the service and then we have we have the largest governments in the world using.
Dorsey,The service so you know they're both the important thing is they're both using the same tool and that means you know.
Interviewer,You're only limited by the are the quality and the influence of of your idea and and your ambition ultimately.
Dorsey,And it can scale back and forth quite quickly and we see the same thing with Square where we have we have people who.
Interviewer,Are piano teachers or golf instructors or doing something on the side using the exact same tool that we supply to to.
Dorsey,Starbucks and you know glow and and to Whole Foods and if we can handle the transactional capacity of a Starbucks.
Interviewer,That means that anyone who has that aspiration in the same way that Howard did could also use us to get there and.
Dorsey,And that means that because it's the same tool it truly loves Lovis a playing field my mother my mother owned a coffee.
Interviewer,Store when i was uh when i was 12 and you know she had a very very different ambition than Howard Schultz her.
Dorsey,Ambition was to provide a venue for the neighborhood to provide a sense of community in the neighborhood to sell.
Interviewer,Beans but tell me have three employees and those three employees happen to be me.
Dorsey,And my two younger brothers and she didn't want to have multiple locations she don't want to grow beyond that and I.
Interviewer,Find that to be very admirable and i think there's a there's generally a trend today where more and more.
Dorsey,Companies and more and more groups of people can actually choose to stay small and still have massive impact whether.
Interviewer,It's a deep impact like my mother in a community or a global impact like teams of six who can actually create something.
Dorsey,And and really everyone around the world can can participate in and then use it Howard Schultz had a very different.
Interviewer,Ambition which is he had a similar coffee store and he wanted that coffee store in every city around the world and.
Dorsey,I admire both approaches but it's a difference in an ambition and and what they want to do and I believe that.
Interviewer,Fundamentally the tools should remain consistent and and really get out of the way so that people can can meet that.
Dorsey,Okay just so you kind of continue on that so you talked a little bit about how Twitter is a great leveler and.
Interviewer,Indeed you can make it happen that they've been amazing things happening on Twitter and Twitter being useful things.
Dorsey,Like the arab spring the uprising coordinating the protest and then more recently there's been a lot of focus on.
Interviewer,Twitter trolls and some some of the negative abuse that can happen on Twitter do you see the company is having.
Dorsey,A social responsibility to promote a certain view or promote certain ideals or is it very much as you said just a.
Interviewer,Tool to allow people to interact i mean I think the main purpose of Twitter is to make sure that we let every voice.
Dorsey,Flow and i think it's really important for us to see every opinion and I think ultimately like every technology is just.
Interviewer,A reflection of of the world and what we want in civilization both the present and the future State so what we we have.
Dorsey,To make sure of though is that everyone who participates in lending their voice to Twitter and using Twitter to amplify.
Interviewer,That voice they feel safe doing so and you know abuse has has no has no part on on the service and we have a staff of.
Dorsey,Many that are dedicated to making sure that people feel safe and they can continue to trust the brand and the.
Interviewer,Service to make sure that their voices is heard everywhere in a way they want to be heard and also that they don't.
Dorsey,Feel threatened in any way but you know I I wanna I want to live in though I want to live in a world where I can.
Interviewer,Actually see all opinions because i think I think there's there's value in every opinion it's up to me to decide.
Dorsey,Which one is truly valuable on which ones or which ones I act on but if we were to take that away and and live and.
Interviewer,Very very sheltered ways i think we would we would take away a massive learning opportunity as well so I think.
Dorsey,The most important thing is to give people controls you turn it off you turn it on and I think as long as those and.
Interviewer,Those controls are intuitive and people know how to use them immediately people people feel great and trust and.
Dorsey,Trust the service and and when that fails or when it's confusing or when people are frustrated we've failed as a.
Interviewer,Company as well okay my final question on Twitter before we move on to square so then based on that do you have a.
Dorsey,Problem with things like isil using Twitter to promote the latest their video do you see that as being something.
Interviewer,That maybe twitter should draw a line on and you know close the site close that particular account down or do you feel.
Dorsey,That it would get a lot of retweets is it something that people deserve to hear about I think it goes again back to the.
Interviewer,Controls and i think um i think people should have the freedom to choose what they what they see and what they choose.
Dorsey,Not to i don't think it should be forced upon them I don't think it should be you know an unexpected surprise in any way.
Interviewer,I think they fully have to opt into it but the more we start adding bias or editorial to the service the less people.
Dorsey,All over the world trusted and i think that that trust is something that we've really worked hard to earn and and.
Interviewer,We'll continue to do more of that and be very transparent around those policies I mean I think the most important thing is.
Dorsey,Is to explain why something like that may still be on the service and and to also work with our peers to make sure.
Interviewer,That we have a consistent point of view around that but this is a reflection of the world today and this is happening.
Dorsey,And i would rather live in a world where at least we're having a conversation about it and we and we're talking about.
Interviewer,It because i think ultimately it allows us to move faster and in solving it and fixing it and addressing it if that's.
Dorsey,What we need to do okay now moving on you left Witter or I mean you left a CEO and most people would.
Interviewer,Have said that you know creating and founding one life-changing business is enough but you moved on to set up square.
Dorsey,Which has just been launched in the uk yesterday was it launched around the world yesterday around the world yes not.
Interviewer,Sure our cash register product around the world for free yesterday so those of people people in the audience who might.
Dorsey,Not necessarily know that a huge amount about square do you want to very briefly explain what it is that you do what's.
Interviewer,Your vision for the business yeah so five how many of you have have seen square good amount we have a lot of work.
Dorsey,To do but we have a lot of work to do with Twitter tear so I mean that that's one.
Interviewer,Of the reasons why you you keep keep working at this as a if it feels over just I don't think it's it's truly as.
Dorsey,Big as it as it could be so i think so five years ago I switched roles with my co-founder eV and he was chairman and.
Interviewer,Our ceo and i became chairman he became CEO and I reconnected with my second boss after my mother at the coffee store.
Dorsey,Which is a guy named jim mckelvey in san Louis Missouri and he became a glass artist and we we really loved working.
Interviewer,Together when i was about 15 16 years old and he was an engineer as well and we were talking about you know just.
Dorsey,Wanting to work together again and we didn't really know on what and then one day he called me in desperation and said.
Interviewer,I lost i lost i lost the sale of my glass art and he says you know two thousand dollar pieces of glass art and.
Dorsey,The reason he lost that cell is because he couldn't accept a credit card and the funny thing was we were both talking to.
Interviewer,Each other on an iphone so we have these like effectively super computers next to our ears and the guy can't close the.
Dorsey,Sale because he can't accept a credit card so why why is that and and we started asking why and we started.
Interviewer,Realizing while this industry is extremely complicated so it seemed like a very interesting challenge can we.
Dorsey,Build something that allows jim to accept a credit card and we we set aside a month to build it and we knew nothing.
Interviewer,About the credit card industry both of us were actually in credit card debt at the time we you know we we saw what the.
Dorsey,Credit card industry actually did to st. Louis and families in st. Louis we didn't really like the credit card.
Interviewer,Industry in many ways we didn't think it was fair but we recognized that buyers were using them all the time and in the.
Dorsey,United states and all these independent sellers and and the smaller folks really just had no opportunity to even accept.
Interviewer,Them so what it meant is they they ultimately missed a sale and they they missed an opportunity to grow or.
Dorsey,Opportunity for revenue and so we we searched on Google for how to accept credit cards we found rock-bottom.
Interviewer,Merchant accounts calm we signed up for rock-bottom merchant accounts calm and we started learning about well how do we.
Dorsey,Actually accept the credit card do we take a picture with the phone no that seems like a weird experience if I'm.
Interviewer,Handing over my credit card and you're taking a picture of it we looked at the 30 pin on the bottom of the iPhone and.
Dorsey,Turns out that has a huge license fee and we just didn't want to pay that and and then the interesting thing was.
Interviewer,Uh all these phones have a headphone jack on it and the headphone jack is also a microphone and if you probably.
Dorsey,Not for a lot of your cards but if you take out your credit card and you look on the back there's a magnetic strip and.
Interviewer,That made magnetic strip is actually the same technology that you would use in a cassette tape to play music in fact that.
Dorsey,Is an audio track and that audio track can be decoded into numbers and those numbers are your credit card number and.
Interviewer,Your expiration and if you actually play this audio track it sounds like a squirrel screeching like I don't know if.
Dorsey,You've heard a squirrel screaming but it's not a it's not a pleasant sound at all.
Interviewer,But if you if you swipe it through you actually hear that sound and you can write some software to decode that into.
Dorsey,A number and then you can send that number up to Visa and MasterCard you can check to see if there's funds available.
Interviewer,On it and if there are you capture them and then that goes into a bank account so we ultimately made a cassette tape.
Dorsey,Reader that plugged into the microphone jack of the iPhone and we swiped the cards through and that and the damn.
Interviewer,Thing worked and and we swiped this is my favorite company to pitch ever because I would go around to people and.
Dorsey,I would say do you want to see my new my new project and they would say yeah and I would say and give me your credit card.
Interviewer,And and they would say no i said well he and I can see what I'm working on and and then they would hand it over and I.
Dorsey,Would take anywhere from five to five hundred dollars or take $500 for the from the people who.
Interviewer,Gave me like black amex doesn't what not so and and the way we we pitched it to TV sees when we actually decided to.
Dorsey,Build a company and raise money was to see the pitch they would have to give me their credit card as well and we we did.
Interviewer,Something interesting i put all the b C's that I didn't want to work with in the first week and I met ten during the.
Dorsey,First week and all the vcs that i really wanted to work with in the second week and and the reason why is I wanted to.
Interviewer,Make all my mistakes in the first week and then just nail it in the second week in the last the last we see that we Matt.
Dorsey,Is the one i wanted to work with most which which was Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures and the price started very high.
Interviewer,With a hundred dollars and it went down to $1.00 with Vinod but it was um it was just uh there's a lot of fun we learned.
Dorsey,So much about the credit card industry and risk and fraud and we knew nothing about building hardware and we we.
Interviewer,Learned everything that we needed to to make it work in a month and it just started resonating with with everyone we.
Dorsey,Showed and and little by little we figured out how to actually build the readers and send them out for free and.
Interviewer,And then a funny thing happened in that we realized hey we weren't just building a credit card terminal but actually were.
Dorsey,Building a full point-of-sale and these points of sales around the world and it's a there's a reason that the acronym.
Interviewer,Is pos they are not the best systems in the world and people don't have a hold you know very high regard for for a.
Dorsey,Point of sale it's usually a effectively a calculator on on top of a cash box but what's what's interesting in the.
Interviewer,Opportunity is that there's all this potential data and insights that you can have around a business you can actually.
Dorsey,Bring back up to the seller to help them make better decisions around how to grow their business and some people decide I.
Interviewer,Don't want to grow my business i'm happy like my mom with what I have but a lot of people do want to grow the business.
Dorsey,And they just no access to any analytics around how they're doing most places that we.
Interviewer,That we found in america like coffee places you go in and you ask them a very simple question how many cappuccinos did.
Dorsey,You sell today and they'll have no idea and if they do know they were usually counting cups coming out of the.
Interviewer,Dishwasher or waiting for you know their paper cup inventory to diminish and it just seemed so simple to solve but no.
Dorsey,One's spent the time to do it so we ultimately have been working on for the past five years a really sophisticated.
Interviewer,Register that is in many ways on par or better with what a Walmart has in terms of running and understanding their.
Dorsey,Business and we give it away for free to all these sellers and that's what we we launched yesterday and made available.
Interviewer,To the whole world so anyone around the world can download this piece of software for their Android or their or.
Dorsey,Their iphone and and really see and understand their business and and you know hopefully hopefully grow that.
Interviewer,Business from it because we just believe so much in the power of the independent business and the small business to to.
Dorsey,Drive the global economy do you see this being particular focus you talked a lot about for example coffee shops in.
Interviewer,America but off the top of my head i can just think of for example in India we it's a place where there are there.
Dorsey,Aren't that many huge supermarket chains and loads of small businesses and nowadays there are so many smartphones.
Interviewer,Out there do you see this has been particularly helpful in places like the developing world or it's not really.
Dorsey,Something that you know yeah i mean i think it's less about we're definitely seen as a as a mobile payments company.
Interviewer,And mobile payments is one of those phrases that just means kind of everything and and therefore it means.
Dorsey,Nothing and and i think ultimately what it's about is is around commerce which is a very very simple activity it's a.
Interviewer,Exchange between a buyer and a seller and it has nothing to do with the payment device that's used to do that it.
Dorsey,Could be a barter it could be a digital currency it could be a credit card it could be it could be a paper currency.
Interviewer,But what's important is really accounting for that transaction that exchanger buyer because if you can.
Dorsey,Account for you can learn from it and then you can grow so I think that applies in in every.
Interviewer,Every market not just not just a market like the United States or in Europe but but everywhere because I think everyone.
Dorsey,Can make use of of insights and and the Stata and if they have access to it in an easy way where they can just flip it.
Interviewer,On and wow like I you know why am I getting all these sales at 3:40 p.m. and what if I.
Dorsey,Open you know an hour what if I stay open an hour later for the next two weeks what does that.
Interviewer,Actually do to my to my business turns out and increases my business by 20% we've had we've had sellers you know.
Dorsey,Look at that and and and and actually perform those action so now our job is to answer that question and direct them.
Interviewer,In that way before they even ask the question right and and that's a that's really exciting and and then we can also.
Dorsey,Build pretty interesting services like we we have we've we launched a service called square capital six months ago and.
Interviewer,What it does is we have this deep because we're building the register our merchants these companies are putting.
Dorsey,Their full inventory their full menu a list of all their employees their full business all their sales into this one.
Interviewer,System so we have this really deep understanding of how they're doing right we know their industry we know we know a.
Dorsey,Lot about where that industry is going so what we can do is after after a few a few months of them just using the.
Interviewer,Register which is free to download and free to use we can actually send them an email saying you know here are three.
Dorsey,Options were we're happy to announce that you know we we can extend you advance you capital and from these three.
Interviewer,Options it could be a thousand dollars it could be five thousand dollars it could be ten thousand dollars would you.
Dorsey,Like to you know get this advance of capital here's the price it's all fair it's all upfront you know exactly what.
Interviewer,You're paying for the capital and you can choose one of those and it goes into your bank account the very next business.
Dorsey,Morning and typically you have to go to a bank and get small business loan and that processes.
Interviewer,Six months to even a year in some cases and the way that this advance is paid is is paid and returned is actually just by.
Dorsey,Swiping their customers card a fee is extracted so just in the course of doing their business they're actually paying.
Interviewer,That advance back and and we've lent and we've advanced over seventy five million dollars in just six months to 15.
Dorsey,Thousand sellers and 85% of sellers who have taken in vance once take another one so there's an opportunity not just.
Interviewer,To build something that accepts a payment not just to build something that allows you to see your business but.
Dorsey,Actually can give businesses capital to grow their business in a very fair and up front and in a very rich rich way.
Interviewer,Okay my final question before we open it up to the audience how do you see square working with things like Apple pay the.
Dorsey,Introduction of nfc chips and phones or is it a competitor and things that even like Bitcoin I guess yeah I think our.
Interviewer,Philosophy has always been you know we're building this register right and we need to empower our sellers to accept.
Dorsey,Every form of payment that comes across the counter and whether that's cash cheque EMV NFC Bitcoin any other digital.
Interviewer,Currency that comes their way our sellers should never have to think about that they should always think about.
Dorsey,Making only think about making the sale and buyers should just have the the freedom to use whatever they want to use.
Interviewer,So if they want to use bitcoin they should be able to use Bitcoin and they should not the seller should not have to.
Dorsey,Think about what currency or what payment method they're they're using so we we started in the US we opened in.
Interviewer,Canada and japan and nfc has just never been large in those in those markets and I know that it seems counter to what you.
Dorsey,All experience because nfc is is growing quite quickly in the rest of the world but I always found the u.s. is really.
Interviewer,Behind and technology adoption masek adoption like even with Twitter it took us 10 years to really adopt SMS and mass.
Dorsey,You all had it for 10 years prior to to the United States and and we didn't really get it until 2005-2006 and the.
Interviewer,Reason why is it was the first time when you could send a message between the two largest carriers a text message between.
Dorsey,Two large cares which were verizon and singular because they both had different technologies SMS as you know as a g8 GSM.
Interviewer,Technology and verizon is cdma so we we never really invested in building an NFC reader because we're in markets that had.
Dorsey,No buyer adoption whatsoever of nfc so Apple could change that but what they've done is they've created a convenience.
Interviewer,Which is a chip that proxies a physical card and allows it to be read by an NFC terminal so we we certainly don't see it.
Dorsey,As as competition in any way because we're not building a phone and we're not building a payment payment device we're.
Interviewer,Building a register that accepts payments and and what that means is we need to build NFC terminal that that.
Dorsey,Accepts it and back to that philosophy of of making sure that ourselves can accept every form payment it's something.
Interviewer,We have to do we have a we have a product called square market that allows anyone who's using the register to flip.
Dorsey,A switch on any of the items in the register and it builds a web page for them that they can tweet out or put on.
Interviewer,Facebook or put it on their own their web page and people can actually buyers can actually use Bitcoin to pay with.
Dorsey,That so if if they've turned on the the ecommerce ID for any of those items bitcoin is an option for a buyer and we.
Interviewer,Get a small amount of orders from that but it was important for us to make sure that we're we're constantly testing.
Dorsey,Testing these new technologies and and you know our sellers are paying us to do that work and to be ahead of it.
Interviewer,Brilliant so that's it from me i'm now gonna move on to some questions from the audience hi why 140 characters.
Dorsey,It's a great question so there's two reasons one practical and one conceptual so the practical one first is that we we.
Interviewer,Originally focused on sms and and the web was really just a way to kind of archive and and see the tweets later on.
Dorsey,The web was really not a big part of the original vision because we wanted something Noah's there was real time in.
Interviewer,Life and you could actually feel and and it would buzz your pocket right you could actually physically feel it so the.
Dorsey,Other thing that was really important to us in working with SMS was making sure that we had a very simple approach and.
Interviewer,Simple experience and that simplicity met in that case that we would send one message that a message would not break.
Dorsey,Up and there was a limitation in sms at the time which was a hundred and sixty characters so I had a really really.
Interviewer,Cheap little nokia device and i loved the thing it was from a virgin and there's a prepaid phone and I wanted to.
Dorsey,Make sure that it worked on this thing and I had a great experience on it and you know that was a t9 keyboard and a.
Interviewer,Lot of you probably haven't used the t9 keyboards but I used them and I loved them is super fast and so we we took.
Dorsey,Those 160 characters and you know i also paid for every text message so we didn't want to we don't want to break it up and.
Interviewer,And and require you know to receive a text message to get charged twice for one for one tweet this was important to.
Dorsey,Me but it was also important to if we wanted to go around the world we could actually reach everyone in a in a.
Interviewer,Cost-effective way as well so the 160 characters we took 20 characters out for the username and we arrived at 140 and.
Dorsey,That was that but the conceptual side of it was we believed that you know this constraint inspires a creativity and if.
Interviewer,We really constrain the size of the canvas people might be more off-the-cuff and.
Dorsey,They might be more in the moment and that's really what we wanted because we wanted this to feel again very live and.
Interviewer,Just very very human and very of the moment and and the metaphor you know we use is like if I were to give you a red.
Dorsey,Paintbrush and this huge canvas that that just took up this entire wall and I asked you to go paint that canvas you.
Interviewer,Compose yourself naturally right because this is a huge canvas and you want to you you want to you want to do the right.
Dorsey,Thing you know that that's what it kind of goes through your mind but if I were to give you that same paintbrush and.
Interviewer,That same red paint and i'd give you a business card and I say make a mark just very quick to make the mark and and.
Dorsey,That's kind of the feeling we wanted was that everything you everything you write everything you tweet is a value to.
Interviewer,Someone and we wanted to make sure that it feels like you can just fire these things off very very quickly as if you.
Dorsey,Were you're speaking and and and someone the interpreter is going to devalue it and that's always been really important.
Interviewer,To us and you know in the in the early days of the service we we got a lot of we got a lot of heat for 140 characters.
Dorsey,And just how useless twitter was right and and people would would explain in a way that wow this is just a since it's.
Interviewer,Only only 140 characters you know all people are gonna end up doing is just talk about what they have for breakfast.
Dorsey,And we would share that so much like theirs and Twitter is just about what you have for breakfast and you know my.
Interviewer,Answer to that is well you know sometimes I do tweet about what I have for breakfast and most of the world.
Dorsey,Could care less and was probably offended because it's so not valuable to them but there was one person in the.
Interviewer,World that really cares and that's my mom and when she gets the tweet that I just stayed breakfast and one day for.
Dorsey,Breakfast and she's really happy because she knows that I'm still eating I'm alive and yeah and I had breakfast and.
Interviewer,She loves it so what i mean what's in thing about that is it's all up to who receives a message and who interprets.
Dorsey,The message and we can't we can't judge the value as it goes out we you know we have to leave it up to the individual to.
Interviewer,Really bring value to that message into that tweet and that's always been an important part of our philosophy Thanks.
Dorsey,What are some of the key lessons from your time at Twitter which helped and influenced the way you set up and.
Interviewer,Launched swear there were many i you know again I really had no aspiration to be a CEO or to be a leader in the.
Dorsey,Company or even create a company i just wanted I wanted to to build and use this thing and I was so excited about that.
Interviewer,And and and really you just learn whatever you have to you learn whatever you have to learn to make that work and.
Dorsey,And right now a company is just a great vehicle to spread an idea around the world and it allows an idea to to thrive.
Interviewer,But the idea and the purpose of our work always leads not not the company the company is support and that and the.
Dorsey,Businesses is oxygen not a to that idea so I think you when when you are tasked with then creating a company you kind of.
Interviewer,Want to you you you tend to or at least I did you grow up a little bit too fast sometimes and you try to put too much.
Dorsey,Structure in place or the wrong structure in place and that distracts you from you know really the work that.
Interviewer,You absolutely need to do and one of the interesting thing I did two big lessons from from that time number one was the.
Dorsey,Power of instrumentation the power of knowing exactly what's happening within the system and the power of transparency.
Interviewer,Within the system but also within the company so we would go down a lot in the early days of the company because we.
Dorsey,Just had no instrumentation at all it's like driving the car flying a plane and not having any sense of how fast.
Interviewer,You're going right it's extremely dangerous so we we just didn't know what people were doing.
Dorsey,With it how how the resources were being used and and ultimately it just crashed to a.
Interviewer,Halt multiple times and little by little we started instrumenting the system and we we built simple things that would.
Dorsey,Tell us what the system is doing or how people are using it and these seem like of course you build dashboards and of.
Interviewer,Course you you know you look at the data but you know in the in a moment when you're creating these things that's not.
Dorsey,What you put first it's it's often an afterthought and the biggest thing that that solved was we stop speculating.
Interviewer,About what was going on and we could actually point to what was going on and then since we could point to it we could.
Dorsey,Fix it and we had a ton of communication issues in the company at that time just that we wouldn't talk to each other for.
Interviewer,In some cases and and in like engineering sometimes we want to talk to operations and when you have those.
Dorsey,Divisions in the in the company the people using the service actually see the results of it right so any.
Interviewer,Organizational difficulty actually manifests in the service itself and that's just ultimately rude and selfish.
Dorsey,And you're putting your own your own mess in front of the people that are using your service or the customer so as.
Interviewer,We started instrumenting the system we had a lot healthier communication this is a funny thing because we're building.
Dorsey,A communication company and we couldn't communicate internally so that was number one and the first bit of code I.
Interviewer,Wrote for square was an admin dashboard so we could actually see everything that's happening constantly and then.
Dorsey,Number two is just how important it is to to really make sure that you're building the right team dynamic and and.
Interviewer,That means hiring great people who share your you know who share the purpose and share the vision but it also means that.
Dorsey,We're parting ways with people who who don't and and we had some people in the is a Twitter who were just you know not.
Interviewer,Not not not folks who really worked well together with others and and this was probably the hardest thing for me to do.
Dorsey,As a ceo in the early days i had to i to fire someone who had the entire system in their head and when you're faced with.
Interviewer,That you're like well i can't i can't fire this person because if I fire this person then the whole system is going.
Dorsey,Down and we can never get it back up and it took me a long time to do it about six months and that's you know a regret.
Interviewer,Actually but ultimately when i when i did it and I did it and you know when I when I was when I was when we were.
Dorsey,Parting ways i was crying and he was crying and then I went back to tell the company and we're only about seven.
Interviewer,People and i was crying and the company was crying and like it was at a very emotional period because we were also.
Dorsey,Under a lot of stress because we're constantly going down and now we just parted ways with the guy who knew how to.
Interviewer,Bring the system back up but something really interesting happened immediately after that all these new leaders and the.
Dorsey,Company emerged and actually we didn't go down and and we built we built a lot of great practices to stay up more and.
Interviewer,More so i think when you're just getting started whether it's a company or organization you try to get people.
Dorsey,Really quickly but you don't you don't edit as much and you don't really make sure that there's a great team dynamic.
Interviewer,And if you don't it can be really really poisonous to the culture and and ultimately will will block new ideas and.
Dorsey,New leadership from from emerging so constantly looking at the team and making sure that we have the right team.
Interviewer,In place is something i applied to square as well hi my name is Christian R once and thank you for coming to Oxford.
Dorsey,Today my question to you is what do you think more people in your position within the tech industry can do to.
Interviewer,Encourage women in tech so in your case you've invested in peak and you've also AM set up a female coding program at.
Dorsey,Square what do you think others in your position can do to follow suit well I mean I think.
Interviewer,I think doing it i i don't i don't think it's just women in tech but really established establishing more leadership.
Dorsey,In in our in our women and i'm really proud to say that like over over 54% of squares led by by women on my team so.
Interviewer,Our cfo our head of business and our head of engineering are all women leaders and they you know I think the.
Dorsey,Most important thing is to always establish a role model for who you're who you're really looking to become in.
Interviewer,Terms of your own leadership aspirations and and your own aspirations around impact so making sure that we're we're.
Dorsey,Really hiring for that and and we're hiring really great people to put them in those positions of leadership and.
Interviewer,We're and we're establishing that in the company as a majority of the company not a minority of the company is really.
Dorsey,Critical and and then and then talking about it all the time this is this is what we've done and and we're really.
Interviewer,Proud of it and we're doing more and this is what that looks like and we've invested a lot of time and effort and.
Dorsey,Resources into programs like girls who code who does an intensive seven-week program teaching girls how to engineer.
Interviewer,And program and we have our own program called code camp which we do three four day intensive for college girls and also.
Dorsey,High school women as well so i think it's you know just just doing it and making the time investing in it and and.
Interviewer,Setting the intent and and you know making sure the whole company knows that this is our intent and this is something.
Dorsey,That we believe in it'll just spread because everyone in the company will constantly talk about it as well and.
Interviewer,That'll spread around around the industry so we try to talk about it in in there's many ways and channels as.
Dorsey,We can with square you seem to have got lots of funding on board and it seemed sort of from the face of it that you're.
Interviewer,Very much in charge still in my experience that's quite hard small startup but big funds on board how do.
Dorsey,You go about attracting funding and then managing your investors after you've secured it I think the the thing that's.
Interviewer,Always worked for me is realizing that your your investors are first and foremost I always want to go to anyone.
Dorsey,That i want to work with with something to show and it was really important to us before we talked to any investors on.
Interviewer,The twitter side that we actually had people using the service and in in in some at some scale and on the square.
Dorsey,Side that we actually had a working prototype square we had really seven merchants when we actually went to raise.
Interviewer,Money but we had a working prototype that people are actually using and if people can't see it and feel it's very.
Dorsey,Very hard to sell and i don't want to just go and tell people this is gonna be the biggest thing ever.
Interviewer,I want to i want to be able to show that and have them feel it and walk away feeling that as well so that's first and.
Dorsey,Foremost is have something to show and so that they can actually feel and start making it a part of their story as well.
Interviewer,And feel like they have ownership over it and then second is the realization like I always kind of approach this is.
Dorsey,Like this is a this is a if if we take money from someone this is kind of like hiring someone that we can never fire we.
Interviewer,Can never get rid of right so that means do we really want to work with this person is this person going to be.
Dorsey,Someone that really pushes us pushes us in a way that we need to be pushed and and you can tell that very fairly.
Interviewer,Quickly in that first week of pitching square got a lot of people who said you know okay great we don't have any.
Dorsey,Questions we'll get back to you in about 30 minutes probably with with the term sheet and I said I don't want a term.
Interviewer,Sheet especially if you're not asking any questions because they asked no questions.
Dorsey,During doing the pitch and that means if if they're on our board that they're actually not going to be all that.
Interviewer,Constructive in terms of really asking the tough questions and making sure that we're you know we're not just in our own.
Dorsey,Bubble but they're looking outside that is the role of the board is to is to look outside and bring all their insight.
Interviewer,And wisdom to us so that we can help guide to guide the company and and that second week we got a lot of tough.
Dorsey,Questions and and that's what i love because I know if I'm getting tough questions in the pitch I'm going to get.
Interviewer,Tough questions in the boardroom as well and not just the boardroom but every week I mean if a node emails me once a.
Dorsey,Week about have you thought about this are you doing this and you know I know this person can I make an introduction.
Interviewer,Here and it's just very very useful so I'm looking for someone who I just love working with and I think you you have to.
Dorsey,Set a very very high bar it's not just about money or the firm it's about the individual that you're ultimately going.
Interviewer,To work with and people ask me all the time like you know what firms would would you suggest I go pitch and like.
Dorsey,Fine find the people that you really want to work with in those firms and if there's someone that really you know.
Interviewer,Just really resonates with you and you love and you love the idea of working with them focus on them and if it if it.
Dorsey,Test out to be to be the case great but I think you have to kind of treat it as like I'm adding this person to my team.
Interviewer,And square was um was a little bit different because one of the things that I stated to all the investors in the.
Dorsey,Board meeting and and and folks who might join the board is like look this is not going to be a stress-free company.
Interviewer,Like there are so much interest in in commerce and payments and there's gonna be a ton of competition in the future.
Dorsey,We're very early right now but this for me a ton of competition in the future and not a lot of people want to work in.
Interviewer,Payments because it's perceived as being slow and you have to work with these banking partners which aren't the.
Dorsey,Fastest moving organizations in the world and people are trying to steal money from me all the time.
Interviewer,So this is not a place that you know it's going to be stress-free so I need to know that you will actually have a.
Dorsey,Level head in times of in times of crisis because it's going to be very easy for us to see something and then.
Interviewer,React quickly and if we constantly react to something then we're actually building someone else's roadmap and.
Dorsey,We're not fulfilling our own vision and I want to make sure that we stay calm cool collected in that as a board and as.
Interviewer,An investor group and that you trust the folks with the most context to do the work and that is the folks in the.
Dorsey,Company and i just made sure that everyone everyone knew that and if they didn't like that then don't invest and.
Interviewer,And some people some people walked because that and that was great great for me because that meant I didn't have.
Dorsey,To deal with that later on you know i think social networking platforms have had the dual effect of attracting.
Interviewer,Hundreds of millions of people but also alienating many those who've used it and also those like me who never joined them.
Dorsey,Not because i never wanted to sort of enjoy the benefits that they offered but because of my sort of fears over privacy.
Interviewer,And you know my fundamental skepticism of sort of where technology is headed so what do you say to that and how do you.
Dorsey,Try to coax those people that the unconverted the the fearful but the ones who are equally as enthusiastic as you.
Interviewer,To to join sort of the global community whether online or personally thank you I think it's a I think it's a great.
Dorsey,Question and it's definitely a concern shared by by many I think the first and foremost we we say the word technology.
Interviewer,And we tend to put it on a pedestal and that pedestal makes it very abstract and then that abstraction makes it very.
Dorsey,Scary and we have to keep in mind that technology is ultimately just a tool and these are tools and we pick up the tools.
Interviewer,And we give power to the tools and and we can also take that power away from the tools fundamentally I believe.
Dorsey,That all tools and all technologies are really just reflections and mirrors of our desires as civilization our desires.
Interviewer,Is as a humanity and and ultimately i think a reminder and potentially even a crutch that we're already born with.
Dorsey,Everything that we need and i truly i truly believe that you know and you see this trend where we're moving from these.
Interviewer,Abstractions where you know before a computer would fill this room and now it fits in my pocket and maybe very soon.
Dorsey,Around my wrist and just 10 years ago the only way to input something was a keyboard and a mouse and now we're using.
Interviewer,Our fingers and potentially very very soon we'll be using our voice and and and and more of these these very human.
Dorsey,Aspects so the interfaces keep becoming more and more human and and and utilizing more of what we're born with.
Interviewer,And i think what what's important to me about about Twitter is that I think it's a closest thing that we have to right.
Dorsey,Now that we have to like a global consciousness where you can actually see the world in real-time and not only can.
Interviewer,You see what's happening from from a news level and from an event level but you can actually see how people think.
Dorsey,And feel about it and ultimately if we have more of that sort of activity and and the nice thing about Twitter is you.
Interviewer,Share as much as you want or you can just stop if we have more of that activity though we actually see how.
Dorsey,People live and what they desire and you know how they want to how they want to see the world how they want to change.
Interviewer,The world how they want to live in the world and ultimately I believe that that creates a potential for empathy and if.
Dorsey,We have more empathy in the world we have more opportunity to remove a lot of a lot of conflict so I think broadly we.
Interviewer,Can use these tools in a way to build more empathy around the world and that empathy can actually actually.
Dorsey,Has a chance to to diminish a lot of the conflict that we see in you know where we've also internalized but I I believe.
Interviewer,That we have the tools necessary to do it without these technologies as well and I think these technologies really.
Dorsey,Serve a purpose of reminding us of that and you know maybe in 20 years 50 years we will understand how to lock more of.
Interviewer,The powers of the mind in order that in order to do that when we're busy exploring space and we're busy exploring.
Dorsey,The the physical universe but but what really interests me is are the folks that are really exploring that the.
Interviewer,Depths of the of consciousness and how the consciousness actually interconnects and how it relates and I think.
Dorsey,Technology provides a model for that that might teach us in different ways so I think it's something to be excited.
Interviewer,About but it again goes back to these controls of how do I turn it off and how do I turn and turn it on and if that's.
Dorsey,Not intuitive or if it's not apparent then it's going to feel scary and if we continue to use these words like.
Interviewer,Technology or disruption or we don't explain that the why of what we're doing with these things these these are things.
Dorsey,To increase the amount of people who can participate and these are things that increased velocity of communication or.
Interviewer,Effort and if you increase velocity and the increase participation you get time back for more meaningful pursuits and I.
Dorsey,Think that's enough positive but we can also use the tools in a very negative way and we just we have to make that.
Interviewer,Decision it's ours and ours alone it's not the tools greatest inspiration I that that varies.
Dorsey,That varies a lot i think i think you always find role models for phases of your life and right now I'm I'm really.
Interviewer,Obsessed with this artist named robert Irwin I mean how many of you know Robert Irwin okay well he has a he isn't.
Dorsey,There's a book out about him which is an interview of his life and he's an artist and he he started as a as a painter and.
Interviewer,Then he started questioning well do i really need the boundaries of the canvas and then he moved to to light and then.
Dorsey,You know he made these these light sculptures upon walls and he's like well do I really need the the wall and then.
Interviewer,He started using you know just these massive rooms and he's just constantly questioned every single thing and I love.
Dorsey,People who who really are comfortable exploring this this this ultimate question of why right so you know why is.
Interviewer,The question that is just it's the easiest question to ask but it's the hardest question to answer right and.
Dorsey,That to me is is really you know the driving force and and and what how curiosity manifests is being able to.
Interviewer,Constantly ask the question why and doing the work to answer the question why and this is a this is a you know.
Dorsey,Sometimes a fun little exercises you take a your friend or your parents or or your nephew or nieces or brothers or.
Interviewer,Sisters and i would do this to my parents all the time like dad why is the sky blue as I well you know.
Dorsey,Such-and-such recession like well why like well you know because this and why and he's like that's just how God made.
Interviewer,It and it's just it's it's interesting how quickly people kind of go to Authority and then there's another route.
Dorsey,Where instead of going to authorities look well that's that's what we prove to science or you know that that is uh.
Interviewer,That's how the universe works or that's what you know this person said or that's what you know my boss said or whatever.
Dorsey,It is there's another course where we can say I don't know and if you're saying I don't know then that means that.
Interviewer,You're going to find out and and robert Irwin is someone who just constantly questions every single thing that he.
Dorsey,Does in terms of this that's why what like why am i painting in a canvas why is that I don't know and and then he.
Interviewer,Explores a completely different meaning so he's a he's definitely a current role model but I've I've had I've had many.
Dorsey,Many throughout my throughout my life Virginia Woolf is another one to whom I love and in terms of just her her prose.
Interviewer,And her writing style and just her strength and confidence and comfort with being isolated and in her work and her.
Dorsey,Art and you know just how how she lived thanks very much for coming today Jack I really enjoyed your talk my question.
Interviewer,Relates primarily to the branding of Twitter and you touched briefly on on some branding issues could you talk.
Dorsey,About a little bit how about how you came up with named Twitter and also the verb to tweet I mean it's something that.
Interviewer,Everybody knows regardless of whether they're a Twitter fan or user or not and to me it's very iconic and I think you.
Dorsey,Really nailed it i'd really like to know the thought process about how you got there yeah I I would agree with you I.
Interviewer,Mean i think um i think twitter is a is one of those brands now that has so much awareness around the world I think it.
Dorsey,Actually has more awareness or equal awareness to to coca-cola but unlike coca-cola it actually stands for.
Interviewer,Something it's not just a beverage no offense to coca-cola but I don't drink it.
Dorsey,But it actually stands for something to people because people bring the meaning to people bring their own purpose to it.
Interviewer,And people bring their own ideas to it and and they feel ownership over it as well so we uh when we were starting the.
Dorsey,Company we wanted something that really kind of expressed or had a physical manifestation you know because when you.
Interviewer,Received one of these messages and they were called updates at the time we didn't have the word tweet when you.
Dorsey,Received an update your phone would would buzz and we we just thought that was so cool that like you know you do.
Interviewer,Something virtually and it actually affects something physically that was amazing and it was just so cool for me.
Dorsey,As a programmer i could write one line of code and I could actually make business pocket buzz which is hard to.
Interviewer,Say and he's like whoa and takes out his phone and it's a message and I just thought that was so cool so we wanted a.
Dorsey,Name that really celebrated that and we came up with the word jitter and twitch and both of those words don't really.
Interviewer,Bring up the best sort of imagery right it's something you actually want to avoid so Noah Noah glass who started OTO.
Dorsey,And and and and and was formative in the early early Twitter days went to the dictionary and he found the word Twitter.
Interviewer,And it's actually in the dictionary and it was in the dictionary before the company and it means a short.
Dorsey,Inconsequential bursts of information and chirps from birds and we saw the definition were like of course I mean.
Interviewer,This is it this is what we do so we took that name and then like a standard web 2.0 company we removed the vowels and we.
Dorsey,Started with the name twt tr but we didn't do it just to copy like a Flickr or the you know the the web 2.0 trends.
Interviewer,We did it because we were text-based and in the United States a short code was was five digits and we wanted.
