available you know I'm saying like I'm

humbled right now I feel like I feel

like a kid again why do you why did you

become who you were why did I become who

I was um well I wanna do this you know

um I just loved hip-hop growing up as a

kid I just you know it was like like it

just it spoke to me more than any other

music I had ever heard before you know

from early like ice-t to

Fat Boys and then LL Cool J Run DMC

Beastie Boys and it just like I don't

know it was like I did I didn't I didn't

first first I was a fan of the music you

know I'm saying before I even thought

about rapping

hello Cool J was the one who made me

like first start writing rhymes and I

was like 12 13 maybe and it sucked you

know I wasn't good but like I had to

keep practicing and practicing pressed I

gave it up for a little while then I

started again back when I was like 15

and started being able to kind of put

songs together and then I just was like

I'm starting to I was never really good

at much else you know so I just I don't

know once I found out I was decent it's

something I just kind of focused and

just you know went for it I was in the

juvenile detention center and we heard

the I'm not a rapper still I was it what

the [ __ ] was that

yeah we heard on the streets in our

neighborhood but we never thought it'd

be on the radio yeah and it was on the

radio we like what the hell with that we

just all blown away yeah music was being

played on the radio yeah you know how

about the fact that rapper's delight'

was like a 7 7 some odd minute song yeah

who had a radio pleaded they played it

from top to bottom like it was so

popular off the hook mm-hmm and the

nucleus jam on it yeah don't don't

yeah I was like yeah I never really I

never really like got into rock and roll

or R&B or blues or anything like that I

just like I you know I've listened to

songs on the radio or whatever my mom

was listening to in the car but once

hip-hop came along I just felt like man

this is like I don't know I just was all

in yeah

hip-hop was can't even imagine me he

gave you cried yeah but being like

but the prototype of hip-hop at the

beginning of it it gave us cried another

our music people talk to it we talk with

being on television being in the radio

yeah yeah private yeah and it's a it's

also like it's just such a if you think

about like how hip-hop from the start of

it well I was there yeah and then it

just like oh you thought in the front of

every hip-hop club you got the [ __ ]

the hope of New York police station out

in front of the club yeah it was just it

was just and if you went to a hip-hop

Club and you're marked it was hell yes

even your neighbor you hardcore bebop

hip-hop and that's what the [ __ ] you

[ __ ] with those [ __ ] like that's

what they said you [ __ ] with them for

you in the neighborhood you [ __ ] with

them [ __ ] for but those those are

people all the criminals are thieves we

all listen to hip-hop the money makers

and everything the crew know the killer

the robbers know all the [ __ ] street

urchins we all listen to that that's all

we listen to and soon as we listen to we

enjoy it but we're spot where we are

surveying everything we're looking at

the people with the jury to coach the

clothes and look and then we're getting

ready to get them after the club is over

that's just what hip I was about all the

while all the thieves were coming there

they enjoy the music but afterwards oh

but we gonna rob yeah that's the hip I

was about yeah once break-in came out

the movie breaking and then Krush groove

and beat Street man it was like yeah I

just put it put the hole it put the

whole culture of hip-hop on the map in

an in an it in a place where you could

see with the music and I'm saying you

had the visual and you had UG you know

graffiti like that's you must say this

is my way out when you saw that I didn't

get good you must say this is my way out

when I started yeah when I started being

able to put songs together and I started

like you know figuring out like well I

might be almost as good as that rapper

you know I'm saying so I'm gonna keep

going and then I start you know just I

learned so much like I asked

how old were you when that started

hip-hop the first time I heard anything

my uncle Ronnie brought over a tape of

breaking the breaking soundtrack in a

hat reckless on it from ice-t once upon

a time a DJ's task was just a play what

more could you ask and I was no couth

cousin yeah yeah yeah

colors was hard yeah my uncle Ronnie

started liking rap before I did and then

he kind of introduced me to it and right

around that time I think yeah the movie

had just come out and I saw the movie

and I was like yo this is I love it

mmm and they just I don't know they just

spoke to me and the way that no other

music had spoke to me before understand

hold Ryu and he first started putting it

out there like started rapping or doing

rap battles well I had a weird

trajectory like I I was afraid like I

was afraid early on like 15 16 years old

I was afraid that to go into any clubs

or anything like that to say my raps

because I felt like I wasn't good enough

yet so I had to get to a certain spot

and then I was trying to like I was just

making songs and uh one day I got a call

from my boy proof and he was like yo you

need to come up to the hip-hop shop and

I was like what what is the hip-hop shop

and he's like yo just come to the

hip-hop shop write something come up

here and proof like I'm a proofing Ani

here he ranch it in Detroit wewe like me

and him came up together and we came up

together but he would kind of go do his

own thing and then I I'd be working like

a factories and stuff like that and

proof was out there like on the grind

and he started making connections and

then he met J Dilla slum yeah slum

village and a lot of the early Detroit

hip-hop that was like

exploding onto the scene like proof was

such a part of that and I got a chance

to when I went to the hip-hop shop I was

like what the [ __ ] he was like you know

I'll clear everybody out I'll have like

ten people right and you rap in front of

them and if they don't like you you know

they're gonna tell you they don't like

you if they if they do like you and they

[ __ ] with you in it you know so I went

there I said to rap I got some people

jumping around and [ __ ] and I was like

okay this might be it for me and then

that's when we start having battles at

the hip-hop shop hmm we was having like

a battle every couple months or

something yeah every every yeah two or

three months but every Saturday I would

make sure that I didn't have to work

till four o'clock because I was going to

the hip-hop shop every Saturday so every

Saturday for me was and this is early

twenties was st. Andrews Hall on Friday

night Saturday hip-hop shop Tuesday

evany showcase and then Buddy the

[ __ ] battle heaven and I Heath here

yeah I said well that's what happened I

started battling and then in the hip hop

shop the first battle that we had there

I wanted but what we was doing proof was

taking names and he was putting him in a

hat like you if you want to sign up to

battle you just put your name in the Hat

he picks a name picks another names

would be like bizarre verse b-flat and

then they go at it and it was you know

and then miiverse whoever I remember one

time I battled conniver who was in my

group d12 but we weren't a group yet a

battle yeah fine and and then I just

started like I met a few people that got

me out of just Detroit and I started

going to I went to like 97 scribble Jam

and I went all the way to the end and

then I lost to this guy named juice who

to this day is still a really good

[ __ ] rapper and I think that it's

he's so good that it's okay that I lost

to him you know I'm saying but the

trapper know this was uh this was

Cincinnati

yeah yeah the scribble Jam was in

Cincinnati that was 97 and then I from

there I met windy day and she put me on

her battle team

she had this battle team that was it was

an event in LA called the rap Olympics

and she put me on that team I went out

to LA and then started bad we got in

that battle at the rap Olympics

went all the way to the end and lost

again last dude

and I was like super discouraged I just

got evicted from my house had to break

in through the through the back of the

house the dude that we is paying rent to

he wasn't paying the rent with it so one

day we took this is literally the day

before I go to the rap Olympics that

that I can thank God for windy day man

because she played for my plane ticket

but that day were like what do I come

home from work me and my boy and we're

like what the [ __ ] all our [ __ ] is on

the lawn oh so yeah so on the victory

man and they decorated your [ __ ] lawn

with your furniture yeah and people was

rummaging through it from the way thank

you [ __ ] yeah yep so that happened and

then I had to break in to the back cuz I

had nowhere to stay so I had to break

into the house through the back window

which was my old window broke in slept

on the floor got up the next day we went

to the rap Olympics and and by the first

prize was $500 and not needed at $500

man and I lost and I was like I was

[ __ ] devastated and then his kid Dean

guy slinger walks up to me and he's like

he's like yo man you got one of those

CDs and I was like yeah and I kind of

just tossed it to him right and didn't

think nothing of it I didn't know that

Dean worked with Jimmy Iovine

so he gave it to Jimmy Jimmy gave it to

Dre and I'm back in Detroit now [ __ ]

right nothing like nowhere to go and I

get the call and I'm like oh [ __ ]

you know this is about to happen well

who's fast then theme fad did to you nah

did not yeah yeah nah but um I just

gotta say like III bro you you are like

a god to me like III bro you you've done

so much in your life man that's like

just so crazy to be the heavyweight

champion at twenty twenty years old

well you're not chopped liver yourself

I'm just saying what I'm saying no but

I'm just saying man like like I I don't

know it takes a lot to be the champion

like it takes a lot and and you know I

remember seeing the first like the first

couple fights when I was when I was

younger when you were first like

starting to really pop I had heard about

yo you were seen this guy Mike Tyson man

he's knocking [ __ ] out in ten

seconds late and the first fight I saw

was uh which was the first fighter so I

think it was Trevor Burbank man you

knocked him down three times with one

punch like like what the [ __ ] and ever

since then it was like it was like when

you fight somebody's getting knocked out

it's just a matter of what round you

know I'm saying it like they come from

humble beginnings you know I have to had

in order to be the champ I'll have to

add to get beaten a couple of times yeah

learn yeah yeah boxing is hard man it's

hard like I've been boxing for like 13

years just sparring just messing around

I mess around with Emanuel Steward

and he's the best yeah yeah all the

champions back then yeah Cronk Jimmy

that was just so [ __ ] a yes man

anybody was coming down here to see the

fighters and stuff yeah

down there he was the man back then yeah

man yeah he was such a nice dude and he

would come over he'd come over to my

house and we spar like twice a week he

bring his boxers from the crunk gym

I mean uh he won't man yeah and they

were really great fighters yeah this was

remember the amateur the frame for the

Olympic those guys were really grateful

yeah yeah man in an Emmanuel was like he

would this was like 12 13 years ago

right so he would he would come over he

would show me the basics and it took a

lot for me to look it took a long

[ __ ] time for me to just learn the

basics right so then he started like a

after a couple months of us doing it and

they were just like you know

up-and-coming kids and stuff like they

would you know didn't just you want to

spar with em they're like okay cool I

got a funny little story so he's

bringing his boxers and this is we're

probably like six months in and he's

bringing his boxers like every week

right and I'm getting my ass whipped but

I'm at least I'm staying with him right

I'm getting some good hits in I feel

really good about myself so one day he

comes over and he brings his boxer from

crunk and I'm in the house and I

remember like I was on the phone or

something so when I came out the dude

that he brought had his headgear on

right and uh and I'm like oh okay I

guess he's ready so I put my strap on my

headgear we're going at it he kicked the

[ __ ] out of me [ __ ] me up so after we're

done we go like three rounds right I

don't think I got one hitting after

three rounds he takes off his [ __ ]

head gear and I said man how old you

he said 14 I'm done yeah man um it's

funny when you said it cuz some fighters

just um they mature early they may be 14

15 they may be the best day ever being a

night

anymore yeah that's just how it is mics

with people they they mature they only

peak at a certain age I paint they're

looking my twenties and stuff

some people peaking at 30 some people

peaking at teens it's just I feel like

if you hit me I probably die like right

now like I still feel like you can I

still feel like you could get in there

and just [ __ ] people up wow I don't even

have them anymore they mentality feel

like I have to [ __ ] kill everybody

family and stuff yeah but I mean I still

feel like you still look like you could

punch a [ __ ] brick wall put a hole in

that [ __ ] yeah I saw recently we 90 was

showing me the video you did where you

was just [ __ ] around and you was

trying to show these dudes how - yeah

yeah and how you jump to the side real

quick jump to the other side like man he

could get in there right now and [ __ ] up

anybody well cuz they make this fight

you know you can fight at any age any

age fighting and fighting yes you can do

forever so you have to desire to do it

Fighting's all about Spears you want to

do you could do that in the age yeah but

it's like but but nobody nobody knocked

people out in the way that you did like

people people got knocked out by other

fighters but it was like when they got

knocked out by hew they got knocked the

[ __ ] out yeah that's how I looked at

every time I heard somebody knock come

out my life gets better yeah my life

gets better yeah and so I love hurting

people that yeah cuz my life is getting

better and I'm getting a [ __ ] girl

I'm getting imagine I'm getting the

plane I'm getting the boat I'm getting

whatever I want so hurt and is beautiful

and my perception of my life at the time

yeah but it's like to be a fighter

though it's like you got a it takes a

special kind of person it takes a

special kind of commitment you don't say

it's almost like you almost have to give

you happiness up to accomplish your

goals

right because you

when you do anything if you want to be

the best garbage can

collected in the way time you want to be

the best in the world at anything it's

gonna be disappointment

yeah a lot of competition and it's gonna

be guys that peak a younger age that

he's gonna blow you away with either kid

and then you're gonna do it I gotta

blows you away when he's old guy here

and then it's going to come to the time

when you're experienced enough then

that's me you know you start blowing

anybody's everybody gifts their time

yeah yeah but it's like you're right

though because like like from me rap is

like a 24/7 job and it takes a lot of

dedication right and you just stay sharp

with the pin and stuff like that but it

just takes it's a different kind of

discipline to do that you know what I'm

saying like and the end and the balls to

get in the ring and fight in the first

place that listen know why I hate to

have anybody gets in the [ __ ] ring

you just think about it as human beings

when fighters do we avoid all of our

life getting into a fight and that's

what a guy that every day of his life he

fights every day with life and we avoid

that [ __ ] yeah it's humiliating if

you're not on the right side and if

you're not fight and he's still went

intimidating yeah you're gonna get hurt

you know some people avoid fighting just

it's not normal people are not supposed

to fight building a structure to fight a

hand and I've developed the fight even

for boxer they break that's what we have

to wrap him up in everything is not

human beings are not designed to fight

yeah we do it all this just part of our

DNA to kill one another just DNA who you

are as part of a any form of murders is

a form of self-hate yeah you know I mean

you kill another person so it's just

it's just nicked me and stuff how you

feel about yourself yeah it's

interesting though it's like you know

boxing is just like a like coming up

when I was a kid I got my ass kicked a

lot I fought I lost I fought I won you

and I'm saying and it was it was a night

and there was a time it was a point in

time where I started getting enough

fights and winning enough fights that I

felt confident until I started learning

some of the fundamentals of boxing and

I'm like I don't know [ __ ] I know

nothing like we all believe in here that

if you get involved with boxing

it's a tough man sport boxing is not a

tough man support a tough guys gonna get

hurt in boxing I talk funny at the end

of the day yeah understand them this is

a thinking man sport only the smartest

one yeah

when you get a certain level yeah only

the smartest would tough guys man this

is not a tough man sport yeah no I shot

you look man I I also know you got a

heart so it's like you [ __ ] somebody up

and then feel bad later yeah and you'd

be late because out you know you'd be

nice to him after the fight like I don't

like I hate you during this fight and

then I don't hate you anymore and I

actually feel bad cuz you might die now

that's who you are that's know that's

our fear yeah right there with vicious

be ferocious to the fact that we've lost

before and we've been disappointing

before we don't want that feeling

anymore yeah

the foot the fact that took that we have

to go back to Brownsville you have to go

back to seven mile that's [ __ ] fear

that's our biggest fear to go back where

we started

yep oh yeah subconsciously that's our

biggest fear yeah I have to see those

people who we grew up with if I made it

and I [ __ ] up I'm back in DC yeah yeah

Milton Berle used to time I lost a fight

you know I was the president birthday

well tell you the press was you know

doing bad it's going back to Brownsville

you made 30 million dollars why are you

depressed yeah he is he's old Jewish got

these walks in and guys can't understand

why these guys lose the fight for 30

million 20 million dollars a night he's

crying yeah he is he'll understand if I

want to watch he never went to the

phrase if I wonder why two minutes is

what I usually I used to grab my house

in Beverly Hills right hey boy you want

to say you you said we really in this

really entertain your

you're emerging in rap we thought that

was beautiful everybody all

nationalities and everything we have to

we had to say you're the best you put

you put it down we watch you battle we

watching that battling but we watch you

them compared with the best we watch you

two songs with jay-z what you do all

those guys when you got really ill oh

thank you man yeah thank you you know

yeah one no sir they say yeah you saw me

before I didn't have all these awards

before but you see all these guns it's

worth before yeah oh yeah yeah before

all the weapons book marshal step in the

door yeah yeah yeah that was the biggie

song yeah you know [ __ ] him listen are

you conscious that you know you rapping

like Jamie do you know you gotta play

for you know you gotta put it down cuz

if you don't put it down people I feel I

may be [ __ ] on you I mean that's how

I feel

anytime I get on a song with anybody

it's like man if I don't try to like I

have to you know just having their

hunger still and trying to like like you

said it's not about it's not about the

money all the time right so it's like

when you when you lose a fight and you

get depressed is because your

competitive nature and your competitive

spirit its wounded right because your if

the reason that we started doing this

because we're not good enough for goes

in your mind not good enough

y'all better than me and the [ __ ]

kills you better than you you believe in

your head that you're God to you the

better whatever you believe you are yeah

yeah yep

hangover hey listen man I was just very

happy to do that I was like 280 pounds I

was on cocaine I was I was just doing I

I knew you had so I'm on the show and

iFit good night and it's 4,000 people

and when I think I'm a harbor they all

get up and they come to the stage and

he's gonna touch me and I don't know the

security is not run up I wanna run

that's right it's just overwhelming and

[ __ ] that people think that way about

you and in my mind I always had a little

selfish thing I said these people think

much about me they must not be [ __ ] why

would you think about me good I'm [ __ ]

ya know I went through a lot of that

[ __ ] too growing up as a kid and just

feeling like I wasn't good enough for

anything like whatever I did I just

wasn't good enough and yeah man it's a

psychological thing I think that once

you for for anybody who doesn't feel who

feels like that right like I just feel

like I'm not I'm worthless I'm not

nothing in this world

anybody who feels that and then find

something that they're actually good at

it's like I think that's that's what

makes somebody go for that so hard if

you know I'm saying yeah like I'm never

get it I was never getting nothing I'm

good if this you know most the most

successful people never lived in history

I megalomaniacs

but they got a little self-esteem yeah

nothing much about this stuff but they

think they're God in another hand to

write you know those are the most

successful people they're always

challenging that doubt yeah making a

doubt inconceivable that's not true but

they still believe is doubt right even

though they prove that it doesn't stop

them from succeeding but they still they

still challenged and it still bothers

them

they still believe there's nothing and

3me billions of dollars they still feel

they believed in that [ __ ] that's just

how the mind [ __ ] limit yeah people

also think to like money just buys

happiness and it absolutely is not the

truth you know I'm saying like you got

to be right inside otherwise none of

this [ __ ] means nothing no absolutely

have helped raise to that's kind of like

a daughter pretty much like a daughter

to me and she is 26 and then I have a

younger one that's 17 now so when I

think about my accomplishments late

that's probably the thing I'm the most

proud of you know is that he's being

able to raise kids you know most guys

like us successful and stuff that

suppose we have a kids are [ __ ] up you

know yeah they never had the life that

we hadn't ever struggled they never know

struggle without struggle there's no

progress

yeah and that's why they don't put grass

for their own struggle yeah yeah it's

definitely important to keep your kids

grounded when there's situations like we

have right it's very important yeah oh

hey brother thanks for coming in really

you got to get back to your shoot it's

all good man I'm I'm so honored you

would even think to do this man I can't

Mike Tyson man your [ __ ] in the

now it's an Internet listen let me tell

you something right I've been those

hammies I'm in the streets with um

all-star there

some [ __ ] in the tree and I remember

better - how Fortin Detroit but you know

I listen so and I'm from brown with a

similar to the tree what's the

possibility of you being a seven mile

from seven mile now you hear and I was

that how what's the what's the

percentage that that that's what I think

what's the how do a guy in seven miles

get out here how do you get out here you

don't got [ __ ] and you know a destitute

ya know how does that happen because

it's ordained by the universe me and

this guy man chenine went through a lot

of [ __ ] like when we were when I we were

kids ourselves right and we were still

looking when I met denying he had just

started making beats and we met do it

through a mutual friend IQ who was a

rapper who was actually on my infinite

album and IQ introduced us and then we

man we grinded until like he went

through a lot of this wheeling through a

lot of the same things together coming

up right so it was like we and we did it

together we worked the same job we were

roommates we had you know I'm saying we

lived in houses together you guys

success became because of your lifestyle

success and fame all that stuff comes

from lifestyle you know I changed my

lifestyle I stopped getting I asked top

three I stopped every dance a [ __ ]

girl I never had no girl when I was

boxing yeah I was too young I didn't

have a good time like 19 18 years old

you know but up that's all I focus on

that's where I didn't wanna dance wanted

to fight it all I did watch fights all

day just from a guy from 1892 now yeah

all day that's all I digger that's all I

wanted to be yeah that's all I knew I

don't know etiquette about fight baby

didn't you ask me about fighting I could

tell you how did it begin how did they

start I knew everything about fighting

yeah I remember what was there I saw a

documentary where customer I used to

make you he would call out numbers oh

yeah the woolie yeah like man I could

never live to do that that [ __ ] is that

[ __ ] was crazy yeah he was crazy but

yeah you know a lot of his father left

him because he's so overbearing and so

perfected and if you allowed to say you

have to be crazy to to be with this man

but I wanted to be the best so bad yeah

and only he could do it no way he could

know why the end there's no one could

inspire me like him I wanted those guys

I'm I'm a dark person I come on my dark

world so nobody sitting a white

[ __ ] no one can inspire me like

him he inspired me to be better than

what I was there's no way I was going to

be if I wasn't like Tyson

badass [ __ ] Brownsville Brooklyn

I still wouldn't have made it because

I'm that was just browse the book he

made me believe I was - I was the best

fight of the world ever produced

yeah but you did it oh yeah but you did

it and you were the best fighter yeah

but in life that's not a good way to

think and fighting this great but in

life is reckless

isn't that interesting yeah to be

successful in one field is disaster it's

in another field right yeah would you

you were great in rap but in life you

will kind of shake yeah oh I have an

eighth grade education I you know I know

the pressure or something

boom there in your face and the judge

people are judging you you gotta lows we

have a little weird self-esteem any

we're not people are judging the same

things about it and we get defensive and

we get defensively playing to their game

but still even though we do that this

gives us our attention and we get

reputation for being crazy and unstable

and drug addicts and stuff and then we

go through the whole recovery thing well

listen the best thing that ever happened

to me involved with the recovery

programs and I met great people but I'm

what am i know what i am i am i am a

relapse specialist you know I have to

relapse even for five years straight

then I relapse and my relapse is like my

real that starts with thinking or me

jerking off a lot of some

you know I know that's just dropped me

off looking at my porn that I saw

jerking off and did not start looking at

[ __ ] pregnant I look at people I

never thought about [ __ ] stuff who's

real close to me and that's just who I

am and I mean those are my list of my

habits and those are my flaws and [ __ ]

yeah oh the people around me man my

people think I'm [ __ ] nuts you know I

used to sorry for the people who are not

nuts at around you yeah you're not if

you're not crazy in this crazy world I

really feel sorry for you

yeah I think my circle of friends is

definitely somewhere in the ballpark of

my insanity if noticed be friends with

me how did we live in this well how do

we find our purpose you're born and most

of us are born [ __ ] in bad situations

everything why what's wrong with us

while we here mm-hmm

why do they put us in why do you why

we're not living like these people and

stuff and these people look down on us

and we were around these people these

people can call the cops on us and the

console and listen to us and listen to

those people yeah please don't say hey

I'm garbage of nothing my true life

showing me that I'm nothing and then you

run to somebody who you think is

certainly he tells you great things

about yourself and then you think you

agree because this great guy told you

creating the budget and then the whole

perspective of your confidence go to

another level proof

that's how proof was to me yeah man he

was uh he was a godsend to me because he

I know that I would not have made it

without knowing him because he gave me

like not I mean he he he co-signed for

me when I went to this shop when I went

to every show cuz he co-signed for me

everywhere I went and people respected

him his name meant something because

they respected him because usually crazy

listen when custo those South African

guys hey listen we have a black young

man this house he's our family you treat

him the way you treat us and he told

anybody around there all of the way

here's all these guys of power positive

this is

son this is the and look my head was so

bad he shoulda did he never told me I

was the [ __ ] that you're not gonna make

he always said I was superior than

everybody you know that trip he told me

I'm better than everybody reason why

those people bother cuz they're jealous

of you he never had put doubt in my mind

that I was [ __ ] up even though I

believe that he/she is shattered and be

me of my mind I thought of a demigod

it's crazy because that's the one thing

you needed the only thing you needed in

your life to feel like you was special

no that's how proof made me feel I'm not

like my confidence was so low I had such

a low self-esteem

I was just so good when I first met cus

and I saw the house imma walk up these

white [ __ ] then he kept talking

to me and gave me self-esteem and then

he made me want to be his watch if

anybody say their bottom I would kill

them I believe you hmm no I'm saying I

believe you I believe my mind just like

that anybody disrespected he me it made

me feel something he made me feel like

something I never felt before

and I said that if anybody disrespect my

was [ __ ] kill them yeah then together

that's how you show your love by killing

somebody or hurting somebody for

somebody

yeah I gotta ask you when you was going

into like them early fights right when

you first started coming up and you're

walking to the ring what like what that

what is that [ __ ] like really orgasmic

is almost like um like you felt delight

did you feel like part of you nervous

like tense but the other part like you

gonna kill somebody I'm not nervous I'm

scared I'm scared yeah cuz I'm a scary

guy because I've been picked up I'm

honest I've been abused all my life

people did anything they wanted to me so

I have natural fear I'm not being safe

yeah that's just my that's who I am

natural it's know it's in my life that's

who I am

so now I got it with this weird

self-confidence

violence and stuff so now I'm sadistic

and I'm afraid I'm gonna get hurt

yes animal now yes I was like I gotta I

gotta hit this guy

I gotta hurt this guy before he hurts me

I feel yeah and now I have to do they

have to do spectacularly for more people

want to see me do it again and more

people did hurt doing the most

spectacularly I heard them the better my

life would be yep and that's how my

mindset was that's crazy cuz love

hurting people other fighters he loved

breaking the ribs that I thought that

the chief ball he is loved he he is

wonderfully how people work under those

circumstances yeah and I just I just

never seen nobody like hit so hard

before like I don't like that's gotta be

something like like what is that like no

um and their credit for my punch in

speed but it wasn't my punches it wasn't

my punching power that it was the

accuracy and that fast so I got the I

got the punch here before the other

people does that the hard punches got

there you know sometimes the Harley

Foreman's a hard puncher but he has

pounds you hit you in the shoulder the

arm gonna [ __ ] you up I'm in some

precise and you hear me everywhere I

hate you the reason and normally I get

the right results most of the time yeah

it's like like the way you sit down on

your punches and when you throw those

hooks to the body and [ __ ] for the guy

don't see the punch to the punches that

knock you out
