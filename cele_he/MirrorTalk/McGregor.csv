McGregor,To do and how to approach this next time and I gained I was in phenomenal condition then I little slip up again.
Interviewer,And i'm just trying to find that balance and get motivated again and I'm looking for inspiration everywhere like I said I.
McGregor,Took great motivation from watching Nathan go out and do his thing and even looking at Nate and there's many things.
Interviewer,That were amazing about that whole performance for me for Nate but one of the most important one of the most ones.
McGregor,That stood out for me is the very first thing he said post-fight was the Nick Diaz army he gave a shout-out to his.
Interviewer,Brother and i hope his brother's down well I hope Nick is doing well a soldier of the game of the foot of the real.
McGregor,Fight game and he gave him respect straight off the balance where the fans love Nate that's why looking love and.

McGregor,I hope he has his business mind screwed on because he is in a position now where he could also make a generational.
Interviewer,Generational like i have and i hope the seed Atma and and these are the things that I'm just looking at taking.
McGregor,Motivation from to use in my in my game and to push me forward you don't sound Conor like a fighter who.
Interviewer,Is retired you don't sound like a fighter who doesn't want to fight anymore you sound as motivated as ever.
McGregor,But i miss him i don't ask you about your quote-unquote retirement because this came just weeks after the incident.
Interviewer,In miami so i'll ask a very simple question off the bat are you retired a and B if not why did you tweet that out.
McGregor,You know there's a lot you don't understand the amount the things that go on behind the scenes area sometimes I.
Interviewer,Just needed distance i'm like hold on I've rushed out you don't know most understand my foot was a balloon when I.
McGregor,Walked into that fight i've got all this footage backed up from that entire camp I broke my foot three weeks out from.
Interviewer,That for you and my foot was abalone i went and I broke I told my I told my leg the.
McGregor,Shreds before i'm in that's when someone for the company back-to-back-to-back non-stop like I build I built this hoist.
Interviewer,Can say he built this house i say lee I've certainly laid bricks and blocks down myself to this game and then when.
McGregor,So many things are going on backstage and between my inner team and then the outer team and then the business side.
Interviewer,But sometimes you just need to think up like step on you know but retirement I don't think I would ever retire from.
McGregor,This game i really never in my life i'll be fighting until the day I go out there's no doubt about it I mean it's.
Interviewer,Just the way it is it's in me it's blade in me and I can I will I will I will take it with me to the grave how did you.

Interviewer,To to be able to prepare for that because he doesn't want to have the rematch you know and whatever I just.

McGregor,There's no dispute at all we are all eager to get this back on track you know there was a stretch mid year where it.
Interviewer,Seemed like every saturday night a fight happens and there you are popping up on Twitter talking about you know the guy.
McGregor,Who just wants someone who's close to your weight class and again I was starting to feel like the fans were like.
Interviewer,All right you know we'll watch you fight anyone will watch you fight a broomstick you sell a million paper used by.
McGregor,Yourself yeah but they were like okay enough already like you keep teasing us it seems like and I was starting to get.
Interviewer,That sense from the vents why were you doing that why did you keep putting yourself in those positions and then not.
McGregor,Take a photo of the game watch it from the start to the finish I wants to prelim to the finish.
Interviewer,Come on that's why hey can i not can i not engage in the game why am i outlawed wait wait I know he's not spoken over a.
McGregor,Year yeah you know i mean why is this i love this game like this is this is my game I absolutely had I love it look at.
Interviewer,It everything that i've been talking about like even the guy always jumped and I don't wanted to say things up to.
McGregor,Help build their boost people i don't like it a lot of the things that's been connected to me the.
Interviewer,Holloway fighting they ever think i even had them party if there's so many things in the fight game that's been connected.
McGregor,To me that i've i've been speaking on but even though that things like watching the belts take place watching.
Interviewer,Specific rules happen and watching specific stylistic matchups take place this is what I love to do and what I.
McGregor,What i what i this is what i live for that is what I am a fighter forced he heard of me and I'm an entrepreneur and.
Interviewer,I love my aura i love my other game my games my businesses and my these are my lows but I'm a fighter for some.
McGregor,Farmhouse and i love it dearly you mentioned 80 years last weekend he wins he looks very good it sounds like.
Interviewer,You were somewhat inspired by his performance but I thought it was interesting that afterwards you noticed.
McGregor,The stance he come tight with his hands up high nice and early yes I know what I said he had to do that he had to do that.
Interviewer,Against anthony anthony also his land if you look at Anthony's style look at his style versus Tony Ferguson he should.
McGregor,Have got that win against tony ferguson but he almost blew it he blew it was he rushed the finish ended up and closed.
Interviewer,Guard end up tied up and the exerting his energy this is the things I have gone through in my career so I'm.
McGregor,Watching anthony closely also any thought wonderboy Thompson a lot differently he.
Interviewer,Kept a lot more patient he wasn't as reckless with his with his 360 flip kicks that if you catched him great but.
McGregor,You you must time them perfectly and Annie was a lot more patient although although Thompson was winning the.
Interviewer,Penalty caught him with that shot and look look what that it was in a phenomenal finish and then I caught him.
McGregor,The big fight with nate but then Nate is just a little bit more experienced like if you look at Anthony.
Interviewer,Is kind of laying and that stuff nate has they even landed a little bit more to the belt with me so Nate was just.
McGregor,That bit more experienced in there and just been able to understand that that bit more and that's where he came out.
Interviewer,With the win that's why i was interested to see what way the belt would take place.
McGregor,Who would implement this smoother and sharpen and and I felt mate would and I was good I was happy to see him do it I.
Interviewer,Thought it was interesting afterwards that he didn't mention you he didn't call you out he called that Jorge Maz.
McGregor,Vidal and moz vidal who had been talking about you seemed very interested in the fight and I felt like you were almost.
Interviewer,Being boxed out were you surprised that no one you know it seemed now that these guys weren't asking for you that mate.
McGregor,Wasn't targeting you next no no i do make Nate man come on no I already looked it was he spent almost 50 minutes.
Interviewer,In the knock together the damages own it has been in it was they were intense bouts REO.
McGregor,You know very very intense bouts but Nate is a crafty individual he cut he he opened up the deck he opened up the deck.
Interviewer,For him that's what you know nate is a crafty crafty individual Jorge horizon a to fight win streak at them and I.
McGregor,Can't against ready forgettable he yet didn't really have a great one in the lightweight division and he's on a two.
Interviewer,Five score streak and he was in it was a present in the arena Nate's a crafty individual would and I did not feel I.
McGregor,Was being box that i've done hi i box Nate out in reality so and we'll see what happens if the belt if the trilogy.
Interviewer,But if he does not want the chilis you've got no problem I don't blame him I don't blame him look at the dammit.
McGregor,Look at the fights look at the damage it was they were intense belt area but I thought does not matter like you.
Interviewer,Said earlier it does not matter now that's time for me to just get back in you know I mean I was over at all so I.
McGregor,Was i was ready to go against anyone and I was preparing for the end of July and this happened and that's it I'm still.
Interviewer,With it and accept it and learn from it and that's what I will do I feel like it's taking me back to when I throw the.
McGregor,Acl postmen there's our lobo post that whole sequence because I had to change my whole training methods into a much.
Interviewer,Softer approach much more aware of the body much less damage taken you want to see the footage we have aa real you want.
McGregor,To see the cam so i've gone through you know know me know that people holed up in hotel rooms waiting for me to call.
Interviewer,Them to come down have own schedule belts they weren't training sessions they were belts they were belts with.
McGregor,Crowds and attendance we have them filmed and this was in preparation for a belt why am I having belt in preparation.
Interviewer,For a belt it makes no sense so this injury is that the forcing me to just go back to that with the way I had.
McGregor,To when i had no when i had when i was on one leg and look what happened there and I won boat my world titles so that's.
Interviewer,The mindset i'm approaching this game with now and and using that previous experience as as confidence and and.
McGregor,That's what i will do and and to be clear Conor for that fight in July did you have in fact an opponent I'd heard.
Interviewer,Pettis i'd heard other names as well but did you have an opponent waiting for you or we didn't get to that point yet I.
McGregor,Believe it was it was leaning towards just engaging at that time but look if the game changes so quick.
Interviewer,Everyone just comes and goes it's a forgetful business it is a cruel cruel business our deal only for the amount of.
McGregor,Only for the the amount of history of may the amount of iconic moments that's happened in my career they would've.
Interviewer,Loved him to thrown me away discard me think of other people that haven't had what I've had that's that's.
McGregor,Gone through the trauma and the van der battles for the fans watch what we do before we do over the fans and for our.
Interviewer,Family and for the p for the people and then when it's all said and doing they just discard you when it's a cruel.
McGregor,Business but you know that's why that's why I'm how I was happy to see Nate bounce back and I was happy to see not.
Interviewer,Not just not just some parents back to bounce back with some business on his mind I know he doesn't want to go into.
McGregor,That i was listening to him talking about a CBD and he was like I totally want to get into it out or just to get.
Interviewer,Into that you need this here to hold that man wall so inside lane and I expected a game because the flight game.
McGregor,Is short and the gunner game is very forgetful so I was just happy to see it and I understand the business I mean I'm.
Interviewer,And it's not gonna be here forever all the whole be here forever I'll be always I'll be always around our deal you know.
McGregor,That there'll always be something and i will always be looking for something or it got to do with this game because I.
Interviewer,Love a dealer i'll always be invested into this game my son I'm training my son in the skills our marshal of all the.
McGregor,Martial arts that i've learned over the years and if he wants to run with that I'll guide him all the way if he doesn't.
Interviewer,Know or not you're not i mean i like this sport is my life this is what gave gave me this life and God blessed this.
McGregor,Life so i'm just i'm just eager to get back so let's be as clear as possible if the UFC came to today and said Conor who.
Interviewer,Do you want what do you want is it the winner of Habib Poirier which has been discussed in the past they're.
McGregor,Fighting in just a couple of weeks in Abu Dhabi is that someone else who does Conor McGregor want in his highly.
Interviewer,Anticipated return fight in the return fight you know I want my world title back I want that Redemption the camp was.
McGregor,Incorrect i learned so much on that and look no one known the commitment I had in that camp I know the performance I.
Interviewer,Put on you know i mean he ran away around that he ran away for that fortune and I really didn't throw sweet he.
McGregor,Didn't throw a punch he shot for the legs before he threw a punch the fourth round I should have been talking to herb.
Interviewer,He says he was talking to in the cage there was no whisper out of him until he ended up in the dominant.
McGregor,Position given reason the end up in that dominant position is like walked around with disrespect towards him cuz he was.
Interviewer,Running around the cage i switched off for that millisecond he got that a lucky shot.
McGregor,Even after he got the lucky shot although it was a beautiful shot even after he got the shot like bounce back.
Interviewer,Up and engage what did he do is shut again but whatever there's many great things that I can take from that and and.
McGregor,I can i can come back and avenge that but I'm not gonna wait around I'm not without whoever if you're asking me.
Interviewer,Whoever if it's if this thing goes in and does a toast and if Nate Nate if you Jorge horn oh what I don't know what.
McGregor,Sighs i don't i don't know what dana's talking about about soy's and all that I don't know what well I don't even know.

McGregor,Ferguson just engage he hall away rematch Aldo rematch there's so many belts for me Ariel so many and in.
Interviewer,Reality it does not matter hugh it's just about me getting back in I've been being who I am NOT a shell of myself not.
McGregor,A half committed i was almost if i had to say what I was I was too committed in there in the gym and not committed.
Interviewer,Enough outside of it the training sessions were too serious and then when I left the gym it was gone from my mind.
McGregor,I would go off into into the jungle and and and you cannot do that you cannot be half in especially in a game like this.
Interviewer,And i paid the price for it and that's it and although I had reasons and I had.
McGregor,Injuries who gives who gives a  what happened happened I know what I can do I've done it before.
Interviewer,I've done it before when i was doubted so I'm eager to do it again true or false you will fight again this year.
McGregor,It's hard to put it iii would say true i would say we can get that done I would say we can get that thrown like I said.
Interviewer,Yesterday i spoke to the surgeon about grappling I'm gonna begin grappling now I'm already in shape I have not lost my.
McGregor,Condition so i'm in shape i just need to sharpen up the grapple and just feel how to how to grip feels on the wrist and.
Interviewer,Things like that but i can punch fully so I would I would what do we now August come on I would say so I would look for.
McGregor,That yes for the end of the year and would it be fair to say that the the the prime option would be you know Habib.
Interviewer,Gets by poor that rivalries still seems very personal it still seems like there's a lot of.
McGregor,Heat there and it still seems like you think that you could beat hubby jump right in there no tune-up fight.
Interviewer,Just go back in there and try to avenge that loss yeah so even dull even area I dove in on one foot my foot was up alone.
McGregor,My foot was up alone you want to see it turn on me and my toes came out of the socket I got to come into the cage I'm.
Interviewer,Break their mic in the place the thing Bellino and i hobbled in there and walk them down and did not give two shits and.
McGregor,That was with a pod camp that was with a half committed camp there's no doubt if that's what's if that's what's there.
Interviewer,That's what i'll take but if not i'll take what I'll take whatever is there and there's plenty there like I just.
McGregor,Named multiple people you have alluded a couple times to your relationship with your longtime head coach John Kavanagh.
Interviewer,Sbg jim i've seen photos of you guys together but I've also heard the whispers that maybe you aren't as close.
McGregor,As you once were when you do return will it be with him by your side and could you tell us what's the state of the.
Interviewer,Relationship there john is there a genius at the game and having him in my corner is it is essential you know what.
McGregor,I mean i felt a little bit slow at when there was some lenders these interviews Conor Ontario and and it was one of the.
Interviewer,Things was i hadn't watched a fight back yeah no go when I hear that I was like I watch the fight back 888 times before I.
McGregor,Even got back to the house from the from the t-mobile Arena to the house i watch the fight I get about 800 times and to.
Interviewer,Hear that he has almost a void bank i was a little bit taken aback and then I've got to ask and I got a I need a why.
McGregor,He has to coach me i just felt a little bit hang on a minute you're not I me and maybe I need a way but look it's this is.
Interviewer,All i understand i understand that that my half commitment has led to these thoughts and these and this type of.
McGregor,Things so i'm just in the process i'm making them right and we'll get there we'll get there but I need John will be.
Interviewer,In my corner no doubt okay and i know that we are approaching the limit that we agreed upon.
McGregor,Do you mind if i go a little longer do you have to leave walk away Arielle it's it's an honor to chat here when I.
Interviewer,Appreciate your time and it's good to chat you again it is I feel like we're just getting warmed up it's like old.
McGregor,Times here i love it i know i know well hey well hey don't bleed and don't lock me away but are you here.
Interviewer,Make her mom listen what was that about I mean either are you serious I felt I know that I hear you but I feel ago I.
McGregor,Don't know i don't notice how much been going on at me so many teens coming at me I'm like hang on a minute I feel like.
Interviewer,I need to get my voice back out there a little bit and I just and I was get I was getting my for I was getting my.
McGregor,Fighting back out there and then i got sidetracked and then but look I'm in a good spot area this this is this is many.
Interviewer,Months ago this this everything and i just want to you know I want to make sure that I'm apologizing for that.
McGregor,Situation it's not that's not a good look at it's not who I am and I want to just get Boyd out and get on with this.
Interviewer,And show where i am now you're not i mean and move forward and move forward with with positive attitude on and a.
McGregor,Full commitment to the game several months ago Connor max Holloway took a trip to Dublin and it seemed like.
Interviewer,He was taking subtle jabs that you'd seem like he was looking for you what did you make of those pictures and the.
McGregor,Content that he wrote online and is that a fight that you are interested as well it's it's certainly a fight I'm.
Interviewer,Interested in young holloway i mean you saw it's not as easy as you think to move up a division and challenge the.
McGregor,Second world title you started with with young max and I taught him coming over and doing that was a little cheap.
Interviewer,Although get get get your money you know get if you're paid to come over and do this player brand that's that's afraid.
McGregor,Of me and afraid of what i'm doing with my you're not I mean that's okay but whatever it is what it is again this.
Interviewer,Does another moment i'm almost reacting to the bait and I hold on I need to just you know need to accept things but the.
McGregor,Way they are and that's it and but the Holloway belt is certainly about I'm interested in ever a lot of respect for.
Interviewer,Max i truly did we went to that issue that kind of just forgot forgotten about but I you're not I mean of a lot of.
McGregor,Respect for max and he's been through Wars McGann he's been rushed and rushed and roastin you know he's you know you.
Interviewer,Know it's just max is definitely up there topless and you know Wells is probably it's Frankie Edgar it's also.
McGregor,Out there right there at table list because he has similarities to kabir who runs on the back foot shoots on the.
Interviewer,Single leg i want these type of similarites similar belt and also Franky has been very respectful Frankie has.
McGregor,Always been respect he wanted to say he wanted to say one thing I want to tell my grandkids that I thought Conor.
Interviewer,Mcgregor one day and for me to hear i'll ask Dana for me when I heard that this was going back many months he said that.
McGregor,I miss staying straight away and said that's the flight to make and even though he.
Interviewer,Lost about the max in it in a closed belt and I don't care about that wins and losses in this game don't mean.
McGregor,Anything it's the stories we are all on the journeys we are all on that's what sometimes when teens got a little bit of.
Interviewer,Prayers and that doors here huh hit harder you know I mean but but that's alright well also when we can see.
McGregor,Something going well luke the nate situation it just makes me feel good animator you know just use it well we're.
Interviewer,All in it together at the end of the day it's a mad mad mad business we are in and that's it so there are many many.
McGregor,Fights for me to have and we look forward to them and when you talk about fighting for the belt next and wanting.
Interviewer,To jump right back in there i can't help but think of Tony Ferguson and Tony has been vocal since returning and since.
McGregor,Leaving the management team that you're represented by thinking that he has been held back and he feels like he should.
Interviewer,Have fought for the belt and i'm wondering if that's a fight that you feel and again again Tony's in order.
McGregor,Warrior tony is in order warrior i've got a lot of respect for Tony also I mean to say that he wasn't Luke Tyson.
Interviewer,And i stable he was not even competing for the world telling we had him on half a million show money Tony.
McGregor,Tony's wage we had tony tony was looked after and I stable all eyes all our fighters that would we have a strong.
Interviewer,Stable of fire so it was wrong of him to say that it was wrong of him to turn his back on that and I think you know for.
McGregor,Already and the team that worked out with him constantly and and helped build him up and fought for him I thought it.
Interviewer,Was wrong but tony's also in the mix we'll see what happens you still want Jerry you know buddy tony has that 12.
McGregor,Fight win streak and they can't even put a belt and all this stuff let's just see what happens now in.
Interviewer,September abu dhabi there's a lot of things there's a lot of things moving and shake and let's just see how it pans.
McGregor,Out okay just a couple boards you still want shares in the UFC is that still a sticking point for you it's not a.
Interviewer,Sticking point but i'd love i would love to be brought on I would love to be brought on what I'd love to be I'd love.
McGregor,To be engaged in the game i'd love to get look let's see we are in a great place at the minute and we are having.
Interviewer,Good good discussions and now that we know that I can grapple again and we can work towards our new arrangements I'm.
McGregor,Sure i've note that we can get there to where we were all we are all satisfied no doubt last month Connor was the.
Interviewer,5-year anniversary of your win over Diego Brandao one of the most magical nights in the history of this sport in.
McGregor,Dublin and there were a lot of things written about that videos that were resurfaced and you're in the midst of.
Interviewer,All this and i'm wondering somewhere in your home wherever you were at the time were you looking at this stuff and maybe.
McGregor,A little nostalgic for a simpler time for a time where you were on fire I mean we could not do anything wrong.
Interviewer,How did you react to that and did that help fuel you in this return as well of course I mean what I what an iconic.
McGregor,Noise for the sport of a sport and for the sport in Ireland it it made the sport in Ireland really what we it.
Interviewer,Catapulted it into the mainstream and it had nothing but good effects so to be a part of that and then to think of the.
McGregor,People that i don't know wait and i came up with of course I was sitting there nostalgic and again using it as.
Interviewer,Motivation and even the opponent i went to I know I'm not sure how many opponents I went to was supposed to be :.
McGregor,Miller i had a back and forth with : Miller on your show I believe and then was Diego I think was an the old girl.
Interviewer,And that was diego brandao diego was an amazing an amazing opponent the Brazilian people I have so much love and.
McGregor,Respect for the brazilian people there's so many Brazilians here in Ireland and even just the other day I saw cell.
Interviewer,Paolo's in darkness and with the amazon rain present like what tough what's going on here look I'm just I don't know.
McGregor,What's going on but i mean the a guy was a phenomenal opponent that I have a lot of respect for the Brazilian people and.
Interviewer,What an iconic moment am for it for the sport in our land then and I'm I'm just proud to be a part of it and I pray.
McGregor,Every day i pray for that whole situation out there I just pray for the clouds to clear or something I prayed.
Interviewer,And now we can put i mean a church point down and we got it together and billions were formed and the church was put down.
McGregor,And rebuilt now that we can put this out there surely we can we can fight this fire and clear the skies I mean sell.
Interviewer,Paulo brazil beautiful brazil is in darkness in the day I mean what we need to do something about that encounter you.
McGregor,Know we hear from famous athletes all the time I'm gonna be better I'm gonna learn from my mistakes could you tell us.
Interviewer,What you are actively doing right now differently than a few months ago to try to get back on track to try to.
McGregor,Not be in trouble anymore I'm half first of all I'm focusing on my family I'm a bit I'm focusing on my.
Interviewer,Family life i'm having and i'm also having a long hard discussions with myself daily discussions because there's.
McGregor,A daily thing i do not to get you know you could save the world at my feet I could eat a stomp on it or use it to.
Interviewer,Raise me up you know no means i'm trying not not to succumb to temptation I'm not I'm trying not to give in to bait I'm.
McGregor,Trying to be a family man and i'm working hard every day and these are the things I'm doing focusing on my kids.
Interviewer,Focusing like i said training my son in martial arts we moved into a new property and only only a few weeks ago.
McGregor,When we were searching a hard time to find them when I'm already we're very happy with it and I'm settling down with.

McGregor,Hoping to return later this year great to catch up with him after all these months without a doubt the most famous.
Interviewer,Fighter in the history of mixed martial arts there he was speaking for the first time since October in a interview with a.
McGregor,Media outlet he had not talked since right before that Habib nurmagomedov fight there is certainly a lot of.
Interviewer,Options for conor mcgregor upon his return appears to be in great spirits it has been a long time since I've heard.
McGregor,Him that motivated and that to return and I think that is music to a lot of his fans ears appreciate you.
Interviewer,Watching this sportscenter special one-on-one with Conor McGregor I'm Ariel Helwani thanks to Connor thanks to all.
McGregor,Of you for watching we'll see you next time good night hello everyone - Terry Oh Hani I just came here to thank you.
Interviewer,For watching our espn youtube channel it's the best you know what else is the best the ESPN app you can get highlights.
McGregor,Analysis all that stuff and more and if you want premium content and live streaming sports there's only one place.
Interviewer,For all of that it's espn plus  .
McGregor,You're going to walk like a dog in that octagon on Saturday night.
Interviewer,"I guess, lastly, for me, Dustin, this is obviously different. It was similar last time. It's getting kind of ugly again. Is this getting personal for you at this point?"
McGregor,"You're only a little b***h. Your wife is your husband. You're only a little b***h of a thing; a silly little hillbilly. Joe Lee's wife, Joe Lee's wife, Joe Lee's wife, you little b***h of a thing."
Interviewer,"Thanks, Dustin. Conor, I want to ask you the same. Conor, throughout your career, when something has gone wrong, you've always evaluated spot on and made the corrections right afterwards. You really did point to those low kicks and said how dangerous those were. In the time since, have you seen other issues or other challenges that he presents to you, or is that really all that you need to address here?"
McGregor,"This is my bread and butter. This is what wakes me up in the morning with fire in my belly. Errors to correct, tactics to prepare for. I've had a great camp, a great focus on the opponent's details."
Interviewer,"Conor, it's clear that the gentlemanly Conor that was in Abu Dhabi is not here this time around. Dustin's admitted, at fight number one, you got in his head. As you're sitting there right now, do you feel that you've been able to get into his head or under his skin again?"
McGregor,"I'm going to go through his head, put holes in them, and take it off his shoulders. That's the goal here. He's done here. This is it for him. This is the end of the road. Even after that last fight, ""Oh, I don't love this anymore. I don't love doing this."" He knew what was coming. He knew the smacks he took. It's on, now. Saturday night, he's getting walked around that octagon like a dog and put to sleep."
Interviewer,"Hey, Conor, just one last one for you. We think about all the things that you've accomplished in your career. Certainly, there's not a title on the line in this one, but what would a win in this trilogy series mean for you? What would this mean, as part of your legacy?"
McGregor,"It's beautiful. Another addition, another feather to the cap. It's what I love to do. I love to come in here, defy the odds, do the unthinkable, and put on a show."
Interviewer,"Thank you, Conor. Dane, just one quick one for you. I know that you were teasing some big numbers and big trends and were excited about it. As we sit right here, what can you tell us about the status of this pay-per-view and where you expect it to end up?"
McGregor,"It's garbage. Don't have that garbage up on my bleeding stage. Where's the proper 12, the real sauce, the real Irish hot sauce."
Interviewer,"Dustin, it seems like you have something to say."
McGregor,Good one.
Interviewer,"Another one for Conor. This is really the first time you've been in the same room with Dustin since Fight Island. Has seeing him in person now, after all the back and forth, on social media-."
McGregor,"I think he looks rough, to be honest. It looks like the wait is getting to him. I can see it in his eyes. There's stress in his eyes, a lack of sleep. You can see it. It's coming for him on Saturday night and he knows it and I know it. I'm going to love doing it."
Interviewer,"Dustin, same question. Is finally seeing Conor in person, after all the back and forth on social media, has it elicited any more emotions or is it still just business, as usual?"
McGregor,I see a corpse. I see a dead body.
Interviewer,"All right. Robbie, Barstool Sports, over here. Question for Conor. Conor, we know you left the kids at home this time. Are they going to be watching on Saturday night or are they not allowed to witness the violence you plan on delivering?"
McGregor,"The fight will be about 5:00 in the morning on Irish time, so the kids will be asleep. They'll watch it in the morning, when they wake."
Interviewer,"Conor, when people think about you, they think about the guy who apologized to absolutely nobody. Is that guy here today and will he be here on Saturday?"
McGregor,"An evolution of that guy. I'm better than that man, do you know what I mean? I'm out there evolving. I'm about to come on full circle and I look forward to showing it on Saturday night."
Interviewer,Dustin-.
McGregor,"That night was the single greatest performance in UFC history, widely regarded. The night I won the second world title in Madison Square Garden. This performance, on Saturday night, I'm going to top it."
Interviewer,"Question for the notorious Conor McGregor. You're already a hall of famer, your legacy is already cemented. Winning against Dustin Poirier, winning this trilogy fight, where does it stack up against all the accomplishment, beating Aldo, getting the Champ status against Eddie Alvarez. Where would this rank?"
McGregor,"My mindset, I'm back on the building site now with a hard hat, a  vest with two hammers on my fucking hands."
Interviewer,"Out of curiosity, did you finish the bottle of hot sauce that Dustin gifted you on Fight Island?"
McGregor,Didn't touch it.
Interviewer,"Dustin, question for you. Winning this trilogy, would it be more meaningful than winning the interim lightweight strap at UFC 236 against Max Holloway?"
McGregor,"Don't contradict yourself, Dustin, because the last time we were up here, you were giving us all a large one. Saying, oh, the title means everything. Yet here you are looking for the bread and the butter, you little fake c***."
Interviewer,"Then, this is the last question for both of you. Get your hand raised Saturday evening, how quickly would you like to return? Would you like to fight for the strap before the end of 2021 against ?"
McGregor,"Yes, we're going to fill out the Allegiance Stadium, the Death Star."
Interviewer,"Question for Conor. Conor, the say that game recognizes game. When you look at Dustin, does he feel like he's on your level? Do you recognize him as a champ?"
McGregor,"No, he's not in the same stratosphere as me. The man looks disgraceful up here. He looks frail. He looks frail at this weight now. I'm telling you, his head, his body, his frame, his eyes. That weight class is getting to him. I'm all the way, ready to go. There'll be no 155, there'll be nothing free given here. Everything is getting took here."
Interviewer,"Second question for Dustin. You entered the UFC as a young fighter. Now you're a wise business man. What's that journey been like for you to be entering the fight game, but now in the business game?"
McGregor,Your wife is your husband.
Interviewer,"Question for Conor. Conor, win or lose, do you respect Dustin Poirier no matter what happens on Saturday night?"
McGregor,"I don't give a fuck about him, to be honest. I don't give a rat's ass about him. He's Buster Douglas. He's Buster Douglas, is what he is and that's the way he's going to go down. He's going to be known for that. It was a fluke win and I'm going to correct it on Saturday night."
Interviewer,Does this Conor McGregor look-.
McGregor,He's not going to do nothing.
Interviewer,-that I can't pay attention to this fight.
McGregor,"Don't keep watch on me, because that little filly won't do nothing."
Interviewer,"Conor, right here. Conor, right down here. Conor, question for you. You have won exactly one fight since Barack Obama was president."
McGregor,Watch your mouth. I'll go down and smash your nose in.
Interviewer,"Hold on. Conor, as a fighter-."
McGregor,"I'll go smash your nose in and then I'll laugh. Then, I'll laugh."
Interviewer,Cross talks over the last six months.
McGregor,You little rabbit. I'll smack him.
Interviewer,Sent you to a place where time doesn't exist six months ago. We want to know why should anyone expect anything different on Saturday?
McGregor,"It's one more fight I won than your little sissy ass, you little fanny pad."
Interviewer,"Question for Conor. Despite your feelings towards Dustin, Habib, and Nate, do you still think it's important to have a strong rival to help you get better and establish legacy?"
McGregor,"Yeah. Fuck the whole roster. Fuck the entire roster. I see the way it is. You try and be nice to them, you try and help them out, but fuck them all now. It is what it is and that's it. I'm coming for all of them."
Interviewer,Question for Conor. I'm curious. You've been talking a lot about legacy. How much would a trilogy fight with Nate Diaz interest you?
McGregor,"It's for sure going to happen. It must happen. More than that, it must happen, it will happen. I look forward to the day."
Interviewer,Last thing from me for Conor.
McGregor,"Louisiana wasn't good enough for you, was it? You left Louisiana. It wasn't up to scratch to get you to where you needed to be, was it?"
Interviewer,"For Conor, what else do you feel you still have to accomplish? You already were a simultaneous two division title champ. What else do you have on your radar to accomplish?"
McGregor,"Strainers, scraps, fights. That's what I love to do. It's what I've been doing my entire life and that's it. More mega fights."
Interviewer,"Question for Conor. Conor, the lack of trash talk last time around made things easier for Dustin, he said. Can you regain, in an intimidation factor, after losing it? How do you regain a psychological edge?"
McGregor,I don't give a bollocks about all that. Lock me in the cage with him. You're going to see what's happening.
Interviewer,"TMZ Sports. Conor, congrats on making the cover of Forbes."
McGregor,Thank you so much.
Interviewer,How long until you're a billionaire?
McGregor,By the time I'm 35. I'm 32 now.
Interviewer,"35. Okay. You'll be 33 next week. Do you want the boss, Dana, to get you anything for your birthday?"
McGregor,"No, I have everything I need. I have everything I need."
Interviewer,"Thank you. Thank you. Conor, same question to you?"
McGregor,"I love it all. There's not one bit of it I hate. I love every bit of it, from the start, to the middle, to the finish, to gearing up, to right now, here at the presser, to the weigh in tomorrow, and to the fight on Saturday night. I absolutely love it all."
Interviewer,"Conor, history has shown when you are active, you are sharper. Do you think you'll look back on this five year stretch and regret only fighting three times in your prime?"
McGregor,"I don't regret nothing I've done on this planet, as long as I live. I love my life. I've done some incredible things and I've had an incredible career. Long may it continue."
Interviewer,"Conor, should we expect to check calf kicks this fight?"
McGregor,You'll pay to see that.
Interviewer,"Finally, Conor, I've watched all your interviews this week. It seems like you've been hesitant to give the official ""Mystic Mac"" prediction for this one. Can you go on record-."
McGregor,"No, I said I'm going to take him out in a stretcher. He's going out in a stretcher in this fight."
Interviewer,"What round, sir?"
McGregor,You'll pay to see that.
Interviewer,Thank you.
McGregor,Shut your fucking mouth.
Interviewer,"We not talking about being at the top one year, two years, three years, four years, motherfucker. 21 years!"
McGregor,You owe money.
Interviewer,"I do? Let me see the bag! . Yeh he was right, yeh, the bag got books and we gonna show you what the books look like. If you believe in yourself like you say you believe in yourself, bet your whole fight cheque, you b****!"
McGregor,"No fucking problem. Send the contract kid, it's done."
Interviewer,"Let me see what it look like, grab me one , let me see what it look like. See if this b**** want to bet this."
McGregor,"Do what you're told, b****. Do what you're told, b****."
Interviewer,"You know, you know. You know, I like you."
McGregor,You love me.
Interviewer,"You fucking idiot, you fucking idiot, that's the fuck you are. You punk! This your boss, you b**** ."
McGregor,Good one.
Interviewer,And y'all got the fucking nerves to believe in a fucking fighter that like to fucking quit? This is a fucking quitter!
McGregor,And you act 10.
Interviewer,"Hey he told me, hey. You see, I'm not going to go there. I'm a'go there in the last press conference, I ain't gonna go there right now. And we talk about females."
McGregor,"You don't even know nothing about true fighting. You've never been in there. You're against little boxers afraid. You're against a different animal here, Floyd."
Interviewer,"Shut the fuck up, b****."
McGregor,Shut your mouth.
Interviewer,Shut the fuck up.
McGregor,Shut your mouth. They want you off this stage. You're embarrassing yourself up there.
Interviewer,Yeh I'm going to keep this souvenir. Can I keep this souvenir?
McGregor,"You do something with that flag, I'll fuck you up."
Interviewer," I like you, I like you."
McGregor,"That's it? That's it?! There's about five grand in here! There's about five grand in here! F*** me. Just know, you do something with that flag you ain't getting this bag or this money back and I'm going to fuck you up on this stage."
Interviewer,Has your strength and conditioning changed any in prep for this fight?
McGregor,"It's exactly what it should be for this fight. I know the fighting weight  and I'm preparing for that the size, the weight, the distance. Last fight, I felt like I was in phenomenal condition but when the weight got changed, I had to eat up to that weight and I mismanaged it. I threw out the diet. I ate a lot and I over-trained. I attacked in the first round really went after him. But the weight was a factor... mine and his. He was breathing heavy and hurt pretty bad but he took shots well. Someone at my regular weight wouldn't have been able to do that. I wasn't as lean as I usually am and it affected my performance. I blew out my energy and just didn't have anything in the tank."
Interviewer,Which martial art is the best to start learning first?
McGregor,"To fight MMA? You need to learn striking and grappling, so you could start a lot of places. It's an individual thing what are you willing to put the time in to? I started out with some semi-contact kickboxing then went to a boxing gym. The skills I learned in the boxing ring footwork, power punches, working with both hands, good defense helped make me the fighter I am. But heavy sparring isn't always the way that fast, snappy kickboxing style is also important. I think you should train in everything, and I do that Capoeira, Tae Kwon Do, Karate. But you can't train in just one. I'm open to all styles of combat. You want to wrestle? I'll wrestle. My fight style is always changing and I keep trying to learn new sh*t, so where I started doesn't seem that important. Any martial art is really about dedication and discipline. I used to want to be a footballer. Even then I was out every night doing drills after dark. Then when I discovered combat sports, I became even more obsessed. I don't have more talent. I just work harder. That kind of attitude helps you more than anything whether you're in the fight game or on some other path."
Interviewer,How did you come up with the gorilla in a crown design for your chest tattoo?
McGregor,"Lots of people talk about tattoos and their special meaning, but for me it's just about how it looks. My gym's logo is a gorilla and I wanted to get something along those lines. I feel like I'm the king gorilla in the gym, so I asked for a crown. I do like gorillas the way they carry themselves, their balance and core strength. Animal movement fascinates me."
Interviewer,"How do you prepare mentally for an opponent you know has beat you once? Do you need to control feelings of revenge, or do you let them fuel you?"
McGregor,"This fight, any fight... it's always about your mental state. And I'm always in control of that. Losing was a tough pill to swallow but it's not that big of a deal. You move on. And in a way, I celebrate defeat because it becomes inspiration. How do you prove anything to yourself unless you face adversity? I own what happened the last time and I learned from it. That's a blessing, because what happened will never happen again. There was a lot of hate that came out of the woodwork after that fight. That's just fuel for me. There's a reason I wanted this fight again at 170 it's the same exact story, but will have a different ending. I'm facing the challenge head-on as always and I'm going to prove that I can dominate at that weight."
Interviewer,What do you wish people knew about how MMA fighters train?
McGregor,"Some people seem to think MMA training is all about lifting weights and sparring. They don't realize fighting is a mental exercise. The most important thing is mindset it's my belief that makes me stronger than any opponent. Even physically, the brain is what controls our movement it tells us when and how to move. You have to be mentally engaged at all times you visualize everything before it happens. I think about my sport all day, every day. I don't think of anything else."
Interviewer,"Which exercise, in the gym or out, do you think has been the most beneficial for you, and why?"
McGregor,"Physically, my most important skill is balance. It's not a single thing, but exercises that are about balance are most beneficial for me. I practice yoga all the time... planks, handstands, extensions. Martial arts is all about being loose, flexible and maintaining perfect balance and yoga trains for all of that."
Interviewer,You've mentioned that you potentially over-trained the week before the first Diaz fight. What have you learned about recovery?
McGregor,"The weight issue affected my training for that fight. Usually, a few weeks out, I'm cutting weight. That puts you in a particular state of mind. I'm rationing food, but also energy. I stay focused on fight-specific things and preserve energy for the actual fight. Getting up to welterweight, I was eating what I wanted 24-7. So nutrition was a factor. But eating like that also gave me energy to burn. And I was not disciplined about it. My training was just too much and not focused. I've never been one to over train or go too hard. I prefer constant, light to medium, intelligent training and I got away from that last time. That's not an issue now."
Interviewer,What adjustments have you made to your nutrition?
McGregor,"I'm doing what has always worked for me. I eat good food. I'm just making sure this time I get to weight in a more disciplined, performance-focused way not eating any sh*t food. If it had a face or grew in the ground, it can be on the menu. Seriously, my typical diet is good quality meat, fruits and vegetables fish, steak, chicken, quality greens, good carbs from vegetables like sweet potato. I stay hydrated with water or coconut water. I do like my coffee."
Interviewer,What supplements are you using?
McGregor,"I get most of my nutrition from food. There's no cutting corners and there's no supplement that can make up for a sh*tty diet. But when you train like I do, you need to make sure you're getting your nutrients, and you can't just be eating all the time. One of the things I use is a protein supplement BSN Syntha-6 EDGE®. It delivers a lot of high-quality protein but helps keep things lean. I don't want to feel heavy, even in the higher weight class. That hurt me last time. I want the weight to be lean muscle and the Syntha-6 EDGE® helps with recovery and muscle building without excess carbs, calories and fat. Plus, it tastes like a milkshake. People have made a big deal about some recent comments about my sweet tooth. I'm not eating any cheesecake at the moment, so the protein shakes are as good as it gets."
Interviewer,Can you give us a sample gym workout? Something you might do for strength or power?
McGregor,"There's really no standard day for me in the gym. It's always a mix. But for strength and power, I use a lot of free weights. I use them to build strength and balance at the same time with exercises like single-leg deadlifts and pistol squats. I do moves that utilize the full body, and bodyweight for power dead hang pullups, muscle-ups, burpees, handstands. Handstands with leg raises and lifts are great for core and balance as well. I'm also fascinated by animal movement and incorporate that kind of motion in my workouts like a lizard crawl for strength and agility."
Interviewer,Connor it's good to see you again it has been a while since we last spoke thank you for doing this.
McGregor,Good to see you ariel thank you good good to be on uh obviously different circumstances.

McGregor,Time goes goes by obviously the vaccines are being rolled out and this this type of thing so there's there are.

McGregor,It seemed like they were able to put on events in a safe and healthy way were you back home saying to yourself you.
Interviewer,Know there was talk a mcgregor card in july with no sports going on across the world that would.
McGregor,Probably do over 2 million buys people were speculating you versus nade fight island things like that were you.
Interviewer,Starting to get those competitive juices flowing and were there ever any serious talks about you coming back.
McGregor,A heck of a lot sooner than you are right now uh ariel come on man there was a lot of.
Interviewer,Talks about me coming back i was so eager to come back i wanted to come back the tuesday after the fight against.
McGregor,Cerrone i had that meeting with lorenzo and dana and you know the conversation was what's what do we.
Interviewer,Do now what's next there you know there didn't really seem to be what was the next belt we couldn't we.
McGregor,Had not got the answer at that at that dinner and you know it just didn't it didn't.
Interviewer,Come to fruition i was eager i was trying to get things moving.
McGregor,And it just didn't happen but you know with all the circumstances surrounding it the year and what went.
Interviewer,Down it just went the way it went and it is what it is i feel now you know i'm i have.
McGregor,Transformed my body into a lightweight frame again i've done it healthily i i'm full of energy i'm full of full of.
Interviewer,Vitality and i'm ready to ready to showcase myself at 155 pounds um at my absolute best and i'm very.
McGregor,Excited about that doing that also opens up many more options.
Interviewer,For me you know there's there's many uh lightweight contenders and you know there's many options i've.
McGregor,Even heard nate is coming back down to 155 which is an exciting one obviously you've got.
Interviewer,This box and escapades and things i think i don't think what happens what happened last year will happen this.
McGregor,Year and i've kept that fire going throughout 2020 2020 and i'm excited to continue it into.
Interviewer,2021. and of course i want to ask you about some of those options but there's so many unanswered questions about last.
McGregor,Year because it did appear like you were in great shape and ready to go and so could i ask you know.
Interviewer,Ufc 250 that night in june after amanda nunes defends her title you retire once again.
McGregor,Online could you explain now maybe some months removed it felt like it came out of frustration.
Interviewer,It felt like you you had just kind of had enough and you needed a break now that it's it's it's removed why did.
McGregor,You do that and do you regret quote unquote retiring you know i'll probably never retire from.
Interviewer,The game to be honest i'll always be although i'll be competing for a long long time yet so you know there's just.
McGregor,It is certainly brought out of frustration you know when you're trying to get these events going you're trying.
Interviewer,To get things moving and it's just not happening you're you're you're you're.
McGregor,Getting you know you're getting sh it felt like i was shelved almost you know i felt.
Interviewer,Like if i had been ran out a couple more times that year.
McGregor,Not only would my you know would my with my skill set and my sharpness everything be in tune a lot more.
Interviewer,We'd also be talking the goods of 800 million dollars in revenue toward for the company and you know it's just.
McGregor,It was certainly out of frustration but it is what it is the past is the past we're in a great spot now we've all.
Interviewer,I felt i felt like i've got what i needed to get off my chest and i felt like it's.
McGregor,It's been reciprocated well and it's come back you know there's the other side has come back as.
Interviewer,Well so i'm in a great spot and i'm excited to come back and that's what that's what we're at we're focusing on.
McGregor,The positive side of it and we're focusing on the future obviously the the next question that.
Interviewer,Makes the most sense is how would you describe your relationship with dana white now.
McGregor,Me and dana i've always had a great relationship throughout the years i i believe it's more even more so than a.
Interviewer,Fighter promoter you know we've gone and we've done amazing things together obviously it's.
McGregor,High stakes high pressure business uh you know we were at loggerheads probably the most we've ever been in.
Interviewer,2020 i felt some things were wrong i don't you know that were done towards me i.
McGregor,Don't some things wrong for sure so you know it is what it is we've we got it off our chest and.
Interviewer,You know we're back to where we're at and i'm very happy with that i've got a lot of admiration for dana what are you.
McGregor,Doing in 2020 against all odds was quite admirable and you know i would have loved to be a part.
Interviewer,Of it more but it is what it is i i'm happy that i started it.
McGregor,Started the year launched it and i'm also happy that i that i got all the records of the year.
Interviewer,So you know we came through it and we're in a great place now and you know here we are.
McGregor,There's many many great things ahead and so you know he said also recently that you're in a great place do you feel.
Interviewer,Like that storm is behind you know i think you're referring to maybe the the dms.
McGregor,Which is something that he he didn't he didn't like he didn't appreciate you releasing yeah.
Interviewer,You know it wasn't you know i i i the worst thing i don't know about that now you know but it.
McGregor,I was more at that time when i was putting that out obviously it was frustrations because i was campaigning.
Interviewer,For a fight and it was like i wasn't campaigning for a fight and i was a bit upset with that.
McGregor,So you know but then me putting them out was it was around the time diego had given me a lot of respect and uh.
Interviewer,In in the media and he had just had a fight and a victory and i wanted to show my respect and say.
McGregor,Diego i am actually looking for a belt against you all so i have no problem competing against you.
Interviewer,You know i understand diego maybe on the tail end of his career and and this time but it wasn't like it was just a one and.
McGregor,All it was like it was part of a collection of belts i was looking for i wanted activity i must you know.
Interviewer,And i'm a competitor and a competitor needs activity so it is what it is it went the way it.
McGregor,Went and you know all all in the past once we got to the fall that's when.
Interviewer,You know this fight with dustin started to percolate it didn't really seem like the poirier.
McGregor,Rematch was on the radar and and you even said in the past like you know you beat.
Interviewer,Aldo in 13 seconds you beat him in a minute 46 it's kind of hard to replicate that.
McGregor,Performance so you were looking for new options and it kind of really started online.
Interviewer,Right with the the offer to do the uh the sparring match for charity in dublin and then just all of a sudden it's like.
McGregor,Okay we're talking about dustin versus conor two from your perspective how did we end up.
Interviewer,With your return fight being against dustin poirier of all people you know it went the way it went and i.
McGregor,Was just i was just trying to get some competition going something something popping.
Interviewer,You know i mean i was i was trying i was finding it hard to get something going and.
McGregor,You know i went about it the way it went i went about it and i got it going they set up this great event for from me.
Interviewer,Here in in fight island and i'm very happy with how it came about i'm excited to get in and compete.
McGregor,Against dustin i think he's i think he's atop this division for sure you know he has not get wins over justin.
Interviewer,Uh you know he beat hooker he's you know he's a phenomenal uh.
McGregor,He's a former champion in the division also so i'm excited i'm happy to be back at 155.
Interviewer,Pounds also it went perfectly well and i'm very excited to be back just about there.
McGregor,Just on the cusp of it i i saw you say recently that you're going to knock them out in less.
Interviewer,Than 60 and i and i find that that proclamation in particular to be very interesting because that would be.
McGregor,Less than obviously the first fight do you feel pressure to do something even more.
Interviewer,Spectacular than the first fight you need to finish him quicker than the first time around.
McGregor,You know it's certainly it's certainly a different belt when you face a man twice right.
Interviewer,It should be it should be a more difficult bout to face a man a second time.
McGregor,So in that scenario i must do it better and i'm going to aim to do it better and i'm i'm.
Interviewer,Highly confident the shots i will need to land will be will be will be hit home inside that first 60.
McGregor,Second mark if dustin can withstand them um more power to him i know he's hoping it's a.
Interviewer,War and a drag that wore back and forth i'm actually excited about that also i i wouldn't.
McGregor,I wouldn't be against that i'd actually i'd actually love that i would actually relish a war.
Interviewer,With dustin so if he can if he can withstand the shots and get a pop and let's get it.
McGregor,Going let's stand in there and let's fight so i i just foresee i just foresee.
Interviewer,My shots landing early and that's it you would prefer a war over a 60-second fight.
McGregor,Uh yeah i probably will to be honest i probably would you know i it's yeah i would i want to.
Interviewer,Get i want to compete i need to i want to rack up my rack up the clock you know get get some.
McGregor,Time in there and what's a war to him and what's a war to me are two different things you know.
Interviewer,It's if he can last he can last but it's it's not.
McGregor,You know it's it's going to be a small one for me to be honest i really you know i know this is a good.
Interviewer,A good fighter but i'm the double greatest the whole mood of this fight the.
McGregor,Build-up of the fight drastically different than the first time around no trash talk.
Interviewer,There seems to be great mutual respect you're even pledging to donate to his charity.
McGregor,The good fight foundation uh what do you make of that you know i spoke to uh.
Interviewer,Ally quinto when this fight was first made he said oh dustin's already lost the fight you know he's kind of just.
McGregor,Happy to be there and i've heard this from other people i'd like to fight ally or quint at some.
Interviewer,Stage i'd like to fight allah i i don't know i just like to fight him.
McGregor,I'd like to fight ali said a few things and you know i actually like alex he's a funny guy.
Interviewer,Yeah real estate agent and all i think that's even funny in itself and i you know his team he has his.
McGregor,Little team longo and those guys i i'd like to fight al er but as far as them i'd like to fight.
Interviewer,Them all to be honest i don't care this is the thing with me and all these other guys wins and losses and all this.
McGregor,It means nothing to me if you're scheduled to fight a man.
Interviewer,And you've gone through build up and there's there's history and all of this a fight is a fight and fights must take.
McGregor,Place some of these fakes you know you know if you look at like the tony and khabib fight.
Interviewer,That that's scheduled to fight five times and that that's a every fight is different regardless of anything every.
McGregor,Fight between every man is different and the fights are to take place they must take place you know what i mean you.
Interviewer,Can't scurry away and not not not not not get the fight scene that you were supposed to fight that's my opinion of.
McGregor,It and you know i don't care how many wins or how many losses you have it means.
Interviewer,Nothing to me i thought i fought unbeaten everything in in different sports and all.
McGregor,You know i would fight anyone you know and if you want to fight someone you're.
Interviewer,Supposed to fight them they should happen so as far as this one being a lot more.
McGregor,Respectful and this we're more mature myself and dustin we're both fighters and we've come through a lot.
Interviewer,Uh you know he we both are engaged in much philanthropic efforts i know he he's doing a great team with the good.
McGregor,Fight foundation and even even you know how could i not respect dustin moon for that.
Interviewer,And two for how we handled the last loss and how he came back and how he rose up and became a champion.
McGregor,That's that's admirable in my book and i'm very excited to get in and compete with him and you know especially as i.
Interviewer,Get older in life i am you know i feel it's our duty as human beings to give back i.
McGregor,Think we've all got to give back in this in this world and as i'm getting older right i have so much admiration for the.
Interviewer,Coaches and the trainers and the teachers because if you think about it they.
McGregor,Dedicate they are it's all volunteer work you know they dedicate their time.
Interviewer,To help train the youth and guide the youth you know and i have so much admiration.
McGregor,For that i know growing up i would never really think of like the coaches or anything.
Interviewer,In that in that way that these people are actually taking time they've got their own families they've got their own.
McGregor,Things but here they are dedicating their time to help coach and train.
Interviewer,The youth and give them an outlet a much needed outlet especially in this day and age so i want to go back and support.
McGregor,That i'm going to support people to support people you know support support these these gyms and.
Interviewer,These these places and that's that's what my aim will be for this part of my life.
McGregor,Yeah and i give you a lot of credit for what you've done with the the sbg gym um in in in ireland of course one of the.
Interviewer,Branches of of your team and and of course with the hospitals like i said it's as far as.
McGregor,Philanthropic work it's been a great year for you um and i think people need to recognize.
Interviewer,That and give you the proper credit for that part in the pun uh because you have done a lot of great.
McGregor,Things over the past year for your community um getting back to the fight if i can.
Interviewer,First time fighting at 155 since the khabib fight how do you feel right now as we approach.
McGregor,Almost a week out and and you know how do you think the weight cut is going to be as we approach.
Interviewer,Weigh-ins next week it it has been the greatest camp the greatest weight uh transition i've.
McGregor,Ever i've ever endured you know and it's not even enduring i'm just.
Interviewer,I'm embracing it my frame is is light i'm i'm a true lightweight frame now i'm zippy i'm fast i'm powerful.
McGregor,You know i've maintained i have not only maintained strength i've actually gone opens.
Interviewer,In strength and power uh the weight is on point as it's ever been and i'm very excited you know.
McGregor,Heart once you're fully committed things are easy it's that simple hard things become.
Interviewer,Easy when you commit yourself fully and that's what i've done so i'm very excited to begin to showcase.
McGregor,Myself at 155 pounds fully focused back in october when khabib suddenly retired everyone thought.
Interviewer,Including myself that this fight would be for the belt it seemed like a natural this would be for the vacant title.
McGregor,Are you surprised and or disappointed that it's not for the title not surprised not disappointed i i feel.
Interviewer,It should be for the title also um i mean you know i feel it should be for the title but.
McGregor,I'm not surprised not disappointed it is what it is with the way the year went i don't think.
Interviewer,I was going to get i was gonna walk into a title shot straight away you know so it is what it is i'm happy to be back.
McGregor,Here and i look forward to getting in and competing on the night.
Interviewer,Just curious why why do you think it's not for the belt you know when cejudo retired.
McGregor,They instantly made a vacant title fight why do you think this one isn't for a belt.
Interviewer,Um yeah you know who knows you know i was stripped at a featherweight belt before even getting an offer of of a.
McGregor,Featherweight fight you know i barely even got the cha i barely even got the second belt in the octagon.
Interviewer,In new york that time you know it is what it is uh i suppose habib and and and the death of.
McGregor,His father and you know we they give they give the the time and and so on and you know i think that's.
Interviewer,Admirable also i think the time is is now though you know i think this could well.
McGregor,It's well passed and i feel this should be for the belt if it's not no problem i'm looking to have an active year i'm.
Interviewer,Looking to compete and you know i am the champion do you know that the unified title was never.
McGregor,Crowned the unified title was never crowned that time in october 2018.
Interviewer,The habib fled the cage and left me fighting with his family members in the case the.
McGregor,The the post-fight ceremony was never never took place so you know i still feel like i'm the champion here and and.
Interviewer,I will go in and prove that i'll prove that with my performances and you know time will time will show.
McGregor,The the cream always rises to the top and the world is about to see it do you think khabib fights again.
Interviewer,I think he's afraid to fight me that's right i'm sure you know when i don't blame him.
McGregor,I know everything i know exactly what the face he i fought the best of him on that night he fought the worst of me on.
Interviewer,That night he knows that i know it his team knows it i have the answer to destroy that man so.
McGregor,You know he can he can pull the wool over over people's eyes for.
Interviewer,Only so long so you know it is what it is i know there's surrounding things regarding the family and that and.
McGregor,You know if he's retired and that's it i wish him well and it is what it is but i i am who i am and i am at the top you.
Interviewer,Know so time will show do you think he retired because he didn't want to fight you is.
McGregor,That what you are essentially saying uh yes i would say so another you know i i think his hand was.
Interviewer,Shown he's not a true fighter in my opinion you know how could you how could you how could you walk away.
McGregor,There's so many great fights to be had the anonymous like think of the diaz is the fergusons you know.
Interviewer,There's so many wild fights the oliveira's the you know the rematch against me i think it's just.
McGregor,Preposterous to walk away i think i think he just not only did he on the bus i think he put.
Interviewer,On the chips also i think he showed his hand but then at the same time you know there is family issues and you know it.
McGregor,Is what it is so all the best dana white has been very clear about the fact that he wants to.
Interviewer,See the rematch do you think the rematch happens in 2021 i'm here for it i'm ready for it i would.
McGregor,Like it to if it doesn't it doesn't so i i wonder i wonder i wonder what he's going to say you know.
Interviewer,Like i said he can only pull over the wall over someone's eyes for so long you know dana probably you know could.
McGregor,Have taken could have stripped the belt from him that night you know what i mean.
Interviewer,All that stuff all that all that uh all that was put into him for that event then.
McGregor,The pay-per-view flopped and then a retirement you know it's you know how long how long will it last.
Interviewer,It doesn't last that long in this business you know so what have you done late it's a what have you done for me.
McGregor,Lately business and the clock is taken for sure so we'll see what happens.
Interviewer,Is it true there was an offer on the table for you guys to be the coaches on the ultimate fighter and then.
McGregor,Fight at the end of that dana had said something to me you know i i don't think he was going to.
Interviewer,Be up for it i would have been up for it no problem might actually i know i know the ultimate fight is about to take.
McGregor,Place soon i'd be up to come i'd be up to coaching on that also.
Interviewer,You know to showcase a different version of me from a coaching standpoint would be an interesting uh an.
McGregor,Interesting uh journey and i'd like to do it so we'll see what happens.
Interviewer,Dana did mention it to me i didn't but i was skeptical where of the other sides agreement you know you know they don't.
McGregor,Want that area let's be real is it still an option or you haven't you haven't talked about it anymore i.
Interviewer,Haven't talked about it since now but i would still be open to it whoever they'd wanted against i would.
McGregor,Still be open to it i'm sure look there's so many there'll be a lot of conversations to be had.
Interviewer,As this thing as this thing shapes out and i'm very excited about it if it all goes well on the 23rd i would.
McGregor,Imagine because you were very you were very clear that you had the season in mind for 2020 you wanted to.
Interviewer,Fight at least three times could you map out your ideal 2021 for us can you give us you know just like you.
McGregor,Did at that press conference in russia uh you know towards the end of 2019 you kind of mapped out 2020 unfortunately.
Interviewer,Plans changed the floor is yours can you map out the perfect 20 21 for conor mcgregor.
McGregor,You know i don't that didn't work out so well the last time so let's just say competition.

Interviewer,Circle i've have experienced everything in this business right I mean I'm just an experienced individual I know what I.
McGregor,Need to do when i'm doing it and i have a solid team of masters tactician behind me that are that I discussed my.

Interviewer,Now we're just in sync like every just conversations constant conversations about techniques about skills but.
McGregor,Practices and we're all just rising and feeling the energy and it's a beautiful time was there ever a point where you.

McGregor,Know iii was there and my training was flawless I like I said when we had that discussion a while back right I hired I.
Interviewer,Was in phenomenal condition i had a few little slip-ups and they caused me I ended up in a timeshare I thought in.
McGregor,Army and i just slipped off slipped away from me but I was in from a phenomenal place then also so and I knew I know I.
Interviewer,Get back i knew i knew it sometimes you need sometimes sometimes certain things need to happen for you to.
McGregor,Kind of to get things right right so that's what happened to me and and Here I am you know when we spoke in in August.
Interviewer,It was a bit of a diff Connor you were very contrite you were apologetic you you've never been known.
McGregor,To be an apologetic guy in my care what the Portier say Portier said am i went from apologizing to absolutely nobody.
Interviewer,Apologizing to absolutely everybody and it was different and I think the fact I'm sure what to make of it right and.
McGregor,They weren't sure if you were being sincere or not why we've never seen Connor in this look I'm as real as.
Interviewer,Against like the slogan of the ufc okay you get what you see with me I'm in the wrong I'm in the wrong and and I'm.
McGregor,Really that's who i am so that wasn't that long ago that was just five or so months ago meet you your demeanor is.
Interviewer,Different you seem different you seem happier of course you're about to fight what's the difference between this guy.
McGregor,And that guy in august were you nervous about your career we're just you know I let it let people down and that's it and.
Interviewer,Just i'm in a position where i must you know you must take take control of things and and not shy away from things.
McGregor,And that's that's i've never done that in my career and I never will do it I'm back here now how am i how many months.
Interviewer,Five months ago that was solid five months work so I'm very very happy with it.
McGregor,One thing that i remember you saying in that and that interview was you felt like it was a knife in the heart when.
Interviewer,You when he started to hear the irish fans in particular lose faith in you lose lose that trust in you because they.
McGregor,They propped you up right you meant so much to them you feel like the support of the people means a lot to me you know.
Interviewer,I i do this to entertain the people you know this this is for my for my fans and my people who believe in me and not not.
McGregor,So much the anything that's gonna just my lack of commitment I think the people who believed in me and support me they.
Interviewer,Deserve better and i wish to give them that night and I will and I am I know like you said people can see that and.
McGregor,I'm putting in the walk and i'm saying I'm putting in the focused walking that's why we're all we're all in good.
Interviewer,Spirits do you feel like they are back on your bandwagon or do you think you have to do something I'm generally pay.
McGregor,You know that's why i'm like a man after if there's even a thought it out and they're not really with me anyway right.
Interviewer,So look i've got my team my people i know who's with me and I know that's you know I'll say a prayer for.
McGregor,Those who who cost me and try and bring harm to me and and move on and stay focused on the positive aspects of my.
Interviewer,Life and there are many many great things in my life and that's it and you know we can reach this bliss they say.
McGregor,Right so that's that's that's helped me a lot and I'm like I've got blinkers on right I'm just focused nothing can.
Interviewer,Infiltrate my entire thoughts you know no external it's like a lot of the narratives Ariel that people say and.
McGregor,It's a crazy game right you know it just used to irritate me to wait the way certain the way certain narratives are.
Interviewer,Spread and the rewards are twisted and these type of things and I just I had to just disengage from it I eat but when I.
McGregor,Came into the game it would happen and i kind of laugh it off and plate and play up to it and do my thing and then I just.
Interviewer,Kept on on and on and on and i just cared a little a little a little more and then I area I reacted I reacted to.
McGregor,Disrespect but no more i am just focused on myself my inner thoughts my team's thoughts and and that's where we're at.
Interviewer,The legendary boxer marvelous marvin Marvin Hagler he once said many moons ago that it's.
McGregor,It's it's hard to wake up at 5:00 a.m. to go run outside when you're waking up in silk pajamas you've experienced that.
Interviewer,Now right i'm caught in a show tracks yeah I mean this is you know sorry about Conor McGregor line damn is that a real.

McGregor,And now i'm doing it full steam ahead and I'm in the best shape of my life in.
Interviewer,Mental and physical but it's not like you're throwing a basketball into a hoop right you're getting punched in the face.
McGregor,And you have to get punched in the face leading up to the fight a minimum fighter so no one's punching me in the.
Interviewer,Face how do you know i mean i do sharp may trust me on that but I'm just saying where do you find that motivation now if.

McGregor,Special so the the opponent and the weight was your decision ultimately right you could.
Interviewer,Have made this at 155 like i'm under weight right now so how much do you weigh on this Friday before the fight.
McGregor,I'm underweight i'd say 160 160 and a bit so why not make him I know I could how I just don't think he looks well at.
Interviewer,155 right he does not look well i won't he's a 170 fighters so don't you want it to suffer on the way too worried but I.
McGregor,Want them or some of this i don't care no I I could be a movie for I would bring him any blade no I.

Interviewer,Cut men build and include it's not you know it's I'm happy where I'm at and also 170 is it an excitement for me I.
McGregor,Like 170 i like what's going on at the 170 division at the minute you got Jorge with that belt you got the other guys.
Interviewer,Would fighting for the belt and and i like all what's going on at 117 I feel good at 170 I feel energetic it's what I.
McGregor,Weigh it's what i weigh and and that's it so it opens up so many more options right you don't want to die no 140 no.
Interviewer,I'm not doing i 155 no okay i could make good I can make 155 this this this fight no problem but I am I just want to go in.
McGregor,Freshen as it is let the let the fly play as it is and then open up all my options historically the knock on Donald.
Interviewer,Has been he can't win the big one never won the belt in WC never won the belt you have see you know when it seems like.
McGregor,He has a big fight when the spotlight is on him he falters there's no bigger spotlight than a fight against you so.

McGregor,Nothing it's it's me i'm gonna in their fresh sharp fast like dangerous powerful and full of energy.
Interviewer,It can be if you want to put it on the first flight of the mate of the of the card in the first prelim fight or.
McGregor,Something i think that's that that's gonna make Donald be comfortable then do that let's see what happens to stay it's.
Interviewer,Still gonna be it's not gonna be what's gonna happen so yeah that's it I know you're very in tune with the fence and.

Interviewer,Beat donald how could you fight donald yeah this is the fight to make what's your response to the people who say that.
McGregor,You were ducking gaeshi and you picked the easier fight well well well first of all I put it.
Interviewer,Into the ufc's hands right i was like they wanted to make the belt I wanted to make the baton Justin's in listen to.
McGregor,Heavy door he was going on with certain things or said a lot of people are saying certain things or following these.
Interviewer,These narratives these vicious narratives that are going around about me and and I'm like just I'm just.

Interviewer,Proper ways here i've abstained from that I made a promise to myself I made a promise to my team I made a promise to.
McGregor,My friends that i would stay wound represent fully focused or up staying from that and I miss it you know I do.
Interviewer,Love my liquid i'll have a few little sips of my after-party I'll take the following day to rest and then the day.
McGregor,After that i will engage in a red zone McGregor fast training session like I don't post the as - after the ds2 fight.
Interviewer,I went that i had my afterparty i took a day rest after the fight and I went in and I don't read on sprints on the ski.
McGregor,Area the skier it's a stationary machine we pull the strings down because the leg was jammed up from kicking Diaz's me and.
Interviewer,His legs and so i couldn't i was hot i was on crutches and I got that walk in and just least set my mind I just reset.
McGregor,My mind put me back in that training mind it's so easy for you to finish a fight have a little celebration and then.
Interviewer,It's stretched into the next day and then you read a bit of bad food and then the next day and then it's kind of hard.
McGregor,To pull yourself back in so i have my plan that I'm gonna set out and that's what it is I'm gonna have my little.
Interviewer,Celebration rest the next day and then back into training and then and then what's next Wow okay so this is I mean.
McGregor,We haven't seen you active like this in a very long time so if I asked you do you even have the opponents in mind it.
Interviewer,Does not matter you don't there's so many times in Justin's there jeho Hayes there my Camaros there don't have a.
McGregor,Preference i don't know i don't yeah it just wouldn't be fair to say you want to end with Labib in Moscow cuz that's what.
Interviewer,You know that one i'd love that one but that's got to happen it's got to happen here not a man he can it must happen so.
McGregor,I went on moscow and i wasn't so was that like our amazing Moscow is a great place Roose is a great place I got to.
Interviewer,Say i'm very impressed with him you didn't feel unsafe at any point no not a Russian people did you see the fans and.
McGregor,The soap you know they're good people have something at you I sort of reflected I could have caught.
Interviewer,It as well i loved it i love i love the game you know yeah I look forward to that to that competition it's fully.
McGregor,Focused you can see it come on you can see the shape of me yeah everyone knows everyone knows and no matter what they.
Interviewer,Can map that mine can run but he cannot hide from it so in the build-up to that fight a lot was said right it's very.
McGregor,Personal between you and a lot was said that I think it wasn't just shared was actions that led to what was said it.
Interviewer,Wasn't just they didn't just get to words it was you know there was actions that led to those words so like what.
McGregor,Like just things that true about the course of the build-up like with the Artem situation you know and thinks that.
Interviewer,Maybe maybe slipped under the radar like it was meeteth kind of began or listened and whatever it did get it did get very.
McGregor,Very personal but i'm i'm taking a back step from that and focusing on the skills it's a very skillful belt and he.
Interviewer,Poses a specific air a specific style set and I posed a specific style set it's an interesting clash with two fully.
McGregor,Focused fighters and that's what will happen in the next belt and I look forward to it and settling it but I'm.
Interviewer,Just curious because it got so personal things about in his family and he was talking about things were that they were.
McGregor,Being alleged about you and do you regret any of that do you do wish in hindsight it didn't get that personal.
Interviewer,About his family the religion all that the dad yes so some of the things maybe I may be too far but hey it's it is what.
McGregor,It is it's the fight business at the end of the day it went the way it went that's it but you think that fight will.
Interviewer,Happen again when you hear him say he's gotta win 10 fights and all this stuff oh yeah what is your reaction to that.
McGregor,Fear fear you know doesn't want it so this is what it is you mentioned something very quickly there that I just.
Interviewer,Want to ask you about so i think a lot of people be surprised you said no liquid in this camp when's the last time.
McGregor,You had a drink a couple of good couple months ago tree for all months ago maybe here is that a first for you or at least.
Interviewer,First in a while what was rincon oblate in 40 week you asked me am I think I was on the Conan O'Brien show yes Abra.
McGregor,I mean part of the habib fight yeah hmm you were drinking in the build-up mm yeah mm-hmm was that common for you and.
Interviewer,Your career not read not not to that extent no not that extent why'd you do that I don't know I just I just venom in.
McGregor,Me or something don't know boy i had people holed up in a in a hotel from that part that a world and and I would I.
Interviewer,Would ring and her and and arrange a fight so they come from the hotel down to the.
McGregor,Gym and have a full block a full blown flight no head guard close that certainly good and a fight I'd win you.
Interviewer,Know i'd have a war and i'd win i'd knock the guy out and then I go off and celebrate and then I'd come back in.
McGregor,Three days three days what were you doing you know just don't know not nothing what I should have been there.
Interviewer,Celebrating partying just i don't know just not living the life that I should be living and that's it so I'm not going.
McGregor,Back there you know i mean i'm in a graceful nail that's he and I put I've made mistakes and you know I've been man.
Interviewer,Enough to admit them and correct them and that's what I don't and you know I mean I'm Way know I might not be perfect.
McGregor,Area right but where would i what a good sleep and a full belly on damn close what time are you going to sleep these.
Interviewer,Days well right now we're on the course getting onto the clock of a fight time right that's hey I'll be walking into.
McGregor,The octagon 10:00 p.m. of aigis time but back home in Ireland I was sleeping early I was waking up early we had a set.
Interviewer,Time i think was like it was 11 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on my training sessions slots and then so that was it I stayed.
McGregor,Structure to of that now that we're here or in the gym now every time on fight night all right at the time of the fight.
Interviewer,And carrying on i feel i've got a custom for the time already to the times aren't so perfect absolutely flawless.
McGregor,And i've heard you call that previous camp of disaster right I'm not trying to get you know it's not a disaster you.
Interviewer,Learned something from everything right but I heard a lot about myself shoe and and home came here on the walk was great.
McGregor,Like but it's not like i was coming into gym being lazy and half-ass that goes almost what the park I said here I was.
Interviewer,Almost too too intense and to series and to working too hard in the gym and they're not working hard enough outside.
McGregor,Because that's a that's a big part of it as well you know I mean you've got to be focused outside cuz then the next day.
Interviewer,Rolls around interview i'm focused when you left the gym and then it's time to go back you're not a sharp you're not as.
McGregor,Fresh you're not as eager to be there and that's what kept happening to me and I just avenged didn't want to be there.
Interviewer,Never get there and then i have this the scrap and then I'd offer go again and it is what it is everything's a lesson and.
McGregor,Some parts of it were enjoyable though you knows I do love a good scrap just I just gotta stay focused outside is um.
Interviewer,Let's see how are things with your head coach John Cavanaugh amazing absolutely amazing very very very in in contact you.
McGregor,Know we discuss a lot or we we discussed training methods and practices everything you know that's communication.
Interviewer,Has been excellent this camp and i made sure you know just it wasn't the last camp not nothing not even with John but.
McGregor,It would everyone involves you know so I've been a lot more in communication with my team and relay and how I feel.
Interviewer,And and you know what some hyuna together we are truly some unit I brought back my boxing coaches as well.
McGregor,Went back to my old boxing gym feel sort of and then at crowman Boxing Club it's where I learned have the pawn shop.
Interviewer,That's been good for the soul and that and uh you know I said in my head that after to me after I went back then I was.
McGregor,Like because i don't know boxing about in in there good Friday show and I had feel in the corner and that I was like.
Interviewer,Damn i should i should have had the guys in there for their Mayweather build-up and you know I was part of the team and.
McGregor,But look that's the box and avenue still there also I'm it's good to have big the guys back and there's a great energy in.
Interviewer,The counter walks been phenomenal everyone's in sync and that's it I had a true team of tactician.
McGregor,Behind me and I'm excited to go in and represent our walk and this is something that I don't.
Interviewer,Think that guys have caught on just yet you and Phil Sutcliff I've seen you working with him kind of like the.
McGregor,Classic old boxing guy if you will the decision to bring them back I think is really interesting and I think symbolic.
Interviewer,Of the fact that you were trying to go back to when it was simpler and to your roots so to speak is this the first time.
McGregor,In your mma career that you have had them a part of of your camp in your corner part of the corner yes and not.
Interviewer,Part of the can but since ufc days my early MMA career I was still in the box and in the boxing gym I would go to the.
McGregor,Box in germany and it's faster and it mixed martial arts jamming we were kind of at loggerheads a while back at the.
Interviewer,Very beginning because it was they could not understood what the mixed martial arts was and then that's kind of what.
McGregor,Led me the interest to kind of stay focused on the only MMA what boxing such a beautiful beautiful discipline and.
Interviewer,These guys are the best you know me and so I'm very very and this is what I learned how to fight and.
McGregor,Then hit the box so i'm pretty happy them feel yeah when were you at Kremlin I will do a table 12.
Interviewer,Wow 12 so do you see the symbolism in that to have profits where my 12 keeps bouncing up everywhere it's magic for.
McGregor,Sex right - 46 is ufc two four six yeah adds up to 12 to the 12th UFC fight it's my 12th UFC fight something else there.
Interviewer,Was another one i think the date counted up to 12 or something a 1 numerology is but there's some great symbolism in that.
McGregor,Right now bring back the old coach so to speak of course you have to push anyone out but you're adding him yes no no no.
Interviewer,We're together we are all better we're better together most certainly everyone everyone on my.
McGregor,Team has amazing skills and amazing knowledge of the fight game in specific areas generally and so and like I said.
Interviewer,We're all in sync we're all in discussion and we're in a great spot did you sign a new deal signed a new deal.
McGregor,Yes i'm on the fight and it's just that usually just work for you here I've got a piece here don't fire than you.
Interviewer,Renegotiate it's that blasted i believe that's buzz what will happen after this one I know.
McGregor,That's a no point of doing the eight fight deals anymore if you're just gonna renegotiate every single time yeah I.
Interviewer,Know you yeah yeah i'm confident it's gonna be a good a nice paycheck most ever probably in in my mixed martial.
McGregor,Arts career yeah really hmm give us the range we knew how much you made for Mayweather yeah I'd say about it could.
Interviewer,Be i'm estimating a good 80 million 80 mmm come on yeah because I have all like I said we.
McGregor,Got the australia and canada and england and England and Ireland then should be a good one.
Interviewer,Wow what did you make for habib fifty fifteen of it Wow eighty no one's ever made anything most of many fighters.
McGregor,Combined haven't made that think i'm toast out here but I'm still the bread you know this is the first time since.
Interviewer,The seaver fight that you're not a champion or there's no stakes there's no belt on the line or anything like that.
McGregor,Even with nate not a title fight we're still a champion and whatnot does it feel a little different now.
Interviewer,No no i am the champ champ forever and always it's in stone were you annoyed at the.
McGregor,Bmf title stuff mom i thought it was great yeah that was great I guess straightaway I was like who will.
Interviewer,Show me that belt i wanted this i saw the belt before Dana said that over to me and then I was missing say no design.
McGregor,Because i seen the drawer unloved at the outline of it but I didn't see the color of it I was estimating was gonna be the.
Interviewer,Bmf with the gold right and then when i saw the silver and black and I don't know about it sorry well scoop it up.
McGregor,Though well i'm attitude to the thing yeah definitely so do you almost feel like those two should finish up their.
Interviewer,Business and maybe the winter fights you cuz I was with our name cuz it ended yeah yeah you don't know what wait wait.
McGregor,Is now you're not i mean it's where did where do you want to do it again I don't think we were robbed at all right I mean.
Interviewer,You could see jorge dippin oh he was dipping there enough at the end that I toured around and that's where Nate's.
McGregor,Only kicking in yeah it would've been great to see the four on five we didn't see it look whatever.
Interviewer,See what happens you really feel that the hub you Tony if I won't happen just maybe you know possibly has nothing put.
McGregor,That supposed to happen four times i mean they're known for pullin out ray Kirk I be able supposed to vote Donald.

McGregor,Both stood near me they would had a moment sir but hey you know what way you trying to find me so but isn't it a.
Interviewer,Little disingenuous like everyone like yeah but only it's tainted baloney right you laugh at it mm-hmm exactly.

McGregor,But it's it should be it should be guaranteed right but I mean whenever it is what it is so the fighting the fight.
Interviewer,Is definitely an animal to get there like like the Mike Harrison Ford stunts you want to have another boxing match.

Interviewer,Flirting with it and then when all this and he can go and pick someone else it's not gonna be the same it's not I don't.
McGregor,Phenomenal i don't feel homeland that belt and the only reason I lost that belt was cause I prepared I prepared for.
Interviewer,A back footed philly shell style of opponent and when the fight was like that I was picking him apart then he.
McGregor,Came forward and start pressing and i wasn't sinking into my shots like I am there one like my box and coaches under.
Interviewer,My belt that i that are drilling specific boxing things to enter me again and I know I beat Floyd I know I beat.
McGregor,Floyd if we be matched and when we rematch she's not gonna be one that makes much noise but like he said it was.

McGregor,Going to practice it i practice it i used to drive we used to drive and my girlfriend we used to drive to a food.
Interviewer,Place in like a shopping mall in ireland then it was a very busy shopping mall and I don't like I.

McGregor,Gonna knock this manner with this exact shot at this exact time and I don't have back to back to back and tell everybody.
Interviewer,Tell everyone i think that's a very important thing it's easy for us to keep it all in but you're not not you're not.
McGregor,On the line then all-in is a term i like to use in my ventures all-in we've got to be all in our adventures I am I'm all.
Interviewer,In on my whiskey i'm all in on my clothing my fitness my fitness regime the McGregor fast program I am all in on.
McGregor,The fight game i'm i just want my wart you know we're in there's a lot of politics in the game the fight game is.
Interviewer,Full of sharks but i'm the whale so I want what's mine and that's what I'm gonna.
McGregor,I heard but even many visualize language well again yes see I was visualizing before I even.
Interviewer,Knew about it obviously soccer is huge in Ireland than the UK and it was my force law of most certainly I used to.
McGregor,Sneak out of the house late at night and it used to be a little grass patched by my home and I would play I'd take the.
Interviewer,Football out and play on the grass patch on my own and I would kick the ball against the wall and when I kicked the.
McGregor,Ball against the wall i would imagine it was a goal the goal net and I scored a goal and I would run off and I would.
Interviewer,Visualize a screaming arena cheering me on and they were my first visions of of.
McGregor,Selling out arenas and and you know and doing these type of things although although it didn't end up in the.
Interviewer,Football game i ended up in a similar one so it all worked out and it was all true visual visualization so I was just.
McGregor,A young kid with a dream you know i mean I know that sometimes my dreams change and change but it was still a kid with a.
Interviewer,Dream and a belief in himself and for many times I was laughed at not believed in but you know what nothing external.
McGregor,Can can can defeat the internal the only thing that can take someone down or break you down as internal nothing.
Interviewer,External is strong enough it's just about making sure your internal dialogue and your internal belief in yourself is.
McGregor,Strong enough that it can withstand the external the external is there it's got to accept it you've got to embrace it.
Interviewer,You've got to understand and be aware of it but don't let it seep into you into your internal dialogue and and I am as a.
McGregor,Two-year-old man i am i don't know at all I am only I'm open down and grown with this I'm trying to continue to.
Interviewer,Learn it's a daily daily occurrence not to let that external infiltrate infiltrate my internal and that's what.
McGregor,I'm trying to do right now because i have let it infiltrate it at times how do you keep it out what do you do I.
Interviewer,Think you know it's a daily team for me I like you know I'm figuring out my rituals the only reason the only.
McGregor,Yesterday i was like every time i wake now I put on a song I start every day with it dance and feel myself Who am I I.

Interviewer,You do you know what i do my project i brought the game to Ireland I said I would try this promotion back I put my.
McGregor,People on i put my nation on the map although we are known as the Fighting Irish in boxing in boxing terms we have.
Interviewer,A rich history in boxing but not in mixed martial arts true fighting a full fight we had zero history zero impact.
McGregor,We were almost looked down upon the uk scene had risen up there was cement there was many stars of course the.
Interviewer,Brazilians they invent they invented the sport valet to door no-holds-barred fighting then the Americans took it.
McGregor,Franchise it into the ufc and built it up to what it was so the Americans and the Brazilians dominated the sport and.
Interviewer,And then the uk was rising up and the Irish were just the Irish but I I knew more but no more exactly now now now my.
McGregor,Nations flag is on the ufc belt they released a new belt because what they do is they're crafty Bunch the UFC I have.
Interviewer,So much respect for therefore i love the company I love I love all the people involved but I need time I tip away they.
McGregor,Try and reignite my interest and get me back in there but they Dumas they they I wound the two belts they're forced to.
Interviewer,Ever done at the for ever and still the only to ever do it unified there's been in from double champions but that's not.
McGregor,Unified double champions i'm the only unified chirp-chirp Ted Cham Cham exactly exactly the og.

Interviewer,Was fascinated with materialistic things I would buy myself cars watches I know I'm speaking about that I big diamond.
McGregor,Watch on my best this was actually a gift but I I like I I switched off of that now it's like I realized I was.
Interviewer,Spending things on material items or not Kings on myself on my being on my fitness on my health I've switched that.
McGregor,Completely like i said my nutrition has traveled to me full-time my doctor is my training partners my coaches I have a.
Interviewer,Full team and it's all dude it's all for health fitness and peak performance you know God we've got to be in shape I.

Interviewer,To be you've got to be in shape yes to be you know you've got to be in shape physically to be in to be in shape.
McGregor,Mentally they go hand in hand yeah so I'm putting a lot more time into that and I realized I actually actually.
Interviewer,Realized that it forced when i read it on LeBron James he spent one point five million dollars a year annually on.
McGregor,Himself physical therapist masseuse nutritionist trained all of that right and you know what I seen that I said I.
Interviewer,Spent zero I spent zero I just went to camp forms when a fight forms I'll gather a team of.
McGregor,People we go into the vegas desert lock yourself away for ten weeks and doing say insanity walk if I'm trying to back.
Interviewer,At home during camp i have fighters locked in in a hotel room waiting on call to be called them to come and fight.
McGregor,Me it's an insane game but it's not it's it's it's not all in again I'll go back to that Tim it's it's halfway in and.
Interviewer,Then you can't be that way and you certainly cannot be that way in the fight game but in reality you can't be.
McGregor,That way and any game you're in if you're in the game make sure you're in it all the way all in with it and then.
Interviewer,That game will be your game and that's that's where I am right now and I've only kind of taken this.
McGregor,Philosophy recently like i said i've had dips lots of motivation Gibson in in commitment and I'm figuring it all out.
Interviewer,And i'm feeling good in a great place and this meeting and this invitation this is just you know because I'm.
McGregor,Seeking inspiration i'm always looking for inspiration looking to learn looking to grow and honestly thank you but it's.
Interviewer,Not grateful for it and i look forward to continuing this chat there's absolutes time here too you know I love.
McGregor,Your hat you know you are like you're yourself completely but if there's any athlete we could relate you - it's.
Interviewer,Probably muhammad ali yeah what did he have an influence I had the privilege getting to know him a bit he was just.
McGregor,Believed about i saw the book you have a little in the submarine big respect Tony man.
Interviewer,Honestly i i know do your quest you were interviewing me but I will I want to interview you as well like your story is.
McGregor,Insane it's crazy how you've risen up and it's true that positive mind do that conviction that's right commitment that.
Interviewer,Conviction and big respect like admitting that you've been off your game at times like so it was a yeah so you talk with such.
McGregor, authority that some people assume you just yeah but you don't tell me about talking about trash talk.
Interviewer, tell me how you Timah dated people and tell me about was Ollie an influence yes of course I ally was one of my forced.
McGregor, heroes in combat sport I watched documentaries on him I read books on him.
Interviewer, even before I actually is a fully thing even before I actually boxed I've been boxing a fight in my whole life but even.
McGregor, before I engaged in combat sport I was interested in like the wrestling side of things which is a lot more show yeah and.
Interviewer, then obviously Muhammad Ali was a different animal because he was doing it for real wrestling's not really for real.
McGregor, it's in enemy but Muhammad Ali was doing for real and he was captivate the audience he was entertaining and he had.
Interviewer, passion and conviction and I was just a young kid watching this and then what got me into combat sport originally was.
McGregor, as I grew older and began venturing outside my home and outside my estate again like I said Dublin 12 it's a wild.
Interviewer, L town you've got to be able to fight you've got to be able to defend yourself so when I would when I ventured out.
McGregor, conflict began happening and I wanted to be prepared for that and be able for that and confident it anyway man this is.
Interviewer, this is like early early teens in like 11 12 did you were you a tough kid to start with or did you become a tough kid.
McGregor, oh you know I just like I heard your dad say you came out with I needed to I needed to how much yes you know that's.
Interviewer, that's false toughness the tough guy does not last in this is in a real game you know I mean that's that's false I.
McGregor, look at the tough guys back damn here today now yeah not tough no more ain't tough in their mother's box room you.
Interviewer, know what I'm saying so am I was not necessarily a tough growing up but I was I was a hard worker and I was and I was.
McGregor, you know what I was smart that's what I was that's what I was and wits beat toughness.
Interviewer, any day of the week and twice on Sunday so I I knew what I needed to do I needed to learn combat sport I needed to learn.
McGregor, martial arts gain confidence in in surroundings and then rise up and that's what I don't and your your psychological.
Interviewer, warfare you know where you torture these that was that a marketing nice for you to or was it but does it.
McGregor, really feel like you penetrate their mind and what is your mindset about you know I simply you know coming up I look.
Interviewer, at it's not trash talk to me although it has in a way become that and what is it really for you.
McGregor, I look at the opponent I look you know you know know yourself to no order is that's a Bruce Lee quote if you truly.
Interviewer, know yourself you can know orders so I know what way I feel I know what way that man feels I know what I can say to.
McGregor, push his buttons I know I know what he's thinking I know what he's afraid of I know his worries and I and I am put them.
Interviewer, in under the spotlight I put them out there I get them thinking about it I made a Jose Aldo an undefeated champion.
McGregor, yes the first UFC featherweight champion he was 28 years of age at the time I made him feel like he was an old man but.
Interviewer, he was 28 years of age I went and I told him what shot I was gonna knock him out and I knocked him out with that shot so.
McGregor, so how much of the fight game is psychological how much you know it's it's all psychological to be honest.
Interviewer, you've got to be able to control your breathing and control your emotions in there again like I said sometimes I've.
McGregor, been open down on it sometimes I've riled up too much to and I've I'm only young tone you know I'm still learning.
Interviewer, and learning the game and I don't claim to know what all but what I do know I know it I'm well you know and I'm.
McGregor, continuing to learn and continuing to push on and and that's where I'm at now so tell us some moments when did you.
Interviewer, like saying holy this when I visualize has become real like on my own life I know there have been certain.
McGregor, moments right give me a couple moments the it just right now I'm out you a blackguard we're in this big.
Interviewer, like it what's this like a big mark here we beat each other back this is something else nice cream carpet on the.
McGregor, floor nice pink August McGregor it's my own line I know David August my business.
Interviewer, partner has been dressing you for 30 years 25 he said tortilla is a 24 that'sthat's insane years myself and.
McGregor, Dave and their fashion is a big I enjoy good clothes I always I always think to myself exactly.
Interviewer, again toplin 12 we are known we are known to dress well I mean we might not have the best money or the best sex you.
McGregor, know we can't afford a lot of things but but we always would dress well and we'd always be clean and that was up we were.
Interviewer, proud of that my people were proud of that yeah and I always think back to where my where am I warmed from Mooney.
McGregor, came what made me interested in Mooney my original you know how did my love for Mooney begin all right you know what.
Interviewer, made me want to acquire that yes and and when I think about it I wanted to acquire money so I could buy clean fresh.
McGregor, runners runners sneakers we call the mooners back home sure but that's that's where it began so fashion was always.
Interviewer, instilled in me and I always talk at night when I get I'm able to get up and make some money I'm gonna splash out boy.
McGregor, the finest silks and the finest materials are wear them proudly and David I met David a couple of years ago.
Interviewer, and you know the partnership has been amazing we willing to get in there we have our own line out the August.
McGregor, McGregor line we're on our second drop now when it's grown really nice just checking it out we've got you a funny.
Interviewer, story about David I remember years ago I lived in Del Mar California I don't let Del Mar castles it's Castle both my.
McGregor, places in Europe and we had a fire and the house burned down Davison zombie clothing for like 10.
Interviewer," years and like you know he's always replacing it as you but literally we burned up like $40,000 of the clothing."
McGregor, David company goes in the fight game when were the moments in the fight game were you like holy man what I.
Interviewer, visualize is real like what there had to be a couple moments that were the most important to you you know to fight the.
McGregor, most important one for me the most significant moment in my career was when I forced tasted UFC gold it was.
Interviewer, UFC 189 in Las Vegas I faced I was supposed to face the corn champion Jose Aldo but he pulled out nine days before.
McGregor, the belt would have broken rape someone to a spinning back-kick on him and broke his rib broke his rib it was more like a.
Interviewer, bruised rib two and a half weeks before my last fight I drew a front kick at a shootin Moldovan wrestlers or shooting.
McGregor, wrestlers I kind of shooting in on your legs yeah I mean he's shot like to the front kick I true it at his belly and my.
Interviewer, two toes the baby toe and the toe next with bent back like this and stuck in that position.
McGregor, my doctor who's here when we now had to come into the cage stretch it and break it back in the place my foot swelled.
Interviewer, like a balloon that was two and a half two story a fight I wanted to come I wanted to compete and I want to take it.
McGregor, in there you know one of the things I'm blessed with I have many shots in my arsenal at many moves like a box I can.
Interviewer, kick have many different weapons in my in my in my arsenal so that's a blessing and of course a blessing pretty obvious.
McGregor, I can throw many moves I can stifle an opponent of course because if I faces a serious injury where I probably should.
Interviewer, have just settled it out reset the match to a later date but your hunger made you go by hunger and my my knowledge also.
McGregor, that if if I have one shot that's my wound Liam that's gone I have another seven limbs you know the act of eight.
Interviewer, limbs this year so I can utilize your strikes in my ass oh yeah tell me about the last night we could be because I'm.
McGregor, curious were you prepared for that approach dude were you able to fight your fight tell me what you found out.
Interviewer, different about this right I was there by the way yes he literally jumped right in front of us right on his brothers I.
McGregor, say today a lot of my student on my way the fight went my way and trust me when I tell you Tony this war is not over if.
Interviewer, this fight does not happen again if it does not get reset it's on them they're running away I'm here for the fighting.
McGregor, here for the rematch I know the errors I know like I said the lapses in commitment that I've had in that belt I.
Interviewer, know my mindset there was a lot of external things obviously the injury the what the injury itself led me to ha I.
McGregor, had to half my work I couldn't Road wrong anymore I or as for we prepare I wasn't my weight was too high so when.
Interviewer, you're cutting weight if I if I can't get my weight because of injuries or what rot I have.
McGregor, an more intense wait could so I was severely dehydrated I didn't sleep for 48 hours before the wait could but these.
Interviewer, are all just nonsensical I don't know that's why I walked in there hands down ding ding ding and walk forward to him.
McGregor, and he went running away around the cage he got lucky with that overhand right drop me.
Interviewer, well didn't really drop me I I landed on my hand but I kept my vision my vision was clear backed away jumped up landed.
McGregor, shots back and then we engaged in a fistfight he tried to take it tricky took me down again after landing.
Interviewer, asserting a significant shot the fights let's fight now instead he's was afraid and grabs ahold of the leg so but my.
McGregor, whole approach in that camp the injuries did non-commitment for you were you trying the game tactics we were.
Interviewer, I attack I am an attacker and my attack defense but in this camp for some reason the entire focus was defend defense so I.
McGregor, was like every round I would be every round we would start in the training I would be having my back against the.
Interviewer, fence I would have my back on the floor and I would always put myself in a vulnerable position.
McGregor, and I'd be kept well as the camp went on I'd be just came defensive defensive well that's never been what idea was.
Interviewer, like what like it still it irritates me to this day because you know the trainer plan is that I I trained with heavy.
McGregor, people 90 plus kilo I guess told you at Moldova and wrestler I broke my foot it's like a horse least like a.
Interviewer,Human horse and then i've got another I'm an American Brazilian Jiu Jitsu world champion to change me.
McGregor,He was like 200 pounds not only a big beat the big big boy is but I was always on the defensive with them and since the.
Interviewer,Fight i've gone back to train with them and and went with my internal dialogue not the external dialogue the dialogue.
McGregor,Of i can't proper with this man because he's a Russian guy and he's wrestled bear since he's a kid in all.
Interviewer,This that's external I let the external infiltrate my into internal and it filtered into the fight but after the.
McGregor, belt I went back and train with these people and attacked and I'm all them so I'm just here waiting to continue to go.
Interviewer, and see where we can get get with this situation with the UFC see can we get this fight again and.
McGregor, let's go again and that's that's where my soul I could you wrote the other day on Twitter I mean it was a couple days.
Interviewer, ago that you were retiring yeah and so bottom line is you're retiring unless they give you your terms is that what it.
McGregor, is you're enough of a brand to do it brother you're all so strategic tell us.
Interviewer, how you made the deal to fight money Mayweather I mean you're you know like you talk to his ass how did you pull.
McGregor, that off and tell me what your thinking was about to start with why'd you want to do it what was your mindset you made.
Interviewer, what eighty-five million dollars give or take look at the competitive the competitive aspect of it a new sport the.
McGregor, greatest of all time under that rule said again more external Dell I love it give it to me give me all that they'll.
Interviewer, tell me I can't do something tell me I'm not gonna I'm not gonna cross over and make that jump into a completely new.
McGregor, sport not only against some some not some random guy yes the damn best yes so it was just competitive my competitive.
Interviewer, nature of course the financial benefits and the notoriety was great and and two eggs how'd you get him to do it cuz it.
McGregor, was your idea right we just continued to poke poke at it and it just happened you know it happened naturally he well I.
Interviewer, went down on his terms I fought him under his rules and originally the promise was I'll fight him his game he.
McGregor, fights me my game yeah I haven't heard of him since so we'll see what happens but I would love another call when the.
Interviewer, boxing arena like that we spoke briefly about it outside floyd mayweather will is known for his feeling shell defensive.
McGregor, style of fighting he has his he has his right arm tucked in his left sorry is an orthodox so it's.
Interviewer, the opposite but he has when I'm tucked in on his belly and one arm kept up by his ear and it uses his shoulder to.
McGregor, deflect shots he's a back footed fighter he fights on the back foot that's what I prepared for because that's what I.
Interviewer, that's all I had seen of him my sparring partners were fighters on the back foot fighters defensive leaning against the.
McGregor, ropes and then when I went into the fight in the early rounds I was whooping him in the early rounds who was actually.
Interviewer, I went back to my corner after the fourth round said this is easy I literally set out to my corner man.
McGregor, this is easy and then he had to switch up style now you've got to respect that.
Interviewer, because that's what that's what a crafty veteran can do we can switch up a star he switched it to that all Mexicans.
McGregor, boxing style the Mexican boxing style is where you put your elbows in tight the the knuckle you put a two-step of the.
Interviewer, the forehead and and connected and walk forward with heavy pressure he'd never fought like that in his.
McGregor, entire career but he was forced to fight that way because he was getting beaten beaten when he was fighting his ole way.
Interviewer, and the the approach caught me off guard I was not prepared for it I was not used to it and he walked me down and end up.
McGregor, getting getting the stoppage the referee I felt could have let the fight go I would have liked him to see the end of.
Interviewer, the round get my get my breathing back get a little bit more comfortable put I know he's not gonna come into my game.
McGregor, but I would love to rematch him on the boxing rules again and and have that knowledge and have.
Interviewer, have my sparring hands come forward with that style also and see where we go and I believe I could I believe I would win.
McGregor, actually there I go again with a fake humbleness we know longest fight of your career do.
Interviewer, right you were incredibly yeah 20 22 22 minutes it was so that was another H that was in order and focus on the camp.
McGregor, to go from five five-minute rounds which is twenty twenty-five minutes to twelve treatment and rounds which is 26 minutes.
Interviewer, quite a big jump so my my my entire camp was almost a switch my time and my energy and how to develop more stamina.
McGregor, and to go and you know if we didn't get there in the end I had a ten week period and that brings me back to that all in.
Interviewer, and that before the Floyd fight I was a tubal weight world champion I doing it in the fight in mixed martial arts I had.
McGregor, done it I wasn't as committed as I could have been I wasn't I didn't have my team around me I didn't have my nutritionist.
Interviewer, my coaches my Bonapartist and then the fight got made the fight was ten weeks out so now I had ten weeks to adjust.
McGregor, from five five in arounds to 12 three minute rounds you know and but again tightly I have my McGregor fans program.
Interviewer, that we that we have I said I truly believe this in this program it has got the shape I got in in that ten weeks on.
McGregor, that program was insane it was phenomenal shape and was one of the reasons why I got to that tent around.
Interviewer, you know under that pressure and under that and that new experience and experience that I had not felt before so.
McGregor, I'm very confident now on my end let's keep building as long as I keep on it and try not not slip and and keep.
Interviewer, keep motivated I think like if you if your lack of commitment is almost an insult to the people who believe in you.
McGregor, and that's what I'm trying to tell myself I said there's people in there's people who believe in me so this is what.
Interviewer, I'm telling myself right now today there's people that believed in me and and me having this half commitment it's.
McGregor, it's you know it's gonna it's not it's not a I am it's not all my people it's not other people who who believe in.
Interviewer, me deserve and I want to you know I want to I want to give back to the people who believed in me and and give them that.
McGregor, belief you know and prove that belief correct so that's where we're at now and let's see where it goes that's let's.
Interviewer, yeah I was taught how to talk about you know you want to take the Island you burn your boats because if there's a.
McGregor, way back the mind will give you there right yeah and I heard you say sometime and I wanna chew you so I don't wanna.
Interviewer, die in that arena is that we might say yes it has to be it has to be I have what I have seen a man die in.
McGregor, this game I I was wing side I caught I cornered a man who killed a man I cornered a man who killed a man an Irish.
Interviewer, soil the only death in mixed martial arts history in Ireland it was everywhere and a couple of days after.
McGregor, that it was a couple of days after that they wanted the UFC wanted me to fly all over the United States of America to.
Interviewer, promote the next belt and I was like I can't do this I need to get away and just my head needs to be in the correct.
McGregor, spot it's a rootless rootless game you have to be willing because you can go in there and when you come out you're a.
Interviewer, different person if I could describe it to two people it's like entering a car crash you're going into a car crash that.
McGregor, shins are bare the feet are bare you can strike with the elbows the knees it's a vicious vicious game and you've got to.
Interviewer, be fully committed and you've got to be willing to go all the way and that's what I am and that's what I have even I.
McGregor, make correct decisions even in there even in defeat I know I know when when it's there if there isn't it's time to.
Interviewer, get our I know I know when to live to fight another day you know so you have to be intelligent in there as well.
McGregor, otherwise you won't live to fight another day and that's what happened in my last bell didn't knock on my way.
Interviewer, but then the fight broke out afterwards I bounced back in Soto's it all happened so fast it would literally happen right.
McGregor, in front of me what the happened yes but he jumped affair a jump to Freud or so he jumped everyone Swiss his feet.
Interviewer, jump inland when I was punching you I saw no no you're much higher to tell what happened was the fight was doing.
McGregor, their match was doing he climbed over the fence and jumped into the crowd to make a bit of noise but as soon as he.
Interviewer, jumped into the crowd he cowered away I like to call it scurried away cuz he's that little rats they are they won't be.
McGregor, honest we scurried away I know as I get my respect Congrats you won the match I get let's see what happens next time I.
Interviewer, our confident will get it again let's go again humble in defeat I am humble in victory or defeat no matter what it's.
McGregor, it's a sport at the end of the day a gruesome sport but it's a it's a sport so I respected I was defeated on the.
Interviewer, night he jumped in and caused his case and went to attack but really it was just I don't know exactly he was trying.
McGregor, to just hide away when he jumped in so he didn't really do anything but I saw this take place I got up off the ground.
Interviewer, I said ok now I'm back in the mix jumped on top of the cage as I jumped on top of the cage his brother.
McGregor, that's sprinting across and jumped up on top of the cage also to climb in and help him and join the fight.

McGregor,Know you know there's always challenges but for me i am an optimist true and true.
Interviewer,And you know although there are lots of things going on around the world but there's lots of opportunity.
McGregor,You know there's lots of opportunity to adapt to evolve into something else all business.
Interviewer,Sectors and all areas are are you know they're forced to look at their ways and adapt and evolve and that.
McGregor,Is only good uh you know anytime you have to you're almost.
Interviewer,Even if you're forced to look at yourself in the mirror and look at your own practices and your own.
McGregor,Ways of how you carry yourself you know if you're forced to look at that and address that.
Interviewer,And assess that and and and you know make growth through that that that is only a.
McGregor,Positive so you know i look at this year as an opportunistic gear you know what i mean.
Interviewer,There are a lot of there are a lot of things moving and shaking and you best believe you know.
McGregor,Through this situation we are faced with you will see some amazing things take place as you have already seen you know.
Interviewer,What i mean some very uh highly intuitive things you know what i mean some some some things.

McGregor,Things will happen from it so it's always happened to me sergey anytime anything bad has happened to me.
Interviewer,Or anything i've any time i've been faced with something that forces me to look at myself i look at the.
McGregor,Surroundings you know it's always worked out for the better so.
Interviewer,You know you've got to go to the storm to get to the zone you know they say so that that for me is the way i'm looking.
McGregor,At this year do you think it's possible to achieve success without this mindset without you know seeing.
Interviewer,Opportunities without being adopted in let's say for the upcoming generations for the next 10.
McGregor,Years all businessmen all businessmen if they don't have this mindset can they succeed your opinion.
Interviewer,No no impossible yeah i don't think so i would say so yeah you've got to you know it's got to start with the mind.
McGregor,Your mind has to believe in believing chance believing believing in the divine believing things.
Interviewer,To to happen for you you know what i mean it's got to you can't your mind must create these things.
McGregor,Before anything else and then the rest of it you know through work getting through.
Interviewer,Through fighting through the doubts and through the storm so to speak you know you know maybe other people's.
McGregor,Doubts upon you you know fighting through all of that strengthening again this strengthens.
Interviewer,Your own mind and then you know you you will break through and succeed you've got to you've.
McGregor,Got to see it you've got to have it in you've got to have that outlook fully agree you know it is hard at times.
Interviewer,To get to that stage but it's about a lot of self-talk you know a lot of self-er.
McGregor,Self-talk with yourself and and and just being honest with yourself you know a lot of people can lie to themselves but.
Interviewer,If you're truly honest with yourself you know a lot of most of us if not all of us know the changes we must make or.
McGregor,The things we must do in order to become successful or to reach the heights where it happens is we.
Interviewer,Just don't do it you know you i know i've got to get up at 8 a.m in the morning i get up at 9.
McGregor,A.m you know these are things i know i should need this extra pack of.

McGregor,Treat my body and my mind like a temple and then everything else falls into place you know i could say make sure i.
Interviewer,Go training make sure i keep my structure my training structure but if i get my rest correct and if i.
McGregor,Get my food and nutrition correct the trainingism is i don't even got to speak on the training because it's a.
Interviewer,Guarantee i have energy i'm for i am i am excited to go to work.
McGregor,You know be it exercise or be a business so i don't even got to say i got to make sure i got to be at this all.
Interviewer,At this training session at this time or this meeting that's a given i'm asleep at a certain time i'm up at a.
McGregor,Certain time i'm eating a specific diet that's going to boost my immunity my endurance my mindset.
Interviewer,Everything else that comes with it and then it's like a i don't want to say a domino.
McGregor,Effect because dominoes is knocking it down it's like a reverse domino effect you know it builds it up you can't build.
Interviewer,You can't build something on an unstable foundation you know you build something on a shaky.
McGregor,Foundation you can even get it high as you can you can.
Interviewer,You know you can build something on it you can throw things together and get it up.
McGregor,High real quick but the cracks in that early foundations will start to it will start to present itself and it.
Interviewer,Will start to open up and eventually crumble and it's a hard crumble.
McGregor,You know it's a hard fall when you do this everyone everyone looks will look to skip these.
Interviewer,Things and make excuses for these things the basics and but it catches up on you you know.
McGregor,What i mean the night cell will catch up on you the lack of that the lack of discipline in the in in in.
Interviewer,The you know it's it's i'm going to say the small things but it's not you know as.
McGregor,They say the small the small things make the big things what you put into your body what rest.
Interviewer,You take you know you you were saying about your you play you you have this place where you go.
McGregor,You go to and it's like your water you know we've got to have these things that that strengthen us and and and.
Interviewer,Guide us to that next level and that's that's where i'm at now and i'm trying to.
McGregor,I'm trying to stay no i'm not trying because you know i am i'm working for it and i'm doing it.
Interviewer,That's it it's dawn i'm being i'm i'm engaged holy in it now i'm fully obsessed and fully committed.
McGregor,To being the best version of myself and that's it you know so onwards and upwards we go what about.
Interviewer,Surroundings i mean people that surround you how important is it as.
McGregor,A part of the core picking right people you know to help help you through it or maybe.
Interviewer,Cleaning cleaning up some people so they don't distract you you think it's important.
McGregor,Yeah you know i hear what you're saying it's like you know as time goes on things will.
Interviewer,Just happen naturally you know what i mean i feel those that are there are there.
McGregor,And and those that are not you know they are not and eventually eventually they say the cream always.
Interviewer,Rises to the top so you know if you just put true faith in that alone you know that as long as.
McGregor,You internally your own self is is correct and your elite you know people you must.
Interviewer,Lead from the top you know you it filters down throughout the staff or throughout the people.
McGregor,Surrounding you or whatnot in your businesses it filters from the top you know the people.
Interviewer,The people the staff below are one that are not gonna say below like people are above each other it's not like that but.
McGregor,I'm just saying people that are are looking at who's who's.
Interviewer,Instructing them will be looking at at how how they carry themselves they'll be.
McGregor,Looking at how the how the the leader carries themselves the chairman the ceo the boss whatever.
Interviewer,You want to call it and then you know they will they will respond to that if the boss is.
McGregor,Late or if the boss is acting humble then everyone else thinks it's okay to act up.
Interviewer,You know what i mean so it comes down from the top and that's why i'm almost like.
McGregor,You know regarding bad people that made bad energies or bad things i almost don't.
Interviewer,I don't dwell too much on that because it almost just works itself out as long as internally you from the top.
McGregor,Are correct and it filters down and that you will only see good from that you know a guy that i've.
Interviewer,Been speaking to recently was like and even my own mother right i've been very proud of my mother recently and actually.
McGregor,She caught she actually you know my mother was was was going through some things and she she.
Interviewer,Came through with flying colors and she's like a new woman and when i seen this.
McGregor,And my my mother is at the top my mother is the top right and that's that seeing her correct she.
Interviewer,Wasn't telling me connor do this do this be right get yourself right do this do that you know because that is.
McGregor,Almost you're going gonna say wait what i'm okay and you'll almost rebel against that it's.
Interviewer,Leading by example and i saw my mother in the great light that she was in and i was in.
McGregor,All of it and i was like i'm gonna do that i want to get to that stage i want to be in this position and that.
Interviewer,Motivated me to go and correct myself so that's what i'm saying.
McGregor,In in that way you know as long as you in your place are correct and on top of your game to.
Interviewer,What you need to do and where you're going everything else around you will fall.
McGregor,Into shape and everyone will you know take inspiration from that and become that in their own way.
Interviewer,And then they will bring their own qualities to it which will make the whole.
McGregor,Picture like a picasso you know like a picasso painting for sure man very wise words i fully agree the only way forward.
Interviewer,Is lead by example don't force anything because it will naturally happen wrong people will will depart and right.
McGregor,People will join join joins the vegan you know yeah so uh.
Interviewer,For sure and i went through that went through this time almost trying to get people the way it.
McGregor,The way i feel it should be but it's not about that that's all external in the internal must.
Interviewer,Be correct you know it's like listening to external thoughts or external doubts from people.
McGregor,That will criticize you or want to see you fail or are are pro it's like a mirror almost.
Interviewer,People will project their own insecurities towards you you know what i mean it's like it all.
McGregor,It's all external it does not matter you know as long as your internal is strong and correct and focused.
Interviewer,Again it's like a mirror so my internal is correct and i'm looking out in a in such a strong place it.
McGregor,Reflects back like a mirror you know and then all i'm seeing is internal strength within my surrounding.
Interviewer,You know what i mean the external is not even not even a uh nothing you know i went to here you go.
McGregor,Online or something you'll see some guy hey you're only  you only fought.
Interviewer,Ceremony or you know like imagine saying that imagine some guy saying that about a legend or.
McGregor,Something or you know the way the way the fans kind of try and downplay who you fought or something or.
Interviewer,You haven't fought this guy yet or you ain't done that if you think of it like a mirror that.
McGregor,Man or that person who is writing this are saying this him he himself is projecting his own.
Interviewer,Insecurities because that man would have not even fought anyone on planet earth.
McGregor,So he said you ain't doing this you ain't doing that when really it's his own thoughts.
Interviewer,That he ain't done this or ain't done that on any scale so it's just it's like a mirror so you.
McGregor,Know i just see it you know as long as your own self is right everything else around you will become.
Interviewer,Right and that's it so being indifferent to external is is also part of the key right.
McGregor,Being indifferent to the external yeah yes of course i've been reactive to it external.
Interviewer,And even now and with all the things that's going on with me in the fight business.
McGregor,Say yeah i know we don't want to talk about the business no problem i appreciate that also it's a different.
Interviewer,Conversation yeah it's it's it's it's they it's a it's a.
McGregor,It's a it's an attempt at getting you getting a reaction getting you to like like bait like bait.
Interviewer,On a fishing rod you know they want to draw out a reaction tish to paint your character or.
McGregor,Yourself in a different way to see you go a different route but it's like.
Interviewer,As long as you're yourself and you're strong and you're you know like i said leading from leading from.
McGregor,The top you know it's like it's it's non-existent you're not reactive you're.
Interviewer,Creative and that is what it's all about it's about creating.
McGregor,Not reacting do you think for modern leaders it's important to have someone you know to pass on the knowledge.
Interviewer,Someone who who will inspire you or are you singing on your own it's also possible without listening to others to.
McGregor,Succeed well uh you know you're that's a bit that's a bit ego that's a bit of vegan.
Interviewer,Ego issue i feel you can't you know you've got to be you've got to have an open mind you've.
McGregor,Got to you've got to accept and not you know it's almost like.
Interviewer,The old martial arts way before it became like before people began mixing the arts it.
McGregor,Was like a corrupting coach would disrespect someone else's methods and.
Interviewer,Almost this like really almost spit on that the methods in the way of training and.
McGregor,That is not the right way and then all of a sudden the fight would happen and it would not end well and then it.
Interviewer,Was they were forced to look at themselves you know so that i would feel that that's kind of the same thing.
McGregor,If you don't if you don't look for guidance from elsewhere you know we are all we are all students.
Interviewer,At the end of the day and if that's got to be understood no matter what level you are you know we.
McGregor,Are all students we must all remain with that student beginner beginner mindset.
Interviewer,So where i think to be a leader you've got to to be to be a leader you've got to be an.
McGregor,Amazing student you know what i mean and you've got a remainder no one knows where.

Interviewer,And very challenging times like what's the simple thing simple advice to everyone.
McGregor,I suppose i'll just give the advice that i've been utilizing myself rather than looking out all the time at.
Interviewer,The doom and the gloom that's all that's all around us at times it sometimes feels like it's so.
McGregor,Overwhelming look within look within yourself what are the.
Interviewer,What are the what feel like minor things but they are actually the major things what are the we'll call the minor things.

Interviewer,Lot of young guys uh after we uh after we show this this video this conversation.

Interviewer,And the call and you know the guidance and advice also i appreciate it so uh amazing brilliant stuff i look.
McGregor,Forward to i look forward to continuing the talk and carrying on you .
Interviewer,"Conor, what was going on with your late arrival? Was it a conscious decision, a little bit of a mind game?"
McGregor,"He knew what he signed up for. The traffic is a little heavy, there must be a McGregor fight on. I don't know where the little fool is. He's better off running anyway, I bet he was saying a load of shit up here. He didn't say anything last time... fuck it, these things happen."
Interviewer,"Are you disappointed at all, we were looking forward to the face off. It was maybe an opportunity for you to get in his head."
McGregor,"I did not plan this, I tried to get here. I'm only a couple of minutes late for fuck sake. The mad backwards c*** should have stayed put. That's a sign; he doesn't want to be around me, he doesn't want to be around these people - he's petrified. He said nothing in New York and I bet he was saying shit here. It is what it is, I've given you enough face-offs over the year. I'm here to fight this man on Saturday night, it's more important that he gets the weight off. I want him making weight, I want him to show up on Saturday night because he was missed weight before and been rushed to hospital and all this other bollocks. Get that man in a sauna and cook him like the little chicken-jaw rat that he is."
Interviewer,"Conor, you've achieved a lot of incredible things in your career already..."
McGregor,Who's on the Proper whiskey?! Only another couple of hours and I'll be on it with you.
Interviewer,"Can you say where this will rank... stepping away for two years and coming back to fight the unbeaten Russian champion, the toughest stylistic match-up for you, where would this rank?"
McGregor,"It's another day, setting the bar high and knocking it out of the park. I plan on knocking that man's nose straight into the nosebleeds, that's what's going to happen on Saturday night."
Interviewer,"We see the two opportunities he may have as grappling and cardio, how much were those the focus of your camp?"
McGregor,"I've been grappling and wrestling much heavier men this whole camp. Only yesterday... 200 pounders for 25 minutes straight. I have cut no corners and I am ready for all outcomes. Once I hit him he is going to turn weak, I expect panic in him early but we've prepared for every outcome. I also don't give a bollocks, I've experienced it all."
Interviewer,The fans weren't there in New York; they're here today... is this the way it should always have been?
McGregor,"This is what I campaigned for in New York. I almost wasn't going to show up to the New York press conference. It's great to see the fans here and they're going to keep coming and coming. I'm filled with energy seeing my people come here and I'm going to make every single one of you proud on Saturday night. Thank you truly from the bottom of my heart, it's good to be back!"
Interviewer,"Tony Ferguson is carrying his belt around, Khabib is carrying his belt around, where are your belts?"
McGregor,"I was in a hurry, they're in my gaff at the minute, in my bedroom. I forgot them as I came out but there's a bloke gone to get them. But because I was late and because that little backwards c*** sprinted off the stage I thought fuck it, I'll just come on the stage. I know who the king is and I'm going to show it on Saturday night."
Interviewer,"Part of the reason for him leaving early was to get on schedule and make weight tomorrow. If he doesn't, do we still have a fight?"
McGregor,"You know with me there's always a fight going on somewhere. I don't give a bollocks about the weight, but if he doesn't make weight we'll figure it out when we get there. I'm fighting, know that!"
Interviewer,"At the open workouts, Khabib had something to say about the Irish language and about your family... what do you have to say to those comments."
McGregor,"You should never take information from an informant; you should keep distance from the informant at all times. That's the friendly way of putting it... his manager is a fucking snitch terrorist rat and that's it. I can go into heavy detail... and I will! He was pulled off a flight going from Cairo, Egypt to New York on September 11, 2001. He was caught with five passports in his possession. He turned informant and turned on the people he was working with. I don't even know how that man is in this fucking country. The Irish people are facing this immigration stuff on the way over and you've got this man with such a crazy background, Ali Abdelaziz, and he's rocking around free, it beggars belief to be honest. But don't ever take information from an informant and that's what that man is doing; he's a rat b****** and I'm going to get him on Saturday night."
Interviewer,Do you think the presence of the Irish fans has gotten to him mentally?
McGregor,"uck him and his mentality. I don't give a fuck about him. My heart is black towards him, towards his team and towards his people. I can truly see inside that man's head and style. I don't give a fuck about him and his people. There is way deeper shit than just a fight on Saturday night so it is what it is. I'm going to settle this the noble way and see what happens after that."
Interviewer,Do you think you're in Khabib's head?
McGregor,"It's clear as day, but again I don't care about his mentality or what he is thinking here. I am ruthless; I am coming to put a hole into this man's skull, dig my knuckle into his orbital bone and that is what I am going to do."
Interviewer,You have been very gracious before in wins and in defeat. Do you see yourself being able to squash the beef after fighting him?
McGregor,"Fuck peace. There will never be peace here. I always say you should aim for peace, but if you can't aim for peace, aim between the eyes. I'm going to aim right between that man's eyes and this is never over, never over. Never, ever, ever over."
Interviewer,Let's talk about whiskey for one second. I wonder if your whiskey is good?
McGregor,"Ask my bollocks! There's always going to be people who are hating, it comes with the territory of being at the top of the game. Trust me, it is the tastiest Irish whiskey there is on the planet. I fucking love it and I don't care what anybody says. I'm not even trying to sell it, just have a sip. Just take a bottle and enjoy it. When I count to three, I want everyone in this building to scream at the top of their lungs, fuck the Jameson brothers, One, two, three, fuck the Jameson brothers! Yes, coming for it all, me."
Interviewer,Have you been getting any numbers back on how well it's been doing?
McGregor,It's exceeding expectations. I'm involved with a couple of people who have been in the liquor business their entire lives and they've never seen anything like this. I've just got to thank my fans and the people who support me. It has sky-rocketed... we are trying to get more glass created and keep the whiskey flowing. It's out of the park but it's flowing in Las Vegas.
Interviewer,Is part of the art of war to you learning as much about your opponent as possible?
McGregor,"I just observe. I know every shot everyone throws, every move everyone makes. I just keep my eyes on the game that I run. I overlook my empire with my hawk eye."
Interviewer,"Khabib has talked about your past, what do you think that means?"
McGregor,"He's listening to that informant. It's all good to me, it's closing on fight night. You just cook yourself in that sauna you smelly Dagestani rat, and be there on Friday for that weigh-in and be there Saturday for the right. Say what you want, you don't have the bollocks to stay here for a couple of minutes extra. He spotted his chance and went running; like in the fight, I believe he'll spot an exit and he'll try and take it, but I won't let it happen."
Interviewer,"You mentioned falling out of love with the game, are you here to stay?"
McGregor,"Yes, that's why I'm here; the fans, the love, the energy. Truly, you can't beat that. It's as addictive as this Proper Twelve whiskey. But you know what's better than money? More fucking money, and there's a lot more coming in. I just love to be here doing what I'm doing. I'm only 30 years of age so I'm very, very young in the game. Even though I've been around and I'm experienced, I'm young compared to others so I'm here for a good while yet."
Interviewer,"You say it'll never be over with Khabib, can you see yourself fighting him more than once, or if you get the devastating KO will that be the end of it in terms of in the cage?"
McGregor,"I don't know, we'll see what happens. I'd like to fight that Ali, I'd like to fight that rat b****** somewhere. He's had a few fights, I might want to spark Khabib and then headline that Madison Square Garden card on November 3. I may want to do that one, that's what I'm thinking. Get the fight promo started; The Snitch against The Irish Proper Animal."
Interviewer,Where does your legacy go from here when it's already so big.
McGregor,"I just keep doing my thing, looking for a knock. At the end of the day, when I sign up, you're going to get a fight, that's a known fact. I come out fast, I come out aggressive and it's a damn fight. There's no holding, no stalling, it's a straight knock. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing. My legacy is set in stone, two-weight world champion, the first, the only. I just keep on going, see what happens."
Interviewer,What would you describe your level of hunger to be? Might Khabib be hungrier than you?
McGregor,"No. I'm starving. I am starving for this man's head. I am going to eat him alive in here and I don't give a bollocks. There is no-one hungrier than me, I am 24/7 in this game."
Interviewer,"You used to say you wanted to come to Las Vegas a month before, how come you haven't done that this time?"
McGregor,"It's hard to leave Ireland when you're in it; it's a damn good place to be. The air, the people, it's where I'm from so I spent more time there this time round. But I've also done the rounds in Las Vegas, I've been here for many, many months on end. I'm used to the climate so I said I'll stay in my beautiful home of Ireland then come out a little later and that's what we did. I feel great, I'm energised, we've done it easily."
Interviewer,You looked Khabib in the eyes a few weeks ago; what did you see then and what will you see tomorrow?
McGregor,"I saw a man who does not want to be here. He got out of here quick style, but hey you can't run now so I'm excited about that."
Interviewer,"Jose Aldo came out very aggressively in the first round, do you think we'll see something similar with Khabib?"
McGregor,"He's afraid of a clatter, make no mistake he does not like to be hit. He's a flincher as we call them in the novice ranks, that's what he is. He's also easily backed up so I am well aware of what to expect and it ain't nothing that fazes me."
Interviewer,When are you going to fight in Ireland again?
McGregor,"I said the other day, where is the Dublin fight? I know the situations with Croke Park, I know we want the stadiums but I'd fight in the Ringside. I'd fight in the Ringside on the south circular road where I made my boxing debut and my MMA debut. It's a pub and it holds about 50 people but I'd fucking fight in it. I certainly must, must, must fight in Ireland before I call it a day."
Interviewer,You've spoken about new weight classes... how necessary is 165lb for the UFC?
McGregor,"I think we would benefit from having more champions. With an overlook we could help athletes with their weight cuts but I don't think it's the be all and end all. When people are campaigning for these weight classes, and anything in general, they usually use it as a complaining tactic. I think you need to sit down and discuss all aspects and figure it out. I believe it would be beneficial having more belts on the line... potential dual-weight and treble-weight champions. I am for it, 155lb, 165lb, 175lb, 185lb, 195lb, 205lb."
Interviewer,Do you see yourself at 165lb?
McGregor,"Have you followed my career? I could go 185lb. I don't give a bollocks, if there's a fight there I'll take it. I would like te 165lb belt, but I would also like te 170lb belt. I think the game is going through a stage where we're looking to make it better for the athletes with their weight, but also the more belts... but I understand the way boxing has gone and there's hesitation about but I think we can sit down and come to a decision."
Interviewer,Dana said your mental game has surpassed even Muhammad Ali...?
McGregor,"Thank you so much, Dana, I appreciate the kind words. I have nothing but good things to say about you. You bare an OG (original gangster) of the fight game. The work you've put in to get this game to each level, you don't get the credit you deserve. The ESPN deal you got, when Lorenzo bowed out I wasn't sure what would happen, but with the ESPN deal, you are a true OG of the fight game and it's an honour to be up here doign business with you. I know we've had our ups and downs but it's an honour. Thank you for the kind words about Muhammad Ali, you tell the truth, no matter what, you tell the truth, like me also. Muhammad Ali was a special, special individual. I am not even close to that man, the things he did in his career, he is a special man. To even have my name next to that man is a truly special moment but I can't compare myself to the great man."
Interviewer,"If this fight does two million pay-per-view buys, how much money could you make?"
McGregor,"We're estimating three to three and a half million. I'm closing in on the $50m mark and for a mixed martial artist to make $50m in a MMA bout is breathtaking. Life is good; to think where we've come from... when I fought Nate Diaz the first time he was on $20,000 to show and $20,000 to win... the game has gone to so many new heights so quickly. It's a great time to be involved in the sport. Times are good so let's enjoy these momentous ocasions."
Interviewer,How long until you're a billionaire?
McGregor,I'd say by 35 I'll be a billionaire.
Interviewer,"Hell yeah, man. I just launched my own alcoholic sports drink. It's called Smirnoff Sport. Smirnoff Sport. It's just blue vodka."
McGregor,"Invest? Pfft. Why should I invest in some silly bank for years when I can go to Vegas and double my money in an hour? All I do is win, Charles."
Interviewer,"Okay. Last time you went to Vegas, what happened?"
McGregor,I lost.
Interviewer,"Conor, gambling is an addiction. I still have my issues myself. Yesterday I bet Michael Jordan $10,000 that I would get a hole in one."
McGregor,"the odds of that is fairly long, man."
Interviewer,"Okay, the question there, Trust a Stripper. Scenario"
McGregor,"I like that. She's freaky, right? Yeah, you bloody go for it."
Interviewer,Connor i'll give you credit where credit is due first things first you're the first.
McGregor,Athlete i've ever interviewed that is dressed better than me i just want that i just want that on the record okay.
Interviewer,So congratulations on that but i got to ask you this question as we sit here right now just days.
McGregor,Removed from your third year trilogy with dustin poirier why are you here why are you here.
Interviewer,Considering all that you've accomplished in your life and in your career why are you here for this fight i love.
McGregor,The trail of it stephen i love it all i love the fight i love the business about it i love.
Interviewer,Everything about it people ask me that all the time why am i here i'm you know am i too accomplished to be.
McGregor,Here you know but it's what i love to do it's all i do but if people are asking you that question.
Interviewer,They obviously feel that looking at you they believe that you may have lost something forget.
McGregor,Skill for a second i'm talking about passion you've got people questioning whether or not the passion to do this.
Interviewer,Is still there for you where do you think they get that from you know am i the hungry lion i once was.
McGregor,You know maybe not it's certainly different but i'm i'm i'm now the fat cat you know what i mean i'm the fat cat.
Interviewer,Pulling all the strings around here that's an even more dangerous individual so you.
McGregor,Know and i'm also you know cutting weight so i am hungry so i'm eager to get in there.
Interviewer,And prove all all the people uh you know all my doubters wrong and all my support is.
McGregor,Correct you know i do a lot of this for fans i love to i love to get in and get in and show my.
Interviewer,Appreciation for the fans some people don't believe some people believe however that you're not as.
McGregor,Dangerous as you used to be yeah well they don't feel that way okay.
Interviewer,Because because you know you every time i sit in in an interview it's oh why are you here you have too much money.
McGregor,You're too successful you're doing it all blah blah blah you know when the last.
Interviewer,Fight i kind of bought into that you know i was in the press conference and a guy was reading out.
McGregor,A quote of mine from many years ago where i was like you know talking about i can't wait i'm.
Interviewer,Gonna i'm gonna put my mother in a mansion i'm gonna you know my girlfriend's gonna have a car for.
McGregor,Every day of the week and you know i was feeding into that wow i did all this you know i i'm not even.
Interviewer,I'm where i am i'm grateful i'm proud of where i am and what i've achieved but there's a lot more left in me i'm still.
McGregor,Very young i'm very fresh in the game and i'm a dangerous man steve and i'm the most dangerous of them all you know.
Interviewer,I mean this i have 19 knockouts in my mixed martial arts career saturday night i will get my 20th it'll.
McGregor,Be my 12th ufc main event only 22 years of age fresh fresh is anything i'm ready to go.
Interviewer,So i'm gonna prove how dangerous i am because trust me in the mindset i'm in i'm really.
McGregor,Really dangerous this man is not it's not gonna be pretty what's gonna happen to this man in here.
Interviewer,Let's rewind the clock to the press conferences leading up to the sequel between you.
McGregor,And dustin poirier people looked at you and said you were incredibly nice you were nicer than anybody had ever.
Interviewer,Seen conor mcgregor be yes towards an opponent why was that you know i feel almost pity for some of.
McGregor,Them some people in the game to be honest i had a little bit of pity for dustin you know he's.
Interviewer,He's been around many years and i was it's not a pretty game for a lot of people in this business and i just came.
McGregor,Back and you know wanted to be respectful and you know give it give the jews and.
Interviewer,You know that this time you know it wasn't it wasn't reciprocated it was it was shady it's not that i didn't know.
McGregor,About it it's not that i didn't know the intentions but now now the intentions are clear and i'm.
Interviewer,Going to punish him for that how was it shady what did he do that major just a few.
McGregor,Things you know just a few things on national television tell us how what are those people throughout the build up.
Interviewer,With certain things certain discussions we've had and just just shady behavior i'm not in the.
McGregor,Business of explaining any of it but no the mana is going to pay for it when they look at you.
Interviewer,And they saw a guy that's that's the excuse in terms of dustin poirier nice guy you felt bad for him et cetera.
McGregor,Et cetera but you they're looking at you and they're saying maybe you were a nice guy because.
Interviewer,Again you're thinking about all that you stephen i am a nice guy okay you know i am a nice guy you know what i mean it's.
McGregor,Just about not translating it into the game you can't be nice in this business that's for sure no matter what you know.
Interviewer,What i mean you've got to be ruthless in it i've got to stay ruthless that's that's what i've been saying you know in.
McGregor,In the most rootless business of all i am the most ruthless and that's that's what it is and that's where.
Interviewer,Where i am what happened in the octagon in general you know there was a lot of free.
McGregor,There was a lot of freebies given there was a lot of free things given there was there was.
Interviewer,There was weight on the scales given there were shots in the octagon given there was plugs and support given.
McGregor,There's nothing free given this time everything is getting took and that's that's the mindset here.
Interviewer,Is that why you lost yeah i would say so there's a i mean there's a few things a tactical.
McGregor,You know i wasn't like i said i pitied the man to be honest which i wasn't i was looking past him i had a manny.
Interviewer,Pacquiao camp in place and that was three quarters of the camp so you know i've dialed it back in i've.
McGregor,Focused on the skills and the tactical errors and things like that and here we are you.
Interviewer,Know it's been full uh focus on mixed martial arts practice and i'm ready to go they look.
McGregor,At conor mcgregor right now the novices not the avid followers who know the sport.
Interviewer,I'm talking about fans i'm talking about fans i'm not talking about the fight but just the fan.
McGregor,Watching you fight they've seen you lose to the mega metal they saw him wrestle and maul and grapple.
Interviewer,They saw you lose to dustin pourie and they said those calf kicks really hit you i know what i peeled from it was.
McGregor,That excuse me that that that that leg that front leg of yours was ready don't.
Interviewer,Forget he also shuffled his legs 20 seconds in you know almost as fast as the tiger.
McGregor,Standing did that the dagestani shot for the legs for the takedown 15 seconds into the first round.
Interviewer,Dustin was 20 seconds you know they know what's what they can say what they want they know the danger that they that they.
McGregor,Face now it's you know i understand they fight they fight they fight me.
Interviewer,Afraid they die for the legs they try and stall positions they share look they look to.
McGregor,Kick the legs there's there's things i'm aware of now and i've made adjustments and i look forward to.
Interviewer,You know correcting it i became a fan of this sport in large part for watching somebody like.
McGregor,You knock people out you know that my record in mixed martial arts competition is 19 wins.
Interviewer,And one loss i only count knockouts i only count knockouts dustin's win justine's dustin's record is 13 wins.
McGregor,Two losses the only thing that's final in this business is a knockout all the other the decisions the tabs all.
Interviewer,That means nothing to me uncommon to take a man's head off and that's it you know what i mean i was.
McGregor,I was aiming to put a few holes in his head the last time now i'm going to put a few holes in his head and.
Interviewer,Send it into the bleachers what about somebody that looks at conor mcgregor and said excuse me sir that just.
McGregor,Happened to you what do you say to them about that yeah well here we go again i'm back.
Interviewer,You know what i mean so let's go i look at it and i say to myself right now conor mcgregor you don't want.
McGregor,To stand straight up with him still because he'll put you to sleep he'll knock you out.
Interviewer,But if you grapple him if you calf kick him excuse me you you you mess with his lower.
McGregor,Extremities that's hard for him to take that's not the fight that conor mcgregor wants to.
Interviewer,Because before he fought floyd mayweather he was talking about fighting manny pacquiao.
McGregor,He's addicted to the knockout addicted to striking if you go away from that that's how you.
Interviewer,Beat conor mcgregor to that you say what yeah try it now try it now you know what i mean this is i'm opening up the.
McGregor,Up the targets i'm opening up the toolbox you know what i mean it's just about going into my toolbox it's.
Interviewer,It's vast you know i mean my stances my approaches my attacks my shots so i'm gonna whip out all the weapons.
McGregor,Here and i'm aware of what you know that panic shot the panic in his body it's.
Interviewer,I see it all written all over him i saw it in the first fight when i sparked him you know what even started in the in the.
McGregor,Second foot i just was you know i just wanted to pat him on the head almost you know that's kind of the way i.
Interviewer,Felt with it but that's gone now he's gonna it's it's on now i'm interjecting because he.
McGregor,Actually admitted it was almost like a flash ko you hit him you caught him he sent an electric bolts through his.
Interviewer,Body and he said you know but you didn't follow up why not because here's another thing because i.
McGregor,Was trying to get the rounds i wanted to get rounds here but then i realized i'm not paid for the hour here.
Interviewer,There's none of that going on this time trust me on that i send electric bolts to his entire body.
McGregor,From his head to his toes you can see him rattled in the octagon in the first round and in the second.
Interviewer,Round he was out on his feet so he knows it as well as i know it and that's it's going to be.
McGregor,It's going to be a butchering let me rewind back and get a little personal with you here about something i did a.
Interviewer,Little research doing a little reading and i heard that conor mcgregor was once a.
McGregor,Plumber's apprentice that's right i'm back on the building sites now stephen i'm back on the.
Interviewer,Building that's my mindset yeah i'm i'm forbes the highest paid athlete on the forbes.
McGregor,List this year but now in my mind i'm back on the sites going back on the building so it's what.
Interviewer,A hoavey isn't a hard hat and a hammering in me hand i'm asking this question because in.
McGregor,Doing that research i read that your parents didn't want you to get into this game.
Interviewer,You even got into a fight with your dad until you want until you told him one day.
McGregor,You're going to see i'm going to be a millionaire and you told him that and you obviously excuse me.
Interviewer,When that conversation was going on with my parents you were in the same boat as my parents there was no game it wasn't i.
McGregor,Was getting into a game there was no game i made this game i built it up my father said to me who like at the.
Interviewer,Time i think it was chuck liddell and tito and those guys that were kind of you know what.
McGregor,And i was like how much do they make can you make a living out of it and you couldn't so i'm just trying to.
Interviewer,Convince i'm going to make a living now this i'm going to make it a business where you can make it a.
McGregor,Living and that's that was basically it so you know they didn't know what it was.
Interviewer,You know but that's where i'm going because you accomplished those goals obviously making your family proud you.
McGregor,Got a proud you're proud papa for connor jr all of the stuff that you've accomplished all the.
Interviewer,Great things that you've achieved in your career is it possible.
McGregor,That no matter what you say that you're sitting back knowing that everything's going to be.
Interviewer,All right no matter what that's the fire that people is questioning whether or not they're still.
McGregor,There with conor mcgregor because of that yeah what do you say today i mean i'm coming in to kill this.
Interviewer,Man i'm coming in with with vicious intent here murder shots.
McGregor,So you know what else can i say that's that's the way it is i don't care about nothing here i'm coming to take this man.
Interviewer,Out cold and if you don't do it it's doing it's dawn it's already done okay so if you do.
McGregor,Do it it's done what does that mean for your future in the ufc on to the next one on to the next one i.
Interviewer,I flew in on the ghost now we saw the allegiant stadium which is a phenomenal looking.
McGregor,Stadium i'd like to fight that at the end of the year this is what i love to do.
Interviewer,Born and bred to do this like i said you can go back way in time my name my family name are bred on the battlefield.
McGregor,Swinging pickaxes on the back of a horse you know what i mean that's where the mcgregor name comes from we come from.
Interviewer,The scottish highlands we're warriors it's all i know it's all we know so.
McGregor,I'm going to be doing it for a long long time yet when you say a long long time like you.
Interviewer,Said you're 32 years of age how long are we talking 332 that's you know what i mean i'm doing this.
McGregor,Until the day i go out right you know i mean if you look at tyson tyson came back at a.
Interviewer,Phenomenal performance against roy jones jr and i was you know it was great to see.
McGregor,Tyson come back like that great to see roy as well i thought i was very impressed with the.
Interviewer,With the performance people walk away from the sport it's not like your physical body lets.
McGregor,You down it's just a mental fatigue of it all you know what i mean tyson said a quote.
Interviewer,That uh i was interested in he said what would cuss say to you if.
McGregor,Uh if he was to cut the model custom customer said you now know that you're coming.
Interviewer,Back he said what took you so long and i agree with that you know what i mean i'm going to keep going and that's.
McGregor,It you'll never get rid of me this game this game is mine this city las vegas is a mine.
Interviewer,This world is mine saturday night i'm gonna show that and i asked this question because i also.
McGregor,Read about and people talk about things like this where okay it's the fame and people think about.
Interviewer,Okay so i've got fame and i'm comfortable and that might be the reason where in fact the reason might be the.
McGregor,People that you got to ward off because everybody wants a piece of you once you're that champion kamaru's mom.
Interviewer,Spoke about being a champion at home he is a bomb of a thing don't even don't mind him.
McGregor,You know there's no celebrity there's no fantasy that thing is nada nothing not even on.
Interviewer,The radar of anything fame and celebrity there's pitfalls for it but i am no celebrity people mistake.
McGregor,Me for a celebrity i break people's faces from money and bounce that's what i do.
Interviewer,So saturday night i'm gonna do it again who's next assuming you beat dustin i i i would go for that lightweight belt.
McGregor,The lightweight belt of course okay oliveira the the brazilian okay then we'll look to replicate we'll.
Interviewer,Go back up weight divisions and whatnot what about nate diaz the trilogy of course that's all that has to happen.
McGregor,That must take place that fight will take place of course i uh yeah about five times i'm thinking.
Interviewer,About that because again i go back to you connor the mega medal off loss.
McGregor,That's temporary where's he gumbo where's he now he's retired yeah boy he went splendan he's gone his.
Interviewer,Jocks fat and roid and i've been doing nothing in the sport.
McGregor,All he done in the sport yeah oh brilliant he was totally in the know fighting goes.

McGregor,And he was pointing blatant guys with like two wins and eight losses and all that's his record up until he's 20 you.
Interviewer,Know he has three fights on the trot in the ufc before that that that done him well and then before.
McGregor,That it's nothing it's pull outs couldn't make way you know that's that's that's.
Interviewer,Not the last time and now he's gone okay the last time we spoke you said stephen it's hard to get fights people.
McGregor,Are not giving me fights people are running from me so i haven't been able to been act to be active.
Interviewer,And that has a lot to do with some of the struggles that i've had in recent memory do you still hold that.
McGregor,Position that that's the reason why you've been struggling of course yeah i'm on a nice little path.
Interviewer,Right now with it's more it's not so much to the opponents there is a bit of that with the opponent of course.
McGregor,It's more the behind the scenes the business aspects and things like that you know that's kind of what's.
Interviewer,Halted it a little bit but like i said i'm on a great path now we've got this trilogy.
McGregor,We've got big things planned for after and i'm excited about it do you feel the ufc is in a good place or does the ufc.

McGregor,Need conor mcgregor yeah foreign but i am forever i am forever my accomplishments are forever my.
Interviewer,My knockouts are forever my rune is forever you know my domination of two divisions is forever.
McGregor,And you know what's what's to come is going to be more forever what if the ufc says that's true but we.
Interviewer,Need you to win yeah well we need you to win that's what i'm not so sad tonight.
McGregor,Saturday night you're going to see a dominant performance have you ever felt pressure.
Interviewer,No in your career the way are you feeling pressure no not at all no no not at all you think you think.
McGregor,The way the last one went i should be feeling less i should be less confident i'm actually more confident to be honest.
Interviewer,With you how it went so i don't feel pressure why are you more confident just the way the last.
McGregor,Fight went you know the way i was the way the way you know it's it's funny watching the.
Interviewer,Way the man thinks and the way the team the opposite team things like it's it's going to be nasty in here stephen it's.
McGregor,Going to be nasty in here on saturday night what's the difference between conor mcgregor that one in 2014.
Interviewer,To dustin and conor mcgregor lost in 2021 you know relishing in i'm accomplished.
McGregor,I've done it all i'm you know i i i've got rid of that you know what i mean how did you get rid of it.
Interviewer,I'm up here just told myself just went back went back in time you know what i mean not even back in time just.
McGregor,Just i sure should i lost it happened you know what i mean i'm about to lose and so that's what that says that.
Interviewer,Happening naturally you know what i mean sometimes that's sometimes the defeat is what you needed the feet is the secret.
McGregor,Ingredient to success you know what i mean so it's not that it's not that taking it out it's after.
Interviewer,Taking those accomplishments on my belly and i'm hungry to get back you know what i mean i'm a fat cat.
McGregor,That's hungry and that's a dangerous dangerous man when you lost to nate diaz you disappeared for a little while you.
Interviewer,Didn't want to do press tours or anything like that you were focused on avenging the loss to him yeah is that.
McGregor,The similar feeling to what you have yeah we're dusting right now or is it worse.
Interviewer,Yeah it's more venomous there's more yeah it's more venomous for sure why is that yeah just the way things.
McGregor,Have have went i don't know just you know another thing i've not brought my family with me this time.
Interviewer,You know and that has definitely there's it's hard to juggle it's hard to go face to face and want to.
McGregor,Tear through a man and then hold your your son or your daughter and give them a bottle.
Interviewer,You know and feed them and this type of thing so i've stayed away from that for this one and i've actually i feel i.
McGregor,Feel great i've not i've not switched roles almost i've stayed in the in.
Interviewer,In in that mode that i need to be in and you know even if i would say like rest days you know.
McGregor,Like on a rest day when i would have rest day around my family it's not really a rest day i'm playing with the.
Interviewer,Kids i'm busy it's my rest days have been true rest day so then when i go again for my next round.
McGregor,Of work i'm energized i'm refreshed and it's you know shown in the.
Interviewer,In the practice room was that your idea or was it a loved one someone close to you that suggested that's what you know.
McGregor,Yeah it's my idea you know it's not an idea it's just it's what i'm it's what i'm doing and that's that's the way it.
Interviewer,Is so saturday night when this fight is over.
McGregor,What will we walk away saying about conor mcgregor the greatest of all time what a.
Interviewer,Dangerous man shouldn't have doubted him the usual you feel that you've been doubted.
McGregor,Of course do you feel that's been fair yes i don't really care about it i'm just.
Interviewer,It's fuel to me it's fuel to me are you gonna be in the ufc for a long time to come or.
McGregor,We're gonna see you boxing as well you know for sure i'll box again like i'm back on the sights the boxing.
Interviewer,Is it's not even on the radar at the minute you know what i mean but i will do of.
McGregor,Course do you feel obviously fighting floyd money mayweather and making the.
Interviewer,Exorbitant amount of dollars that you made and well deserved nobody can knock you for making that.
McGregor,Decision steve reflected even floyd didn't make me anything oh he was on the forbes this before.
Interviewer,Floyd that's great oh i brought floyd i already got that with it you know explode he had the andro andre berto.
McGregor,Fight before i'm not going to knock you for that because floyd mayweather said that he.
Interviewer,Said i mean it was morning he was more grateful to you he told me that person he was more than great for.
McGregor,You but my last question to you because he has a picture of me in the gaffe in his house he has fallen a deal.
Interviewer,He does i have no problem with floyd i was in it wasn't a good look for him to to uh.
McGregor,Face against that man in the in his life logan paul yeah it didn't it didn't it didn't feel right.
Interviewer,Even his eye didn't he didn't even feel like he could see it in him we can go again if he wants you know.
McGregor,What i mean i feel that's going to happen at some stage down the line last question when by ko.
Interviewer,Or just to win saturday night sk oh out on a stretcher this man is gone stephen good to meet you my man all.
McGregor,Right thank you  .
Interviewer,"What's up Los Angeles! Ladies and gentlemen, the reigning and defending 155lb champion of the UFC, 'The Notorious' Conor McGregor."
McGregor,"Baby, we did it. I couldn't hear anything those motherfuckers said, thank fuck. This boxing press conference is a completely different set up to what we're used to, but 20,000 people, it's mind-blowing. I'm absolutely honoured to be here before you, to give you this great spectacle. And somebody's 0 has got to go!"
Interviewer,You just show up and I'm going to do the rest.
McGregor,I'm here right now.
Interviewer,You can get it right now.
McGregor,Do something.
Interviewer,You can get it right now.
McGregor,Do something.
Interviewer,You can get it right now.
McGregor,Do something.
Interviewer,You can get it right now. Talking that shit.
McGregor,"Am I the hungry lion I once was? Maybe not. It's certainly different, but I'm now the fat cat. I'm the fat cat pulling all the strings around here, and that's an even more dangerous individual."
Interviewer,Poirier acted shady?
McGregor,"I feel almost pity for some people in the game, to be honest. I had a little bit of pity for Dustin. He's been around many years. It's not a pretty game for a lot of people in this business. I just came back and wanted to be respectful and give the jewels, and f*ck that this time. It wasn't reciprocated. It was shady. It's not that I didn't know about it. It's not that I didn't know the intentions, but now the intentions are clear, and I'm gonna punish him for that."
Interviewer,I was looking past him.
McGregor,"I pitied the man, to be honest. I was looking past him. I had a Manny Pacquiao camp in place, and that was three-quarters of the camp."
Interviewer,They fight me afraid.
McGregor,"He also shot for the legs 20 seconds in, almost as fast as the Dagestani (Khabib Nurmagomedov) did. The Dagestani shot for the legs for a takedown 15 seconds into the first round. Dustin was 20 seconds. They know what's what. They know the danger that they face. I understand they fight me afraid. They dive for the legs. They try and stall positions. They shell up. They look to kick the legs. There's things I'm aware of now, and I've made adjustments. I look forward to correcting it."
Interviewer,For the record ...
McGregor,"My record in mixed martial arts competition is 19 wins and one loss. I only count knockouts. I only count knockouts. Dustin's record is 13 wins, two losses. The only thing that's final in this business is a knockout. All the other things the decisions, the taps all that sh*t means nothing to me."
Interviewer,Rewriting history.
McGregor,"I sent electric bolts through his entire body, from his head to his toes. You can see him rattled in the octagon. In the first round AND in the second round, he was out on his feet. He knows it, as well as I know it. It's gonna be a butchering."
Interviewer,Murder shots.
McGregor,I'm coming in to kill this man. I'm coming in with vicious intent here murder shots.
Interviewer,UFC needs me forever.
McGregor,"UFC needs me forever. I am forever. I am forever. My accomplishments are forever, my knockouts are forever, my run is forever, my domination of two divisions is forever, and what's to come is gonna be more forever."
Interviewer,"Conor, the fight obviously stopped in a horrible way. Give us your thoughts on how it was going."
McGregor,"I was boxing the bleedin' head off him and kicking the bleedin' leg off him. Usual shite,  dived to close the distance. THIS IS NOT OVER! If I have to take this outside with him, it's on outside. I don't give a bollocks."
Interviewer,He said that he believes that one of the kicks he checked broke your leg.
McGregor,"There was NO CHECK! There was not one of them was checked. Your wife is in my DMs! Hey baby, hit me back up. I'll chat to you later on! I'll be at your after-party. The Wynn nightclub. You look in bits, ya little ho! F*** him!"
Interviewer,"Conor, you missed with a punch and stepped back. Tell us what you felt. Tell us what you thought was going on?"
McGregor,"Just, the thing had separated and I bleedin' landed on the wonky leg, like Anderson Silva that time. Something similar to that. It's a fucking mad old business. F*** sake!"
Interviewer,"Listen, it was a wild fight, for as long as it lasted. I'm sure you'll be back and I'm sure you're going to want Dustin again. And I'm sure he'll oblige you."
McGregor,"I don't really care, to be honest."
Interviewer,"Oh, man! You're like a Dave and Busters if it was a person. Next, we got a man who wears $10,000 suits and just bought $350,000 Rolls Royce, UFC fighter, Conor McGregor."
McGregor,"Charles, I'm not going broke, so you can take your patronizing tone and shove it up your ass."
Interviewer,"Alright, I know you're not broke now, but let me ask you a question. How many high school friends work for you?"
McGregor,Six.
Interviewer,"Well, you better get yourself a Roth IRA, Conor. You know what that is?"
McGregor,Yeah. I've been in the IRA since protestants moved into my neighborhood.
Interviewer,"That is incorrect. Once again, the answer is always no.' Remember, if you own an animal that used to belong to a drug dealer or middle eastern dictator, that's a red flag. Okay, pick again, Gronk."
McGregor,"Invest? Pfft. Why should I invest in some silly bank for years when I can go to Vegas and double my money in an hour? All I do is win, Charles."
Interviewer,"Okay. Last time you went to Vegas, what happened?"
McGregor,I lost.
Interviewer,"Conor, gambling is an addiction. I still have my issues myself. Yesterday I bet Michael Jordan $10,000 that I would get a hole in one."
McGregor,"the odds of that is fairly long, man."
Interviewer,"Okay, the question there, Trust a Stripper. Scenario"
McGregor,"I like that. She's freaky, right? Yeah, you bloody go for it."
Interviewer,"I wanted to get your reaction today to the ruling that the Nevada State Athletic Commission made that will allow the request that you and Floyd made, to reduce the size of gloves from 10 ounces to 8 ounces. Can you give me your thoughts about that ruling?"
McGregor,"I'm very happy with how the Nevada State Athletic Commission handled it. I think they handled it fairly - they listened to both requests and just the overall approach to the decision and the referees, the judges, I think they were very fair throughout. So that was a good thing for me to see that they're taking into consideration both fighters' requests and I'm very happy with it."
Interviewer,What was your specific reason for wanting the smaller gloves?
McGregor,"You've got pros and cons on both sides. You've got both athletes asking for the request. And then you've got me also coming up in ounces from what I'm used to. I know some in the media are like oh no, it's 10, it's 8, but hey, look what I fight with. I fight in 4 ounce gloves, fingerless gloves. The knuckles are barely covered in what I am used to, so it benefits both in certain ways and I'm very happy with it."
Interviewer,What kind of gloves will you wear in the fight; what brand?
McGregor,"You know, we're still in discussion with that, so we'll see in a little bit."
Interviewer,I wanted to know might there be two or three things that people don't know about you that hasn't been written before?
McGregor,"Oh wow. I don't know. What you see with me is what you get. I am the same person on and off the camera. A lot of people like to say I'm not. Obviously there are different moments. You'll catch me against an opponent, I'm a little different but I portray myself as who I am. So what you see is what you get with me. And there have been many articles, many stories, many things written, but it's been okay I suppose. It's just I am who I am. I speak the truth for what I believe and people portray that in many ways. So I'm pretty open and what you see is what you get with me."
Interviewer,"Is there anything like you like to cook, maybe any other hobbies - changing diapers now lately?"
McGregor,"Yes. I'm razor quick with the diaper changes. Right now I have a nutritionist who's been with me for this time, bringing in the weight. So the cooking is out the window, my son has been living with me since, it must be three months now. We've had one hell of a camp. It's been one long stretch. A lot of hard, hard work. A lot of dedicated and focused work and then of course the nutrition has been top of the range, and that's why I'm at peak physical condition at this moment, ten days out. Now we are closing in on the weight cutting phase, and then we weigh-in and we fight. So that's about it. I'm by the book."
Interviewer,How have you approached the challenge of possibly going 12 rounds in this fight?
McGregor,"We've adjusted to the timing in my cardiovascular preparation. On the endurance phases we've stretched it out to accommodate the 12 three minute rounds. It's actually been very enjoyable to go from five, five minute rounds which is what I'm used to, which is 25 minutes, to 12 threes in boxing, which is 36 minutes. You've got to factor in there's not as much grabbing, but not to the extent of a mixed martial arts bout where you can end up on your back and you've got to tactically work your way back to your feet, which is very draining."
Interviewer,I'm wondering if you see a difference between how fans treat you and Floyd and whether you think race plays any role in that.
McGregor,"How many times have I been slayed by people? It's give and take here. I get my fair share of hate and my fair share of love also. I believe it's 50/50. I mean look at every boxing analyst. It's like I've been discarded and it's like I'm not welcome. I've suffered as well, so it is what it is. For me, this is athlete versus athlete. I was upset that Floyd tried to bring this in. I thought that was a weak move on his part. And he knows and his people truly know that it's not from me, not that I'm saying that there's not people on both sides that have this mindset where it's black versus white and this type of thing. But it's certainly something I do not condone. This is athlete versus athlete and two prime physical condition athletes about to take part in an amazing event and that's it on my end. So I'm disappointed to hear the way sometimes it's been portrayed, but I suppose it's just the nature of the game with the way things are going on in the world at the moment. But all I can do is stay focused on my craft and look to go out and put on a great performance for the fans who are supporting this event, as a whole."
Interviewer,What do you make of some of boxing circles being so dismissive of this fight? Is that something that motivates you?
McGregor,"It's certainly motivating. The disrespect and the disregard to my skill set is disappointing. I look at people so many times and their mind is closed. They've got a closed mind to how things can be done. It's a set way and there's no other way. Where if that was the case we'd never have reached across the waters and searched for other lands. And we'd never have went into space. Do you know what I mean? You've got to have an open mind and you've got to realize that there are other ways and there is a time and a place for every single moment. You've got to give respect for other disciplines and other styles. Like for instance, fighting is a complex game. There is a time and a place for every single attack and every single move. It's about finding the correct timing for it. So when I hear the way they carry on and they disregard and disrespect, it is what it is. I use it as motivation and I look forward to going in and educating them. But at the same time I get it. I'm coming in; I'm supposed to be from another sport and so again, I understand where it's at. But I'm just looking forward to August 26th, going in and proving what I'm saying and then educating the world on what martial arts are and giving the fans and everybody a good solid fight and earning my respect in this game also."
Interviewer,"In UFC you can't always wear personal sponsors, logos and endorsements like that. Are you looking forward to that? What do you have planned endorsement wise for August 26th?"
McGregor,"Yes. I've got a couple of endorsements coming up. And then as far as an apparel deal, we're close on an apparel deal. But at the same time, I'm in no rush. I've got good endorsement deals. As far as in ring endorsements, there are two that will be on the shorts I believe. Look, there are so many moving parts in the game. I'm just kind of trying to roll with it. And look, it's ten days from the fight time so I leave this to my agency and my management agency. I rely on sports management to handle that side of the business, but it is certainly a good business, so I'm very happy with everything that's been going on, on the endorsement side."
Interviewer,"I just wondered how your preparation and also the buildup kind of outside around you, has differed from your big UFC fights and whether that's affected your preparations at all."
McGregor,"Oh, look it's another day for me. It's another day of making history. It's another day of doing what I've been told I shouldn't be doing or I can't do. It's another mega blockbuster event. It's nothing new to me here. So the only difference in this buildup is I have a little son now with me. So we are here in Las Vegas as a family and my coaches and sparring partners and team, they have their multiple houses close by. So it's just been - I go to the gym and I train really hard for that given day. I come home, I rest and chill with my family and then I repeat."
Interviewer,Do you believe Floyd and what he has said about a rematch? Specifically on Jimmy Kimmel.
McGregor,"Yes. I didn't watch - I didn't hear the Jimmy Kimmel bit - but I got some snippets of it that someone sent - I got tagged in some stuff, but I didn't really hear much of what he said. As far as what he said on the world tour, he said he would step into the octagon. If he would do that he would have my respect. Anyone that's willing to step into a game like that where the limitations are so short, deserves respect. And that's at all levels whether it's at club level in a small hall, or a big stadium, it's still full of fans. If you get into that game or any combat sport game for that matter. I'll be here to grant him his rematch."
Interviewer,I wondered whether your mindset has changed toward anything he's done or anything that's happened in the buildup has made you more confident?
McGregor,I think the team I have around me has instilled confidence in me. And we have a solid team. It's been a growing team and an adjusting team throughout my career. And I think we just understand how it's done and how it's done correctly. And training has gone absolutely flawless. Everyone has a say; everyone listens to each other. Everyone's input is there and then we come to the best solution off of everyone's input and it's just been an absolute amazing camp.
Interviewer,"Floyd has worn eight ounce gloves in 46 out of his 49 fights. So for that reason, was there any consideration on your part, to wear 10 ounce gloves, just to inconvenience his side?"
McGregor,"No. Not at all. I mean I said that doesn't bother me. Again, I'm - I was already up six ounces from four to ten, so it's down a little bit from ten to eight, so how often he's worn the gloves never factored into it. I didn't even know that for instance, so that didn't factor into my thoughts at all. I do not care about his record. I do not care about his achievements. Every fight is on a fight by fight basis. So that's the way we approach it."
Interviewer,Was Robert Byrd the referee that you asked for? And what do you think that he will bring to this fight? Are you happy with it?
McGregor,"They gave us options. We didn't necessarily ask for any referee in particular. There was a referee or two that gave an opinion on the fight and it was like a little bit, if that's the case then it's very hard for them to be considered. So that was where we were at with it. And then the referee - I mean we were kind of hoping there was like a mix between an MMA - someone who had some link to an MMA bout. Robert Byrd is a phenomenal referee. We've watched him - I've watched him ref since the announcement has been made. He's a good ref. He lets the fight take place. He doesn't interrupt. He steps in when he should step in."
Interviewer,You weren't hoping for Tony Weeks then by any chance?
McGregor,"Tony Weeks was also a consideration. He was also selected - he has had - he has ref'd both MMA bouts and boxing bouts, so yes, he was definitely one on our list also. But we are happy. We are happy with the selection."
Interviewer,Did you have any issue with the three judges selected by the Commission?
McGregor,"I haven't really studied on the judging so it's very hard to find out like a history of the judges just yet. I believe my coach. I'm sure that coach has been already on that case. But I believe it's a fair mix across the board. I believe there's US, there's European. I think it's again, I commend the Nevada State Athletic Commission, they've done a hell of a job. It was fair all the way through. So we are very pleased."
Interviewer,"On Monday your former sparring partner, Paulie Malignaggi, said that he is trying to fight you. That's his intention. He would like to fight you. I'm wondering if this is something that you're interested in?"
McGregor,"Look, tell the kid to join the queue. Tell him to shut his mouth and join the queue, will you fast? Lord save me. He got his ass whooped and he went sprinting and I don't know what you want me to say about the guy, but hey, there's a big list of people that want to get in there and try and fight me, so tell him to join the queue and we'll see what happens after the fight."
Interviewer,"Some fighters like Terrence Crawford and David Haye have put out videos mocking your training. Have you seen these videos and if so, what do you make of the response to your training on Friday?"
McGregor,"I've seen some videos. It is what it is. It's lighthearted. I don't take it personally. If anything, I see stiffness in every single one of them. You must have the limbs free. Your shoulders must be disconnected. You must have the ability to disconnect your shoulders and reconnect it at the point of impact. With that skill set is how you can change a jab to a hook in the blink of an eye or a jab to an uppercut in the blink of an eye. It's the same thing with the hip flexors for kicks. If I throw a front kick to your midsection; if I'm tight in the hip and I can't free the leg like I can free my shoulders like I showed one of many training methods on how to free the shoulders, if I can do that with my hip flexor, I can change the point of impact from the belly and switch it up to the head in a millisecond."
Interviewer,You said that you want to defend your multiple world titles in MMA. Do you still consider yourself the featherweight champion?
McGregor,"Oh, 100%. I mean how can I not consider myself the UFC featherweight world champion and the UFC lightweight world champion? The current UFC featherweight world champion is Max Holloway, a man who I dismantled. And then the former was Jose Aldo. I still reign supreme over that division. And then also, the 155-pound division, I know there's talk of an interim belt. I had already won that belt and literally a month later, there was an interim scheduled."
Interviewer,Conor what have you heard as far as the metrics from the fight?
McGregor,I saw it pointing to record breaking numbers. All across the board. From the gate to the sponsorships to the Pay-Per-Views. Absolutely every angle.
Interviewer,"Conor, I'd like to start with you. Welcome back, of course, first things first. I mean, this entire pandemic. I think we've wondered. What would a Conor McGregor fight be like with no crowd, and now it's limited crowd. So now that you're kind of in the building, you're getting a sense for what the atmosphere is like. And we think about you, the bright lights are on the big crowds. That's when you perform, how does that affect your energy, your focus on fight night?"
McGregor,"I tell you what it feels pretty good right now. You know the crowd here. I know it's a small crowd, but it feels good, so I'm very happy to be here."
Interviewer,"Fair enough. But of course, as you said, this is a big fight, you know, pay-per-view headliner, but it's interesting. I mean, you have a victory over Dustin. There may be the title fight on the line, maybe there's not, we don't really know. So what provided kind of your daily motivation? I mean, you know, that extra practice, that extra grind that you might not want to go to. What, was providing that for you?"
McGregor,"My love for the game, my love for competition, my love for combat, and, you know, Dustin has put on an incredible run since our last fight. It's been a long time coming. Yes, I did get a over him the first time, but you know, he's rose right up and he's back up there at the top of the division. So I'm excited to go on and compete with him again."
Interviewer,"Fair enough. And you went out there and kind of made a pretty bold prediction. You said you think you can get it done in 60 seconds. You know, I know you have a lot of respect for him. But I wonder, that puts a lot of pressure on you, right? I mean, you win in the second round or you got shot decision. Maybe it was a letdown. So any regrets in making that prediction, do you stand by it?"
McGregor,"You know, well, I got him out of there in 90 seconds the first time. So I mean, I'm not that far off, but you know, I just started complete confidence in my preparation and in my abilities, I know Dustin's a hell of a competitor. I know there's questions here. He's heavier and he's up on it. He's up on a different weight, but he's more experienced. I feel I can do it. However, you know, there are question marks regarding conditioning and things like that. I know his team has been spouting about the condition and on that I have put in a lot of work to get myself correctly to the 155 pound frame. I got 40 seconds inside the octagon in 2020, which caused major frustration in my, you know, it's not enough. I need more. So I'm going to go in there and I believe, I believe I can get him out there and possibly we'll hit him early and hurt him. But, you know, I, I hope for, for a good long, a good long bell."
Interviewer,"Last thing for me, Conor, I mean, it's kind of a, I think probably no coincidence in the timing, but you were named in a lawsuit this week. I just wonder if you have any comments on that and if that's affecting your focus and I think that's a lot on your shoulders ahead of a big fight like this."
McGregor,"You know, it's all news. It's been, it was investigated totally over the course of two long years and I was cleared of any wrongdoing and, and that's it, you know, so much positivity in my life. I've got a great challenge ahead of me on Saturday, on Saturday night. And I'm very excited to get in. I put in an immense amount of work to get my frame correct at 155 to get my conditioning. You know, I want to answer questions here and I hope, I hope, I hope those things can bring it to me and we can, we can have a good fight."
Interviewer,"Fair enough. Thank you, Dustin. Just one last one for Dana. Please, Dana obviously this is a massive Pay-Per-View."
McGregor,"Can I, sorry you've got the hot sauce, Dustin. I'm actually very, I want to, I'd love to taste the hot sauce."
Interviewer,I've got a bottle for you.
McGregor,"I appreciate that. I've got a bottle of Proper for you. I love to share that. That's so, you know what I mean? He's putting in the work. I've been highly impressed. I think the whole business has been highly impressed. After that last many, many years ago, he rose up became champion. He's given so much back. I'm honored to share this octagon with this man. I know we have this competitive fire and it's still there. There's still that, you know, there is no denying that we, we have a clash and it's going to be a good firework field bell. And, but the respect is admirable for this man from me."
Interviewer,"I don't want to make it seem like we're up here giving each other back massages, but Conor's, I just want to clear the air, Conor's team, McGregor sports entertainment, did reach out to my foundation and they are, you know, starting the donation to the good fight foundation. And we have huge, huge plans for that. So Connor, man to man."
McGregor,"My Pleasure, buddy, my pleasure.Thank you."
Interviewer,You're going to help a lot of people with that.
McGregor,"Yes, yes and you, you."
Interviewer,Maybe you can help them with a distribution deal for the hot sauce.
McGregor,"Of course, of course. No problem. I got to taste it first though. You know, I don't put my name to something unless it's the proper, you know what I mean? Unless it's the finest."
Interviewer,"I got you. You'll taste it Sunday morning, then I'll give you a bottle after. Yeah?"
McGregor,That's perfect.
Interviewer,"And then question for Conor, Max Holloway declared himself the best boxer in MMA. You kind of laughed at that on Twitter. So I'm wondering, how would you rate the three gentlemen up here boxing compared to yours?"
McGregor,"I'll tell you what, the last press conference I'd done with  it was just myself and Dona up here. This time we've got three other men, four of us and we're all in the same division. So there are opponents, potential future opponents and I'm very excited about that. That's kind of what halted me in 2020, before the pandemic even hit, it was like nothing really presented itself. Well, here, we've got three up here. We've got Max skateboarding in the hallway, back at the hotel, so I'm very happy with that. I'm very excited to see how the bout goes in the coming event. I know the two men know the magnitude of where they are at and I'm excited, that's going to breathe an exciting fight. You know what I mean? It's going to be a lot of power thrown I hope. I would tell the two lads, if there is any stalling or any situation like that, to be separating and let the shots fly because there's a lot at stake here. And I wish both men, the best of luck."
Interviewer,"And then question for all four gentlemen up there, a unique situation four dads fighting on Saturday in the main up coming event. So are your kids aware of what's going down on Saturday? Are you going to let them watch? I know Conor has Conor Jr and his kids here, but are you going to let your kids watch on Saturday night?"
McGregor,"Sorry, say that again, was that to me?"
Interviewer,It's for all four. Are all four gentleman's kids going to watch the fight on Saturday?
McGregor,"My kids will watch them, after having them for a week and giving them the experience, they are a little young though. I don't think I'll have them in the arena for the actual bout, but there'll be watching their daddy for sure. And I look forward to going back after the fight."
Interviewer,"I told you guys, we'll see what happens this week."
McGregor,We'll get him. We'll get him.
Interviewer,"Hey, Conor, out of the available lightweights to you right now is Dustin the hardest challenge you could be facing?"
McGregor,"I think so, yeah. You know what, I'll always go. I'll always look to get the highest challenge. Dustin here has a win over Hooker, who is on stage here. He has a win, he knocked out Justin. So there's some high contenders already. And Justin and Tony knocked out Tony, who was another contender. So I think I'm right at the top here. I would make the case, if that man is continuing to dodge this and dodge the commitment of competing again, the title should be stripped and we should be engaging in a title fight. But I'm sure it will happen after this bout. I'm interested to hear what the excuses are, what will be said after the fight. But I predict a title strip."
Interviewer,"Going off prediction. You said, ""It's going to take 60 seconds to beat Dustin."" It might go longer. But do you have the shot in mind already that you want to finish in with? Or is that something that presents itself in the fight?"
McGregor,"I have a million shots. I've so many weapons in my arsenal and they're all fine tuned at this time. I'm in a phenomenal place. And I look forward to getting out and showcasing, painting my picture and putting on a beautiful performance for the fans around the world."
Interviewer,"Hey, just a quick one from me as the unofficial lightweight tournament commissioner, I just wanted to get available confirmation you guys, because listen, Charles Oliveira with the victory only over Tony Ferguson, he's pretty much through to the semifinals. Now we've got Justin, you've probably just come into the mix, but of course it's about you guys. The semifinal spots at stake, even if one or two, you come out of this weekend and fight for the title. I think most media fans, we want to crown a new undisputed lightweight champion by the end of the year. And I just want to get a quick confirmation-."
McGregor,"Book it, put me in. Book it, I'm in."
Interviewer,"Hey Conor, you looked like you had something, you were about to say there when Dana was talking about the pay-per-view numbers. Why don't you ."
McGregor,"Yeah. It just goes without saying. You don't go and come up and talk about EA Sports, UFC Selections and all this type of thing, when it comes to me. All the pay-per-views are treading. The Embedded has been record breaking again, it's almost double. The first episode of the Embedded has almost double all of the other Embeddeds that came out in 2020 by one, McGregor Serone. So it's trending in the right direction. I'm very excited about it. I'm very excited to get these guys on the platform here, you know what I mean? And like I said, and I'm happy to hear Chandler say this and Hooker say this, ""Take your chances and reap the rewards here."" So that's it, there's going to be two cracker fights and I'm ready. And as the guy from BT said about the tournament, book it, we're in and that's amazing. Let's go."
Interviewer,"One more for you, Conor. I know you kind of said at the beginning, the narrative about your conditioning and everything going into this fight. Can you just expand on that? And why do you think there are those doubts about your cardio?"
McGregor,"You know what, I think it's a myth. Obviously I had the Diaz one, the first Diaz fight I went from feather weight and then a month or so later I was at welterweight, that's obviously going to have impact and then there was other issues, but I think overall it's a myth and it's a myth that's... It's out there and that's it. I hope we can answer it. And I will answer it in time. At some stage, I keep showing up here, someone's going to be able to stay in the pocket with me and stay in there and fight with me. And I hope it's this-."
Interviewer,"Hey. Question for Conor. How are you doing? I've enjoyed listening to you talk about getting the frame right for 155. And it struck me, it's kind of crazy that you've only competed there twice. You've been in the UFC for, what, seven years? You've only competed at 155 pounds twice. Is that your ideal weight class, do you think? Do you think that's where you operate at the highest level?"
McGregor,"I've done pretty good in all the other ones as well. I've done good in them all. I've knocked secured belts in multiple divisions and I've secured knockout victories in multiple divisions. And I do feel great at this weight, but whatever I commit to I feel great at. When I do the welterweight belts, I feel great. I feel strong and big. I still feel this now. You know what I mean? I feel fast, also. So I'm excited to get in and showcase it. And like you said, I have not had that much fights at 155 pounds in the UFC, and I'm eager to put in a stint, to get a run going like I done with the featherweights. I think I went seven or eight fights within the space of a year and a half. That's what I'm looking for here if they can match me up."
Interviewer,"Yeah. And one Tweet that you... I don't know exactly when you put it up but you said that after you won the 155 pound belt you wondered, maybe you should've jumped up and gone for that 170 pound belt right away. And I just wonder... Obviously things have worked out well for you. The Mayweather fight made you a whole lot of money, but have there ever been... Do you think about that sometimes? ""What would have happened had I not left the sport?""."
McGregor,"Yeah. Sometimes I think, ""Man, I should've just stayed in the featherweight division and fought Ricardo Lamas and all those type of guys and I've just been in the featherweight division."" I always look to challenge myself and seek greater heights. And although I've been the champion at 155 pounds. I have not had much time at this weight in the UFC, and this is what I wish to do now."
Interviewer,Last thing for you
McGregor,"All of those events were 2018. It's now 2021. What I will say is as long as we fight again, there'll be no issue. And that's it. If he continues to run, well then I'm not sure. We'll see what happens."
Interviewer,"Overall, this is the toughest competition that I will ever face in my entire life. But I think when you look at my resume, when you look at my track record, guys like Eddie Alvarez, guys, like Benson Henderson, these are champions that were here in the UFC. Granted it was a couple of years later, but I've been competing at a high level since I was 14 years old, as I said. So I've been dreaming of this day or visualizing this day just in case it ever did come, and now I'm fully prepared to take the opportunity head on. And absolutely, all these guys are the best in the world. And the UFC lightweight division is the most hyped, most electrified, most energetic division in the UFC today. And it was a perfect time to insert my name into the mix."
McGregor,"I bring all of the discipline and the drive that I learned in my martial arts training and preparation and competition into the business world, and it's helped me tremendously. It's why I always would urge any parents around the world to get their children into mental martial arts. Any type of combat sport. And it's not necessarily to compete. If they wish to compete, well then they can compete. But the things that they learn through martial arts, you cannot learn it anywhere else and it will translate many other things, especially the business world. So it's pretty much the same. Two of the same."
Interviewer,"I think we've seen a lot of growth in Conor. One of the baddest men on the planet and now one of the most daddest men on the planet. All of us, as you alluded to, we're all dads. We all started coming up hungry, humble. And now we're dads and really fighting for a different purpose. So you see that in him, you see that in Dustin, you see that in Hooker, and you see that in myself. So man, either way, Saturday night we're all going to go out there, put on a great show. Everybody by that pay-per-view. Let's go."
McGregor,"Appreciate that, brother. Thank you."
Interviewer,"Conor, how are you doing mate?"
McGregor,Yeah.
Interviewer,"You've evolved so much in your fighting career, but I think you've always been an artist inside and outside the cage with your fighting style and your ability to sum up things in such a poetic manner. But can you just talk to me a little bit about how you define yourself as an artist?"
McGregor,"I'm just an insanely driven young man. You know what I mean? I'm passionate about what I'm passionate about and I give it my all. That's it. I'm a hard worker, through and through. If something needs to be done, Conor McGregor gets it done. Make no mistake about it."
Interviewer,"That's awesome. Staying on the topic of art, I wanted to read you a quote from 2013 that you said. It's really poignant and I think it deserves to be read out in full, so just bear with me. ""I've lost my mind on this game, like Vincent van Gogh. Dedicated his life to his art and he lost his mind in the process. That's happened to me, but fuck it. When that gold belt is around my waist and my mother has a big mansion, my girlfriend has a car for every day of the week, and my kids kids get everything they ever wanted, then it will pay. Then I'll be happy I lost my mind. Can you just reflect and talk to me about how that makes you feel, hearing that in 2021?"
McGregor,"Yeah, it's been some ride. I've got it done and I'm up here mad as a brush. I've been through what all, my friend. I appreciate that. And it's been a wild ride for me. It's not been easy at times, but what a life. And I'll tell you what, I wouldn't want it to be any other way. I'm very excited to be back here. I'm very excited to have fans back in the area. I'm very excited about the competition, the multiple competition. I just feel invigorated. And as you said about artistry and all, and Vinny van Gogh. I'm going to paint a beautiful picture here inside this octagon on Saturday night, and I'm very excited to do so."
Interviewer,"We know the motivation behind Dustin's fight against Conor McGregor is to beat Conor McGregor and to become the champion within one year. But you, Conor McGregor, you fought Jose Aldo, and you elevated the standard and then you fought Eddie Alvarez and you became the double champ, and you're just elevating standards each time. So, beating Donald Cerrone last year, and now you're fighting with Dustin Poirier; what's your motive? After this? After seven, eight years of competing in the UFC?"
McGregor,"I feel like I'm only starting, man. Everyone kind of wants to, ""Hey, Conor, you've done it all. You're so rich. Richer than Dane, over here. What are you doing here?"" I'm like, I'm allowed here, I want to be here, I want to perform for the fans. I'm a young man, I've got many highlights, all the money, all the belts, everything that comes in and that goes, what lives on are highlights"
Interviewer,"Conor, question down here. Talk to me about how your training camp went in Portugal. I know it was kind of secluded due to the lockdown. You've had secluded camps in the past, do you think this is something that you want to continue with going forward?"
McGregor,"Yeah, I'll tell you what. It's been a phenomenal camp all across the board. We were in Lagos in Portugal, we were in Dublin, we were in Dubai, and now we finish it up here. Yeah it was an amazing camp. I have an amazing team of people around me, all across the board, from the nutritionist, from my coaches in mixed martial arts, in jujitsu, in boxing, in wrestling, and all my sparring partners... It's a phenomenal team I have... as well as my conditioning coaches. I'm looking forward to going in and represent them all my team's hard work. You know what I mean? We put a lot of hard work in here and I'm going to go in and do my team proud."
Interviewer,"And Conor, this one is for you. I know you've been asked a lot about this whole Khabib thing, but I'm just curious to know"
McGregor,"You know, I don't really care. I did not say that, Dana said that. Let's just get to the fight. All these men are up here, there are plenty of challenges, it's a tough business and things have gone on in his personal life. I don't wish him any harm. Like I said, it was in 2018, a lot of time has passed. The world knows this fight is not over. This war is not over. The sport needs it to happen, the people need it to happen, I'm not going to chase it if he doesn't want it. And that's it. I'll keep my calm and move on. And that's what I'm doing, I'm back here at the 155 pound division, I'll show the world what's what over time and that's it. It begins on Saturday night against Dustin Poirier."
Interviewer,"Finally, my last question. I heard Dustin say that he actually kind of enjoyed the fights during this past year without a crowd because he felt it was a bit more intimate and he was more focused. I'd like to know, does having or not having a crowd affect you in any way when you're inside that octagon or not really?"
McGregor,"Yeah, no, a fight is a fight for sure when you're inside that octagon. I was actually very, very excited to compete with no crowd, at the start I was like, ""Oh, I don't know"" but over time then I really wanted to see and hear my power, and my velocity, and my precision. I wanted to hear my shots whistle through the air with no background noise and, and really put a statement out there of the difference. I almost got to do it, but there's not that many fans, only a couple of thousand; my power, my speed, my precision, my velocity, my whistle will still whistle strong on the night. And I'm excited to show."
Interviewer,Thank you.
McGregor,"Thank you guys, thank you."
Interviewer,"Conor, clearly, I'm sure, frustrated with the result, not what you're hoping for, but what are the emotions like for you right now?"
McGregor,"Yeah, it's heartbreaking, John. It's hard to take. Damn. . So, it is what it is."
Interviewer,"We think about your mental toughness and what you're made of. I mean, was that difficult for you to know, like, This leg just isn't working anymore. Like there's, I'm, I'm dead in here.""?"
McGregor,"I was going to tough it out. Do you know what I mean? I toughed it out as much as I could, but it was an unusual one , where I would feel okay in sparring or something, checking that side."
Interviewer,"You said the inactivity just caught up to you. I mean, is it physical? Is it a timing? what was the cost of the inactivity?"
McGregor,"It's the whole shebang. You know what I mean? But I have no excuses here. It was a phenomenal performance by Dustin, and that's it. I don't know what I ...."
Interviewer,"Last thing for me, Conor, Dana was here earlier and he said like he hadn't talked to you yet, but he was like, ""This could go one of two ways. Either A, Conor gets hungry, you know what I mean? It drives him and he comes back better than ever. Or he walks away. He know he's got money in the bank, he doesn't need to do this."" As you sit there right now, which of those two paths sounds right?"
McGregor,"Yeah. I'll certainly regroup, I'll regroup and pick myself up, you know what I mean? Get up off the floor and go again and that's it. Styles make fights, there's many great stylistic match-ups out there. Me, myself and Dustin are one-and-one myself, and Nate are one-and-one. There's many good match-ups for me and I'll adopt a different approach for the trilogy, I feel with Dustin, because those leg kicks are not to be messed with. You know what I mean? A that calf kick, the low calf kick, I've never experienced that."
Interviewer,"Conor, was the the leg something that you felt growing over time as he landed more shots, or did it suddenly happen? Because in the final sequence, there's a moment where it looks like your leg suddenly goes dead and your balance goes?"
McGregor,"Yeah, it was accumulating, accumulated for sure. I knew when I seen that he had Tiago Alvarez in the corners like these, I knew what was coming. I knew he likes to kick the low-key. He's also experienced that kick before, himself, Kagan. That's my first time to experience that. But one of them soon gain early and Tiago said, ""That was a good one."" And I was in my head thinking, ""You bastard, it was a good one."" And then it just started accumulating up. But, fuck it, it is what it is, man. I'm not that upset over it, which is another weird one for me, you know what I mean?"
Interviewer,"Dustin looks like he's going to go on and fight for a title now. You mentioned his name. Do you think now's the time to do the Nate rematch? Would that be a fight that makes sense for you, or you're not even thinking about that?"
McGregor,"No, I'm not. I was just kind of thinking I have a lot of... Like I said, styles make fights. I adopted a similar approach against Nate, but I was above the leg, it was the leg kick above. And that low one is an interesting one, for sure. It's a very interesting kick, same stance. Opposite stance, it's nothing. You know what I mean? He threw, actually, an opposite, a right low kick, and I checked it clean. But the outside ones wrapping around. And even though I felt like it toned the leg out, checked it, and you have to almost turn it right out and it has to hit the bone, it can't hit the muscle. And that's it."
Interviewer,"You mentioned the clench. There was a moment where you were both against the cage trading shoulder shots with each other, and it looked like you were having a conversation or something. Were you guys talking to each other?"
McGregor,"Yeah, just the usual cracking back and forth, one for one it was. But I felt the better ones, anyway."
Interviewer,"And last thing for me, Conor, you say you're sitting there and you're not upset and that's a bit of a weird one. Is part of that because this is something that you love to do, otherwise you wouldn't be doing it anymore? And the fact is, despite the loss, you finally have been able to compete again for the first time in a year. John mentioned about, ""Our people worry you might sort of go off and leave the game."" Are you still happy right now? Are you happy that you just got to compete?"
McGregor,"Yeah, I am, I am happy. I'm disappointed, but I'm happy for sure. I got to come out here and do this fight here in the Middle East, put on a show for the people. I done me best. And things don't go your way at times, but pick yourself up and carry on. I've got a lot of good things going on in me life, if you know what I mean? So I'll just keep me head high and that's it. And take the shots, take the licks and just fucking keep on going."
Interviewer,"Conor, right here. A lot was made, coming into this fight, of the sheer size of Dustin. A lot of people said he was cutting down from 180 to 155. Did you feel the strength or size of him in there?"
McGregor,"No. I was way stronger in the clenching. And I turned hm against the fence, I had him pinned. And we both had to make one... Well, I made 155, they made 156. But no, he just fought a good fight, an experienced fight. He's been in here a lot, almost more than double the amount of time I've been in here, in the cage. And that's it, it's a hard... You keep showing up, you'll get there. And like I said, I'm very happy for Dustin and his wife, and the things that they've been doing. I'm proud and honored, like I said before, proud and honored to share the octagon with him and we all want a piece."
Interviewer,"I don't want to sour your mood, but Habib has responded to your loss on Twitter. He says, this is what he wrote. He goes, ""This is what happened when you changed your team, leaving the sparring partners who made you a champion and sparring with little kids far away from reality."" Do you have a response to that at all?"
McGregor,"My team has been the team since day one, I've not changed anything. It is what it is. Respect the athletes, and that's the character of the man, for sure, behind the mask. And whatever, what's he want to do? Does he want to come back or no? Because he's not throwing to no leg kicks, you know what I mean? I got up off the ground against Dustin, I turned Dustin. You know what I mean? Look at little pockets of that sequence where he fights. Like I said, styles make fights."
Interviewer,Yeah. Dana did say it's-.
McGregor,"That's fighting talk. So if you're coming back, come back. You try and do it. So that's that."
Interviewer,"One of the main comments right now on social media from all the fans is, ""Even legends can lose."" How do you feel to have such an amazing fan base that supports you until the end?"
McGregor,"I'm very, very grateful for the support I receive. It's got me up off the floor many times throughout my competitive life and me personal life. And that's what I said, I'm proud and honored to come here before you and put a show on for people of the world. To do this through Christmas, to go the 155, to give it a shot. I done this for the support, for the fans, for the people that support me. And all I can say is I'm sorry I let the side down. And I'm fresh. I'm healthy. There was no trauma blows, there was no... It's just me leg is like a football. Below me knee is literally like a football, an American football inside me suit pants. It went right up into the hip."
Interviewer,"Hey Conor, a wise man once said, ""He who fears being conquered is sure of defeat."" And although we didn't get to see the masterpiece that you intended on creating tonight, we got to see a sensational display of heart, charisma and pride all week. I feel that the people that will take the most away from this will be your children. Leading by example in defeat. And if that's not a masterclass, I don't know what is. Do you agree?"
McGregor,"Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. You've been great all week and now you're bringing things back to make me well up."
Interviewer,Thank you.
McGregor,"I'm very happy to have me kids here and me family with me, side by side. And I am who I am at this time, you know what I mean? I'm a different man for sure. And the competitive fire is still in me. And like I said, I will regroup and adjust and come back. I've done it before and I'll do it again."
Interviewer,"Thank you, my friend."
McGregor,"I thought it was great, it was just like fighting in the prelims. I felt good and that's it. It felt no different, inside the octagon is inside the octagon, and I just need more time in there. Just to be settled. And then, I just need to make me adjustments and go for it."
Interviewer,"And after what we saw today with Michael Chandler, I don't know if you had the opportunity to watch the knockout?"
McGregor,"I did, yeah. I thought it was a beautiful knockdown. it was a good fight."
Interviewer,"Dennis said that probably this will be the next title fight. Who do you pick, Chandler or Poirier?"
McGregor,"I don't know, man. I don't know. I don't know. Don't just write me off yet. I'll make me adjustments and keep moving, so anything can happen in this game. And I'll go back, I'll get healthy and I'll re prepare. I've built an incredible... I've got to a great place in me body, physically. And I'm going to continue to grow on that. You know what I mean? I get the swelling down in the leg and I'll get back to me training and me cardiovascular work, me strength work, me skills work, and just keep living the martial arts life."
Interviewer,"Conor, can I just... Over this way, sorry. You've spoken, there's so many people talking about you when it's like Manny Pacquiao or Floyd Mayweather, and getting into boxing and all of that kind of stuff. Does something like today make you think, ""I want to concentrate on one thing,"" or are you still going to be kind of open-minded to do that?"
McGregor,"Geez, there's none of them leg kicks in boxing anyway. But look, I always did want to focus on me MMA courier, but I'm also open. I'll just see what happens. I don't know what will happen. That Manny fight was happening, it was as good as done. So I don't know, man. I just want to get in and just get back into a bounce, and especially against that style of fighter, and not take those kicks. Don't play with those kicks. Although, I don't know. It's just a motherfucker to take, man. That's me mind's going, so I'm just trying to replay all the sequences. And I haven't watched the fight back yet. I just had a shower and came here, and I look forward to watching that back."
Interviewer,"How did you feel in that first round, though? Because I thought, just me here, that you're striking was going really well and stuff. Was it just a case of that first kick where was you was like, ""Ah.""."
McGregor,"It wasn't just... Yeah, no. It just kept building up, you know what I mean? And then I threw one at him, I was like, ""Throw your kicks, man."" I wanted to let him walk... Even when we were in the clench, he got the take down and I got back up and turned him. I was like, ""Right, lovely."" Where I'm getting more time in the octagon, that was in my head. I was like, ""Lovely now, we got a bit more time in here now."" So I wasn't in a hurry. And you know me, I come out, ""Wha!"" And I go over it. So there's a lot of me head now. I'm not even like, ""Oh, maybe I need to go back that way."" I'm just going to be who I am in the moment and take things as they come. And that's it."
Interviewer,"You say the Pacquiao fight is probably on the back burner now, is that because of the leg, I assume?"
McGregor,"I don't know how long. It's muscle, it's all muscle. It's just deep into the muscle and it's just a complete dead leg right the way up. It's no bone, no nothing, not a mark on the head. I'm just plain good, man. It's just  instead of a bleeding dead leg. But it is what it is, man. Fair play to him, it was a smart fight. He got the shot, he got me down in the first, man. I should've just tied it up in the fucking... When I caught a few of them kicks, I should have laid and just pressed him against the fence and keep beating him in the fence. Hit him with a lovely elbow on the temple that hurt him. Should have just kept mauling him."
Interviewer,"And lastly from me, I want to talk about the evolution of your character that we've seen. You're very humble and you've been very respectful and classy for this whole process. Talk to me, do you think becoming a father has really brought that out of you and that makes you appreciate things like this that much more? You can go to your family after this. That's why you're maybe not as upset as what you said?"
McGregor,"Yeah, but I mean, yeah, of course. But I am upset, I'm upset. I'm sad, but I'm still a contender. I'm happy. And like you said, I've got a lot going. It's not nice going back without the win, you know what I mean? That's for sure. But life is like that sometimes and we pick ourselves up and keep going."
Interviewer,"Conor, just real quick to your left over here. I know you would have rather had the win, but Dana did say when he was in here that this was one of the two or three highest selling pay-per-views in UFC history. What does that mean to you and say about your drawing power still at this point?"
McGregor,"Yeah, it's always good. I tried to come in and give a show all across the board, in the lead up and in the fight week and in the fight itself. Sometimes you come in here and make magic, and sometimes you don't. And I'm happy with all my records and I'm happy that I got to compete and do it again. It is what it is."
Interviewer,"What do you think is a bigger trilogy, Dustin or Diaz?"
McGregor,"I think they're both pretty, pretty big. Two south paws as well, which is interesting. Yeah, they're both there, so see what happens."
Interviewer,Is there one you want more?
McGregor,"Yeah, I don't know. I just want to regroup for a minute, to be honest, you know what I mean? I want to just watch the fight and see where I'm at. Right now, I'd probably say Dustin, obviously. It's fresh, and that's it."
Interviewer,"Conor, just one last question here. Over here to your right, just over here. The other day you were saying, ""What does the champ champ do? He does it again."" The lightweight title, where do you see yourself in that now? Is that something that you really feel you want to regain before you retire? Or are you comfortable just taking fights you just mentioned?"
McGregor,"No, I would love to get in and get back on the horse and secure the new belt with the Irish flag on it, for sure. And anything can happen in this business, as long as you stay active, as long as you compete. Things shape around you, you know what I mean? You show up, you reap the rewards and that's it. That's what's happened for Dustin tonight, and it's what's happened against me tonight. I'll keep me on the prize, for sure. All right, thank you guys so much, I appreciate it. Thank you all."
