Interviewer,There is very little information on private individuals the intelligence services cannot get access to.
Snowden,The reality is this
Interviewer,"Snowden waited to release the documents, hoping Obama would bring change."
Snowden,"Obama's campaign promises and election gave me faith that he would lead us toward fixing the problems he outlined in his quest for votes. Many Americans felt similarly. Unfortunately, shortly after assuming power, he closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guant√°namo, where men still sit without charge."
Interviewer,He fears that the US will stop at nothing to silence him.
Snowden,"All I can say right now is the US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped."
Interviewer,Snowden is confident he has the public on his side.
Snowden,"If the Obama administration responds with an even harsher hand against me, they can be assured that they'll soon find themselves facing an equally harsh public response."
Interviewer,But he is less impressed with the media response.
Snowden,"Initially I was very encouraged. Unfortunately, the mainstream media now seems far more interested in what I said when I was 17 or what my girlfriend looks like rather than, say, the largest program of suspicionless surveillance in human history."
Interviewer,Encryption offers protection.
Snowden,"Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it."
Interviewer,He isn't too upset about being called a traitor by Dick Cheney.
Snowden,"Being called a traitor by Dick Cheney is the highest honor you can give an American, and the more panicked talk we hear from people like him, Feinstein, and King, the better off we all are. If they had taught a class on how to be the kind of citizen Dick Cheney worries about, I would have finished high school."
Interviewer,And if Snowden had been planning to defect to China he'd be petting a phoenix right now.
Snowden,"The US media has a knee-jerk 'RED CHINA!' reaction to anything involving HK or the PRC, and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct. Ask yourself"
