Interviewer,"Dr. deGrasse Tyson, it's great to be with you here at the 68th Annual American Humanist Association Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. Is this your first humanist conference?"
Tyson,"My very first. I didn't even know they existed. I guess I'm a little out of it, being a scientist all my life."
Interviewer,"Well, we're really glad you're here and that you've discovered us, in a sense. What are your impressions so far?"
Tyson,"Everybody is friendly, the topics are all very interesting, and it's clear that there is quite a lot of work to be done to make sure we have the country that we all thought we were given 230 years ago when it was founded."
Interviewer,Do you consider yourself a humanist?
Tyson,"I've never identified with any movement. I just am what I am and occasionally a movement claims me because there is resonance between my writings and speeches and what they do, and that's fine; I don't mind that. But no, I have never been politically or organizationally active in that way. Astrophysics, that's what I identify with."
Interviewer,"And as an astrophysicist, do you find it a challenge that people may be less interested in the actual science that you're doing and want to hear more about your position on science in our culture?"
Tyson,"The relationship of science to our culture is of fundamental importance in the twenty-first century, where whether or not we embrace science as a nation will play directly into our ability to compete economically with other nations that already value what it is to invest in science and technology. Whatever people feel the need to explore with me, I'm happy to go there with them. I spend enough of my life as an expositor of the frontier of science; I don't need to do that every time I'm in front of an audience. Clearly this  audience has an important mission ahead of it and I would be very happy to share my life experiences with regard to that mission, compare notes, and look for best and worst practices."
Interviewer,"People argue that Dawkins and Hitchens and others are raising the profile of nontheism in general. But human beings are complex and even conflicted at times, so it's reasonable to think about re-tailoring your approach once you have the spotlight. Certainly in science you want to ask questions and then go in search of the answers. I do think scientists working as scientists and touching on these issues are really the best spokespeople that we could hope for. So thank you so much for doing what you do."
Tyson,"You just put an even greater burden on my shoulders saying that scientists have to first figure out how the universe works, then we've got to get it out there to the public!"
Interviewer,"Speaking of the public understanding of science, you've talked about getting letters from kids and so forth. Do you do much in science education with children?"
Tyson,"Hardly any of my professional activities directly target children. At the American Museum of Natural History there is an entire education department made up of people who are trained in K-12 cognitive processes and curriculum. Occasionally I come in and make a presentation for the kids. That being said, the books I've written are very readable by kids, and the TV show that I host, NOVA scienceNOW, has a playful spirit that kids can enjoy and that resonates with them."
Interviewer,"Your ability to communicate science and your ideas is so sharp. As a writer, as well as a presenter, do you find that you have a very specific technique for communicating?"
Tyson,"Technique implies that one invokes a method. And you repeat that method because it has shown to be successful. What I've found, however, is that one should not have any method at all because everyone is different, and so you come prepared for any audience at any time, any age, any demographic, any political leaning, tolerance for humor, religious sentiment, and so forth. All these factors influence the ability of a person to receive the message you are giving them."
Interviewer,Have you shared this imperative with teacher groups?
Tyson,"I gave a talk to the National Science Teachers Association. That is an important group of people, K-12 educators in science. I asked by show of hands how many people, because I knew it would get an interesting reply, didn't own a television. Half of the hands went up. Of those who owned a television, I asked how many only occasionally used it to watch a movie, and half of the hands went up. So fully three quarters of that audience whose job it is to teach the next generation science don't watch television, yet the average American watches thirty or forty hours of television a week. That disconnect is pedagogically fatal."
Interviewer,I imagine that was a little controversial.
Tyson,"Yes, and when I say pop culture I don't mean only the TV shows that are kind of cool and interesting. I also mean the hit shows. I'm talking about Dancing with the Stars. I'm talking about the reality shows most educators thumb their noses at as being of no educational or intellectual value. Yet clearly millions of people watch them every week so there is a disconnect. Once there is a disconnect, you're not communicating."
Interviewer,The message I'm getting from you is of an unending need to understand human beings as both complex and able to be stimulated with the right approach. Thank you so much for communicating it to us so effectively!
Tyson,"Any moment would have been good, but it's a matter of how many forces align to actually make it happen ... It's not that it's now versus three years ago. It had to happen no matter what. Anywhere between 30 and 35 years is a typical length of what people think of as a generation. There's got to be at least one Cosmos a generation; otherwise, we're not doing justice to sharing with the public the role of science and bringing the universe down to Earth."
Interviewer,Can you give a few examples of the ways the science on Cosmos has been updated? Will the new series incorporate any discoveries of the past 34 years?
Tyson,"If you only think of Cosmos as a science documentary, then the natural obvious question would be, Well, it's been 35 years. What has changed? However, Cosmos wasn't only that, and it wasn't even mostly that. Cosmos is mostly Why does science matter to you? Why should you care about science? Why should society care about what scientists say? How can you empower your own destiny by becoming scientifically literate?"
Interviewer,"What is our effect on the environment? Will we be good shepherds of this Earth as we go forward? Do we know enough to be good shepherds of this Earth? Do we understand the risk of asteroids that could render us extinct? These are broad questions, and Cosmos takes some element of science and shows you why it is way more relevant to your life than you ever previously imagined."
Tyson,"Well, there's always creative tension, and that's never a bad thing if people who are participants in the creative tension are intelligent and rational. Intelligent, rational people can disagree and figure out why they disagree, and maybe you go with one person's view or another person's view. Or, the disagreement leads to a third view that one or the other didn't have, and the third is better than both. So, all three of those scenarios would happen."
Interviewer,What was the most difficult part of making the reboot?
Tyson,I have an unromantic answer for you there
Interviewer,"You make such a great tribute to Carl Sagan at the end of the first episode, when you talk about your first meeting with him during high school. How has this project been important for you personally?"
Tyson,I have a personal philosophy in life
Interviewer,Did you meet Sagan any other time?
Tyson,"I'd say we only met like four times. The first time was very significant to me, as is obvious from that retelling. The last time is also significant. It was his 60th birthday bash. He would die two years later. It was a celebration, it was a dinner and there were all these testimonials. And you would sit there and listen to all these testimonials, and you would say, My gosh, nobody could be that amazing. You know, old people, young people, middle-age people, colleagues, janitors were coming up, singing the praises of Carl Sagan. And then, after that, he gave a public talk, and it was the best public talk on any subject I had ever heard in my entire life. Not the best, the greatest. And I said, Yep, he deserves every one of those accolades. Every one of them."
Interviewer,Where were you in your career then?
Tyson,"I was well established. I knew when I first met him that I wanted to study the universe. I was not one of the people who was turned on to the universe by him. His influence on me was recognizing that there is an appetite for a scientist who would sit down on the couch next to you and talk about the universe. That's what he did when you saw him on television. He's sitting right next to you. Not as a professor, he was a guy just trying to get you comfortable with the cosmos. The fact that that was possible, the fact that a scientist had talent to do that, the fact that people responded so warmly to it, told me that if I'm ever in the position to bring the universe down to Earth, that's a good place to start."
Interviewer,"I wanted to bring up Bill Nye, I hear you guys are friends."
Tyson,"Yeah; in fact, I count him as my best friend. In modern times, he's my best friend. We text and email three or four times a week about one topic or another. We are sort of compatriots in this business, so we're always comparing notes and seeing how we could improve; we offer critiques, that sort of thing. There's professional value to the friendship that manifests."
Interviewer,"What are your thoughts on the debate on evolution Nye recently had with creationist Ken Ham? Nye said he was doing it to raise awareness about science education in this country, and it seems like Cosmos might have similar aims."
Tyson,"There are different ways to do that. One of them is to legislate laws that will improve science teaching and the like. But think about all the ways your citizenry can be influenced. We all go to movies. We all watch television. And some movies are better than others, and some TV shows are better than others. What makes them better? Some are better filmed. Some are better written. Some are more compelling. Different people learn differently and react differently."
Interviewer,"Speaking of science and religion, I thought it was interesting that Giordano Bruno's story was incorporated into the very first episode.  Can you tell me about that decision?"
Tyson,"There are many science martyrs, if you will, whose stories are undertold. And there's the normal cast of characters, Einstein, Galileo, Newton, and we just figured, we've heard those stories before; let's go deeper. And Ann Druyan and Steve Soter are both avid historians, not in an academic sense, but they're very well read in terms of who did what in the past. It's through their collaboration that they came up with this list of people whose stories we'd tell. And Bruno is just one of half a dozen profiles that are featured throughout the series that tell you about the scientific result arrived at by a researcher and what comes when those results encountered the social, political, cultural and religious mores of the day.."
Interviewer,What was it like working with Seth MacFarlane?
Tyson,"He was primarily our broker, not a literal broker, but a figurative broker, who brought Cosmos to Fox, because he's a Fox entity, of course. And why would either we or Fox think that we are a good match for each other? We would not be Fox's first thought; Fox was not our first thought. It was Seth who put the two together, recognizing that Fox needed something like Cosmos and that it could put resources to bear on it."
Interviewer,"For the record, we're HUGE fans of Neil deGrasse Tyson. (You don't put someone on the cover of your magazine if you don't love him!) In our excitement, we dreamed up lots of cover executions, but ultimately, we decided the most fitting treatment would be to have him beaming from the center of the solar system. Here's hoping you like the interview as much as we do!"
Tyson,"When he was 17, Neil deGrasse Tyson got a letter from Carl Sagan, the Cornell astronomer and popular science luminary. Tyson was a Bronx High School of Science student applying to colleges, and Sagan invited him for a tour of the lab at Cornell. It was ""an act of generosity that has affected me my entire life,"" Tyson says. A few years later, in 1980, Sagan launched Cosmos"
Interviewer,"Not long ago, you tweeted that if we imagined our planet's history as a football field, human existence would fit on a blade of grass."
Tyson,"Yes. If the 14-billion-year history of Earth went from end zone to end zone, then the width across one blade of grass is about the time that has elapsed since the paintings of cavemen to this conversation. That's a cosmic perspective."
Interviewer,How has the cosmic perspective shifted since the original Cosmos aired? What advances in science or new issues have you had to incorporate?
Tyson,"If you go back 40 years,  the environment was ""don't pollute the lake because then you'll kill the fish, and it will mess up our little water hole."" No one was thinking that what they did locally would affect everybody else globally. The local-global connection has emerged in the last couple of decades."
Interviewer,"I was reading a collection of Sagan's Gifford Lectures, The Varieties of Scientific Experience, and he really did have a way with words. He was talking about our sun going supernova, and he said, ""Some five or six or seven billion years from now, the sun will become a red giant star and will engulf the orbits of Mercury and Venus and probably Earth. Earth, then, would be inside the sun, and some of the problems that face us on this particular day will appear, by comparison, modest."" He has this implicit humor."
Tyson,"There are plenty of smart people out there who don't know science, and plenty of socialized people who might not be smart. He had all of that in the same package."
Interviewer,What was your relationship with Sagan like?
Tyson,"We met only four times. So he was never a mentor. People think that, but that was not the case. But those four times were significant, so I think of him often, and they serve as a source of inspiration. The fact that he took the time for me  has shaped how I take time for students who reach out to me."
Interviewer,How did the new Cosmos come about?
Tyson,"After he died, I got a phone call from the board at the Planetary Society, an organization that he cofounded, asking me to join the board. That was a little bittersweet, because clearly the spot was vacated because of Sagan's death. It was that acceptance that got me closer to his widow, Ann Druyan, who was a cowriter of the original series and is the writer of the current series. This is 1997, I think, and the conversation about doing Cosmos and continuing the Cosmos legacy had always been there. The question was, ""How would we do it? Who would write? Who would be in it?"" And Ann might have had other people in mind, I don't know, but I knew it was something I could do, possibly uniquely, given my sentiment for Carl and the impact he had on science literacy in the country. And given the rising impact that I was having at the time, I felt, yeah, I can do this."
Interviewer,So are there going to be shots of you walking by the beach with the breeze blowing through your hair?
Tyson,"Afros don't respond to breezes.  the fact is, we have stunning visuals knitted into stories of how and why science matters. So I'm on camera only if it's really adding to that delivery."
Interviewer,Somebody has to man the helm of the spaceship of the imagination.
Tyson,"Yes. Those are some of the most fun scenes I filmed. The spaceship looks to the past, the present, and the future through portals in the ship. Of course, it's all done with a green screen. But because I feel very close to the universe, when I'm describing what you're seeing, even though I can't see it, I can see it. In my head, it's there. As we descend toward the sun's surface, as we descend into strands of a DNA molecule, as we go to the limits of telescopic regions of the universe, I am there."
Interviewer,"Seth MacFarlane, who is one of the producers of Cosmos, recently did an episode of his show Family Guy, where the dog, Brian, died but came back in some kind of time travel twist in space time. Were you consulted on that?"
Tyson,"When Brian died, it was tragic, and I thought, ""Well it would be sad if he's not there because he's a unique voice in the program."" Stewie had the time machine already, right? So the show had already involved time travel, so  had lunch, and he asked me 20 questions on the space-time continuum and multiverses. Six months later, there's a show. Stewie takes the time machine, goes back to before the big bang, in fact goes outside of the big bang, where he is neither in a time nor a place, and it's out of that fluctuation in his time machine that the universe gets started. And at the end, an entire title card says"
Interviewer,"On the issue of parallel universes, do you think there is an evil mustache-less Neil deGrasse Tyson out there?"
Tyson,No. I think you need more than an infinite number of universes in the multiverse to have a universe that has someone who is exactly like me but is evil.
Interviewer,And without a mustache.
Tyson,"Usually, the evil person has a mustache. But my evil twin would have to be mustache-less, I suppose. When everything else is identical except that Neil is evil, I think we need more than an infinite number of universes for that. There are orders of infinity. Most people don't know this. Some infinities are larger than others, so you can show mathematically that that's the case. So I just think if you had infinite universes, that order of infinity is not high enough to create an Earth that has everything else exactly like it except that there's an evil version of me."
Interviewer,So is space a human abstraction or a physical entity in your opinion?
Tyson,"It's our perception of reality limited to how our senses deliver it to us. It's only in the era of science that we can decode the operations of nature outside of those five senses. And we've come to learn, since the era of quantum physics in the 1920s, that the results of your experiments are to be trusted above whatever your senses are telling you. Your senses are actually quite useless in this regard. They're not only useless, they are actively misleading. So you design your experiments, and you trust the results of your experiments. I'm still going to operate based on the reality that my senses give me in my day-to-day life."
Interviewer,"In 34 more years, if there was another installment of Cosmos, what questions would it address?"
Tyson,"Part of the mystery of science is not even knowing yet what question to ask. For example, in the year 1799, the question, ""I wonder if an asteroid will ever strike us and render us extinct"" could not have existed because we hadn't discovered asteroids yet. And even after we did discover asteroids, the idea that maybe one would hit us was not a thought for another century and a half, until we figured out that the crater in Arizona, which then was known as Barringer Crater, is now known to be the product of an asteroid impact and quickly renamed it Meteor Crater. The fun part about the future is not even knowing what questions to ask."
Interviewer,"Right, because five years from now, some alien empire could invade and change our understanding of everything. There's no way to predict that."
Tyson,"Exactly. And it will re-shift, and it will readjust how we pose questions. And what we pose questions about."
Interviewer,"A few years ago, I sent 10 dollars into something called the Time Travel Fund, with the idea being that the interest accrues, and far into the future, they take that money and come back in time and save you before death. What do you think of that as a retirement plan?"
Tyson,"I think it's great if it only costs you 10 dollars. Think of all the stuff you might spend 10 dollars on that wouldn't be nearly as fun to think about as that. If anything, you get novelty value from it. Not enough of us embrace the value of novelty."
Interviewer,This is probably the most profound extinction of animal life.
Tyson,"For years, the killer was a mystery, but now researchers think it could be something we're all familiar with, today."
Interviewer,Smell that.
Tyson,"Ooh, yeah, smells like rotten eggs."
Interviewer,"Rotten eggs, yeah. This is..."
Tyson,And the trigger could be all around us.
Interviewer,...this terrible gas chamber atmosphere. It's not so much stuff from space that gets you; it's your own planet.
Tyson,"Talk about extinction. This scientist has brought back to life one of the most lethal viruses in history, the 1918 flu."
Interviewer,"This killed, probably, at least 50 million people worldwide."
Tyson,What was he thinking?
Interviewer,We felt like it was important to actually reconstruct this virus.
Tyson,"What he's learned might unlock the secrets of how the avian flu, the one we're worried about now, could spread, infect and possibly kill millions."
Interviewer,Maybe we can figure out how to stop it.
Tyson,And you'll meet this guy...
Interviewer,"Hello, Leo. Can you hear me?"
Tyson,He was designed by an engineer who's building sociable robots.
Interviewer,You're such a cute little robot.
Tyson,"Robots that one day may even become our friends, with feelings and emotions. Wait a minute, an emotional robot?"
Interviewer,"I do think, in time, people will have, sort of, relationships where they might feel that it is a friendship, but it's going to be of a robot-human kind."
Tyson,All that and more on this episode of NOVA scienceNOW.
Interviewer,Google.
Tyson,"Hello, I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson, your host for NOVA scienceNOW."
Interviewer,"So yeah, this looks good."
Tyson,"And I mean old; the victims were knocked off about 250 million years ago, in an ancient mass extinction."
Interviewer,"Based on the fossil record, this is probably the most profound extinction of animal life."
Tyson,Geologist Sam Bowring and paleontologist Doug Erwin think this hillside might be a scene of the crime. They're looking for clues to find out what caused the mysterious end of the geological time period known as the Permian.
Interviewer,"The Permian world, and the extinction that ended the Permian world, really reset the nature of life on this planet."
Tyson,Paleontologist Peter Ward has spent years collecting fossils from the strange time of the Permian.
Interviewer,"Permian would have looked very different to us. Let's say we go back there, we look around"
Tyson,"True mammals hadn't evolved yet, but their ancestors were there, animals like this Lemurosaurus."
Interviewer,"This is a mammal-like reptile, probably small-dog size. This animal is a carnivore. It really has a dog-like appearance. We can see this great big piercing tooth."
Tyson,Clearly making him a predator.
Interviewer,"Yeah, but this entire group dies out in the extinction itself."
Tyson,"There were creatures right out of a science fiction movie, like plant-eating Lystrosaurs, and, ruining their day, monstrous Gorgons."
Interviewer,"I went into this controversy fully expecting to find all the evidence for impact. And at the end of the Cretaceous, we see this. We see lots of comet material or asteroid material."
Tyson,"Not to mention the crater, of course."
Interviewer,"Not to mention the crater, least of all the crater."
Tyson,"So you've got the smoking gun, the gun, and the bullets, and, of course, the dead bodies, I guess."
Interviewer,"Well, the only thing we have at the end of the Permian is...are the dead bodies."
Tyson,"So, if asteroids and extinction don't necessarily go hand in hand, what does Earth do with all those asteroids that come our way?"
Interviewer,"The Earth is hit by asteroids all the time, big ones, doesn't cause mass extinction. Why not look for something a little bit different?"
Tyson,But where can we find that something?
Interviewer,"Here's the boundary, right here."
Tyson,"This Nevada hillside might be one of a few existing Permian crime scenes in North America, but the team must date the rocks, to see if they're the same age as the extinction."
Interviewer,Timing is everything. You have to have rocks that can be dated precisely.
Tyson,"Back at the lab, the team breaks down the rock. Rare elements reveal when the rock formed. The results? About 250 million years old."
Interviewer,"Most people, when they think of volcanoes, think of Mount St. Helens or Mount Pinatubo. That's nothing like these volcanic episodes."
Tyson,"The Siberian Traps oozed lava for up to a million years, smothering an area about the size of the continental United States, in some places, over a mile deep."
Interviewer,That is a lot of lava.
Tyson,"Sure is. But still, the lava was in Siberia, not in the rest of the world, not in the whole ocean. So why would almost everything on Earth die?"
Interviewer,So the model starts out like a weather forecasting model or a climate model
Tyson,"All plants and animals and bacteria are, in fact, chemical factories, taking in nutrients and spewing out waste products. With life's chemistry factored in, Lee's model reveals a disturbing chain of events."
Interviewer,Carbon dioxide that's spewing out of these volcanoes is a greenhouse gas.
Tyson,"Greenhouse gases trap the Sun's heat in our atmosphere, forcing the whole Earth to warm up. Of course, that's global warming. But it doesn't end there. Global warming would have heated the Permian ocean, and when it did, ocean chemistry would have changed dramatically."
Interviewer,"There's a difference between warm and cold water. Cold water can hold more gas than can warm water. And so this is, fundamentally, why we drink champagne and beer and soda cold, rather than warm."
Tyson,"What's true for champagne, beer or soda is also true for the ocean and one of its most important gases, oxygen."
Interviewer,Cold water can hold a lot of oxygen. Warm water can't hold much oxygen.
Tyson,"And if water loses its oxygen, things can go from bad to worse."
Interviewer,"It's safe to swim in this lake, as long as you stay above 70 feet."
Tyson,"Below that, the oxygen-free water has attracted a deadly form of bacteria."
Interviewer,"There are bacteria that can thrive under those conditions, and those bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is a very toxic substance, and so, the deep part of this lake is highly poisonous."
Tyson,It's also bright pink.
Interviewer,Here you go.
Tyson,"The bright pink color comes from another microbe, purple sulfur bacteria, that thrive in hydrogen sulfide. Bacteria like these can leave chemical traces in ancient rocks. In fact, such traces have been found in some rocks dating to the Permian extinction."
Interviewer,This lake is a microcosm of what we think the ocean was like in the late Permian.
Tyson,"According to Lee's computer model, over time, the oceans would have become so full of hydrogen sulfide that in some spots, the deadly gas would have bubbled right out into the atmosphere, killing millions of creatures, not only in the sea, but also on the land."
Interviewer,"Even here, we're on a beach in Seattle, we only have to go down about two inches to see, sort of, the next step, in what we think is this extinction mechanism. There. Smell that."
Tyson,"Ooh, yeah, smells like rotten eggs."
Interviewer,"Rotten eggs. So, this is hydrogen sulfide from bacteria in the sediment. So, let's just take those bacteria, put them in the ocean and have untold tons of them."
Tyson,Having...have it run amok.
Interviewer,"Everywhere. The oceans are bacteria filled. And they're producing that same nasty rotten-egg smell, but in sufficient quantity, not just to kill stuff in the water, but enough goes in the atmosphere to kill land life."
Tyson,So it burps up this noxious gas.
Interviewer,"Big bubbles come out of the oceans, and it will kill off animals and plants."
Tyson,"And so, an extinction that began in the ocean works its way to the land."
Interviewer,Exactly. It's horrible.
Tyson,So it starts with volcanoes spewing carbon dioxide; next step
Interviewer,"What really looks like a universal way that this has happened is this global warming, leading to this terrible gas chamber atmosphere killing off life in the ocean and land. It's not so much stuff from space that gets you; it's your own planet."
Tyson,"The Nevada rocks offer some support for the idea, at least for the Permian. This whole area was once at the bottom of an ocean, and tests on the rocks have revealed that, in the years leading up to the extinction, the deep ocean water here had lost its oxygen."
Interviewer,"We know, for a fact, that there have been huge changes in the environment, in climate change. That could happen again today, no asteroids required. The Earth is an incredibly dynamic place, lots happening. We have to understand those changes if we want to survive."
Tyson,"With winter come fears of the flu, and sometimes the flu can be deadly, especially the bird flu. You've all heard of it. It's a virus that people catch from birds like chickens. It's already killed hundreds of people."
Interviewer,"Whatever scary things are lurking in the back of your freezer, I'll venture a guess you've got nothing on Terrence Tumpey. Getting into his deep freeze, at the CDC in Atlanta, is like prepping for a spacewalk."
Tyson,"Life, today, revolves around technology, and when something goes wrong, it can be so frustrating. Sometimes, you just wish machines could be a bit more helpful, nicer."
Interviewer,"Neil, this one's stuck."
Tyson,Thank you.
Interviewer,You're welcome.
Tyson,"Well, here's a scientist who wants to change things. She's working hard to design machines that are so much like us, we might even consider them our friends."
Interviewer,Friends.
Tyson,"This is Leonardo, and today is his annual checkup, or maybe I should say tune-up."
Interviewer,A little of both.
Tyson,"You see, Leonardo is a robot, but the engineer who designed him thinks of him as much more than a machine."
Interviewer,Do we have the tongue again? Where's Jessie? Jessie?
Tyson,Cynthia Breazeal thinks of him as a creature.
Interviewer,And does the nose wrinkle?
Tyson,"That's because, when Leonardo's been put back together and has his fur coat on, he's what you call a sociable robot,..."
Interviewer,"Hello, Leo. Can you hear me?"
Tyson,"...a new breed of robot that Cynthia and her students are designing, in the Robotic Life lab at MIT."
Interviewer,This is the most amazing place you can imagine.
Tyson,"Cynthia's goal is to make robots that aren't just smart, but that can learn the way people do, communicate the way people do, even become our friends."
Interviewer,What does it really mean to design a robot that understands and interacts and treats people as people?
Tyson,"If anyone can answer this question, it'll be Cynthia Breazeal."
Interviewer,"She's fearless, so she tries anything. And she just seems to have no concern, whatsoever, that it might fail. She just does it. And I can't think of any cases where it actually has failed."
Tyson,That's because the living room is not an easy place for a robot to exist.
Interviewer,"Through our evolution, we're so specialized for social interaction. So, if you can really design robots that can interact with people, in this very natural, interpersonal way, I think that would be great. You wouldn't have to have people read manuals, in order to operate them. They'd be able to just interact with a robot the way that they would want to, which we think will be as people interact with other living things."
Tyson,But wait a minute.
Interviewer,I've had just about enough of you.
Tyson,Robots with emotion? Isn't that just something from the movies?
Interviewer,"I was about 10 years old, and I saw the first Star Wars movie."
Tyson,"The daughter of two scientists, Cynthia had robots on the brain, and in third grade in Livermore, California, she wrote a story that was strangely prophetic."
Interviewer,"I talked about this robot that stole huckleberry pies, that apparently was a robot that was created by the Klingon Empire. The last sentence, I think, was perhaps the most salient, which is, And its feelings run on a computer. So, I mean, even then, it was just kind of a given for me that robots would have emotions and feelings."
Tyson,Her teacher's only comment
Interviewer,"She was actually a fairly accomplished tennis player...soccer and all these things, growing up. That took me by surprise. I hadn't really expected that she was such a jock. I would have expected, maybe, more of an egghead."
Tyson,"Well, she did wind up at MIT, where she studied electrical engineering and computer science with Rodney Brooks, who was designing robots inspired by living, breathing creatures."
Interviewer,Cynthia came to my lab just a little while after we'd started building robots based on insects.
Tyson,"With Brooks, she built a robotic bug named Attila, and then moved up the food chain to working on a humanoid robot called Cog, who was strangely adept at playing with Slinkys®."
Interviewer,"When we first thought about Cog, we thought about the all-intelligent robot that was going to be able to manipulate the world and do things. We weren't thinking about how it was really going to interact with people."
Tyson,"But Cynthia wanted to make a robot you can relate to, a robot that would learn because people would want to teach it."
Interviewer,She has a vision of robots
Tyson,But how do you make a robot that's more friend than appliance?
Interviewer,what if you could get people to relate to a robot in the same way a parent relates to a child?
Tyson,"Beginning in the late 1990s, Cynthia rolled up her sleeves and got out the toolkit to build a new kind of robot, based on theories of child development."
Interviewer,"She's willing to have way out ideas and pursue them. At the same time, she will delve into any technology, to put all the pieces together to make it happen."
Tyson,"What she came up with was a robotic head named Kismet, with baby-like features, such as prominent eyes, to draw people into a social relationship."
Interviewer,You're such a cute little robot.
Tyson,"She programmed Kismet to analyze the emotional intent of the person speaking to it, based on the pitch and intensity of their voice."
Interviewer,No.
Tyson,"Then, all on its own, Kismet computed the right emotional response, which it expressed in its face and posture and voice."
Interviewer,"People very quickly would become enamored and attached to the robot. But you almost can't help it, because it was really adorable."
Tyson,"Overnight, Kismet and Cynthia were superstars."
Interviewer,"And the email is basically, you know, Hi, it's Cynthia. Do you remember me? Which I thought was kind of a funny thing, because of course I remembered her."
Tyson,"Cynthia and Bobby were eventually married, but not before Hollywood called."
Interviewer,"Tell me, what is love?"
Tyson,"Stan was Stan Winston, legendary creator of movie creatures like the robots in Terminator."
Interviewer,His name is Teddy.
Tyson,The result of their collaboration was the robot called Leonardo.
Interviewer,"Of course, it's after Leonardo da Vinci, not Leonardo diCaprio, which some people ask me."
Tyson,It's a million dollar creature with a body by Stan and brains by Cynthia.
Interviewer,"Leo, this is Cookie Monster. Leo, can you find Cookie Monster?"
Tyson,"To create a life-like, face-to-face interaction with people, software allows Leo to track the head of the person speaking to him. Then he stores the name and color and shape of the object in his memory."
Interviewer,"Very good, Leo. Leo, this is Elmo. Can you find Elmo?"
Tyson,Leo can also use what he learns to think for himself. When Matt tries to trick him...
Interviewer,Can you find Elmo?
Tyson,"...Leo catches on quickly, responding with a shrug and even a puzzled look."
Interviewer,"Cynthia's one of the best people in the world, in terms of human-robot interaction, and really understanding that it's much more than a person just pressing buttons on a machine, but really having the machine be engaging and improving that overall interaction."
Tyson,"The team's latest robot is a teddy bear called the Huggable. Inspired by pet therapy, it may one day act as a companion for kids in the hospital, as well as assist their caregivers. With skin that's sensitive to touch and temperature, it's designed for physical, full-body interaction with humans."
Interviewer,"This guy has a motion classifier in him, which means he knows how he's being moved. So I can do some stuff, like bouncing him, and you can see on the screen how he's responding"
Tyson,"But will we ever have an interaction with a robot that's as genuine as this? And if so, would that be a good thing?"
Interviewer,"If I really didn't believe that we would have better living with robots, that robots could really be a technology that enhanced and complemented our lives, like, I mean, the way that...same reason we create any other technology, I certainly wouldn't be doing it."
Tyson,"When I was a kid, I used to play this game, Password(TM). And the secret password is always invisible, hidden until you slid the paper into this sleeve, and then the secret word is revealed."
Interviewer,"In these vaults, on these shelves, in these boxes at Oxford University, ancient clues, 2,000 years old, to a glorious human past; wrapped in printed paper, fragments of ancient paper, pieces of the D.N.A. of Western Civilization."
Tyson,"And now for some final thoughts on extinction. When you look up to the sky, you see the Moon, Sun and stars, not as they are, but as they once were. Traveling at more than 186,000 miles per second, their light simply takes time to reach us."
Interviewer,"The early Earth was not a Garden of Eden. There were no clear blue oceans, there were no plants. There was no life at all."
Tyson,So where could the building blocks of life have come from?
Interviewer,"if the building blocks of life were delivered courtesy of comets and meteors, could any of the tiny ingredients they carry have survived the landing? And if they did, how did they generate those first traces of life? A walk on the ancient surface of the Earth offers clues."
Tyson,"In the endless reaches of the universe Earth seems unique. It's a planet shaped and molded by life, a planet that six billion people call home today."
Interviewer,"If you were a human, going back into time, and trying to stand on the early Earth, it would be just like visiting a planet that was not your own."
Tyson,"It was a planet plagued by catastrophe. If you condense all of Earth's history to just 24 hours, then only minutes after it formed, the entire globe melted and reformed. Then, to make matters worse, another planet about the size of Mars slammed into Earth, a cataclysm that created our moon. But soon after these disastrous beginnings, the most radical transformation of all time hit the planet"
Interviewer,"When we think of early Earth we must recognize it was not a Garden of Eden. There were no clear blue oceans, there was no clear water, there were no plants. There was no life at all."
Tyson,The young sun was weaker than it is today. And its light barely penetrated the atmosphere of carbon dioxide spiked with the pungent fumes of hydrogen sulfide.
Interviewer,"Since the atmosphere was thicker and dominated by CO2, the Earth had a reddish tinge to it. It didn't have the familiar blue sky. The oceans would have had an olive green color rather than our familiar blue color."
Tyson,"For about the first 600 million years, comets and asteroids pounded our planet, a time known as the Heavy Bombardment."
Interviewer,"These relic, or antique environments like Cueva de Villa Luz offer the same kinds of environments that we would have found on early Earth, and we're hoping to get clues to work backwards from those."
Tyson,"Hydrogen sulfide is can be extremely poisonous, so the scientists have to wear gas masks inside the cave and carefully test them for leaks."
Interviewer,Have you got everything in there? I think I got everything.
Tyson,"But can any other forms of life survive in the deep recesses of the cave so toxic to humans? Here, hydrogen sulfide, an invisible gas, escapes from the underground springs, reacts with oxygen in the water, and coats the cave with sulfuric acid."
Interviewer,"The longer it sits there on the walls, the more acid it becomes. And so, eventually, by the time the drop is falling on you it's a very, very acid environment."
Tyson,"Amazingly, despite the extreme conditions, it appears that life is thriving inside the cave. It comes in a strange package"
Interviewer,"The snottites are drippy, gooey, mucusy formations that look like stalactites. And that's why they were called snottites, because they resemble strings of snot. We believe that the snotty, gooey stuff is to protect them against extreme acidity because when we measure the drips on the snottites, they are as extreme as battery acid. And so, while we find that daunting, this is where they thrive."
Tyson,"Bacteria are among the most primitive and most common organisms on Earth. Like all forms of life, they grow, adapt to their environment, and reproduce. Inside each single-celled bacterium is a molecule of DNA, the code of life which allows them to multiply. There are millions of bacteria in each snottite."
Interviewer,"They take the hydrogen sulfide and they get chemical energy out of it. It doesn't poison them. It's home sweet home for them, and this is a pretty new finding for these organisms."
Tyson,"Conditions on early Earth may have been far worse, but these bacteria suggest that primitive life could have thrived in extremely hostile environments."
Interviewer,"hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, four of the most common elements in the universe. Combined in just the right way, these are the fundamental ingredients of life, and carbon is the star of the show."
Tyson,"And the idea that life could have started when carbon and other ingredients combined in the harsh conditions of early Earth was first put to the test in the 1950s by a young graduate student named Stanley Miller. To simulate the newborn Earth in the lab, Miller assembled a contraption made out of flasks and tubes. He filled one flask with gases thought at the time to represent Earth's primitive atmosphere, and he connected that to another flask with water to represent the oceans."
Interviewer,"And then he did a brilliant thing. He simply put an electric charge through that to essentially simulate lightning going through an early atmosphere. And after sitting around for a couple of days, all of a sudden there was all this brown goo all over the reaction vessel, and when he analyzed what was in the vessel now, he actually had amino acids."
Tyson,"Amino acids are compounds that form when molecules of carbon and other elements link together. They are the essential building blocks of proteins and cells, vital ingredients of all living things."
Interviewer,"Life is really chemistry; there's no question about that. In fact, it's a chemistry that, when you get the recipe right, it goes, and it goes fairly quickly."
Tyson,"That recipe is hotly debated today, and most scientists think the environmental conditions on early Earth were very different from the ones Miller simulated in his lab. And another debate rages about when this recipe first got cooked up."
Interviewer,The geology of Greenland is unique. It contains a record of some of the earliest geological processes that we know of on the Earth. The rocks themselves are thought to be between 3.7 and 3.9 billion years in age.
Tyson,"These rocks are so old that any fossils they once contained have been destroyed. So to find out if life existed when they formed, Mojzsis had to look for evidence that is far more elusive."
Interviewer,"There may have at one time been small fossils, microfossils but under the conditions of heat and pressure that these rocks experienced, such fossils would have been disaggregated and destroyed. So what we have left behind then are chemical fingerprints of ancient bacteria or microbes."
Tyson,"To search for those fingerprints, Mojzsis first extracts a sample from the ancient Greenland rocks. Then he will analyze its chemical composition looking for carbon, a signature of life."
Interviewer,"It was a surprise for us to find evidence of ancient life in these rocks. We didn't know if it would be there. You know, just because the stage is set doesn't mean that the actors are present. But these samples, here, represent the first evidence we have, direct evidence of a biosphere on our planet."
Tyson,"If it emerged so early, life was lucky to miss the greatest cataclysm of all time, an impact like no other in our planet's history. It happened when another rocky sphere about the size of Mars collided with Earth. The outer layers of our planet were vaporized, and the debris from this collision coalesced to form the moon. That impact was so powerful that any building blocks of life that existed on Earth would have been destroyed."
Interviewer,"Space is not very far away. Space is only about 20 kilometers that way. Now, that's very close and space is vast."
Tyson,And a scientist named Don Brownlee designed an experiment to find out if space might actually harbor the building blocks of life.
Interviewer,"There are 40,000 tons of bits of comets and asteroids that impact the Earth every year. This is mostly in the form of particles that are less than a millimeter in size. We breathe them, they're in the food that we eat, but they are very difficult to find. You can only find them in very special places."
Tyson,"To see if this shower of space-dust contains the ingredients for life, Brownlee needed to obtain samples uncontaminated by Earth's atmosphere. So to get just a few micrograms of dust, he commissioned a former spy plane to fly close to the edge of Earth's atmosphere. Sticky pads on the plane's wings collected the space dust. Then, Brownlee's colleagues sliced the dust particles into slivers less than one-tenth the thickness of a human hair. And they discovered that these tiny particles are rich in the seeds of life."
Interviewer,"If you look on an electron microscope, you'll see this wonderful array of minerals and carbon and organic materials that are 4.55 billion years old and we believe are the building blocks of life."
Tyson,"And this extra-terrestrial dust isn't the only possible source of life's ingredients. In a region of space called the Asteroid Belt are huge amounts of debris left over from the formation of the solar system. And sometimes, chunks of debris containing metal and rock fall to Earth bearing surprising gifts."
Interviewer,"It's a gold mine, this little chunk of meteorite which fell on Australia last year. For the past six months they've been taking it apart and have discovered that it contains amino acids, the building blocks of life."
Tyson,It was the first time that complex organic compounds had ever been found in material from space. And if meteorites like it were common perhaps they had delivered vast quantities of the original constituents of life to early Earth.
Interviewer,"Enough organics are present here that we think that meteorites like this provided the early Earth its entire budget of organics. So all the organics in your body, all the carbon in your body and in your lunch you had today, arrived on the Earth in meteorites like this."
Tyson,"More than 70 kinds of amino acids have been found in meteorites, and many are the fundamental ingredients of proteins that make up living cells. During the Heavy Bombardment, millions of meteorites may have seeded the Earth with the stuff of life. And there might have been an even more efficient delivery system."
Interviewer,"if the building blocks of life were delivered courtesy of comets and meteors, could any of the tiny ingredients they carried have survived the landing? And just what happens to things like amino acids when they slam into Earth with such devastating power?"
Tyson,"The gun fires a bullet at 5,000 miles an hour towards a sample that represents the organic molecules inside a comet. The sample consists of a solution of five different amino acids, two of them present in every living cell. The mixture is inserted into a steel capsule. The gun will send a shockwave through the capsule simulating the extreme pressures of a comet's impact."
Interviewer,"I think it's very hard to just imagine what kinds of pressures we're generating in these experiments. If you think about going to the bottom of the ocean, the pressures you'll have there are only a hundred times atmosphere. So these are hundreds of thousands of times atmospheric pressures."
Tyson,Will Jennifer Blank's experiment show that the building blocks of life can survive a crash landing on Earth?
Interviewer,"Clear the room...Charging now...Okay, bringing up the X-rays...35. Three, two, one, fire. Three, two, one, fire."
Tyson,When they remove the capsule it's undamaged. But have its contents survived the impact?
Interviewer,"We went from our initial small compounds, and here's an example of one of them, a simple amino acid, and we used the energy associated with the impact to build larger molecules. Molecules like this, this is a peptide, and we show that we can use the impact energy to grow larger molecules from the simplest building blocks of life."
Tyson,"Peptides link together to form larger building blocks, proteins, which make up all the cells in our bodies. But the leap from non-living ingredients to a living creature, complete with DNA which allows cells to replicate, is staggeringly complex."
Interviewer,It is hard to really get your head around the great leap from non-living to living.
Tyson,"While we don't yet know how the spark of life occurred, we can try to figure out where it might have gotten a foothold."
Interviewer,"And the mining environment gives us this fantastic window into the deep subsurface. It's a unique scenario because there is nowhere else on planet Earth that allows you to have access to that sort of sample location at two, three, three and a half kilometers deep."
Tyson,"It takes 45 minutes to reach the heart of this South African mine. Conditions here are extremely uncomfortable, for humans, that is. The temperature of the rock is 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and the air pressure is twice that at Earth's surface."
Interviewer,"Microorganisms have been shown potentially to be able to use these molecules to provide themselves with energy and support themselves completely independent of photosynthesis. And if we can prove that that is the case here, then that is very interesting because that adds credence to the idea that you could have life originating in the deep subsurface."
Tyson,"As the miners drill into the rock, they break into ancient pockets of water, havens for microorganisms."
Interviewer,"We're not sure how organisms can live in such extreme environments. The major thing is there's such low nutrient availability, there's nothing really for these guys to continually use and process to survive, and yet somehow they do. And the question is, How do they do it?"
Tyson,The first step is to collect pristine samples of the water and see if they can grow the microbes it contains.
Interviewer,"I'll get a very big sense of achievement if I can actually take something that's been isolated for 200 million years, put it in the laboratory and actually find out what it is this organism needs to survive."
Tyson,"In a makeshift lab near the mine, the team attempts to recreate the environment deep inside the rock. And they have found that these microbes are dining on a variety of strange gases."
Interviewer,"It turns out that in the deep subsurface there's an abundance of methane gas and ethane and propane. Now, for you and I that's not a very exciting diet, but what we think is that these organisms may be taking that kind of gas and actually using that as a food to survive."
Tyson,"On such an exotic diet, the bacteria draw just enough energy to divide and reproduce only once every thousand years, suggesting a way that life could have survived deep beneath the surface of the early Earth."
Interviewer,"If all of the bombardment was occurring near the surface, survivors would be existing in just these kinds of hydrothermal vent communities where there's abundant water and nutrients and heat and food in the form of chemical energy. It has been found that organisms collected there nowadays are genetically akin to some of the earliest organisms that we think existed on the Earth."
Tyson,"By about three and a half billion years ago, or five o'clock in the morning on our 24-hour clock, the bombardment of asteroids and comets had ceased. With far fewer violent impacts on Earth, microbial life could now survive outside its protective hiding places."
Interviewer,"the sun. Up here, microbes evolved a green pigment known as chlorophyll. This allowed them to trap sunlight and use it to drive a chemical reaction that converts carbon dioxide and water into food. Called photosynthesis, it was a clever invention that enabled some bacteria to grow and reproduce almost without limit."
Tyson,"And this remote corner of Western Australia holds clues to how that happened. These domed structures, called stromatolites, are built up layer by layer over thousands of years by tiny microbes. These microbes may be similar to life forms that dominated our planet billions of years earlier. And in the arid hills nearby, there may be evidence of these ancient creatures."
Interviewer,"These are the oldest fossils in the world, at about three and a half billion years old, and they're composed of stromatolites. And at this outcrop we can see two different types of structures that these creatures formed. First are these black mats that have wrinkly textures all through it, and the second are these larger domes that form these broad structures. The most likely way these things formed is by the growth of microbes."
Tyson,"Like modern stromatolites, these ancient structures could also have been built by colonies of bacteria. And not far away are fossilized ripple marks which suggest they might have grown in shallow water."
Interviewer,"And here, you can see we've got a smaller structure that we call the Mickey Mouse Ears, which is this beautiful doubly branching structure. And there is nothing else that we can think of which would make that except something that was growing on the bottom of the ocean."
Tyson,So perhaps the ancient stromatolites were formed by microbes like the ones that build these structures today.
Interviewer,"These big stromatolites are composed mostly of rock at the bottom, and the only living part of the stromatolite is a thin layer on top. And that thin layer on top is made up of microscopic blue-green bacteria called cyanobacteria."
Tyson,"Named after the blue-green color of their cells, these cyanobacteria use photosynthesis to collect energy from the sun. They secrete a sticky coating to shield them from ultraviolet radiation. As tiny pieces of dust and sediment settle on top of the sticky cells, the bacteria migrate closer to the surface to reach the light. The layers of sediment build up by about half a millimeter a year. These structures contain living microbes, just as they have for thousands of years."
Interviewer,"The amazing thing about these stromatolites is that the microorganisms which build them are so tiny. And the structures that you see around me, compared to their size, are enormous. It'd be like if humans made a skyscraper that was a hundred and five kilometers high by seventy kilometers across. These are massive structures for the size of the organisms that make them."
Tyson,"Many different shapes and sizes of what appear to be fossilized stromatolites have been found in the rock. It seems likely that these structures were formed by some type of microbe living on the early Earth, perhaps even by the ancestors of today's cyanobacteria."
Interviewer,"We're looking at sort of a cross-section through the top of these cones. And layers that were laid down year after year, and the fact that they're all different sizes on this one surface, shows that there was a colony of microorganisms growing on this one bedding plane. And that's really fascinating because it means that life evolved on this planet very early and very fast."
Tyson,"And it's the cyanobacteria that would bring about the most astounding changes in Earth's history, a change that could have started as early as three and a half billion years ago."
Interviewer,"oxygen. The oxygen was absorbed into the oceans at first. There, it combined with iron erupting from undersea volcanoes to form iron oxide particles that fell to the ocean floor. Over the next several hundred million years the planet literally rusted."
Tyson,"Every week they excavate half a million tons of iron ore used to make steel for everything from cars to skyscrapers. In a more pristine state, thousands of ancient layers of iron ore are preserved in the Karijini Gorge, just 30 miles from the mine."
Interviewer,"We're sitting here today breathing an oxygen-rich mixture of air. We couldn't be here without that oxygen, but that oxygen wasn't present on the early Earth, and it only became present because of the activity of photosynthetic organisms."
Tyson,"The oxygen also helped protect life from the sun's lethal ultraviolet radiation, by creating a layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere."
Interviewer,"One of the fascinating properties of that is that it actually screens out, just sort of like a sunscreen does on your skin, screens out this harmful radiation."
Tyson,"With the protection of the ozone layer, life was able to diversify into more complex organisms. It took only the last three hours of the day for all the other life forms on our planet to evolve."
Interviewer,"It's only been the last 10 percent of the Earth's history where there was life on the surface of the Earth that you would see with your naked eye. So, for most of Earth's history, life has basically been invisible on the Earth."
Tyson,"Microbes ruled the planet for more than three billion years, two thirds of its history. These tiny organisms had transformed an entire planet. Without them, complex life, humans included, would have never evolved."
Interviewer,"Cosmologically speaking, what's changed in the 34 years since the original ""Cosmos?""."
Tyson,Just about everything.
Interviewer,Exoplanets hadn't yet been observed back then. Now we've seen hundreds. Does that mean we're closer to discovering extraterrestrial life?
Tyson,That is a big question we all have
Interviewer,And our conception of the cosmos may also have changed. Do you think we live in a universe or a multiverse?
Tyson,We have excellent theoretical and philosophical reasons to think we live in a multiverse.
Interviewer,Why is that?
Tyson,"Quantum physics, which is the physics of the small, behaves in odd ways. Everything that the tenets of quantum physics predict about the universe we go out and test it and it's there. General relativity, which was put forth by Einstein, is the theory of the large gravity and the large-scale structure of the universe. That also works. Yet they don't work with one another. If you take the universe all the way back to the Big Bang, well, the entire universe was really small. So now you take the shotgun wedding quantum physics and general relativity. In that shotgun wedding, if you follow through with all the predictions quantum physics gives you, it allows multiple bubbles to form one of which is our universe. These are sorts of fluctuations in the quantum foam. Quantum physics fluctuates all the time. But now the fluctuations are not just particles coming into and out of existence, which happens all the time. It's whole universes coming into and out of existence."
Interviewer,And philosophically?
Tyson,"Philosophically, the universe has really never made things in ones. The Earth is special and everything else is different? No, we've got seven other planets. The sun? No, the sun is one of those dots in the night sky. The Milky Way? No, it's one of a hundred billion galaxies. And the universe maybe it's countless other universes."
Interviewer,And our multiverse could be just one of many?
Tyson,Exactly. It might be that the multiverse is not alone.
Interviewer,"If particles blink into and out of existence, could the whole universe blink out of existence?"
Tyson,It is statistically so unlikely that you should just think of it as zero. Don't worry about it.
Interviewer,You must get a lot of strange questions from your lecture audiences. Do you find yourself having to correct people's misconceptions?
Tyson,"That's not my goal. As an educator, I try to get people to be fundamentally curious and to question ideas that they might have or that are shared by others. In that state of mind, they have earned a kind of inoculation against the fuzzy thinking of these weird ideas floating around out there. So rather than correct the weird ideas, I would rather them to know how to think in the first place. Then they can correct the weird idea themselves. I don't just tell them no. That's pontifical."
Interviewer,What role do you play in what some have called a culture war between science and science deniers?
Tyson,"People reach for me to have those fights, but I don't engage in them. You've never seen me debate anybody. On anything. Ever. My investment of time, as an educator, in my judgment, is best served teaching people how to think about the world around them. Teach them how to pose a question. How to judge whether one thing is true versus another. What the laws of physics say. That's an educational process. It's not a debate and whoever argues best wins. I don't do that. I'm not saying other people shouldn't. I'm not saying it isn't a great thing that they're doing it."
Interviewer,What do you think our approach should be to exploring the moon and Mars and to space exploration in general?
Tyson,"I don't create agendas that people should follow. But if you care about the economic health of this nation, then you ought to know that innovation in science and technology in the 21st Century will be the engine of tomorrow's economy. Nations that embrace this fact will lead the world economically."
Interviewer,How do you convince people of the importance of science and technology?
Tyson,"You can make programs that improve science teachers, but what do you do when you get out? Is it embraced by your culture? No, it's not. It's a band-aid. But when the culture wants to do it, you don't need programs to make it happen. There were no programs in the 1960s to get people interested in science. There were programs to manage the rising science interest that became manifest when Sputnik was launched, but the interest was built into the culture. People were thinking about tomorrow in ways only science and technology could deliver. My read of human history and 20th Century tells me that there is no force as powerful, as ambition-stimulating, as exploring the great frontier. And right now that frontier is space. I'm not here to tell you to like space. I'm here to tell you the cost of not liking space."
Interviewer,"Some scientists argue that in order to ensure our long-term survival, humans must colonize other planets. What do you say?"
Tyson,"It would be great if we were on multiple planets, but I think that's unrealistic. Hawking says we have to be on multiple planets so an asteroid could come and you'd still have some humans left. It's a nice idea. It satisfies the multiple-eggs-in-multiple-baskets concept. However, I claim that whatever power you have amassed to terraform Mars to make it look like Earth and then ship a billion people there...whatever effort that requires is more than figuring out how to deflect the asteroid. It's more effort than fixing runaway global warming."
Interviewer,"If someone offered you a one-way trip to Mars, would you take it?"
Tyson,"I don't see any point of a one-way trip. In the era of the great explorers, colonies were established in places where explorers had already put the place on the map and were able to tell you, ""Yeah, there's air to breathe and fruit on the trees and bring this winter coat and here is a shovel and some hammers and nails, go at it. Oh, by the way, if it doesn't work out, come back."" That's different from saying here's a spaceship that is only designed to go one way and, by the way, when you get there there's no air or water. So make it a round trip. You stay as long as you want."
Interviewer,"In a recent article in Parade magazine, you were quoted as saying that as a young man, despite being an aspiring astrophysicist, you were sometimes viewed as a mugger or shoplifter. That was surprising to see, given your reputation as someone who is disinclined to talk about racism."
Tyson,"I didn't talk to them at all. They went into my memoir written in 1999 and extracted from a single chapter in the book. People feel some major urge to say oh, he's a black scientist so let's have part of the conversation about being a black scientist. I never initiate such conversations. Ever. In fact, I decline invitations to speak during Black History Month. If you only think of me during Black History Month, I must be failing as an educator and as an astrophysicist. By the way, if my professional identity involved strong racial issues, then it would be unfair and unrealistic to decline such invitations. But I never talk about it. I never volunteer to talk about god or religion, but people feel compelled to talk about it."
Interviewer,Do you want to talk about religion now?
Tyson,I'm here for you.
Interviewer,Do you believe in god?
Tyson,I presume you've pre-specified which god you're asking about?
Interviewer,Define god as you would.
Tyson,You're the one who's asking the question. So pick a god and ask me if I believe in that god.
Interviewer,The Judeo-Christian god.
Tyson,"OK, if that god is described as being all-powerful and all-knowing and all-good, I don't see evidence for it anywhere in the world. So I remain unconvinced. If that god is all-powerful and all-good, I don't see that when a tsunami kills a quarter-million or an earthquake kills a quarter-million people. I'd like to think of good as something in the interest of your health or longevity. That's a pretty simple definition of something that is good for you. That's not a controversial understanding of the word ""good."" So if Earth in two separate events separated by just a couple of years can kill a half-million people, then if the god as you describe exists, that god is either not all-powerful or not all-good. And so therefore I am not convinced."
Interviewer,Can science and religion be reconciled?
Tyson,"As religion is now practiced and science is now practiced, there is no intersection between the two. That is for certain. And it's not for want of trying. Over the centuries, many people theologians as well scientists have tried to explore points of intersection. And anytime anyone has declared that harmony has risen up, it is the consequence of religion acquiescing to scientific discovery. In every single case."
Interviewer,Is religion dying?
Tyson,"It depends on what you mean by dying. Most of Europe is atheistic. Even in Italy, the seat of the Vatican, most people never go to church. The Netherlands is essentially 100 percent atheist. The churches are relics. So the trend line in the Western world is that the influence of religion is diminishing. That's just a fact. I don't care whether it rises or falls. It really doesn't matter to me."
Interviewer,"And yet for some people, religion provides a source of wonder and awe."
Tyson,"I would say it's not the only way. It's not the best way. You can have awe of the universe, and it has the advantage of being objectively verifiable. And this is an awe that will continue even after new discoveries are made. You're not being awed at the same thing your ancestors were. You've moved on."
Interviewer,What things do you find most awesome?
Tyson,"There are two. One relates to the formation of the heavy elements in the stars landing inside the human body and all life on Earth. In terms of the most astonishing fact about which we know nothing, there is dark matter and dark energy. We don't know what either of them is. Everything we know and love about the universe and all the laws of physics as they apply, apply to four percent of the universe. That's stunning. That's as humbling a fact as there is."
Interviewer,But you have faith that someday we will know what dark matter and dark energy are.
Tyson,"If you want to use faith in that way, sure. But when faith is used in modern society it has a strong association with religion. The history of science shows that great mysteries get solved. It may be that there's an answer that humans are too stupid to understand. I'm intrigued by that possibility."
Interviewer,Might we be able to create brains that are smarter than we are?
Tyson,"That's an interesting question. Possibly. If we know what's making us smart, go tweak the DNA. Tweak the genome in some way."
Interviewer,How about the idea of uploading your brain into some sort of computer as a way to achieve immortality?
Tyson,"I don't see that as an important day, any more than the day a machine replaced you on the assembly line, the day a machine replaced your oxen, the day a machine beat us at chess, the day a machine beat us at Jeopardy. It's fine and intriguing, but to assert that all of life is going to be different or that it's immortality... don't tell me it's you with immortality."
Interviewer,What's something that people would be surprised to learn about you?
Tyson,"If I had another life, I would be a librettist for Broadway musicals. I love musicals."
Interviewer,Do you have a favorite?
Tyson,"My Fair Lady, West Side Story, Jesus Christ Superstar, All That Jazz."
Interviewer,So you go to Broadway a lot?
Tyson,Yeah. I go to plays with my wife and Broadway musicals with the whole family. We just saw The Glass Menagerie.
Interviewer,What else do you do in your spare time?
Tyson,"We both cook and enjoy good wine with good food. The great frustration is that the better we are in the kitchen, the fewer restaurants become available to us to eat in."
Interviewer,Do you have a killer lasagna?
Tyson,My wife has a killer lasagna. Oh my god.
Interviewer,What's your best dish?
Tyson,I make a pistachio-mint-encrusted shank of lamb. With that one you reach for your better bottle of wine. I can't order rack of lamb in a restaurant anymore. It's just not as good.
Interviewer,Sounds like you have a sense of awe and wonder at your rack of lamb.
Tyson,"No, I have a sense of awe and wonder at the food still made by master chefs that I am sure I will never figure out."
Interviewer,"What's one interesting thing viewers will learn from ""Cosmos?""."
Tyson,We tell the stories of scientists in different cultures and different eras whose life work was fought against by the culture or the governments that controlled their lives or by social mores that interfered with their exploration of the truth. Some gave their lives for having found truth and in that world you learn that there are science martyrs. They're people who cared more about the truth than their own relationship to their homeland.
Interviewer,"Neil, welcome to the show."
Tyson,"Yeah thanks, Tim. It's my first time."
Interviewer,"It is your first time. Hopefully not your last, but."
Tyson,Yeah.
Interviewer,"For now, the first debut appearance. Of course, that's the department of redundancy department way to describe it. But not our first time chatting, but first time, in this case, being able to ask you all the questions I'd like to ask."
Tyson,"First, to your credit, believe it or not, no one has ever asked me that."
Interviewer,"All right, here we go. Good, promising start."
Tyson,"This is a good first pitch home run right there. I can go back to my childhood and middle school years where I had already sort of exhausted the exhibitry of the American Museum of Natural History's astronomy section, which is basically the Hayden Planetarium. It's not just the planetarium, their exhibits and lining the corridors and things."
Interviewer,"That's incredible. Directionally, you said at age nine you were already sort of pointed in terms of interest at the universe, as you mentioned. How did that develop?"
Tyson,"Okay, so now you are now the thousandth person to ask me."
Interviewer,I figured I would follow up with a first by asking the nth number question. Just for those people who don't know your background.
Tyson,Does that negate the first question?
Interviewer,"No, no, no. It doesn't negate, it just averages down."
Tyson,"The other one was a home run you already scored. Right, yeah. So this is a bunt. Let's see if we can get to base on it."
Interviewer,"I want to dig into maybe some of the inner folds of the origin story. It certainly sounds like you and your family, at your parents' encouragement, used New York City as a learning laboratory of sorts, and you had these weekend excursions."
Tyson,You just said it way better than I just did. A learning laboratory. Thank you.
Interviewer,You're welcome.
Tyson,"Can I use that in the future, may I?"
Interviewer,"Yes, all yours. I'd love to hear, if anything else comes to mind, say, during the week or evenings when families were together, were there any other habits, or routines, or approaches that they used for curiosity?"
Tyson,"Yes, but before I tell you that, there's something else I want to add. I don't mean to pit demographic against demographic, or neighborhood against neighborhood, but I can tell you that, think about how many parents, particularly back then, there's less so today. But back in the day of urban flight, where, I'm stereotyping here. But let's imagine you just got out of college, you got married, and you got a good job in the city."
Interviewer,Right.
Tyson,"So they just dumped criminals there and let them fend for themselves. Whole thing aside, they did that to my hometown. I still think it was an awful movie. But yes, that was made in that era."
Interviewer,You were weaving your way to other ways your parents cultivated curiosity outside of the weekend.
Tyson,"Yeah, yeah. Right, sorry. Thanks for remembering where I'm trying to go with what I'm saying. You should be host of a podcast."
Interviewer,I've been thinking about it.
Tyson,"Now I wanted to slip in another little fact, that you can ask the question, ""What are the chances, given crime and all the other factors, of not surviving to age 18?"" Okay? And you can say, ""I want to live where my chances of survival to 18 are at its highest. That would be one measure of the safety of the neighborhood that you choose.""."
Interviewer,"I have to pause just to mention that this is deja vu all over again for me. It's the first time I've had a guest describe exactly what happened with my family also. My parents exposed us to a lot. They would see what caught our attention. They didn't have budget for new bikes or other things, but my mom would always say, ""We have budget for books."" What that meant was going to the remainder table, specifically, at the bookstore to pick up books on whatever had caught our attention. It's very, very similar. That's really wild."
Tyson,"The thing is, as I got older, when I considered writing books myself, I said, ""Suppose my book ends up on the remainder table."" It's a bittersweet thing. It's like, ""I don't want it to be on the remainder table, but that's how I cut my teeth in this."" It's not selling well if it's on the remainder table. Actually, that's not always true. Sometimes they just want to, the hard cover is slowing down and they want to go to paperback. So then they release the hardcover to the remainder table and then the paperback does well on another budget level."
Interviewer,"If we jump from where we started around 14 at the beginning of this conversation, and flash forward. Not too far forward, I suppose. Could you describe, and this is I'm sure something you've been asked before, but I'm going to add a twist to it, which is could you describe for people who don't know the name, who Carl Sagan is? And then also, perhaps share a story or any observations about what people don't fully appreciate about him or don't know about him?"
Tyson,"Yeah, excellent. Thanks for that question. Carl Sagan is probably the most famous popularizer of science there ever was. I can't say he's the most popular scientist. That would probably be Albert Einstein, or Isaac Newton, or Stephen Hawking. But if you look at sort of visibility, he was a very productive scientist in his own right. But that's not how most people remember him. They remember him as initially, author of some very, very readable books on the universe. As multi-time guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Johnny Carson, the Tonight Show host who preceded Jay Leno, who preceded Jimmy Fallon. So there's only been a handful of hosts of The Tonight Show."
Interviewer,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Tyson,"He was really good at that. So I said, ""Wow. Okay, if I'm ever in the position of communicating complex ideas to the public, I will try to make sure that I can fold this in as well."" I think one of my best versions of this was I was being interviewed on the Today show back when the Cassini spacecraft had just pulled into orbit around Saturn for a 12-year observing mission, right? Observing the rings, ring system, the moons, their magnetic fields, the gas, everything about the Saturnian system."
Interviewer,"In the mid-'70s, why."
Tyson,Wait a minute. Excuse me.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Tyson,"After everything I just said, he went on and made Cosmos. Okay? It's called A Personal Voyage. It came out in 1980, aired on PBS. That was seen, I think, by a billion people. It was the most successful documentary there ever was. That really made him a household name at the time. We're now 40 years ago. And invited by heads of state to places and this sort of thing."
Interviewer,"I'm going to come up, or I should say come up, come back to a Carl Sagan follow up. But since we're talking about science, science communication, I would like to revisit, and feel free to fact check this because I don't want to believe everything I find on the internet. But this is from Harvard Business Review. The question to you was, ""How can schools and workplaces emphasize curiosity?"" We can focus on the schools."
Tyson,"Okay. First, I have no memory of that answer, but I do remember saying that. No, no, I don't remember being in the Harvard Business Review. Wow. Okay."
Interviewer,"It could've been syndicated, could've been copied and pasted."
Tyson,Possibly.
Interviewer,Who knows what agreement they have.
Tyson,"Right, because why would Harvard Business Review care about me at all? So yes, but that entire quote is accurate. It's what I think and it's what I've said, and I would double down on that and say this shouldn't just be one class. This should be an entire line of curriculum that threads through all of your years in school that capture the need to stimulate curiosity. So yeah, you have to learn how to ask questions and courses typically are, ""Here. Here is knowledge and learn it."" Rather than, ""Here is something we don't understand. How would you probe it? How would you ask, what sequence of questions would you ask to learn what this thing is?"" Right? I mean, let me just, this might be contrived, but it'll serve the point. Let's say there's a sapling there, like a small tree growing. And say, if you didn't know anything about this, how would you go about investigating it?"
Interviewer,"This is a really important subject, of course, and."
Tyson,"By the way, I'm giving you very long answers. Is that okay?"
Interviewer,Long answers are great. This is why we have time.
Tyson,This is not a short podcast.
Interviewer,"No, not only allowed, but encouraged."
Tyson,All right.
Interviewer,"And I'd like to dig a little deeper on scientists versus scientific thinking, because it strikes me that I've come across many people just in travels, public speaking, and so on, different types of engagements, who would say, ""I'm not a scientist."" And in saying that, sort of throw out the hope or possibility of developing scientific thinking. And I certainly wouldn't call myself a scientist, but I've greatly benefited from reading Bertrand Russell or there's a book called Bad Science by Ben Goldacre, who's an MD, but who writes about many different things. And this book talks about how to read a study and how to read journalism that supposedly accurately covers studies. And I found it deeply enriching and valuable in navigating reality. Are there any particular books or resources you would recommend or approaches for people who would like to develop their ability to look at the world through this type of lens that you're describing?"
Tyson,"So, that's an important and insightful question because, you know, you should really be a host of a podcast. Just so you know. If I haven't convinced you of that by the end of this. So, you're right, not everyone can be a scientist and there's all this talk, ""We need more scientists in Congress."" And I think that'd be great. But what you really need are scientifically literate leaders who know how to trust the emergent scientific truths of scientific research and how to then embrace that and folded in as necessary into legislation or policy, either the executive branch or the legislative branch. So, it's possible to be scientifically literate and not be an expert in any particular scientific line, discipline. And so what does it mean? Tapping back to a few moments ago. It means knowing how to ask questions. It means knowing how to invoke skepticism."
Interviewer,"It's a good book. It's by Ben Goldacre. Gold and then acre, like the parcel of land. It's very helpful specifically for parsing health related information in media or marketing."
Tyson,"Yeah. So, one thing I have to say is, the press, and in all fairness to them, each journalist wants to be the first to break a story and because then everyone references them as the, and this is how Pulitzer prizes are given. If you break a story. And if you hang out at the coffee lounges of scientific conferences, and you hear a new result that could be amazing or devastating or mind blowing, and you write an article about it, what you're not doing as a journalist is honestly presenting the likelihood that it's true. You're just presenting it as true. Or you'll say, ""If this is true, this will revolutionize everything."" And then you leave that phrase in the first sentence of the article and all the rest of the article assumes it's true. And so the reader is left with the assumption that it's true, whereas a scientific truth is never any one person's research paper ever."
Interviewer,Ever.
Tyson,"Ever. The research frontier is a ratty, bloody, bleeding place, and most things will be wrong. And the few things that are right are demonstrated to be right because of verified other research that supports it. And so what you're looking for is a consensus not of opinion. I'm using that word because I don't have a better word. It's a consensus of scientific experiments and observations and once you have that you can say, ""Oh my gosh, this result continues to persist as the results of experiments even when conducted by this person's competitor, even when conducted in another country where they use 240 volts instead of 120 volts."" Maybe the power of the experiment influences the results, you know, who knows? You just don't know. So, when you have enough different people getting the same result, now the journalists can talk about it as the new truth but they don't because they want to get, this is a problem."
Interviewer,"Yeah. The importance of replication I think does not get enough popular press. And you mentioned earlier that in some measure, becoming a scientifically literate person is determining what sequence of questions you might ask to figure something out. And I think you could enjoy Ben's work. I can point you to some of it because it'll help readers to, at the very least look at, say, a piece in a newspaper or a magazine or online and identify what is missing. Right? So, if somebody says eating bananas doubles the risk of colorectal cancer, something like that. Right? Well, there are a bunch of questions, which are like, ""How did you determine that? How many bananas? Were you injecting bananas into rats? Are rats comparable to humans? And if doubled means that the risk went from one in 20 million to two and 20 million, is it really something that you need to worry about?""."
Tyson,Right. Because we remembered the word doubled without reference to the baseline on which you were doubling.
Interviewer,"Yeah. That How to Lie with Statistics is a great one too. Yeah. Make sure your Y axis has a label. I promised I would come back to it and I want to, in part because Carl Sagan is one of those people I would have loved to have met. I would have loved to have had a chance to meet him. If this is true, why did the admissions office of Cornell University forward your application to Carl's attention?"
Tyson,"Oh, yeah. So, when I was 17, a senior in high school applying to college, Cornell, where Carl Sagan was professor, was one of the schools I applied to and unknown to me, they forwarded my application to him. They had already accepted me and I think they had already accepted me. Is that right? Actually it doesn't matter at this point. They forwarded to him to get his reaction to it and my application was dripping with the universe. I was in the astronomy club. I walked dogs to buy my own telescope. In the glory days of dog walking before you had to clean up after them. Pre-pooper scooper laws. He saw my application and sent me a letter in the mail saying, ""I saw your application. I'd love to help you decide if you want to come to Cornell and I'd be delighted to meet with you and give you a tour of the campus the next time you're up here.""."
Interviewer,Amazing.
Tyson,"It's still in there. Oh, then it started snowing and I was scheduled to take the bus back and he left me his home phone number and said, ""If the bus can't get through then call me and spend the night with my family and go out tomorrow."" And I thought, ""What's going on? Why?"" I'm thinking to myself. And I realized that he was deeply committed to making sure that a next generation had access. The next generation had the enthusiasm that he had. And I said to myself at the time, ""If I'm ever as remotely famous as he is, then I will give time to students, allocate time to students, the way he has to me."" And now I joke that, because now of course I have my own books behind my desk that I reach for when students come in, and every time I do that I say, ""Yep. This is an homage to Carl."" And I joke that if I'm on the phone it's, ""Barack, I got to get back to you. I've got a student who's waiting for, "" Students first. So I already knew I was going to be an astrophysicist at that point. But that exchange with him codified for me what kind of a scientist I would be, what kind of humanity I would carry with me in my interactions with others, especially students."
Interviewer,"What do you hope to instill or infuse in students, if you have a short amount of time with them? If they are in your office, and you're going to reach back and grab a book? What book?"
Tyson,"Yeah, a great question. It's ambition. Ambition has gotten a bad meaning lately because people think, ""Oh, that's an ambitious person in the office place."" In the business setting. That usually means you're stepping on top of people to get forward. ""That's an ambitious person,"" and it doesn't always mean that, but it carries some of that patina today. I'm simply saying, what is your confidence in yourself? What are you doing to boost who and what you are in this subject? And how far do you want to take it? These are all aspects of the ambition tree. And so I also encourage people, you should not distract yourself with what grades you're getting. After your second job, no one asks you what grades you got ever. All right? Go ask any 30-year-old person, ""When was the last time someone asked what their GPA was?"" They won't even remember when that was. What matters is, are you a good problem solver? Are you moral? Are you a hard worker? Are you a good leader? Do you have insights into the field? These are the questions that matter."
Interviewer,"Now let's talk about that for a second. So the Letters from an Astrophysicist, you have in reading, in preparation for this, looking at your bio, looking at your current projects. I mean, I somehow create the illusion that I do a lot of stuff but you really seem to have an incredible ability to work on multiple projects. You certainly have more opportunities than bandwidth to execute on all of those opportunities. How do you choose to write a book, let's say, like Letters from an Astrophysicist? Why that book and why now? Just the decision process for choosing that amongst all of the many things that you could spend time on."
Tyson,"Yeah, so it's a matter of, you remember the game in the arcade where all these coins are piled on top of each other, and you have this pushing bar?"
Interviewer,Yes.
Tyson,"And the bar pushes and you add another coin, and it pushes, and there's a big stack. Is it going to come? No, it's not going to come. Let me try again. I don't know what that game is called but I think we're all familiar with it. There are occasions where so many things are preloaded in my life and I have to ask, ""Well, what am I going to do today instead of tomorrow? What should I have done yesterday?"" Well, there's this big stack that's ready to spill over. That's the one I got to do now. Otherwise I'll lose it all. Or it'll roll down the street. So, some of it is, not to overstretch the metaphors, but some of it is like the person who spins the plates and keeps them all spinning all at once. I don't know if that arcade trick is still, that doesn't make the evening variety shows anymore. That used to count as entertainment. Plates spinning on sticks."
Interviewer,"Yeah. Exciting. Congratulations. I want to come back to the comment on balance, which makes sense to me. Maybe like trying to stabilize your heart rate indefinitely, it's not a great idea."
Tyson,Excellent analogy.
Interviewer,"Yeah. Heart rate variability. It's a thing. And in navigating a full life, as you do, if and when you ever feel say overwhelmed or scattered in some way or if you feel like you've lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? Do you have any practices or questions, anything that you use to refocus or sort of down-regulate in order to reassess things?"
Tyson,"All right, that's a great question, and I think that would be a perfect question for most people, but I run my life a little differently from that and so it's as follows. I agree to probably 10 percent more projects than I will finish. I get about four times as many requests to participate in projects than I will ever, so I have to say no to most things. And the ones I say yes to, it's about 110 percent. So it's like airline overbooking, if you will. Continuing creative analogy. You don't overbook so much that there's a mutiny or that people want to overthrow your, but there's just enough so that circumstances will have whatever is the 100 percent of what I produce, get made. The other 10 percent don't get made. It's that simple and so basically I default on about 10 percent of the projects that I agree to in advance and that means the time is always completely full, always."
Interviewer,She's not sending you a lot of horoscopes?
Tyson,"No. So she actually is a pre-filter for news. Right? And so that works great. There are periods of time on the weekends where I have a five-hour block. I will write during five-hour blocks. It might take you an hour to get into it. All right? Well if you only have an hour block, and it takes you an hour to get into it, you can't write in hour blocks. It doesn't make any sense. So all of the timeframes throughout the week are allocated for what kind of things I would do in them. So, there isn't a time, ""Well, I have to focus."" If I only have an hour, I don't have to focus. I'm just doing email. It's not about getting ready to focus or regrouping. Plus, everything I agree to, I'm excited about. I want to do it."
Interviewer,So let's talk about Dr. Tyson Airlines for a second.
Tyson,With the overbooked airline! Okay.
Interviewer,"Yeah. With the overbooking. So in the airline business, they have systems for managing overbooking if everyone happens to show up. So they might ask for volunteers, and then they offer bribes, and then they offer free trips, and then so on and so forth. What is your approach to canceling or renegotiating the 10 percent breakage, so to speak, that overage? What does the communication look like?"
Tyson,"There's a lot of finesse there. Again, that's another insightful question because the energy and effort to say no gracefully is way greater than saying yes. Because you can say yes ungracefully and it's a yes, but a no, there's no reason to make enemies with people. You want to make sure they're still there. You want to make sure they might ask you once again to do what it might be and then maybe it'll end up in the 100 percent rather than in the overbooking part. So just to be clear, the overbooked could have been in the accommodated part. It just landed in the overbooked section. So what I will typically do, I'll send a polite note of regret and say, ""My calendar got away from me. I could not keep up.""."
Interviewer,"Got it. Thank you. This is a sort of an area of study that's become increasingly interesting to me. Not just how to say no initially, which may be the easiest if done well the first no, but also how to renegotiate as needed when circumstances change or when you're overbooked and things along those lines. So thanks for telling, sharing your approach. I've been fascinated by your approach to preparation in a number of different examples that came up when I was reading in prep for this."
Tyson,"By the way, that New Yorker profile, I was going to write a companion analysis to that profile. Only because, while the profile was fact checked, it was not impression checked. And you can say something that is factually true, but then you can ask, ""If someone reads this, what are they going to think?"" And if they don't think what that which is true, even though what they read was technically a fact, then the article is not authentically communicating reality."
Interviewer,"Oh, yes, please do. And I'm sorry that you had that experience. I also had that experience with a New Yorker profile."
Tyson,"Oh, you did?"
Interviewer,"Which was a really upsetting to me at the time with the impression, sort of the impression assessment as you put it, which I think it was put very well. So these I think may be pretty neutral. So the two things that I wanted to mention, and you can correct me if these are inaccurate, were to decide where to go undergrad. You created a spreadsheet that listed recent contributors, physics and astrophysics, articles to scientific Americans showing which schools they'd attended and which faculty they had later joined. The school that appeared most frequently on the spreadsheet was Harvard. And so you decided to go there. And then I'll give you one more and then you can correct or."
Tyson,That's accurate.
Interviewer,"Okay, great. The second was before going on The Daily Show, this is with Jon Stewart, you studied past episodes counting how many sentences Jon would permit a guest to speak before butting in with a joke, and so you were able to really, not necessarily script out, but plan very effectively having taken those preparatory steps. And what I'd love to know is if there's a particular example that comes to mind of preparation really, really paying off. If there were any inflection points in your life or just particularly important moments where preparation has paid off for you."
Tyson,"It paid off not in a literal money sense, but in a success sense. It pays off every single time I am interviewed on television, because I look at the host and I look at, like I said, as was accurately portrayed in that profile for Jon Stewart, I knew that if he interrupts you before you get a point across, everyone will laugh at his comedic quip. But now you have this dangling information that you have to get back to, and maybe you won't get back to it smoothly and maybe the conversation will move on. And that makes for a messy trail in the exchange that you're having with the host."
Interviewer,"You know what I'd love to do, I only have a handful of questions left, is for those people who listen to this interview or any interview on this podcast, it's sometimes easy to feel intimidated by guests when reading or hearing about their many, many, many great successes. If you'd be open to it, just to kind of humanize things a bit, would you be open to sharing how a failure or apparent failure perhaps set you up for later success? Or a tough time that you were able to get through? Are you open to sharing?"
Tyson,"Oh, of course. Well, first of all, let's start with the more recent example. There was an episode of The Colbert Report. I ended up being on his show about 13, 14 times, something like that. I think I was his most repeated guest actually. One of the times I missed a current event. Now his interview in character is the most challenging interview I've ever done on television. And to this day is the most challenging because Stephen Colbert is smart. I think he's the smartest one out there. And he's creating this character. So I have to know what does a double thread through that. And it could rear itself in any way at any moment."
Interviewer,"And it seems like your parents were also, and I'm kind of reading between the lines here, but supportive of you being ambitious and self motivated as an autodidact outside of the classroom, and not overly fixated on grades within the classroom. Is that a fair ."
Tyson,"Since I wasn't failing any classes, they were not concerned. I got As, Bs and Cs my whole life averaging a B basically. So it was not a problem. My brother and sister needed more sort of buoyant support from my parents academically than I did. So looking back, I think I was a pretty easy kid to raise, all things considered. Right. So for example, if I go out on a Friday night and I come back late, they can't say, why did you come back late? You have to come back earlier. Well why? Well it's because you could have been studying. No, my grades are okay. What I mean is my parents were not, if I got a B, they're not asking how come it wasn't an A. Or if I got an A minus, how come it wasn't an A plus? That's not what kind of parents they were. As long as I was progressing in school and moving through and doing okay, they were fine."
Interviewer,You have an impressive memory for.
Tyson,"Wait, one last thing. Ask yourself, suppose they were high pressure parents with regard to grades. So there I am with my own sort of photography business, right? And I'm in the astronomy club, and this sort of thing. And they're saying we don't want Bs, we want As. Then I have to cut away those other activities to spend more time in the books to get As. Then I would have had As and then nothing else in my life would have developed. And that's an interesting trade off one is making of their kids as a parent. If you're going to require grades when their time they might've otherwise spent, they could have grown in other ways that are not measured by grades. But go on. That's just a thought I just had."
Interviewer,You might not have had time for developing your ankle pick in wrestling as another example. Which we won't get into in this conversation because.
Tyson,"Yes, I used to wrestle."
Interviewer,"I'd be very self-indulgent. But those of you who are interested, you can follow up another time. Dr. Tyson was also a very successful wrestler. I was mentioning."
Tyson,"Well, in high school, I was undefeated in high school. College was another matter. I sort of wrestling corn fed guys from the Midwest."
Interviewer,"Yeah, tough breed, tough breed."
Tyson,"I'm sure were hauling cows from childhood. And that was a whole other level of commitment. And so I had a losing record all my years of college. I think my senior year I might've been six and five or something, but I enjoyed the sport immensely whether or not I was winning."
Interviewer,"I'm going to show some restraint in jumping into wrestling for the rest of this conversation. I'll grab the lifeline back to my question about memory. Well, it's indirectly about memory. You seem to really have a knack for remembering quotes, facts, figures, all sorts of data, and sayings. I'm curious if there are any particular quotes that you think of often or live your life by. Are there any favorite quotes that you come back to often?"
Tyson,"Yeah. One is by Ptolemy, Claudius Ptolemy. 2,000 years ago, he was an Alexandrian mathematician who wrote a book, which was the crowning achievement of a geocentric universe. Of course, the whole concept was wrong, but it was interestingly wrong, right? If you're going to be wrong, at least be wrong in a way that stimulates further research, which is what that did. The translation, which went into Arabic a thousand years ago, was called Almagest, which when it was translated into Arabic. That title is now the title that we now use for it because that's the form in which it was most remembered. In other words, it was the most widely distributed after it was preserved in Arabic and then re-translated back into Latin and English. ""Almagest"" just means ""the greatest.""."
Interviewer, beautiful.
Tyson,"While I'm on a roll, Dom Pérignon, the monk who has a very famous champagne named after him, stumbled on this double fermentation process where the first fermentation of the yeast gets you alcohol from sugar and then a second fermentation gives you carbon dioxide, which is the the bubblies. He does this by accident, and then he tastes it, and his first comment was, ""I believe I am tasting the stars.""."
Interviewer,Whisperings.
Tyson,Whisperings.
Interviewer,"The theme and the takeaway that come to mind is that you and I have to have some wine or bubbly and talk about stars. I mean, that's clearly the subtext here."
Tyson,"I don't want credit for a good memory. I don't know how it compares with the average person's memory, but I like remembering things that matter to me, that have moved me. It takes nothing to remember a quote that moves you. In this moment I'm wearing a shirt with the entire tract of Desiderata printed on it. Old timers might remember it from back in the '70s. It's this manifesto for how you might live one's life, written by Max Ehrmann. But that was only discovered later. It was originally attributed to some anonymous monk because they found it in a church, 1600s, in a desk drawer and they figured it was from when the church was founded. But no, it's more modern. It's from 1927. Max Ehrmann happens to be a rabbi, very different from a monk in the 1600s. But one of the lines is, ""Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.""."
Interviewer,"I'm really looking forward to Letters from an Astrophysicist. I recommend everybody check it out. I'll certainly be linking to that and everything we've discussed in the show notes, including Ptolemy with a PT for those people who want to look him up. But that'll be in the show notes."
Tyson,Ptolemy.
Interviewer,Ptolemy.
Tyson,Ptolemy.
Interviewer,"People can say hello to you on Twitter @NeilTyson, Facebook, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Instagram, also @NeildeGrasseTyson. This has been so much fun. I really appreciate you making the time to have this conversation."
Tyson,"Well, thanks for your insightful and welcomed questions. I think they're all the right questions in the right way. Giving me a chance to say fresh things to a listening audience. So thanks."
Interviewer,"My pleasure. As is there anything else you'd like to say, ask, suggest? Any parting comments before we wrap up?"
Tyson,"No, I'd see myself as a servant of the public's curiosity. So the fact that you had interest in interviewing me meant that you felt that your fan base, your following, would have an interest in me. And so I'm flattered by that consideration. And I just hope I served their curiosity or stochastic curiosity in whatever ways that that are within my abilities."
Interviewer,"Well, you certainly stoked my curiosity. I have pages of notes, and that gives me certainly hope that that's the case for a lot of people who will have listened to this. It would be fun to see you again in person sometime."
Tyson,Excellent. Look forward to that.
Interviewer,And very much appreciate it. Thanks again.
Tyson,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Interviewer,"What, me worried? Are you scared?"
Tyson,"Well, I think it's moments like this that we should consider shots across our bow. It's not this single asteroid that puts us at risk. There are thousands of asteroids whose orbit in the Solar System crosses that of Earth. And we have a little acronym for them, NEOs, near Earth objects. And our biggest goal is to try to catalogue them, so we know in advance if one is going to put us at risk."
Interviewer,So how real is the threat of any of these NEOs hitting Earth in a major way that could possibly have huge consequences?
Tyson,"Huge, huge consequences."
Interviewer,"If there's a direct hit, what would happen?"
Tyson,"Oh, it's bad, it would be a bad day on Earth. This particular asteroid is about three-quarters of a mile in diameter. That's not big enough to render humans extinct. But it would completely destroy the infrastructure of any landmass that it hit. So it would be very bad for the culture of any country that it happened to hit, or the coastal regions, that could experience a..."
Interviewer,"So what could it, potentially typhoons and..."
Tyson,"Yes, you could get tsunamis that could take out coastal cities if it lands close to a continental shelf. But the chances of it hitting are about one in a million."
Interviewer,"Oh, well, good. That's making me feel a little bit better."
Tyson,That's a good sign. That's a good sign.
Interviewer,"But you're cataloging this very closely. And we talked a little bit about the trajectory of what we think this asteroid is. Describe to us geographically where we think it will go, and where it might hit."
Tyson,"Well, there are tens of thousands of asteroids orbiting safely out in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. And there is a subset of them that have orbits that come close to Earth. And these NEOs by the way, we've been hit in the past. This one probably won't hit us. But it's not just an imagination, that we are at risk here on Earth."
Interviewer,And you've brought evidence of that?
Tyson,I've got evidence of one. This is a meteorite. It's very heavy.
Interviewer,You're not kidding. This is very dense.
Tyson,"This is part of the meteorite that made the famous crater in Arizona, meteor crater, formerly known as Barringer (ph) crater. And that one happens to be made of iron. Iron asteroids stay together in one piece all the way through Earth's atmosphere. And they leave big craters."
Interviewer,You tend to associate with people who care a lot about these matters. What does it say to you that this kind of story got the most hits on CNN.com? There's a tremendous degree of interest in it.
Tyson,"Yes, well, of course. Survival matters. And to the extent that media pays attention to these kinds of risks. By the way, they are low probability, high consequence events."
Interviewer,Right. So how do you prepare for them?
Tyson,Well...
Interviewer,It's not like you can go out and buy a suit that's going to protect you...
Tyson,"... swat you like a bug if that hits you. What you need is a healthy space program, because the day is going to come, if we find one with our name on it, we want to go up and at least nudge it out of harm's way. That will take technology. That will take time. There is only a couple of dozen people in the world today who are monitoring the sky for these asteroids. That's not enough, as far as I am concerned."
Interviewer,"Well, you bring along the best show-and-tell items tonight. A piece of an asteroid..."
Tyson,The Mars meteorite.
Interviewer,"The Mars meteorite. Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, thank you for your insights."
Tyson,Good to be back.
Interviewer,"What, me worried? Are you scared?"
Tyson,"Well, I think it's moments like this that we should consider shots across our bow. It's not this single asteroid that puts us at risk.

Tyson,The Mars meteorite.
Interviewer,Most humans who could ever exist never will think I've heard you say if there's been more humans that have not come into.
Tyson,Existence than do exist by far and so the fact that you exist at all is against stupefying odds of who gets.
Interviewer,Born and who does not any moment you spend squandering those moments you are alive does disrespect to all those who.
Tyson,Will never even be born I believe that each and every one of us has the power within ourselves to create.
Interviewer,The life that we really want and i want to help give you the tools to make that happen.
Tyson,I'm danica patrick and i'm pretty intense .
Interviewer,Welcome to the pretty intense podcast today's guest is someone that is about a million times more intelligent than me.
Tyson,And i'm not gonna lie it was a little intimidating Neil deGrasse Tyson astrophysicist not even sure what that.
Interviewer,Means but look he is amazing and his depth of knowledge is not only about stars and space and where did we come.
Tyson,From and you know adams and nucleuses and subatomic particles and a whole bunch of other words I can't think of.
Interviewer,Because they're too big for me but we talked about religion and you know that was something that really surprised me.
Tyson,Because look he's a scientist and scientists and science and religion don't really go together but he he knows.
Interviewer,A lot about it and we talked about that we talked about why he knows a lot about it.
Tyson,We we talked about another interesting topic that was fascinating and that's just the trajectory of being 1% more.
Interviewer,Intelligent so chimpanzees are 1% less intelligent than humans so what's 1% warm what's 1% more of that.
Tyson,And then of course i asked the ultimate question do you believe in aliens so I hope you have an amazing time listening.
Interviewer,To this and learn because i sure did well I became a huge fan with cosmos Oh excellent why are you like a few years.
Tyson,Ago okay i put that on i was like that looks interesting and I've always been blown away if you're not something's.
Interviewer,Wrong i mean i used to i used to remember I used to sit there as a kid nice to look up and I said I was like it.
Tyson,Goes on forever yeah that just gives me a headache at the pure thought of it and it still gives me a headache to think.
Interviewer,That montt that idea of like it just keeps going and there's no one but there has been and if there isn't and what's.
Tyson,The end i mean so here's the thing our senses are five traditional senses were forged sort of in the plains of Africa.
Interviewer,Where there is no need to think about know or understand infinity we have no capacity for that it's our mathematics.
Tyson,That shows us that it's real it's our observations of the universe that show the infinitude of it all and you just.
Interviewer,Got a deal we want answers but you can't be a scientist this is the interesting paradox scientists want answers to but.
Tyson,We are completely content steeped in ignorance because it's the ignorance that attracts us not the answers to fit.
Interviewer,To figure it out to figure it out journey it's the journey to that frontier I tweeted recently just cuz it.
Tyson,Came upon me very funny oh thank you that as the area of our knowledge grows so too does the perimeter of our.
Interviewer,Ignorance hmm and so right so with the scientific you're saying a bigger center gets the bigger the outside outside.
Tyson,Outside the perimeter you know why it's like age it makes me feel like a gigantic Fortin you because you know.
Interviewer,More you know more of what you don't know that's what it is and here's the problem here's a prevailing problem in.
Tyson,Society it's knowing enough to think you're right but not enough to know that you're wrong.
Interviewer,I have to do this with you a lot of tea that's insightful okay I'm saying okay yep.
Tyson,You learned a little bit about something and you say I got this yeah I got this well maybe you don't but you don't know.
Interviewer,Enough to know that you don't write you have to learn more to realize you actually didn't know so the great.
Tyson,Challenge for us all to repeat the phrase is knowing enough to think you're right but not knowing enough to know.
Interviewer,That you're wrong and that gets a lot of people in trouble because they rise up thinking they got the answers and so as.
Tyson,A scientist there are answers we have we know a lot about how the world works but our job is to hack our way a cutting.
Interviewer,Through the brush and ramble to the frontier that boundary between what is known and unknown in the universe and.
Tyson,When you stand there and look out into the abyss you can't fear that that has to attract you right and and so we we.
Interviewer,Celebrate not knowing i have a whole video see what do you mean celebrate we don't know it's like hey where's the.
Tyson,Next place where we don't know it i got over there oh my gosh or someone makes an observation or discovery that we.
Interviewer,Don't understand we don't understand it let's have a party let's have a conference and let's have bring all our.
Tyson,Best ideas to the table and we'll talk about it it'll get excited about it yeah that's that's that is it so so if you.
Interviewer,Have to have answers yeah i think that's in white that a religion kind of does that religion gives you answers to all.
Tyson,Manner of things what happens after you die what happens you know your spirit your this and people read it they got.
Interviewer,The answer and it gives them certain comfort I think I hear here's how one of these conversations has played out.
Tyson,Before so a religious person might ask me so how the universe get here looking at the Big Bang and that describes.
Interviewer,Everything like from that first moment and then and then they'll say but what was around before the Big Bang.
Tyson,And i'll say i don't know that's what we got top people working on it well they have to be something is there we're.
Interviewer,Blind thank you yes yes we got singularity people working on.
Tyson,That they call string theorists hmm so you were right on the button there but they'll say there had to be something I.
Interviewer,Said i don't know maybe there was nothing I don't know we're working up they had to be something that's God.
Tyson,Right so they got the answer yeah so we want to answer they insist they say God and then they go home and they.
Interviewer,Can sleep well at night whereas a scientist on the frontier hardly ever gets a good night's know if.
Tyson,It was distracted by the unknown you said that the thing that scares you most is not knowing the right question to ask.
Interviewer,It's not that i don't wanna say it scares me but it it it intrigues me so it feels to me like this edge of the.
Tyson,Frontier that you're talking about is scary because you don't know what to ask next but it's exciting and so if.
Interviewer,Something excites you right you should dive in it's like how I felt about like for me last year I hosted the.
Tyson,Espys and i was scared shitless like i was like I'm not funny I'm not presentable you don't see it I.
Interviewer,Can't do this and i was like but i really want to but I was scared but I was excited and I had to finally fight.
Tyson,Off the scared enough to say yes because I feel like if something scares you and excites you somewhat the same you should.
Interviewer,Go with it you should dive in I think there's deep wisdom there and often you respect the.
Tyson,Thing you fear the most and you'll you will delicately navigate let which you fear the most so you might be giving.
Interviewer,That the most attention the most care the most concern so yeah so for me people ask that that point about the.
Tyson,Question i don't yet know to ask is a follow-on to the question what is the question you want to see most answered.
Interviewer,And the I've got through something we don't know what dark matter is and dark energy and.
Tyson,How you go from organic molecules to self-replicating life that happens sometime in the early Earth under plenty.
Interviewer,I got i got a list of questions but that's not what keeps me awake at night mm-hmm.
Tyson,It's the question i don't yet know to ask because we don't yet stand in the Vista that allows me to see that.
Interviewer,Question in the first place and it's discoveries that continue the continuum it's the continual parade of discoveries.
Tyson,That don't simply move forward but they ascend to give you higher and higher ground to see farther into the universe.
Interviewer,And recognize things that you didn't even know to ask that that I'd lay awake an iPad and so one of my regrets the day.
Tyson,I die i'll say to myself i wonder what questions we don't even know to ask yet and I would have died before I find out.
Interviewer,Have you answered some life do you feel like you've kind of know so I had a predictions a few decades ago I gave and.
Tyson,Watch you in indianapolis upon here when your speaking engagement whenever one of yours one of your tours yeah yeah yeah.
Interviewer,News clippings from what was the title of your tour called a mighty Biff is it reason that's it excellent yep my sister.
Tyson,And i wouldn't watched you that's a little thank you thank you so the so was I saying be what have you.
Interviewer,Learned like what it what do you feel like are there some questions that you're like some decades ago in a.
Tyson,Research paper i made a prediction that there ten times as many galaxies in the universe as our catalogs then record it.
Interviewer,And it was some little bit controversial not deeply controversial but just know that we don't think so this sort of.
Tyson,Telescope show decades later we found ten times as many galaxies how many galaxies do we think there are in the.
Interviewer,Universe this is silicon so you're so what's a bazillion what's bazillion times 10 10.
Tyson,Bazillions bajillion so the numbers are fluctuating right but anywhere between a hundred billion and a half a trillion.
Interviewer,Galaxies or really of all different sizes are in the universe and you might say well how come you don't know it more.
Tyson,Precisely not that you ask that but you might be thinking it between 100 billion and 500 billion which is a half a.
Interviewer,Trillion that sounds like you don't really know the answer however here's something that hardly anyone appreciates.
Tyson,About astrophysics the range of things in size temperature pressure is so huge that if you get something and you're off.
Interviewer,By a factor of two you're doing good yeah yeah because you could have been off by a factor of a thousand in either.
Tyson,Direction some would say okay i'm taller than you alright someone said well he brought you.
Interviewer,A lot or she thought not compared to this building out there not appeared to a Paramecium so to the building and the.
Tyson,Paramecium we're the same size as far as they're concerned because they're so far in that range from that size difference.
Interviewer,So in the universe there's such a big range in everything we're content if we get some within a fact or two then we.
Tyson,Move on you know what size thing you just made me think of that I think is like blows my mind is that please.
Interviewer,Clarify all those you know i'm generally going on but if you took and condensed all of the atoms down to actual matter.
Tyson,Like all the people on earth that's the size of an apple or something like yeah yeah so it's kind of blows my math okay.
Interviewer,Let me let me complete the mind-blowing please dimension of this okay there's a guy named first Rutherford he was a New.
Tyson,Zealand physicist and he wondered how much there's a nucleus an electron so he took.
Interviewer,Gold and hammered it very thin gold has this you this unique property that you can hammer it's so thin it's almost just.
Tyson,A few atoms thick across that so that's why this gold flower on there in ancient times because they can stay together not.
Interviewer,Only hands together but you can you can form it you can form it and you don't have to use very much of it okay and you.
Tyson,Can cover things and the whole thing's very shiny gold you've used real gold okay so that you can make it Sophia it's.
Interviewer,Not that expensive okay so that's why gold is good for it's usually made of what's holds like for I'm gold-plated.
Tyson,Came from exactly exactly exactly so you he made a gold foil and just sort of dangled it there and then he fired.
Interviewer,Particles mm-hmm into this go forth and he wanted to see how many of them would get stopped or ricocheted off her will.
Tyson,Pass through he expected most to be just ricocheted up this is you can't see through the gold one right it is solid.
Interviewer,As far as your concern right and 99.99% of all particles went through as though nothing was there god I love science.
Tyson,Okay well i'm not even done yet mom and he he freaked out what's going on here maybe did the particle go in and then.
Interviewer,Get stopped and in a step another one come out maybe it's just a transfer thing know it matter was mostly empty.
Tyson,And he concluded that the space between the nucleus of an atom and the electrons is this vast chasm of nothingness and it.
Interviewer,Is rumored that the next morning when he woke up he alone knew how empty matter was he was afraid to step onto the floor.
Tyson,Sure to be up in a high-rise ending on earth lest he fall through the atoms down to the basement because science.
Interviewer,Once you know you know you can't know can't unknow you can't unknow so now if you want to compress.
Tyson,Everything if you want to compress yeah all the people in the world can press us down and and fill in all those gaps yeah.
Interviewer,Yeah i have to do the calculation but Apple so maybe a maybe a plum yeah we all just fit into that little ball of.
Tyson,The human race would fit into that volume so what the hell are we what are we well I so I think you're over valuing.
Interviewer,The the matter part yet matter matters but the space you occupy includes space nothing wrong with that.
Tyson,So we're just stardust we've always been Stardust and I think the fact that we have this empty space it's what allows.
Interviewer,Atoms to do their thing if all that everything were collapsed into the dense matter of a nucleus you wouldn't have.
Tyson,Atoms its atoms that make molecules and its molecules that make life so we should be glad that atoms simply here's.
Interviewer,What happens i have one atom here a nucleus Anna and the electrons flitting about have another atom in electrons and.
Tyson,The electrons intersect and bind the two atoms together and you get a molecule if I get h2o is it because we're like it.
Interviewer,Being energy cooped up in an atom yeah there's energy everywhere everywhere that's why not to make another kind of.
Tyson,Leap here in this conversation but we're going everywhere I think it's legitimately gotta leap into this so you.
Interviewer,Can calculate how much chemical energy is in your body calculate that and that energy came from the fact that you made.
Tyson,Food your whole life food has energy it also tastes good but it has energy and you absorb that energy so that you can.
Interviewer,Build your when you're growing you can build your body from childhood to adulthood you in addition you use the.
Tyson,Energy just to live to maintain your body temperature right now the air is like 73 degrees in this room okay.
Interviewer,Your body temperature if you're human is 98 and after green you are sustaining a 36 the.
Tyson,26 degree temperature difference between your body in this air because of burning energy in this instant because the.
Interviewer,Moment you stop burning energy the moment you die actually this reminds me of a story about my dog a long time ago.
Tyson,Might my dog couldn't maintain his body temperature anymore and that was a sign that we knew Wow well so that means your.
Interviewer,Your your physiology is breaking down and you can maintain your body's normal functions and that's a very important.
Tyson,Function for a warm-blooded creature to maintain that body temperature but I can tell you this if you died then all that.
Interviewer,Metabolism stops the metabolism is the converting the the chemical energy into kinetic energy because you move then.
Tyson,Into thermal energy to keep your body warm so no watch what happens that instant your body begins to cool cools.
Interviewer,Down to what temperature what's on its way towards air temperature that's why if you go in a funeral parlor if there's.
Tyson,An open casket and you have any people who actually touches the dead body what's the first thing everybody says.
Interviewer,About it's cold yeah it's actually not cold it's the same temperatures the table as the chair as the floor it's the.
Tyson,Same campus is that you're not accustomed to touching skin at table temperature because skin is 98 point but.
Interviewer,Well it's usually a degree or so a little cooler than your inner temperature but high 90s so the energy.
Tyson,Of your body is there and it's working and it's maintaining your body temperature against this and so so all.
Interviewer,I'm saying is when you die so this is why I have told people when I die I don't want to be cremated oh do you know.
Tyson,What happens when you cream in you break apart the molecules of your body and release the energy that's what burning.
Interviewer,Is that's what that is there's energy in these molecules you burn it you break it apart your releases.
Tyson,Heat so now your body is ash hmm with no source of heat left in it and it it it when it.
Interviewer,Heated the atmosphere and the atmosphere radiated to space nothing wrong with that so your body's energy has now.
Tyson,Escaped escaped to space so wait a minute if you bury me however hmm that same molecular energy it breaks apart by.
Interviewer,Action of microbes they dine upon my body I have an energy source available to it's how you can eat a steak and have.
Tyson,The steak give you energy that's the future we're dead I mean you want to still give after your death thank you.
Interviewer,That's so kind of you that's spent my life dining upon flora and fauna right that is have given their lives for my.
Tyson,Sustenance the least i could do on death is to return the favor to a next generation of flora and fauna so that.
Interviewer,They can thrive in their own lives through it I have mine so it leads to this question where do we go when we die.
Tyson,Well so i can answer that question as a so I guess who what are we is the first question right we have to answer what.
Interviewer,Are we and then we have to answer where do we go there that fertile topic but before I get there I just want to say.
Tyson,Scientifically i know i can but like i said your body has a energy that you've accumulated your whole life nope all.
Interviewer,These molecules you go in the dirt all that energy is recovered and it goes back to all the other life-forms far as.
Tyson,Science is concerned you're done you're done so now you're asking but how about me my spirit energy my soul my.
Interviewer,Everything that i am yeah well we could turn to neuroscience okay they're parts of your brain that are you they're parts.
Tyson,Of your brain that if i tickle it or if I damage it we don't do this you people come in from head injuries this is this.
Interviewer,Is the full set of data we have on well not the full set now because we have probes and.
Tyson,Things but historically how do you know what part of the brain controls what it's from head injuries that people had.
Interviewer,Hmm you got hit over here you got hit back here you got hit over here there's a Language Center who's a facial.
Tyson,Recognition center there's the part of you that is your understanding of self if those parts of your brain gets.
Interviewer,Damaged you lose your language you lose your facial recognition you lose memories either short-term or long-term.
Tyson,We know these parts of your brain so to say I am me and that's some special spiritual entity as far as I can tell.
Interviewer,It's electro chemical synapses firing in your brain got it so it's giving you this belief that you are something other.
Tyson,Than just the chemistry and biophysics of a brain matter what is making it fire like what what is the what is the what.
Interviewer,Is asking it to do things what makes me think to ask you a question so this is consciousness and this is a huge.
Tyson,Frontier now here's something i would tell you no one else is gonna tell you you ready I'm sure everybody's writing.
Interviewer,Books on a subject it means we know nothing about it and the more the literature there is make.
Tyson,Sense the less we know about it that's why people keep writing it go go to the books if there's still bookstores go to.
Interviewer,The bookstore look at the shelf on the human mind oh the shelf after shelf now look at this shelf of physics.
Tyson,There's no who does the gravity boom because what because it is what it is what is with it we're on to the next.
Interviewer,Thing we got this so the fact that everyone and their cousin is writing a book on consciousness yes evidence of.
Tyson,What we do not yet know i'm just saying so are you saying that this is the exciting little frontier spot where.
Interviewer,We're at yes conscious what do you think about consciousness I think about it all the time and here's how I think about.
Tyson,Its why do i wake up every morning as me and not you or someone else if we're just.
Interviewer,Consciousness you're saying if if if i don't know I'm just saying why is it that every day I wake up I mean what.
Tyson,Makes that that and consider that identical twins with identical DNA have separate consciousness consciousness.
Interviewer,They're separate they're not the same people they have different thoughts they might have similar desires or you know.
Tyson,Their twin separated and they will draw the same color car or whatever with as they later discover that happens a fine.
Interviewer,But i'm talking about are you hungry in this moment that's your consciousness telling you this act.
Tyson,In your twin just ate an hour ago your twin is not having that same thought this is the big challenge with the with.
Interviewer,The transporter and star trek if i disassemble your molecules and reassemble them over there is your.
Tyson,Consciousness part of that if you're conscious it is even a transferable entity right I don't know so and let me.
Interviewer,Ask a more blunt question is consciousness even the right question to ask we think it's the right question if.
Tyson,I posed the question what kind of cheese is the moon made out of and you say yes be cheese I think it's pretty so so you.
Interviewer,Don't you start posing and creating experiments that are designed to test for cheese but the moon is not made out.
Tyson,Of cheese so you asked the wrong question in the first place not every question is a legitimate question and.
Interviewer,When you're on the frontier you don't even know what that question is you got a nice you got a ticket on drum you've.
Tyson,Got a tiptoe and ask in little bits is the moon made of anything is it made of atoms is it made of rocks what is it.
Interviewer,Made of how do i test that you got an inch your way there otherwise you'll bust out of the doorway.
Tyson,With a question you think it needs an answer like what is the sound of one hand clapping well just because you.
Interviewer,Assembled nouns and verbs the right sequence to make a legitimate sentence in the English language does.
Tyson,Not make it an authentic sentence worthy of scientific attention the same when I think about consciousness I think about.
Interviewer,Like neil are you your arms i control my arms but if you lost them might still be me that's right what about your heart.
Tyson,Well aristotle thought all emotion was in the heart here's what I think about often and that stayed with us through.
Interviewer,Like the renaissance until we had some understanding of brain it was like what does your heart tell you your heart is.
Tyson,Just pumping doesn't know anything about anything it's left over from a time when we thought all that our emotional center.
Interviewer,Was located in our heart that aristotle has a big have a lot to do with that misinformation that misunderstanding so.
Tyson,So i was wondered if aristotle said your emotions are in your pancreas then I wonder if on Valentine's Day images of.
Interviewer,The pancreas or some other organ you know it's just it's just by happenstance that the heart stayed with us so then.
Tyson,There's there's another sort of you know so if you if you didn't know from someone has a pancreas just give it a.
Interviewer,Chance so it makes me think of chakras it makes me think of energy centers when you go into more of the you know Eastern.
Tyson,Philosophies of you know the energy centers of our you know root chakra you know solar plex crown chakra all the.
Interviewer,Seven chakras like maybe the heart operates with those thoughts so it's that energy center giving you a feeling.
Tyson,Do you believe in that so i'm not convinced I mean I've seen the chakra charts and other sort of Eastern ways of.
Interviewer,Observing and thinking about life and the universe and I let me answer that two ways I could I could first say.
Tyson,There's no way any bit of science has ever found a way to justify that that's too blunt let me be a little more a.
Interviewer,Little softer and that is it is possible to have a philosophy about how something works that's wrong yet there's still.
Tyson,Benefit to be obtained from it so what would be an example of that what I what's a good example so let's.
Interviewer,Take the chiropractic for example okay if you read the foundations of chiropractic it's like got that right.
Tyson,But i'm writing that down don't ever go to a chiropractor go look at the charts that say everything about your body.
Interviewer,Emanates from spinal column vertebrate okay you catch a cold there's a blind into your vertebrae so manipulate the.
Tyson,Vertebrae and everything everything is to look at early writings about the chiropractic arts okay so what happens.
Interviewer,You go to a chiropractor they you know they pop your back and they manipulate it and it feels good.
Tyson,Whether or not it cured your common cold let's say about well there are not a cured your cancer whether or not.
Interviewer,Anything else happened people still derive some curative elements from it so in science what we try to do is extract.
Tyson,What it is they're the essence of what it is they're doing and only apply that mm-hmm that's what we try to do it's.
Interviewer,Very reductionist but that's what it's how we got civilization reductionist is there's this whole thing the.
Tyson,Reductionist if you're chewing on this bark and your pain goes away well is it the bark or is it some chemical in the.
Interviewer,Bark let me find out oh here's this chemical it's Alaska it's it's it's it's a seed of salicylic acid oh my gosh.
Tyson,That's aspirin aspirin so here his appear is a lump of bark and here's a pill what are you.
Interviewer,Gonna do you chew on them are gonna take the bill I think because I found what's in the bark that does it but you might.
Tyson,Have had a whole philosophy about bark that the tree has a spirit energy and the tree that per tree in particular is.
Interviewer,Touched by the gods and you and it the gods want you to feel better and to relieve your pain so the gods put this.
Tyson,Special magic potion in the bark and you chew the bark and you're all better I found the aspirin here it is go buy it.
Interviewer,In the grocery store for two dollars and so is it sad that I bypass the entire cultural spiritual rituals of it I don't.
Tyson,Think i don't think it's sad i'll tell you why look at how many rituals we still.
Interviewer,Participate in oh yeah and and they're beautiful and they're sensitive and they're reflective look at what Jews do.
Tyson,In in passover there's a seder and in the seder they leave an empty seat for Elijah in Casey and had to unlock the.
Interviewer,Front door in case elijah shows up at your seder do they really think that's gonna happen I don't think they really.
Tyson,Think elijah's coming i'm pretty sure they're not let that person in but but the ritual of it can be very communal.
Interviewer,And there's so much of what binds us socially that derives from ritual be it religious ritual or some other cultural.
Tyson,Ritual do you we play the national anthem at the beginning of games that kind of binds us all at the beginning of.
Interviewer,Sporting events if the canadiens are there we also play the Canadian national anthem we you take off your hat you.
Tyson,Salute you you hug on certain holidays you Thanksgiving we have Turkey yes I'm not here to judge the value of those.
Interviewer,Rituals scientifically i'm here to celebrate the value those rituals culturally I don't have a.
Tyson,Problem this kind of gets me into the fields oh by the way there's some sorry so to interrupt no go for it oh don't.
Interviewer,Lose i thought there's some rituals that might be hurtful to you sure okay and ice why withdraw the wine.
Tyson,I say if my region let's do that if it's hurtful to you or to myself I want someone to step in.
Interviewer,I'd want someone to theirs in catholic there's some Catholic and traditions particularly in central South America.
Tyson,Where an easter people will go on their knees in the way that Jesus was carrying the cross to suffer and like Jesus.
Interviewer,Suffered and i thought jesus suffer so we don't have to suffer i man no meat on Friday was enough right yeah so no it's.
Tyson,Not just no meat on friday fish on Friday because they were in that place when that rule came in it was the.
Interviewer,Fishermen were not getting as much business as the rest of the food producers and the Pope got his message.
Tyson,From god that one day we can have to eat fish so it's not a no meat day it's a fish day so you are still eating dead.
Interviewer,Animals but it kept the fisherman yeah so that's how you get messages god man I thought it was because meat was a luxury.
Tyson,It's like so like pulling back from the luxury it's always been a luxury for sure it's very expensive to produce meat.
Interviewer,Right so then what the hell did moses what what's the deal with Moses well knowing that take a man who says thou.
Tyson,Shalt not eat meat on friday maybe that's in the 11th through the 15th commandment that have lost all typically.
Interviewer,Where did his information come from for the Ten Commandments well so what's interesting to me is you know people.
Tyson,People need rules yeah without rules you know it's sad that we need rules but it's not that we.
Interviewer,Need rules well of course we need rules but we need threat of punishment for not following rules and for some people I.
Tyson,Think prison isn't enough right and so if there's a higher power above us all that.
Interviewer,Could damn you to hell for eternity that might keep you in line okay my issue with the Ten Commandments was that like.
Tyson,Why is that shalt not kill like number six I'm thinking that should have been a little higher big of a deal is killing.
Interviewer,Or or graven images or one god first you know I'm thinking this up that a little if I were dead if I had my druthers plus.
Tyson,Depending on which version of the bible you use thee the commandments are not exactly in the same order as each other.
Interviewer,So there's some various but in none of them is that's what I kill number one yet that is the highest level.
Tyson,Transgression we have in modern societies so we have made a judgment on the rest of the command saying no we.
Interviewer,Don't really care about the graven image no don't bear false witness that's a bad thing but we're not gonna punish shoot.
Tyson,And damned you forever for that so human element humans decided marijuana was illegal until recently till it was not.
Interviewer,It's just a human decision right so morality is actually this moving target I want to claim that it's a bounced it.
Tyson,Back and forth target but morality if you look over time has evolved to be sort of not in every place of course but.
Interviewer,We're always evolved to be more inclusive and more forgiving and more accommodating and so so more Allium it's.
Tyson,A huge philosophical frontier where do you get morality from and many people will say like it we get it from my.
Interviewer,Religion no you actually don't you actually don't what you've done is cherry-picked your.
Tyson,Religion and pick the things that make most sense in modern society and they say I get my morality from religion well.
Interviewer,You did you use secular reasoning to filter out so many of the statements that are made in the Bible especially.
Tyson,The old testament for example where you know it's if your children disobey you you should stone them well no we're not.
Interviewer,Doing that we're not i'm sovereignty the jail threat okay by the way mom and.
Tyson,Dad that's the gym okay we would we are not going to stone our children yeah before disobeying us we will now they.
Interviewer,Say no one happened let's go to the next one okay if by the way this section of the.
Tyson,Bible is in leviticus also contains the one where you shouldn't be homosexual okay this is the same section of the.
Interviewer,Bible that says you know you should stone your children if they disobey okay so we are you a cherry-picking right and.
Tyson,So what's happened and plus the bible was used to justify slavery why because nowhere in the Bible older New Testament.
Interviewer,Is slavery objected to it is passive or supportive in its attitudes towards slavery so what so most of what.
Tyson,Justified slavery over so many years came from people's readings of Scripture there are some other readings of.
Interviewer,Scripture where you got to go to the new Testament for this and you got to go to Jesus and it's do you want to others.
Tyson,There's doing you know there's this sort of the Golden Rule kind of thing and other ways to think about the Quakers.
Interviewer,Were totally anti ed quakers are Christian totally anti-slavery from the get-go.
Tyson,Mmm-hmm from the get-go and they were driven by religious means and you have the whole civil rights movement which.
Interviewer,Had a secular atheistic dimension to it but that was not talked up in the press a philip Randolph and others they were.
Tyson,Atheists someone who even like communist atheist communists who were there for the worker and workers rights and this.
Interviewer,Not the not the capitalist right so that the workers right Martin Luther King was the one that the press focused on.
Tyson,Because we were there's still a cold war and you can't have heroes who are sympathizers with the Communist Party so.
Interviewer,So martin luther king gets the the positive attention from the press but but he gets his roots from the Bible and.
Tyson,And this so so you you're cherry-picking to suit what your needs are at the top you know a lot about the Bible what a.
Interviewer,Transmat new tests kind of blowing my being a scientist so you're gonna have to explain to me how you know so much.
Tyson,I tell you why yeah please i was minding my own business just doing my astrophysics okay really.
Interviewer,I was just i was just mind my own business in the corner I got my calculus books and bikes all right and people.
Tyson,Would come up to me and say calculus i want you to make sure you know that okay do you be a little more comfortable with.
Interviewer,Infinity if you took calculus okay see there you go can I afford a private tutor big calculate a private calculus.
Tyson,Tutor and you'll come out of that saying I'm good with infinity so people started asking me as you study the universe have.
Interviewer,You found god does studying the universe make you closer to God I think any dude out there or so no just spiritually.
Tyson,Philosophically are you yes some might wonder if it's literal behind the moon so so I would have answers but I.
Interviewer,Realized if i'm an educator i can't just give any answer off-the-cuff it needs to be informed it needs to be researched.
Tyson,Knowledge is power it needs to be i need to do my homework before I start speaking on this topic and respect so I.
Interviewer,Started buying the books like but you know the Torah and so that's just purely the Old Testament I translated of course.
Tyson,Does i can't beat hebrew and then i got the you know King James Newton you know New Testament and then I got modern.
Interviewer,Translations of the new testament that use modern language and then I got a now assist of the Bible's and then I got yes.
Tyson,Well i mean i mean i said i know what's in and I went to some yeah passages that are more I mean they're places you don't.
Interviewer,This there's the whole section of the Bible where's who begat who that's not scintillating reading so you skip over.
Tyson,That i'm sorry it's okay okay I'm forgiving you producer for giving me away with your information.
Interviewer,About the bibles okay so you find places a place in the Bible for example where the value of pi equals three point zero.
Tyson,What do they got it wrong yeah yeah they got it wrong yeah they tell you why I have to in in 1.
Interviewer,Kings 7 that part of the bible they're describing King Solomon's property the castle and the his palace and the.
Tyson,Surrounding grounds and there's a pond there and here's the statement you ready the pond is round on all sides 30 cubits.
Interviewer,Around 10 cubits across the value of pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter so 30 divided by.
Tyson,10 goes 3.0 now had they said 31 cubits around because fractions and decimals weren't a big thing but and 10 cubits.
Interviewer,Across they would be much better they've got 3.1 and it's a hey they got a fig they got an understanding there and the.
Tyson,Best estimates of pi of the day what's not much different but there was a better estimate of Pi than 3.0 the.
Interviewer,Babylonians have 3.14 and that preceded the writing of that section of the Bible so my only place so I've learned all of.
Tyson,This and so now when people start asking me do I see God do I know God well how do I know the science is long and the.
Interviewer,Bible is right which is which i can engage that conversation in an informed and I'd like to even declare respectful.
Tyson,Way i'm not here to bash people i'm here to just share pic with people what is objectively true in the world are you.
Interviewer,Spiritual so that's good cuz right was religious yes I would I use versus like the Mart is like the fastest growing.
Tyson,Community to community i'm a cult leader so these are people who these are people who spiritual people.
Interviewer,I wouldn't call them spiritualists because those in a day were people who talk to dead talk to the dead.
Tyson,So our spirits of spiritual mediums they would talk so if you are spiritual today that means you feel there's something.
Interviewer,Out there beyond what we know could be a god but you're not affiliated with any organized religion that is the.
Tyson,Fastest-growing oh but so let me back that up people not affiliated with any religion would.
Interviewer,Include atheists that's the fastest growing community I saw a religion called um nism is omnes.
Tyson,'m which is the belief that there is that none of the no religions are true but there's truth within all of them.
Interviewer,Mmm-hmm i would say that's me i kind of I've always been very skeptical okay but now you have to go you have to visit.
Tyson,Each religion and find out what is true - and then staple all that together to get your organism and that's hard let me.
Interviewer,"Back up i can tell you certain things that are objectively false the earth is not 6,000 years old I got this one okay."
Tyson,Why do people have denial about like the science of the age of the earth or age of the you know how long humans have.
Interviewer,Been around and there's i have thought a lot about this and I've concluded there are three truths.
Tyson,Yes i'm ready yeah three truths okay are you ready yes all right sorry the three kinds of truths not three answers okay.
Interviewer,Hmm one time truth is an objective truth this is what is researched and established by the methods and tools of.
Tyson,Science this is what is true whether or not you believe in it it's how we make electricity work.
Interviewer,It's how the physics of your cars you drive works it's how earth moves around the Sun it's.
Tyson,How energy from the sun powers the ecosystem and the biosphere those are objective truths you.
Interviewer,You can argue it but it won't matter if you argue it it's true whether or not you argue it's it's your it's your you.
Tyson,Know okay so in the bookstore correct second kind of truth it's a personal truth these are truths that are true to.
Interviewer,You they are true down in your bones Jesus is your Savior Muhammad is your prophet these you know this is true no.
Tyson,Matter what and no one is going to take it from you at least not in a free society no one is going to take that.
Interviewer,From our religion and our religious or faiths and our our beliefs in our faiths are constitutionally protected conduct.
Tyson,Of american citizens it's what attracted so many immigrants over the decades where they were the religion was.
Interviewer,Persecuted where they were and they come here they knew they wouldn't be persecuted okay hence the religious.
Tyson,Melting pot that we actually are okay so that's your truth but watch what happens the only way you can get me to.
Interviewer,Share that truth is by some intense bout of persuasion or by threat of force violence or death I have a different.
Tyson,Personal truth than you do you require that I share your personal truth we will go to war over that you know why because.
Interviewer,My personal truth tells me that your personal truth is false mm-hmm most religions its most monotheistic really.
Tyson,The great monotheistic religions have as part of their tenant that other religions are false right.
Interviewer,So each one says the other one is false and curiously our country protects that it allows you to say that your belief is.
Tyson,True and everyone else is false and it allows me to say the same damn thing about you so you live in a community.
Interviewer,Where your folks are and you go to your worst place of worship on Saturday or Sunday and I go to.
Tyson,I pray five times a day to mecca i do that with my community and by the way we both work together in the same office.
Interviewer,Okay historically you didn't have places like the United States and whole legions would fight the Crusades the just look.
Tyson,At what people did to each other because their personal truths were not shared by others yes yes but yes yes it used to be.
Interviewer,A daily thing now we have wars over you know access to resources and things well yeah well and some other Dogma that.
Tyson,Might have arisen like nazism or you know that you can have Dogma oh but Dogma is equally as bad yes sorry.
Interviewer,Dogma can drive you to war just as readily as strongly held religious beliefs because Dogma is this is true no.
Tyson,Matter what you tell me yeah and that doesn't have to involve God that you'd involve any other strong beliefs strong.
Interviewer,Belief okay it means you're not susceptible to conversation and a new idea that could.
Tyson,Put you in a new place you are sealed off from arguments of reason so that's a personal truth there's a third kind of.
Interviewer,Truth it's a political truth this is what you think is true because someone repeated it to you often enough.
Tyson,Programming program it's correct what's finally watched the program for the programming what is Hillary's first.
Interviewer,Name crooked hillary told me the tv totally so what I will say about these three truths is in a pluralistic country.
Tyson,The pluralistic land if you are going to make laws that apply to everyone it seems to me you should base them on what.
Interviewer,Is objectively true and not is on any one person's personal truth which would then affect everybody else who doesn't.
Tyson,Share personal booty hmm and if you put it on a political quote truth mm-hmm then that.
Interviewer,Will blow like the breeze some other power rises up and they don't have something else and now that person who.
Tyson,Used to be your friend is now your enemy let me tell political truths can evolve the Republicans are not historically I.
Interviewer,Mean in in recent decades not known for being cuddly with minority groups okay if you look at how minority groups vote.
Tyson,Generally it's not republican yeah you could say why well the policies are might conflict with ideas Dada Dada not.
Interviewer,Fine do you know the first republican president was no oh he knows Abraham Lincoln yeah Abraham Lincoln friend of.
Tyson,The slaves hmm abraham lincoln's the first Republican president the Republicans were the anti-slavery party.
Interviewer,While the democrats were perfectly fine keeping slaves yeah lovely way to go no wait a minute so what happens the South.
Tyson,Had all the slaves so the slot the south is not going to be Republican the South with Democrats and they were Democrats.
Interviewer,From the civil war for a hundred years a hundred years in the South they had Jim Crow they had segregation they had all.
Tyson,Of that and they were just fine with it and from the 1960 through basically President Reagan in the 1980s that.
Interviewer,Flipped the republicans saw that they can get a stronghold in the south by altering their policies and saying yeah.
Tyson,We don't really wanna the equality here or whatever it was and keep this going and they one-by-one they absorbed the.
Interviewer,The dixiecrats the dixie democrats became Republicans so I'm saying if you're gonna base your.
Tyson,Life on political truths know that someone else is defining for you what it is you think is right and wrong and what.
Interviewer,Is true or not and as a academic and especially as a scientist I don't want anybody else doing my thinking for me.
Tyson,And political truths are someone else telling you what to think and how to think do you think I'm screaming at you.
Interviewer,Here i'm so yeah no it's good you know it's some passion I love it just is so anybody you think we need to think more.
Tyson,For ourselves i feel like i feel like there's this is a wave of coming it's kind of it's it's it's spirituality it's.
Interviewer,Hot buttons it's like think for ourselves a little bit more do you feel this do you think this is a good thing.
Tyson,I'd rather i agree but i'd rather say it differently okay yeah you'd rather than say think for yourself because sometimes.
Interviewer,There's an expert who knows more about something than you okay and if you have reason to trust.
Tyson,That person you trust them okay if this building is on fire and what was with 14 flights up and I say there's a sheet.
Interviewer,Over there and we can strap it to the thing we could jump out the window and glide to that thing.
Tyson,I bet you'll believe me because i'm trained in physics and I know something about eridan up you don't say oh no I.
Interviewer,Don't believe i don't okay goodbye how'd you work out my race card for all the physics that you know and so there's.
Tyson,The points where yes you'll trust someone without having to question it but I those extreme that's obviously a.
Interviewer,Contrived example but what you should do is when someone is speaking to you a pundit you should not just believe.
Tyson,Everything they say you should wonder if everything they say is true and use it as an excuse to go back and do a google.
Interviewer,Search or go check on that statement or go check on all of these things mm-hmm and the act of checking you end up.
Tyson,Learning yeah why is it that we live in a world where no matter what grade you're in.
Interviewer,The last day of school in may or in june you run down I'm stereotyping here you run down the steps.
Tyson,Toss your books in the air and say school's out yeah you're glad I did that very thing that school is out yeah you.
Interviewer,Are you what did we do to you in school so that when school is out you glad you're not in school.
Tyson,Something is wrong what i want to have happen is what we do in school is such that on the last day school you say.
Interviewer,School's out makes me i can't have to go three months without learning anything it's the only job in school is to learn.
Tyson,Knowledge is power i believe that and this reminds me of how I feel about food when people like oh gosh I'm on a diet I.
Interviewer,Have to eat this healthy food all i want is the pancakes in my cheat meal it's like how about you change your psyche a.
Tyson,Little bit and go man this is delicious I'm gonna put a little of this seasoning on it we have like the wrong thought.
Interviewer,Process for some things that we have now culturally convinced ourselves that certain things are good certain things.
Tyson,Are bad when all we need to do is change our point of perception that is true for so many things and let me tell you my.
Interviewer,Thoughts about food i'm disturbed that's too heavy a word I'm concerned that in America we view food that has high.
Tyson,Calories as bad when most of this world does not even get their minimum calories in a day we are so wealthy yes we have.
Interviewer,So much access to food that a high calorie food is considered bad and I cringe every time I see that in here.
Tyson,Because i think of empowerment is millions what the number I forgot the number.
Interviewer,But it's millions nothing children starve to death either big out of them because not enough food or because of.
Tyson,Malnutrition that comes from having not having enough food like you can die just because your your body eats its own.
Interviewer,Calorie content and they just drop dead or you can be malnourished and then you're susceptible to diseases that are.
Tyson,Opportunistic under those situations i'm telling you the United States might be the only country in the world that has.
Interviewer,Overweight homeless people but they're getting plenty of calories okay the donuts are doing them just fine yeah and.
Tyson,So i is another thing i sensitive to people who can't help themselves for whatever reason whatever they got the.
Interviewer,Wrong hand dealt or they they need motivation the people that step over homeless person to go help a stray dog.
Tyson,There's a homeless human being that's your species sitting right here that you just ignored what are you doing now.
Interviewer,Don't get me wrong i love me some dogs okay but if I have to rank how I'm going to invest my time and energy and.
Tyson,Resources it's gonna be to help people and in there sure I'll help a couple of dogs I don't have a problem with that so.
Interviewer,What i'm gonna saying oh there's a dog in trouble they're not even see the homeless person oh my gosh.
Tyson,So it's an outlook thing and i'll only give here's what I do it just as a matter of policy if I go to a restaurant.
Interviewer,I eat well at a restaurant and i have a doggie bag mm-hm if I pass a homeless person they.
Tyson,Get in a doggie bag yeah no matter how expensive that food was were like leftovers I can't wait for tomorrow.
Interviewer,Morning stakes knowing your ass exactly exactly know it goes in the lap of the homeless person but if I have my choice.
Tyson,Of homeless person who's going to the fittest person I see who's in the most need right so yes outlook I think is.
Interviewer,Everything what are some other things that you're passionate about make it be they could be passions like that that.
Tyson,You you know it's not necessarily about stars in the dark matter but you know what other things.
Interviewer,I guess i'm seeking what sounds like it's passion but it's really just an interest a deep interest yeah maybe this.
Tyson,Passion I'd like you know I like old books No okay like okay get that get that digital.
Interviewer,Book reader out of here oh me too yeah all the way you know do you realise a physical book never runs out of.
Tyson,Batteries did you know that ever it's still there it even smells unique and cool people ride unum it's fun I I have.
Interviewer,Books i i collect books they go back in time that that capture a moment in our collective thinking where we that pivot.
Tyson,In a moment in our collective thinking where we have a new understanding of the universe or our our place within the.
Interviewer,Universe and this allows me it's humbling because you see the struggle that's that people went through to get.
Tyson,Something that we today just take for granted yeah as though the knowledge on wiki pages is handed down from on high.
Interviewer,No somebody figured that out and it's staying around here's the thing that scares me about digital it's a click.
Tyson,Away from being gone i think about my bank account I'm like oh sure I don't know what was the last book you read.
Interviewer,Uh-oh so I I dip into a lot of books in different ways but I think the last book.
Tyson,I read so i have several going right now but the last book I finished was a book I'd actually read long ago but I read it.
Interviewer,Again and it's barry goldwater's the conscious of her conservative look at you did she go into the conscious step.
Tyson,No but it's just it's just the brought to mind uh because that's really what it should have the conservative yeah yes so.
Interviewer,Barry goldwater was you know a very well known and popular conservative politician in the United States who.
Tyson,Actually ran and lost four grand for president and lost and this is during the Cold War so in this book he's trying.
Interviewer,To say what that conservative thinking is better than liberal thinking and it's better than communism I just I'd like.
Tyson,Knowing how other people think sure i would classify myself as liberal in most ways that matters.
Interviewer,Socially yeah probably fiscally centrist I would say I'd like learning how conservative.
Tyson,People think and how they make decisions and what's interesting people say tell me all the books on your shelf and.
Interviewer,They're expecting books to be all the stuff that I already agree with that's very smart of you what's always on the.
Tyson,Other side i read it all the time that's why I have a shelf of Bibles I have a shelf of UFO sightings.
Interviewer,I have a shelf of all don't worry i won't ask universe oh nice no nice of you I saw it and I.
Tyson,Have i haven't read it yes yes a guy from up at MIT I think wrote that or is or is there another author do you.
Interviewer,Remember the author of this one um i can't remember oh yeah so holographic universe that's very freaky it's freaky.
Tyson,Stuff that we might just be a two-dimensional hologram like some other reality I think the universe has told us.
Interviewer,That anything that is possible may just be likely and yeah we could just be information contained in a membrane.
Tyson,Surrounding some other volume and we it's the illusion of a reality but in fact we're just this holographic.
Interviewer,Projection of information yeah it's deep it's very I mean like it took me a while to read completely deep it's very.
Tyson,Interesting and it makes you think it makes you think in new ways about the mind it makes you think about the power.
Interviewer,Of the mind really which is something that's very intriguing to watch so let me let me just this but really the power.
Tyson,Of the mind let me disavow of that if i may yeah okay yeah we figured out a lot of stuff we've got art and music and.
Interviewer,Poetry in the hubble telescope beeping we've walked on the moon the human mind is something else okay.
Tyson,Do you know our closest genetic relatives yes you do yeah just say it yeah chimps.
Interviewer,Chimpanzees okay chimpanzees 99 and a half percent identical DNA done yeah yeah so why do they have every muscle.
Tyson,And every bone in the same place that we do and they're comfortable you cross your legs they're comfortable crossing.
Interviewer,Their legs sitting there and mean another thing they have an itch they scratch it you want to call it they call.
Tyson,Okay except they like termites and weird stuff too okay I'm gonna ask you what.
Interviewer,You going out of there so so the urge and this is our ego doing this the urge is to say what a difference that one and.
Tyson,A half percent makes it may be as low as 1% but it's small I don't remember the exact number but it's what a difference.
Interviewer,That one person it makes we have civilization and the smartest chimpanzee can stack boxes to reach a banana our.
Tyson,Toddlers can figure that out i've seen young children stack things well okay so maybe allow me to pose you this question.
Interviewer,Maybe the difference between the human and the chimpanzee at the 1% DNA is the same small difference as between.
Tyson,Stacking boxes to reach a banana and the Hubble Space Telescope you're saying no come on how could what do you say.
Interviewer,Obviously the telescope is much more advanced than a monkey chimp figuring out to stack box up you tell me you're.
Tyson,Tend to say that okay now here's the thought experiment imagine an oak now here here's a simple sentence ready.
Interviewer,Okay danika here you're flying back to LA tomorrow you catch up a plane you fly United out of Newark or wherever you.
Tyson,Land five hours later and you have a dinner engagement with friends at your favorite restaurant okay use nothing in.
Interviewer,That scent that would make sense to a chimpanzee what is an airplane what is you know 10.
Tyson,O'clock in the morning what is it restaurant what the food just comes to you what what is that where did.
Interviewer,It come from what oh you have a whole supply chain from farms and then the chip would have no idea and that is the.
Tyson,Simplest sentence you would other in the day yeah okay now imagine a life form and ambien even.
Interviewer,I don't care some life form that is one percent beyond us in DNA then we are beyond the chimp the smartest of us.
Tyson,Would be brought forth by this species and they'll say but the role Stephen Hawking forward and say this one is.
Interviewer,Slightly smarter than all the other humans because he can do astrophysics calculations in his head like little.
Tyson,Timmy over here who just came home from alien preschool Oh Timmy isn't that key you just derive principles of calculus.
Interviewer,Put it on the refrigerator oh their simplest thoughts would be in yeah conceivable yeah to the most brilliant.
Tyson,Human beings at only 1% difference in DNA suppose were 5% 10% 50% a hundred percent so I will not walk forward and.
Interviewer,Say look how smart we are i will not do that I rather wallow in how smart were not.
Tyson,Relative to how smart we could be now we have an advantage because we communicate you can benefit from calculations done.
Interviewer,By engineers and physicists who came before you to drive a car fast you don't have to invent that yourself there are.
Tyson,Books hmm Kindles today and they pass that information forward Isaac Newton.
Interviewer,Invented calculus basically on a dare and he did it before he turned 26 just by the way by the way by the way so.
Tyson,We get to bankroll his his advances and then they think of his rungs on a ladder he built that with that rung right there.
Interviewer,Now i can climb up step on that and put in the next ladder rung on the ladder and then someone after me and someone.
Tyson,After them so our our species collectively may be able to transcend itself transcend the individual so do.
Interviewer,You so if we can let's go let's go down let's go down the alien path here okay it's time so you talked about the 1% and.
Tyson,What if there was another species that was 1% beyond and let's call that another 1% do you believe that the.
Interviewer,There's two parts of this that the human body becomes something different a different form as it evolves into DIF on.
Tyson,Different to the 1% more 1% more 1% more and then the second part of is do you think that we're looking for the wrong.
Interviewer,Damn thing in space we're looking for us but we live in this perfect environment right this ecosystem that is used to.
Tyson,Striving the cosmos like one little thing changes and then something else nothing exists here and it's all about.
Interviewer,The air quality i mean a call of that stuff matters critically to the life on Earth so are we looking for the wrong.
Tyson,Thing alright so our body is pretty irrelevant to our brain when you're just figuring stuff out mm-hmm I mean the.
Interviewer,Best evidence of that is stephen hawking okay yeah these clothes yep yeah I win that argument we got it so so so the.
Tyson,Evolution of the body i don't think is even relevant it's the evolution of the mind that would get you to these new.
Interviewer,Places this extra 1% or 1% beyond that or 1% beyond that you'd be nice if we had eight limbs but we don't be nice if.
Tyson,We could regenerate limbs by the way we're not some model of evolution news can regenerate limbs noose if they if.
Interviewer,They wrote the tree of life look they put themselves at the top say we can reach all those poor humans they lose a.
Tyson,Limb they stuck that for the rest of their lives if we.
Interviewer,Owls we said we can fly in those poor humans those suckers they canvas and there did such crappy visions since they.
Tyson,Need to wear these things on their eyes just a sad thing what 10th as well as we do you don't have sonar out of the box.
Interviewer,Bats or like you know sonar exactly so so the mind is what would have to evolve it now are we looking for the wrong.
Tyson,Thing i don't think so we are made with carbon-based life mmm carbon on the periodic table of elements.
Interviewer,Which you may remember from chemistry class periodic table carbon is the stickiest of all the elements it can.
Tyson,Make more kinds of molecules than all other kinds of atoms combined Wow so if you were to pick one atom off of that.
Interviewer,Table and base the diversity of life on it it would be Cardinal it gives you the most variation the most options the most.
Tyson,Experiments are we looking for carbon another planet well turns out carbon is one of the most abundant elements in the.
Interviewer,Universe where the hell are all the people not only that we've got oxygen in us and nitrogen we are made out of the.
Tyson,Most common ingredients there's a graph I have that I saw that it shows the percentage of what we have of each each.
Interviewer,Thing like my words thing this much percent oxygen this much percent carbon this percent yep phosphorus and that's.
Tyson,The most common ingredients in the universe mm-hmm which is why we Stardust it's know we start us not only that's an.
Interviewer,Aspect of why we're stardust we're Stardust because those elements the heavy elements in particular the carbon.
Tyson,The nitrogen the oxygen the iron are made in the cores of stars that explode scatter that enrichment across the.
Interviewer,Galaxy allowing the next generation of stars to have those elements that can make planets and life so it's not simply.
Tyson,That we are in this universe the universe is in us yes we are not it's not just poetically.
Interviewer,True it is literally true that we are Stardust and so when we look for life in the universe it's not unrealistic to.
Tyson,Look for carbon-based life it's just not it's and plus we have an example of it here so how many of other ways might.
Interviewer,There be to be alive there could be many but if you have a limited budget and can design only one experiment are you gonna.
Tyson,Pluck at random one of these hundred ways that life might be alive that you've never tested before that you'll.
Interviewer,Have any evidence on are we gonna try the one way we know that life does exist so we wish self-aware of that limitation.
Tyson,But it's not a crazy limitation to to operate on it's not so are aliens real probably there's no reason we life.
Interviewer,Started on earth pretty quickly with almost as quickly as the environment allowed we have self-replicating life I.
Tyson,Love about to about a hundred million years I love the in the cosmos how you go to the calendar.
Interviewer,Well the cosmic calendar i think that traces back to the original cosmos with Carl Sagan yeah yeah you know I know you.
Tyson,Know carl sagan you have a good store what's uh how did you tell me the story about Carl Sagan because there's a.
Interviewer,Cosmos - coming out - right yeah yeah we're still looking for a date for that actually technically cosmos three that's.
Tyson,One's three testament new testament cosmos - well get biblical about it fine okay so yeah I was in high school I was.
Interviewer,A geeky kid i knew you know i knew my high school you're an astrophysicist it's okay okay just be frank about it.
Tyson,Okay abb's oh you're very funny my high school counts eight Nobel laureates among its graduates what would you want.
Interviewer,Some of the water which is the same as the country of Spain so jump to saying so this is a.
Tyson,This is a fertile environment all right it's not because the teachers necessarily it's because realize how.
Interviewer,Much how much down time you spend doing nothing between classes you know chasing a love interest or you know throwing.
Tyson,High school now hormones are raging your you know what else your study hall but you're not really studying it's.
Interviewer,Lunchtime you're talking about at that school we're talking about who might have an equation named after them in the.
Tyson,Downtime that's uh that's obviously that doesn't make any sense that's just like not even in the spectrum of thought it's.
Interviewer,Great it's great officially all of humanity it's crazy and not only that is how old I am I was uh the youngest.
Tyson,Person who was formally trained in a slide rule in us what is it slide rule so this is this thing that helps you.
Interviewer,Calculate before calculators oh god before calculators there was this device somebody there before calculus yes there.
Tyson,Was a beast bc before calculators no ecc so there's a device that has the sliding sliders in it and and they're it's.
Interviewer,Highly the numbers all throughout this isn't an abacus isn't no no no it's way better than a NAPA hey Cathy but not as.
Tyson,Good as a calculator and so you slide these AC I want to multiply 387 by 28 and you'd slide these things and you you.
Interviewer,Can get the answer okay it's called a sliding one the bigger the slide rule the more nuance your numbers can be.
Tyson,Because you can then read between the tick marks okay so in my high school Wow you walk down the car door you know if.
Interviewer,You had the biggest slide rule you a badass okay because you put have it in a holster can't carry anything else I came.
Tyson,In leather holsters i attach it to your belt oh my god you're not Brad to be the coolest gig.
Interviewer,Ever wait a minute so so I'm in high school and I apply to colleges and so I'm.
Tyson,Admitted to this set of colleges which includes Cornell and I've known since I was nine through eleven that I'd like.
Interviewer,That the universe in fact the universe was calling me I had nothing to do with it now high side note I had no choice.
Tyson,Thank you so i'm there and i get a letter in the mail from Carl Sagan he was already famous he had been on The.
Interviewer,Tonight show he didn't get done cosmos but he was already famous mm-hmm and I got a letter from Crossout he didn't.
Tyson,Know i don't know this man what is this what it's cool I'll write some paper a theory.
Interviewer,Lotso lotso lotso i did write a paper and published in the journal my senior and ice of the Bronx High School of.
Tyson,Science I was energy of a physical sideshow but that's not relevant to this there's just.
Interviewer,More geeky stuff that one does in high school okay oh by the way just so you know in that high school is is it's.
Tyson,Actually a regular high school just shifted towards the geek end of the spectrum sounds really regular so we had.
Interviewer,We had jocks but they were geek jocks that we had geeky people but they were really really geeky people so and we had.
Tyson,Bullies but they would geek bullies you know where'd you fall in I was geek jock good job yeah what'd you.
Interviewer,Play i wrestled i was undefeated i'm captain of the team dang well that's that high school got to college not so.
Tyson,Much get to college wrestle these boys from Nebraska oh yeah okay we've got another situation so I.
Interviewer,Say call that farm strong farm strong very good very good so I knew when when I was not in the right what they're.
Tyson,Asking in calm but no i still wrestle because I didn't care that I want I just enjoy the sport and I joined knowing.
Interviewer,That if you lost it's because they were better than you and you can know what to do you can't blame it on anybody is what.
Tyson,It is you okay so why did i take that hold diverse oh so I'm there in high school I get the ladder from Carl site.
Interviewer,Opened up it says dear neil the admissions office showed me your application to college and knowing that.
Tyson,They admitted you i want to help you decide whether you want to come to Cornell would you like to come visit my.
Interviewer,Labs when you said you'd come to the interview with me I'm like so I'd love I did double-check Mike he's known his way.
Tyson,Right so i i'd like doing people's podcasts in their early days I love doing it okay just to just to help earth.
Interviewer,More places where people can learn and hear intelligent conversation held by curious talented people so I just like.
Tyson,Helping to birth people's podcasts so i Carl took you on as a young that's what us so here's what oh by the.
Interviewer,Way i only now learned that you came to one of my public talks and so just so you know it's authentic that this.
Tyson,Interest is real it's not just okay well she was a fan I guess I guess I'd better know it was pure just want you to know.
Interviewer,Okay so i so i wrote him back as he yeah but yeah so I visited him he met me outside there was a weekend and it was a.
Tyson,Look like who's gonna snow this is ethic in New York or it snows all the time most think 11 months of the year 11 11.
Interviewer,And a half months of the year snowing and cloudy so I'm very taking up to the to my app shows me the lab shows in the.
Tyson,Department i'm in his office and this was the coolest thing oh my gosh he doesn't even look.
Interviewer,Back he's behind his desk and he reaches behind him and pulls out a book and as.
Tyson,One of the books he wrote i said that's badass I'm sorry that's just badass you know.
Interviewer,You have to look and a book you pick out is and he signed it to me says dear near-future astronomer I still have that.
Tyson,Book and at the end he's taking me back to the bus station it actually began to snow and he says look if the bus doesn't.
Interviewer,Come through here's my home phone you come spend the night with my family and leave in the morning could the bus no.
Tyson,Said that the bus didn't come first people told me but no I was more honest than that then my lesson from that was.
Interviewer,That because i said to myself if i'm ever as remotely famous as Carl Sagan I will treat students the way he has.
Tyson,Treated me and i could be on the phone you know Barack okay I got to call you back I got a student you know at the.
Interviewer,Door and and eventually i'd written enough books so that and so when I'm in the presence of students it's a sense of.
Tyson,Duty and obligation i don't like that word cuz it sounds like it's a chore but it's a sense of duty is a better word.
Interviewer,Where the torch of science has to be carried forward lest it become extinguished and we live in the darkness.
Tyson,So then i know i've taken a lot of your time and I think this is a good lead-in to like the final thought final kind of.
Interviewer,Question although i have more like never mind but that's for part two but what is the point of all this.
Tyson,You know what is the point you say you're you you want to give back to students and that's important to you.
Interviewer,What is the point of life are you really asking what is the meaning of life or is your question what difference to you.
Tyson,What are we here to do yeah you feel called to help people you feel oh no I can't I feel called to to discover the.
Interviewer,Universe but in there if someone wants to also do that yeah I feel compelled but if no one else wanted to do it I.
Tyson,Don't i'm not gonna force anyone to like the universe no but if you like it or if because I said something you do want to.
Interviewer,Do science yeah i feel some duty i feel some some sense of accountability for someone's interests if they saw cosmos.
Tyson,And then they want to assign things i so I feel some responsibility there well then maybe the first question is how do.
Interviewer,We how do we take science and how do we make sure that that stays relevant relevant and expanding so what we need.
Tyson,Is a reality show where you get someone who's in denial of science then overnight you take everything out of.
Interviewer,Their life it's a space program and thermal physics and electric electrical engineering and so there it is you I.
Tyson,Think earth is flat okay so you don't get to fly in an airplane because you might fly off the edge of the earth okay.
Interviewer,So you will travel nowhere don't get me started so I think we need a reality show where we take science away from.
Tyson,Science deniers and what you do is you have to put a limit to that because there's a level at which you can take.
Interviewer,Away science would they would just be dead they would have died in childbirth they would have died of some curable.
Tyson,Disease so you say i'm gonna be nice to you and not take away so much science that you'd be six feet under right now.
Interviewer,So i don't i just made that up on the spot mm-hmm but yeah it's a problem what you need is.
Tyson,People who are in charge because in a free country it's your right should not be.
Interviewer,Scientifically literate at all just don't control anything that can affect the health wealth and security of other.
Tyson,People because innovations in science technology engineering and math will be the roots of the future of our health.
Interviewer,Wealth and security if you don't know that you might as well just move back to the cave because that's where we're.
Tyson,Gonna be anyway now why are we alive why we here what's the point here's some motivation for you.
Interviewer,Okay got my pen back huh all right the human genome can combine in trillions of ways to make a human what that means is.
Tyson,Well so now put a pin in that how many humans have ever been born latest estimates it's about 80 billion.
Interviewer,Trillions is a way bigger number than 80 billion mm-hmm okay taking a cue from a passage in a book.
Tyson,Written by richard dawkins the biologist evolutionary biologist one day we're all gonna die.
Interviewer,In this sad when someone dies however not enough of us spend time celebrating the fact that we were alive at all we as.
Tyson,Individuals are collectively at all individually you are lucky that you get to die because ktml active most humans.
Interviewer,Who could ever exist never will there's been more i think i've heard you say it there's been more humans that.
Tyson,Have not come into existence than do exist by far and so the fact that you existed.
Interviewer,All is against stupefying odds of who gets born and who does not realizing this you are you I am me we are alive we.
Tyson,Get to die and to get to die means you get to live any moment you spend squandering those moments you are alive.
Interviewer,Does disrespect to all those who will never even be born so every day I wake up I've got I want to make the world a.
Tyson,Better place today for my having been in this world than it was yesterday I want to learn something new which empowers me.
Interviewer,To make decisions that are more nuanced deeper more informed than I could have made yesterday and I want to celebrate.
Tyson,Being alive even if you are sick even if you are terminal you still got to live when trillions of people will never even.
Interviewer,Be born so live every one of those moments tell me now what would be your greatest.
Tyson,Celebration of being alive tell me what your celebration would look like what's your best day like give me like.
Interviewer,Fireworks of like no no here i'm alive here it is you ready me that assumes it's what that's captured in one moment.
Tyson,Yeah but if that no but it's the sum of it all the sum of it all so here's gonna be my happiest moment and I won't even.
Interviewer,Be alive to see it but they chisel my tombstone my sister has written in her notes what.
Tyson,I wanna let you my tombstone and it's a quote from the great educator Horace Mann and it is be ashamed to die until.
Interviewer,You have scored some victory for you you very inspirational now now the universe is inspirational I'm just.
Tyson,Channeling that fact well it's been something that's been always intriguing to me and overwhelmingly amazing I'm.
Interviewer,Honored and flattered that you came to one of my talks thank you oh and I mean the cosmos was like a mind.
Tyson,Expansion education on where we came from the simplicity down to the subatomic level all the way there and I.
Interviewer,Loved it and i can't wait for cosmos three thank you like to meet you thank you so much that's not gonna save our.
Tyson,Life those swinging to say that again now be ready for it there you go okay thanks thanks Neil.
Interviewer,Thanks everybody for listening to the pretty intense podcast today I hope you enjoyed it and also thank you so much.
Tyson,"If you only think of Cosmos as a science documentary, then the natural obvious question would be, Well, it's been 35 years. What has changed? However, Cosmos wasn't only that, and it wasn't even mostly that. Cosmos is mostly Why does science matter to you? Why should you care about science? Why should society care about what scientists say? How can you empower your own destiny by becoming scientifically literate?"
Interviewer,"What is our effect on the environment? Will we be good shepherds of this Earth as we go forward? Do we know enough to be good shepherds of this Earth? Do we understand the risk of asteroids that could render us extinct? These are broad questions, and Cosmos takes some element of science and shows you why it is way more relevant to your life than you ever previously imagined."
Tyson,"Well, there's always creative tension, and that's never a bad thing if people who are participants in the creative tension are intelligent and rational. Intelligent, rational people can disagree and figure out why they disagree, and maybe you go with one person's view or another person's view. Or, the di to a third view that one or the other didn't have, and the third is better than both. So, all three of those scenarios would happen."
Interviewer,What was the most difficult part of making the reboot?
Tyson,I have an unromantic answer for you there
Interviewer,"You make such a great tribute to Carl Sagan at the end of the first episode, when you talk about your first meeting with him during high school. How has this project been important for you personally?"
Tyson,I have a personal philosophy in life
Interviewer,Did you meet Sagan any other time?
Tyson,"I'd say we only met like four times. The first time was very significant to me, as is obvious from that retelling. The last time is also significant. It was his 60th birthday bash. He would die two years later. It was a celebration, it was a dinner and there were all these testimonials. And you would sit there and listen to all these testimonials, and you would say, My gosh, nobody could be that amazing. You know, old people, young people, middle-age people, colleagues, janitors were coming up, singing the praises of Carl Sagan. And then, after that, he gave a public talk, and it was the best public talk on any subject I had ever heard in my entire life. Not the best, the greatest. And I said, Yep, he deserves every one of those accolades. Every one of them."
Interviewer,Where were you in your career then?
Tyson,"I was well established. I knew when I first met him that I wanted to study the universe. I was not one of the people who was turned on to the universe by him. His influence on me was recognizing that there is an appetite for a scientist who would sit down on the couch next to you and talk about the universe. That's what he did when you saw him on television. He's sitting right next to you. Not as a professor, he was a guy just trying to get you comfortable with the cosmos. The fact that that was possible, the fact that a scientist had talent to do that, the fact that people responded so warmly to it, told me that if I'm ever in the position to bring the universe down to Earth, that's a good place to start."
Interviewer,"I wanted to bring up Bill Nye, I hear you guys are friends."
Tyson,"Yeah; in fact, I count him as my best friend. In modern times, he's my best friend. We text and email three or four times a week about one topic or another. We are sort of compatriots in this business, so we're always comparing notes and seeing how we could improve; we offer critiques, that sort of thing. There's professional value to the friendship that manifests."
Interviewer,"What are your thoughts on the debate on evolution Nye recently had with creationist Ken Ham? Nye said he was doing it to raise awareness about science education in this country, and it seems like Cosmos might have similar aims."
Tyson,"There are different ways to do that. One of them is to legislate laws that will improve science teaching and the like. But think about all the ways your citizenry can be influenced. We all go to movies. We all watch television. And some movies are better than others, and some TV shows are better than others. What makes them better? Some are better filmed. Some are better written. Some are more compelling. Different people learn differently and react differently."
Interviewer,"Speaking of science and religion, I thought it was interesting that Giordano Bruno's story was incorporated into the very first episode.  Can you tell me about that decision?"
Tyson,"There are many science martyrs, if you will, whose stories are undertold. And there's the normal cast of characters, Einstein, Galileo, Newton, and we just figured, we've heard those stories before; let's go deeper. And Ann Druyan and Steve Soter are both avid historians, not in an academic sense, but they're very well read in terms of who did what in the past. It's through their collaboration that they came up with this list of people whose stories we'd tell. And Bruno is just one of half a dozen profiles that are featured throughout the series that tell you about the scientific result arrived at by a researcher and what comes when those results encountered the social, political, cultural and religious mores of the day.."
Interviewer,What was it like working with Seth MacFarlane?
Tyson,"He was primarily our broker, not a literal broker, but a figurative broker, who brought Cosmos to Fox, because he's a Fox entity, of course. And why would either we or Fox think that we are a good match for each other? We would not be Fox's first thought; Fox was not our first thought. It was Seth who put the two together, recognizing that Fox needed something like Cosmos and that it could put resources to bear on it."
Interviewer,All right don't want to inflate him so everything we see in the universe the Stars the planets the galaxies the.
Tyson,Plants the rocks the plows us everything you say it's me or the front of this book is there's what you call the.
Interviewer,Product of a remarkable asymmetry of matter over antimatter what did you mean by that.
Tyson,Oh can i just say something about your introduction if I may you man so I I'm impressed by your persistent skepticism.
Interviewer,Of all things i say reporters have to you you can never really believe you have to check and verify hmm okay you.
Tyson,Just get you you're right every time though so far I mean how can I possibly just come up with that unless it was.
Interviewer,Correct what that a building ticks offs by the second you're ridiculous but when they built the building did you.
Tyson,Think well i have a wonderful idea what I saw half a foot Charles maybe we'll get those second on the celestial clock.
Interviewer,Okay I don't think so yeah no I'm sure it was not on purpose it just is as so much of.
Tyson,The universe is so profound asymmetry so you just went right into the stuff yeah well okay just a quick note yeah that.
Interviewer,This title astrophysics for people in a hurry I've had people joke with me about it.
Tyson,Say oh was astrophysics for dummies' already taken you know and I just wanted to make it clear that first yes it was.
Interviewer,Taken but but there's nothing i don't think there's anything quote dumbed down about the astrophysics in this book it's.
Tyson,All sort of curated legitimate full up astrophysics in an attempt to sort of grant the reader a degree of fluency in.
Interviewer,Modern astrophysics so like the next morning at the water cooler you could just be talking about yeah.
Tyson,Like there are things in here that i had never heard of really and you get around I get around yeah you get around so I'm.
Interviewer,Gonna be checked but so in the in the early universe the temperature was very hot and above certain thresholds of.
Tyson,Temperature what happens as matter no longer stays as matter they can freely move back and forth between itself and.
Interviewer,Energy and we have the recipe for this it comes from e equals mc-squared we all know that equation it's the.
Tyson,Formal conversion recipe for matter and energy and this C squared is the speed of light squared is a huge number a.
Interviewer,Little bit of mass times that huge number gives you a lot of energy we don't experience in our lives equals MC.
Tyson,Squared because the energy in which we're immersed is not high enough to enable matter to go back and forth.
Interviewer,Between energy and itself that's why it took so long to discover equals MC squared and to come to terms and to come.
Tyson,To understand it but it is a profound equation that manifests from the beginning of time all the way.
Interviewer,To the future of the universe but not in our life experience alright so and also let me preface it by saying in one of.
Tyson,The opening pages of the book is what you call it the uber know the what's the beginning the publishers have a word for.
Interviewer,The page that has a thing on it yeah well it says that's the dedication for all those who has the dedication or you.
Tyson,Want to read it ok i mean for all those who are too busy to read fat books and yet nonetheless seek a conduit to the.
Interviewer,Cosmos yeah that's not what i was looking for them to pages beyond two pages beyond yeah contents yeah preface.
Tyson,Preface okay oh yes the universe is under no obligation to make sense to you yeah that's it signed by you make that.
Interviewer,Clear so the universe is under no obligation to make sense to any of us so I will be.
Tyson,Saying things and you'll say that doesn't make sense just remember what I just said okay okay what we've learned.
Interviewer,Is that the universe is what we measure it to be not what we want it to be not what feels good not what only has to.
Tyson,Make sense to our five senses our five biological senses forged in the plains of Africa you know a million years ago.
Interviewer,Half a million years ago i would whatever what's the latest the biologists tell us is those senses to.
Tyson,Prevent us from getting eaten by a lion are very different from what you need to grasp the universe and so this is why.
Interviewer,Mathematics is so potent because it takes us out of our senses and enables us to still probe the reality of what.
Tyson,The universe is so here's what goes on if matter and energy can go back and forth this is how that works I have a.
Interviewer,Blob of energy and it decides that it wants to become matter and it does so all this energy becomes matter but I.
Tyson,Mean it decides it goes and then it thinks what should I like to be today it happens.
Interviewer,Spontaneously and it depends on what the temperature is oh cool cool what's it it's hot many kids you know.
Tyson,Yeah so if the temperature drops too low then it's not gonna happen the energy will stay energy and whatever matter was.
Interviewer,Around at that time we'll stay matter so watch what happens we now have high enough energy that if.
Tyson,You convert it up this pocket of energy into mass equals MC squared you get enough mass to create particles out of.
Interviewer,It okay mm-hmm so get a very low take of an electron for example that's very low mass among atomic subatomic particles so.
Tyson,You can ask how much energy does it take to make an electron write that number down if you don't have that much energy.
Interviewer,Around you your energy will never become a particle hmm ever okay so in the early universe there was so much energy every.
Tyson,Particle could be made so watch what happens you have a pocket of energy it becomes mass and the only way we know.
Interviewer,That can happen is if if it becomes a particle and an antiparticle pair matter and antimatter antimatter is the.
Tyson,Opposite of the first thing yes in every measurable way okay so the opposite of an electron is a positron it looks just.
Interviewer,Like an electron but among other things it has the opposite charge of an electron positron okay every particle.
Tyson,Has an anti particle does a neutron have an anti neutral yes there's a proton I've an antiproton yes and so you might.
Interviewer,Say well what's the opposite charge of a neutron the neutron has no charge no but you look at what the neutron is made of.
Tyson,It's made of quarks that have fractional charges that cancel each other to get zero net charge on the neutron so an.
Interviewer,Anti neutron has all those same quarks but the antimatter version of those on the inside what will happen if these.
Tyson,Two kiss if you take matter and antimatter and put them together they annihilate and become pure energy and.
Interviewer,The matter disappears entirely what i mean disappeared some thing over oh no not even I'll go little not a light a.
Tyson,Photon some yes yes so you take the particles matter antimatter identical Porto's other than except that their.
Interviewer,Matter antennae bring them together they disappear and that matter becomes energy and all that's left is energy right in.
Tyson,That pocket right there that happens all the time in the center of the Sun it happened everywhere in the early.
Interviewer,Universe now here's the run you have all these photons of light oh by the way I have a photon joke can I tell it tell.
Tyson,The foots ok photon checks into a hotel not a bar it can't be racy because a fan this is a family I got this ok I got I.
Interviewer,Got this folks hunt checks into a hotel the bellhop hat comes up and says do you.
Tyson,Have any luggage and the photo says no I'm traveling light and if the bellhop were here tonight.
Interviewer,He's left a big fat lab so when i say pocket of energy let's just simply refer to photons because they carry energy all.
Tyson,Right so a photon turns into matter it's a matter of antimatter pair matter antimatter come together they make a.
Interviewer,Photon it's symmetric okay okay so basic that mean that if every matter part met every antimatter part they all would be.
Tyson,Left with just light yes there would be no matter in the universe only light oh okay so now as in let there be light.
Interviewer,Yes except there's nothing else after that it's a sort of a very short store let there be light and we're done yeah.
Tyson,Start over yeah yeah yeah yeah that would be a very short Genesis right there so so you have all this energy in.
Interviewer,The form of photons becoming matter and back and forth and there it goes as the temperature of the universe dropped you.
Tyson,Reach a point where you can no longer make particles with the energy you have but you have all these matter and.
Interviewer,Antimatter particle pairs that eventually find one another and annihilate and make a photon but we're.
Tyson,Still cooling the universe so according to our known laws of physics in the cooling universe every matter and.
Interviewer,Antimatter particle pair would have annihilated made a photon the photon would have cooled and no more matter.
Tyson,Would have been made and we would have had an entire universe of just light but it is not the universe we occupy.
Interviewer,We should start it like a band you know no I'm saying if we apparently are the exception yes yes so mysteriously we.
Tyson,Call it symmetry breaking just because we don't that's what if what happened we're just describing what happened not.
Interviewer,That we fully understand why it happened one out of basically a million of these reactions one out of a million the.
Tyson,Photon did not make a matter/antimatter pair it just made a matter particle it was very you're trying to find out why.
Interviewer,Yeah and i'm just saying it is that okay so one out of about a million makes a matter particle without the antimatter.
Tyson,Counterpart so now the dance card the dance hall has nine hundred and ninety nine thousand partners that can pair out.
Interviewer,Of nine hundred and ninety nine nine thousand yes well not thousand nine hundred ninety-nine yeah it is one left.
Tyson,Over so everybody else becomes light and that one has no antimatter particle to mate with.
Interviewer,And it is frozen out of the universe and has become all the matter that we know and see today so everything that we are.
Tyson,Is a profound asymmetry on the early universe we're the stuff that didn't get a date correct.
Interviewer,Doesn't that strike you as an extremely fragile interpretation of all that there is I mean it's like being around by the.
Tyson,Skinny skinny skin of your chinny Chinchin whatever that thing is except in the concept of multiverse we would.
Interviewer,Have many many universes all the laws of physics don't have to be the same in each universe so there could be plenty.
Tyson,Of universes wherever the dance card was full and they just have light in them and you are not in that universe saying.
Interviewer,That it was just a chance occurrence oh well you are in the universe we're not the other ones I'm just.
Tyson,Interested that our universe the one that we know and live in is such a fragile arrangement no it's not.
Interviewer,Well it doesn't have to be it may be but it doesn't have to be and it is unlikely to be and can I give an obscure example.
Tyson,That will settle this yeah okay okay line up a thousand people and give them a coin and everybody's had flip the coin.
Interviewer,And about half will get tails half will get it if you got tails sit down those 500 left approximately mm-hmm have them.
Tyson,Flip half get heads have it 250 of you sit down never left or to it do it again go from 250 to 125 to 60 to 30 15 to 8.
Interviewer,To 4 to 2 to 1 okay in this experiments not a it's not a unthinkable experiment mm-hmm this person who survived this.
Tyson,Exercise flipped heads 10 consecutive times now here is what journalists do they go.
Interviewer,Up to that person and they say how do you feel well I knew I had felt that heads energy halfway through and I and I.
Tyson,Was feeling it can i did they ask anyone else if they felt well that heads energy no they only interviewed that guy.
Interviewer,Wait so that person says boy i was lucky to flip heads ten consecutive times well every time essentially every time you do.
Tyson,This experiment somebody's going to flip heads ten consecutive times so you want to say oh this is a special universe in.
Interviewer,Which that happened no no because of the the nature of the the fact that you have a thousand experiments happening all the.
Tyson,Time there's gonna be one where somebody flips head heads ten consecutive times every time you do this experiment that.
Interviewer,Does not make it special just because somebody flips heads take ten consecutive times every time you do the.
Tyson,Experiment so your inner universe where this weird thing happens at the beginning and you want to feel all feel.
Interviewer,All heads energy about it and i'm saying in a multiverse that could be 999 universes where that did not happen and.
Tyson,You're in the one that did and you want special credit for it I'm not giving it to you let me move on to another thought.
Interviewer,In this second sort of section of this book I I this is something I hadn't really occurred to me I mean once I know.
Tyson,It doesn't i just meant the next thing i noticed that understand the book yeah is that.
Interviewer,Allowed oh if you didn't know it you all get like a free book tonight did you know.
Tyson,This okay everybody excuse me just to be clear I signed every one of your books okay and those.
Interviewer,Are the the books that are part of that series if you look on that page that are signed there six or seven cities there.
Tyson,Are gonna be each in each one of those cities giving one talk and all those books are signed and I'm not signing any.
Interviewer,Other books but those so so limited edition yeah basically that's right if you open your book and your name your.
Tyson,Signature his signature is not in there and you're the only one you can go off and start speaking of universes there.
Interviewer,There was a time when people believed that the heavens up there were the province of God and whatever was going.
Tyson,On in there was unknowable and it would be basically sinful to find out you point out that that with gravity well.
Interviewer,But just briefly newton comes along and then everything changes yeah yes so you look up and the planets are going.
Tyson,Forward against the background stars and then backwards and what we call it there's a word for that retrograde and.
Interviewer,They do a loop-the-loop and nobody understands it and the fact that no one understands it is presented as evidence.
Tyson,In some bits of scholarship as evidence for the divinity of the heavens because that is the handiwork of God and we are.
Interviewer,Mortal and god is immortal and omniscient and so we can't possibly know the mind of God so he just content just.
Tyson,In your ignorance watching planet there was some attempts at this with the geocentric epicycles and all this but.
Interviewer,This was a it was well accepted that you'll never understand Newton comes along writes down equations of motion.
Tyson,Equations of gravity and kind of on a dare he invents in Grillin differential calculus then he.
Interviewer,Turned 26 this is why isaac newton is my man just to make that clear okay among many reasons but so he writes down.
Tyson,These equations and he can now demonstrate full knowledge of how why and where and what the planets are doing.
Interviewer,And so potent was his new theory of gravity that it worked for moons of Jupiter orbiting Jupiter not just.
Tyson,Planets orbiting the sun and this was the first indication maybe this is not just a local truth that maybe it applies.
Interviewer,Across the universe and this was a little bit of heresy thought by some that in fact Newton was accused by some.
Tyson,Say isaac you've left nothing for god to do and that's simultaneously a dig at him but also quite a compliment that he.
Interviewer,Can actually understand the mind of god well that's this is where it got interesting then you went off I mean.
Tyson,Everybody knows that gravity is apparently is ubiquitous and universal but then you wouldn't ask about.
Interviewer,Chemistry and physics constants and and we thought about that before is is the chemistry of the Sun and the chemistry.
Tyson,Of the earth and the chemistry of the farthest thing you can think of are the laws about bonds and pairings and so.
Interviewer,They are the same everywhere without exception it was not obvious there's not there's no tablet in the sky that.
Tyson,Required that the laws of physics we discover on Earth's surface would apply elsewhere if they were different on.
Interviewer,Earth than on the moon and on a sun and I suppose we could deal with that but what a remarkable fact that it is the.
Tyson,Same oh wait a second like you've seen that thing on on Jupiter that storm that never quits the big red thing the big.
Interviewer,Yeah we call it the red spot on jupiter we call it Jupiter's red spot okay because that's how we roll that thing.
Tyson,Spots on the sun sunspots sink feet see how any geologists or chemists in the audience geologists but but can she be.
Interviewer,Jealous of this fact because you guys name stuff that nobody knows what the hell you're talking about.
Tyson,Okay you know it's suspicious to you that a storm there could go on for 350 years without a break and we never have.
Interviewer,Storms that go on for 350 years without a break we don't even have storms that go on for like six weeks without a break.
Tyson,So first of all these storms are when we have storms it's in our atmosphere mm-hmm so it's gas yeah we rotate once a.
Interviewer,Day and so that rotation creates a what we call a Coriolis force which moving air air that moves from one latitude to.
Tyson,Another actually has its direction deflected because of this Coriolis force and this is why storms rotate in one.
Interviewer,Direction counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere just a quick aside I.
Tyson,I was channel surfing one day waiting for a movie to come on at the top of the hour I had 15 minutes I hit a football.
Interviewer,Game and they just ended the game at a tie and they just started overtime I said it's about right let me just watch.
Tyson,This how bad could it be after the necessary exchange of possession it became sudden-death.
Interviewer,Overtime and then one of the teams Cincinnati Bengals got within 50 yards and they kicked the field goal and the.
Tyson,Ball rotated up it hit the left upright of the goalpost and went in and I said wait a minute and I said which stadium.
Interviewer,Is this what's the latitude and i looked at the orientation of the stadium I did a calculation and then I tweeted and I.
Tyson,Said the the the overtime winning field goal by the Cincinnati Bengals was likely.
Interviewer,Aided by a 1/3 of an inch deflection to the right imparted by Earth's rotation which has lost in my people home at the.
Tyson,Local sports channels and and and so the point is if if if you were going north south at all in the northern hemisphere.
Interviewer,You will deflect to the right no matter what you're doing ok that's that's why you have a.
Tyson,Low-pressure system and i'm a bowl of gas below it if it's low pressure there and I'm air I'm gonna head for the low.
Interviewer,Pressure that's how this works it's low pressure that means it's higher pressure out here so all the pressure is gonna.
Tyson,Send me in that direction but i'm crossing lines of latitude and so Earth's rotation will deflect me to the.
Interviewer,Right how about here that's above it it says I see a low pressure system let me go to.
Tyson,It so it goes to it and it deflects to the right so all this hair deflects to the right but it's still trying to get.
Interviewer,To the center of the low-pressure system but it can't because it keeps that getting deflected and all this.
Tyson,Deflection becomes this cyclonic energy that turns into a storm and that is how you get hurricanes tornadoes it's what.
Interviewer,He called it cyclones say ok ok so we're back at Jupiter yes we are so this happens into.
Tyson,The gas yeah all right the Coriolis force is heightened if you spin faster ok and so what is Jupiter.
Interviewer,It's a hundred times bigger than earth more than that ten thousand times bigger than Earth.
Tyson,It's like 10 it's ten times across cubed so it's a thousand times bigger than Earth it's mostly gas and it rotates.
Interviewer,Once in about ten hours you want to talk about ferocious Coriolis forces we have storms that last weeks here hurricanes.
Tyson,That pick up and they get weeks on this little speck we call earth that has this much atmosphere on it go to a planet.
Interviewer,That rotates twice as fast is ten times as wide a thousand times the volume and is mostly gas and you're complaining.
Tyson,That it lasted 300 years you are really good I'll grant you that the speed of light is universal obviously angular.
Interviewer,Momentum conservation is sure what about well this chapters just to be clear he's coming from a chapter called on earth as.
Tyson,It is in the heavens why you said can you spontaneously levitate and hover above the ground in a lotus position.
Interviewer,Like like michael keaton in birdman in the Vino at the beginning of Birdman he says that with his underpants forget the.
Tyson,Underpants just the levitation this that's your first thought when you think of someone in a lotus position Michael.
Interviewer,Keaton in that movie yes okay yeah yeah so so it's just there's certain things you just can't do because they're.
Tyson,Prevented by all known laws of physics you cannot spontaneously set yourself into motion unless you push off of.
Interviewer,Something else or you lose some kind of mass that was within you so rockets when they take off their dejected mass out.
Tyson,The other side okay wow so do you saw Birdman did you just leap up from your seats it can't do that can't do that no.
Interviewer,There are movies where i'm prepared to suspend my disbelief yes like just before as an example I was asked about.
Tyson,The movie guardians of the galaxy and they asked me well the ships that are going through space they they make.
Interviewer,Noise and clearly you would does that upset you because in space where there is no air no one can hear you scream but.
Tyson,No one can hear you explode either nor will you hear engines or anything and so they said does that upset you and I said.
Interviewer,I bought into the idea that this movie has a talking raccoon that shoots artillery from heavy.
Tyson,Weaponry off its shoulder if i can accept that I'm good with whatever else they deliver in the film so I have the.
Interviewer,Capacity to accept movie magic what would happen if someone served you a hot cocoa with whipped cream and you see no.
Tyson,Whipped cream in evidence oh don't get me started okay oh wait wait let me finish about.
Interviewer,Let me hating right so all the Levinson's all the people are levitating the it's some kind of an illusion that.
Tyson,They're not telling you about okay period here you okay now then but if you really want to levitate if this is.
Interviewer,Really important to you i i tried to calculate how many cans of beans this would require then you got to kind.
Tyson,Of hold it in right then let loose suddenly suddenly and in principle for the duration of the thrust you can.
Interviewer,Levitate briefly but this would argue against the lotus position because there would be an opening so suddenly that.
Tyson,There'd be too much too soon too fast and therefore no rise oh yeah you wouldn't like you wouldn't well you.
Interviewer,Could stay there if it just kept yeah some of that right so it's not impossible to hold a lotus position.
Tyson,It's just unlikely you're doing it for these other ways that are described I said yes the Coco oh yeah so I had there.
Interviewer,Was there was an incident in pasadena California I was there I don't drink much coffee I don't have a relationship.
Tyson,With caffeine but every now and then I'll be delighted to have a nice cup of hot cocoa and I went to one of these.
Interviewer,Coffee houses you know with the chalkboard out front and so I had you know the kind I'm talking about.
Tyson,All over brooklyn you trip on the chalkboards in Brooklyn so so I'm in the I order hot chocolate and I order it.
Interviewer,With whipped cream of course right and it comes to the table and there's no whipped cream and I said I wanted this.
Tyson,With whipped cream and they said oh we put it on and I said well where is it oh he said it sunk to the bottom.
Interviewer,I then said  either the laws of physics that apply.
Tyson,Everywhere in the universe are suspended in your coffee shop or you didn't put whipped cream on my hot cocoa and he.
Interviewer,Looked indignant really now to his credit rather than continue to argue with me he intended to prove me wrong.
Tyson,Well he went into the kitchen brought out the the whipped cream scooped it up popped it in my and my hot cocoa and it.
Interviewer,Bombed once and floated atop and there was cream past the float because first of all before was whipped cream it was.
Tyson,Cream okay and old-timers remember what is cream do in under homogenized milk it floats to the top and you skim off the.
Interviewer,Cream leaving behind skim milk okay now you take the heavy cream and then whip it putting air into it it is not gonna.
Tyson,Sink on any no liquid devised by man all right so so here's my point the lesson there is yes I'm I'm a fan of the.
Interviewer,Edict if an argument last more than five minutes then both sides are wrong if that applies maybe 85 percent of the.
Tyson,Time it's a good it's a good rule it's a good tenant to give to carry with you now watch this how science works one.
Interviewer,Researcher comes up with a result and that is not the truth no no a scientific emergent truth is not.
Tyson,The result of any one experiment what has to happen is somebody else has to verify it preferably a competitor.
Interviewer,Preferably someone who doesn't want you to be correct such as my waiter he went out to prove me wrong and got.
Tyson,The same result that i had declared we can call that the beginnings of an emergent truth about whipped cream now.
Interviewer,We need someone to do it in asia and in Europe and and and and then you get a trend and you can then declare that a.
Tyson,Consensus of observation and experiments has emerged in the scientific community whipped cream floats on hot chocolate.
Interviewer,And that waiter today is getting a phd let me go on to to a question that came up later in the book just how void is.
Tyson,The void of space like so it looks pretty empty out there between galaxies just a lot of black you know it seems.
Interviewer,Anyway if you step into intergalactic space by the way what might happen to you shoes die yep but you might see.
Tyson,Stuff and this is the list well i don't I had never heard anything Worf galaxies run away stars faint blue galaxies hot.
Interviewer,Clouds let me just test about some of them what is a dwarf galaxy it's a little galaxy well that I figured didn't.
Tyson,We go through this already our words mean what they say haven't but I pass that all right wait what there are.
Interviewer,Galaxies that you see the ones the Magellan sauce smudges in the sky those are huge things.
Tyson,No well wharf galaxies oh yeah oh yeah they're like a hundred the size of our galaxy so how many dwarf they far.
Interviewer,Outnumber big galaxies they do yeah so maybe we shouldn't be calling them dwarfs because they're the common size.
Tyson,Galaxies we should just be called giants perhaps I asked and they call them regular the where the right that's how.
Interviewer,That works right what is the difference how many stars are in a galaxy galaxy our galaxy has several hundred billion.
Tyson,Stars and in a dwarf galaxy um at most a billion but more typically hundreds of millions these are small numbers.
Interviewer,Compared to full up red-blooded galaxies so tiny or dwarf galaxies and we tend to find them in the vicinity of big.
Tyson,Galaxies but you know what happens you know they orbit the big galaxies but the orbits are not stable and they do a.
Interviewer,Death spiral in they get eaten by the larger galaxies and we have a term for that.
Tyson,It's called galactic cannibalism in fact there are stars there's streams of stars that we see in our own galaxy that have.
Interviewer,The same trajectory as one another through the stellar system that is the Milky Way so they they're roulette and.
Tyson,You follow it and it comes back out and back in again and so this is evidence that this was once a fleshie but dwarfee.
Interviewer,Galaxies that we ate ripped apart and now the stars are just trying to have that sum the last bastions of a memory.
Tyson,Of what they once were because they're getting stretched apart by that what we call the tidal forces of our galaxy is.
Interviewer,All right does the milky way have dwarfs yes I mean has the book so the first science essay I ever wrote was called.
Tyson,The galaxies and the seven dwarfs because at the time the Milky Way had seven dwarf galaxies in horbet around it.
Interviewer,And then but dwarf galaxies are very small they're hard to detect and since then we've discovered you know couple.
Tyson,"Dozen more so it might be up above 22,000 Dorf galaxies in our vicinity basically nearby so the point getting."
Interviewer,Back to the void mm-hmm is you look out on the void and say there's nothing there well what are you invoking to.
Tyson,Declare that it's a void is it your eyes well let's bring in a telescope or using visible light is that a visible light.
Interviewer,Telescope bringing an x-ray telescope an infrared telescope bring in the spate of senses that science has developed that.
Tyson,Transcend the five native senses we have through our human physiology and that power enables us to decode the universe.
Interviewer,Not as our senses receive them but as our detectors there is an amazing chapter of kotas or in the back will you.
Tyson,Find out how human beings finally what they couldn't see that there is a rainbow of color that we all can see.
Interviewer,Which are waves of different lengths they go he take you from whatever it's get be vid bow Roy be viv.
Tyson,So whatever boy be vip roy had roy we had to repeat after me Roy red Roy G Biff Rock red are yellow green blue.
Interviewer,Indigo indigo the violin violin you got it but it's weird just a quick thing roses are red violets.
Tyson,Are violent right is it me who came up with violence or blue that we have a name for that color that was a desperate.
Interviewer,Poet looking for a rhyme i think don't be violating laws of physics just to make the rhyme okay I was gonna say Mark.
Tyson,Twain's enoch that i love what is it first get your facts straight then distort them at your leisure.
Interviewer,The uh let me just finish this up i've been command I'm sorry um at the end there's this this moment where somebody.
Tyson,Has to figure out that that there might be something redder than red or somehow more than violet now we only have eyes.
Interviewer,But this particular person used a thermometer what was brilliant was brilliant brilliant.
Tyson,Okay so isaac newton is the first to understand that white light is composed of colors he takes white light puts it.
Interviewer,Through a prism and he gets roygbiv actually the indigo he had a mystical fascination with the number seven so he.
Tyson,Wanted to lay down seven colors but indigo is just really blue violet all right but anyhow we'll give him his.
Interviewer,Indigo cuz he did all that stuff before he turned 26 so if you invent calculus just on a dare.
Tyson,We give it to you all right we'll give you him to go if you need to have him to go so he's got the colors and then he.
Interviewer,Took those colors merged them back together and he got white light out the other side that's some freaky stuff.
Tyson,That's just freaky yeah that red orange yellow green blue violet equals white okay so we're good there.
Interviewer,William herschel comes around later and says I wonder just to even ask this question I wonder if the different.
Tyson,Colors of light have different temperatures so he laid down the spectrum with sunlight prism and he put.
Interviewer,A thermometer in each color and then he had an eighth thermometer I don't know if he used one and did the experiment.
Tyson,Eight seven times but he had another thermometer that he used as a control thermometer you put that over to the.
Interviewer,Side where there are no colors and that would presumably just measure the room temperature.
Tyson,Mmm-hmm so he knows enough to even think that this is an interesting exercise and he's got a control thermometer and he.
Interviewer,Just puts it over to the side of the read out of sight and then he watches the two thermometers and the control.
Tyson,Thermometer goes through the roof yes and he's looking at it and he says something must be coming through this.
Interviewer,The prism that i cannot see and he describes this as light unfit for vision he discovers infrared light with that.
Tyson,Experiment and then another guy which the human eye cannot see it says you if you go to the hardware store and get an.
Interviewer,Infrared bulb and you turn it on and it looks red you're seeing the red light that is also emitted from this infrared.
Tyson,Bulb and the heat that you feel your eye cannot see that's all the infrared that you're buying when you pay money for.
Interviewer,That bulb and then some other guy put a piece of paper on the other side of violet and it turned dark and even a.
Tyson,Photographic paper and he found that it responds it's responded in the way you would normally respond by putting.
Interviewer,Photographic paper in front of visible light so he concludes that was somebody else from somebody else the end right.
Tyson,And says there's something beyond the light there's something less than the red infrared something beyond the violet.
Interviewer,And thus was discovered ultra violet light and so to pose the question in the first place was a stroke of brilliance.
Tyson,To then trust your measurements on a level where you then declare you have made that discovery is a whole other.
Interviewer,Thing it's oh yeah it's yeah here's the thing about this book is just so people get a sense of the history yeah the.
Tyson,History of puzzlement and the history of discovery rolled up into one I'm not gonna ask you of anything else because.
Interviewer,It's time for questions and answers but I would have so just you know what else is in here there's something there's.
Tyson,Dark matter which is this mysterious thing that's out there which dark matter is everywhere okay dark energy one of.
Interviewer,The questions yes is why are so many heavenly bodies round is there anything in the universe that's.
Tyson,Perfectly round what's going on between planets where why is there still debris coming in when the earth seemed to have.
Interviewer,Scooped up everything after 4.6 billion rotations something at the end called the Copernican principle all of it is.
Tyson,Really but never mind the question is the universe is 14 something something billion years old.
Interviewer,We've now seen stars stars galaxies galaxies that are 13 billion years old and somehow that might suggest that the.
Tyson,The universe is expanding and that there is more and more universe all the time well first of all the universe is.
Interviewer,Expanding and there is more and more observable universe all the time the universe at its edge is expanding at one.
Tyson,Light-year per year that's how that works and so in a billion years the edge is.
Interviewer,Not going to be 14 billion light years away it'll be 15 billion light years away so we got that okay so now galaxies.
Tyson,13 billion light years away we are seeing light it made it by that galaxy and that light has been traveling for 13.
Interviewer,Billion years okay yes that galaxy emitted its light when the universe was 10% its current age and in fact was much.
Tyson,Smaller than it is today now you said the current paradigm is 14 billion year age of the universe you.
Interviewer,Said that with a little bit of oh you'll come up with something different later the proper way to say that is that is.
Tyson,The current measurements of the age of the universe that's how that works okay paradigm is came into our lexicon.
Interviewer,In a big way in the 1970s with a book written by the science philosopher Thomas Kuhn what's it.
Tyson,There's a dangerous woman in here who is this job you speak so dangerously remember what happened to the guy who.
Interviewer,Put the didn't put the cream in the coffee so this book the structure of scientific revolutions sort of.
Tyson,Introduced paradigm as a as a as a way that scientists sort of gather around a paradigm and they're all sort of.
Interviewer,Accepted although then something different happens and better data comes along that we all gather around a.
Tyson,Different paradigm that happened basically until the dawn of the age of modern science which I date from Galileo.
Interviewer,And and bacon of francis bacon where when you experimentally measure something to be true and it's verified.
Tyson,That is a truth that does not later turn out to be false period it's not how science works it's not like oh this is.
Interviewer,Now that's when he falls down let's all crowd around this you would be left with that impression having read that book.
Tyson,But the book got that very wrong for the age of modern science before then sure because people just thought stuff up and.
Interviewer,Then and call themself scientist and that was it with philosophers and you turn I'd be profoundly wrong when.
Tyson,Somebody else thought up something better and then everybody's wrong when we finally started taking data it's all.
Interviewer,About the data okay so everything you described is just perfectly fine yes it finds galaxies the.
Tyson,Next telescope the james webb space Telescope is tuned to live in that regime to find galaxies being born in.
Interviewer,The early universe so to be a whole lot more data coming back from the early universe when that telescope gets.
Tyson,Launched lands at its observing point and gets turned on so there's nothing you said that's odd or weird that is the.
Interviewer,Universe we live in okay question is people there's he heard something he talked about God on CBS.
Tyson,Television and he's had he's like thinking about near-death experiences and he wonders whether these deep.
Interviewer,Mysteries are interesting to you okay so one of the things we know from research in psychology as well as just practical.
Tyson,Matters in the conducting of scientific experiments is that one of which is odd because it's one of the hi.
Interviewer,Evidence in the court of law which disturbs me greatly so if you cut if you come from a lab to a science conference.
Tyson,And say this is true we say how do you know this because I saw it well it's really the end of your talk and you just.
Interviewer,Leave and then we say come back when you have a chart recorder or you have to just give me something that does not.
Tyson,Have to flow through your senses because your census is some of the worst data taking devices that exist and science.
Interviewer,Did not achieve maturity modern science does not maseeh maturity until we had instruments that either extended our.
Tyson,Senses or replace them and galileo was not an accident that we have modern science as I've described it experiment.
Interviewer,Verification this these tactics these methods and tools began with Galileo and Francis Bacon and Galileo was around.
Tyson,1600 that was the invention in that period of the microscope and the telescope so it's not an accident that.
Interviewer,All this sort of came together at that time so now we have people who are in the act of dying and they come back from.
Tyson,Life and they report on mental experiences and that's intriguing it's intriguing but because it is in the.
Interviewer,Realm of eyewitness testimony you can establish it perhaps as a personal truth but it'll take more than that to.
Tyson,Establish it as an objective truth and an objective truth is the kind of truths that science discovers and it's the kind.
Interviewer,Of truth that is true whether or not you believe in it okay it exists outside of your culture your religion your.
Tyson,Political affiliation personal truths if I may consider that would be okay Jesus is your Savior that's your personal.
Interviewer,Truth you cannot convince someone else that Jesus is their Savior in an objective way you have to persuade them.
Tyson,You have to persuade them in some with in some cases by war right look at the wars that have been fought.
Interviewer,Between religions that did not agree about who was their respective saviors so so sure we know if I walked on water.
Tyson,Made you unblind turned got created loaves and fishes out of nothing that would be amazing I think we would like.
Interviewer,Investigate that and we would check we would say whoa yes we would we would so it would be an amazing thing and then if.
Tyson,We keep we cannot account for that for by any other known laws of physics and it's only happening with you that we see.
Interviewer,We'd wonder if you were like alien or something first right but no it would be so easy to demonstrate divinity if in.
Tyson,Fact you have the power you wanted to display but getting back to the gentleman's point so part of this issue.
Interviewer,Is what does it mean to be dead okay to be did you fog a mirror that was held up in front of you while you were laying.
Tyson,There on your bed alright and if you didn't fog the mirror you were judged to be dead they would put you in a coffin.
Interviewer,And in some parts that it is told there's a string that they put into the coffin as they buried you and they put.
Tyson,It over a tree branch and connected to a bell if you woke up you would pull the string and you it that's where you get.
Interviewer,The term dead ringer okay you would pull the string and you come rescue me because you buried a living person okay.
Tyson,So then it was you dead because your heart stops well we know why our heart beats it's an electrochemical so you do.
Interviewer,Poke the heart beats again we got that one okay well is it when you're brain dead well you can be brain dead but your.
Tyson,Heart is still beating and yeah we can keep you alive are you dead yet well no cuz your heart's still beating.
Interviewer,Is your brain functioning no okay i can tell you this that if you're dead long enough that your brain is deprived.
Tyson,Oxygen and then you we bring you back you're not talking about seeing any lights because you're brain dead okay so.
Interviewer,Plus this often happens to someone who is deathly ill to begin with and where are they they're in a hospital and if.
Tyson,They go into cardiac arrest or something critical they take you from your hospital bed to an operating table and.
Interviewer,What is sitting above an operating table lights it's okay and so if you say oh I was.
Tyson,Dead and i came back and i saw lights wait maybe it's not all the cases but it's many of the cases okay.
Interviewer,Now there were skeptics who tried to do an experiment the people who say they left their body hmm and they thought we.
Tyson,Got some of those montesquieu so here's what they did when was Montesquieu he got rear-ended by some guy in a horse.
Interviewer,Fell off flew up into the air looked down at himself in agony watched his way we're in collisions in the air machine.
Tyson,Montaigne sorry montana still they have rear-end collisions in the air well as you ride a horse with a guy behind you.
Interviewer,Is riding too fast is like a cab situation okay I didn't know that okay okay so I didn't know that well I loved.
Tyson,Stopping you mid-career and collision where the horses where was I so so there was an experiment so there's some.
Interviewer,Descriptions that are part of this near-death experience literature where they come above and they see themselves.
Tyson,Down there on the bed okay so what they decided to do is for people who are about to die they would write a message.
Interviewer,Facing upwards to the ceiling above the bed and suspended there so if a person goes above their bed and looks down.
Tyson,They'd be able to read the message so they rejoin their body they what they should then tell us what message they.
Interviewer,Saw that's never happens just no that's enough now now I have a cousin who when her father.
Tyson,Died was alone with him in the room and he's in an open casket and she's otherwise completely rational okay I'm.
Interviewer,Not saying there's a crazy person to completely what she's a real estate agent.
Tyson,Okay thanks for itself okay among other town okay so she's in there she tells me of a conversation she had.
Interviewer,With her dead father and i said was it in your mind no he sat up and spoke to her I said.
Tyson,What was the conversation and she said well he asked he said don't worry about him he's in a better place this sort of.
Interviewer,Thing so this is her eyewitness testimony I'm not gonna say it's wrong I'm just saying it's not scientifically.
Tyson,Useful but that's all i'm really saying here okay I told her next time this happens ask.
Interviewer,These questions and not those questions okay don't say are you happy did you how you know saying are you wearing clothes.
Tyson,It's where are you where did you get your clothes what temperature is it or you just ask questions like this is an.
Interviewer,Amazing scientific experiment you could be performing so so that's my lesson to all of you if you find yourself in that.
Tyson,Situation okay cuz i have a dead person sits up and starts talking to me oh I'm getting chart recorders I'm gonna be all.
Interviewer,Up in that as an experiment okay all right up in the balcony whoever that was yes question is can you help us.
Tyson,Understand a multi-dimensional universe what would be the dimension is we are unaware of any dimension higher than the.
Interviewer,Three that we're familiar with or the actual four that we're embedded in we live in a four-dimensional world and.
Tyson,That might sound a little flaky and freaky but consider the following fact you have never met someone at a place.
Interviewer,Unless it was also at a time and you have never met someone at a time unless it was also at a place that requires.
Tyson,Four dimensions of their daily living what about in a dream this is the dream happening inside your head yes I don't.
Interviewer,Know when so the only point is we know intuitively that we need four dimensions to localize someone to meet up with them.
Tyson,Especially well only two dimensions if you don't have tall buildings you have tall buildings you need the third.
Interviewer,Dimension so you don't say i'll meet you at the 20th floor you know on 7:21 Park Avenue what time.
Tyson,Okay this is a full four dimensions going on there so to someone to convince you we.
Interviewer,Live in a four-dimensional world for that reason okay it may be that these four dimensions are manifest to us but.
Tyson,That in fact we are embedded in higher than in a higher dimensional space and strength theorists on the frontier of.
Interviewer,This exercise are hypothesizing at least ten dimensions to account for everything we see in the universe even if we do not.
Tyson,Directly measure those dimensions themselves now with your permission may I go on a dimensional journey with you.
Interviewer,Man might take you on a journey at a dimensional Odyssey Odyssey are you ready yes okay are you ready to get.
Tyson,Ready for this okay so I'm at my desk and the desk is a surface okay and I start putting pages.
Interviewer,Down on the desk of tiling them on the desk and then I run out of room I have exhausted the two dimensions of the.
Tyson,Surface of my desk we have ways of accommodating this problem and so we have page organizers that go upwards so.
Interviewer,Now and i don't have any more surface area area of the desk I can enter a third dimension and put pages there if.
Tyson,You are an ant embedded in this two-dimensional world of the surface of my desk and you fill up the desk with.
Interviewer,These sheets of paper the ants will say there is no more room and I say yes there is watch me and I take a piece of.
Tyson,Paper off the desk put it in the page organizer and according to the ant that's embedded in the two dimensions.
Interviewer,That page disappeared it disappeared into a dimension that ant does not have access to what a brilliant invention.
Tyson,This is you can put practically an unlimited number of pages but far more pages above the desk then on the desk so.
Interviewer,Access to a third dimension is an extraordinarily useful storage device for a two-dimensional creature does the.
Tyson,Ant trust you that what it cannot see is nevertheless there I have to then talk to it about this extra dimension and.
Interviewer,Then it will have to just trust you yes because watch what happens next I now have my three dimensional room and.
Tyson,I'm filling it with boxes now i've run out of space to put the box but now an alien four-dimensional alien.
Interviewer,Looks at us and says i got this just move it into the fourth dimension what are you talking about and the alien.
Tyson,Comes in reaches in takes one of the boxes and then the Box disappears disappears it went into a fourth.
Interviewer,Dimension and this was captured in the film Monsters Inc did you guys see this film these are monsters that work in a.
Tyson,Door factory and they make these doors and they open the door and it is the door of the kids bedroom or their closet.
Interviewer,And they step through and they're in the kid's closet and then they scare the kid because that's their job they're.
Tyson,Monsters okay this doorway is a portal through the fourth dimension and then back to the third so imagine a new.
Interviewer,Storage system we just go to home depot and buy a door and that door is your portal to a fourth dimension you open.
Tyson,The door put your boxers close the door you look on the other side of the door there's nothing there so this is what's.
Interviewer,Going on when you have access to higher dimensions wait don't you have to then talk to somebody as far as you know if.
Tyson,You're a scientist and you need data what you have is something that you had or it's gone and now a voice says I've.
Interviewer,Got this yeah if if that were to either if it's a voice from the fourth dimension I'm gonna listen to it.
Tyson,So does everything i'm not gonna say no you're out I if if there's a voice coming out of the fourth dimension and.
Interviewer,Makes one of my boxes disappear i'm thinking it's got more power than I do and more knowledge of the space-time.
Tyson,Continuum so i'm going with it does that mean that in order for a scientist to credit another dimension with reality.
Interviewer,With real existence you will need a testifier from beyond so you need a dimension plus a dimension dimension.
Tyson,Voice dimension a dimensionless voice yeah that comes from another from another place now there are things that.
Interviewer,Happen in quantum physics that kind of defy our sensibilities like particles pop in and out of existence they don't.
Tyson,They defy any rational attempt to understand it particles can be entangled with one another a particle can be here.
Interviewer,And there's a barrier and it can spontaneously show up on the other side of the barrier and faster than the speed.
Tyson,Of light all of this is just mysterious let me ask you suppose you have a sphere and I live in a 2-dimensional world and.
Interviewer,You take this hollow sphere so it's a shell and you pass that sphere through my two-dimensional universe.
Tyson,How will i describe that i will say this point just appeared out of nowhere oops now it's a circle a small circle.
Interviewer,And that circle is getting bigger by the moment oh my gosh well if we start maximum size now that circle is just.
Tyson,Shrinking it's shrinking up now it's a point now the whole thing disappeared this would be completely freaky to a.
Interviewer,Two-dimensional being but it makes complete sense if you live in three dimensions and you passed a sphere.
Tyson,Through my universe so who is to say that some of the mysterious things we are describing accurately but don't.
Interviewer,Otherwise make sense make sense in a higher dimension and these are just the manifestations of higher dimensional.
Tyson,Phenomenon in our world and that's an aspect of what these higher dimensional physicists.
Interviewer,Are trying to establish at this point now I want to totally blow their minds if I can.
Tyson,Oh sure if i may but you got to stay with me on this okay a point has no dimensions there's no height width depth.
Interviewer,So it has zero dimensions a line has one dimension length okay a square has two dimensions sort of.
Tyson,Height and width a cube has three dimensions height width depth we got this now follow me.
Interviewer,A line is one dimensional but it's bounded by two zero dimensional things those are the points one dimension.
Tyson,Bounded by two zero dimensional points a square is two dimensions bounded by four.
Interviewer,One-dimensional sides a cube is three dimensions bounded by six two-dimensional sides so in other words.
Tyson,The dimensions of your sides are going up your line is bound by zero dimensional points your square is bound.
Interviewer,By two-dimensional lines I mean bye-bye but one-dimensional sides the cube is bound by two-dimensional.
Tyson,Squares okay so we going up to four six two points four sides of a square six sides of a cube and each side is one.
Interviewer,Dimension less they're squares on the sides of a cube they're lines on the side of a square.
Tyson,They're dots on the sides of a line let's go up to a four dimensional cube a four dimensional cube has eight sides a.
Interviewer,Regular cube has six sides we'll go it up by two afford missile tube has eight sides and each of those sides is a three.
Tyson,Dimensional cube one dimension down from itself in the same way each side of a three-dimensional cube is a two.
Interviewer,Dimensional square so when you get to four dimensions the sides are three dimensional surfaces and you can take.
Tyson,This all the way up and our brains can't picture is what we call a hypercube then some circles are tesseract.
Interviewer,We can't picture a volume bounded by three-dimensional cubes what does it even mean this is because we evolved in.
Tyson,The plains of africa just not wanting to get eaten by a lion our neuro synapses are ill-equipped to.
Interviewer,Do to do the distance on this and this is why we invent mathematics that can take us there.
Tyson,Well the mathematics can help us imagine it but if we want to credit it with reality then you have to design an.
Interviewer,Experiment that somehow touches your own world yes yes so you can invent something that you can't see if it has.
Tyson,Testable consequences in ways that you can see that's perfectly allowed not a problem mm-hmm oh and by the way there's.
Interviewer,Some people that say you cannot prove a negative some people like coming after you.
Tyson,Generally you won't hear a scientist say that it's others like philosophers and people who like criticizing scientists.
Interviewer,But who are not scientist so that you can't prove an A we kind of do that all the time okay but we don't use the word.
Tyson,Proof we demonstrate without any further discussion that the negative is true ok so here's.
Interviewer,An example there's a cave there is there a bear in the cave I don't know I'm not going in to find out okay I'm.
Tyson,Gonna set up cameras and see if a bear comes out okay so I set up the cameras all throughout summer no bear goes in.
Interviewer,And out but then i okay then I take down the camera maybe a bear went in there to hibernate so.
Tyson,Here's what you do you set a powder outside of the cave something that will record a footprint and you just monitor.
Interviewer,This month after month after month after month do it for 12 months look up in the charts how often a bear has to eat and.
Tyson,How long would take a bear to die for not eating if the period of time you waited is long enough so that there are.
Interviewer,No footprints you conclude that there is no bear in that cave I just demonstrated a negative sufficient enough for me to.
Tyson,No longer pose that question and go on to another problem but if you were so distracted that it's not a formal proof.
Interviewer,Of a negative then you could just keep sitting there wondering while the rest of us decode the nature of the universe.
Tyson,We have oh by the way maybe the cave is not a closed cave you might have a rear way have a back door yeah okay that's.
Interviewer,Possible i suppose that's possible so then the assumption that there's no bear in the cave would be wrong but I'm or.
Tyson,The cave could have a cave and that cave could have another cave you see there is just so much to worry about right and so.
Interviewer,You will sit there you'll sit there arrested by your own capacity to doubt an experimental reality yes well like I.
Tyson,Said the rest of us can keep making discoveries well we need we have time for one more question and that person at.
Interviewer,The very end underneath the exit sign hand prominently raised not the one waving it but the woman in the yellow.
Tyson,Shirt still with her hand up wondering if I'm looking at her yeah well looking back and what's not a.
Interviewer,Yellow shirt it's a horizontal striped shirt oh okay really oh oh repeat it this was an art major or something I'm.
Tyson,Right i guess yeah if you had one last question to answer this evening what would that question be so you you you.
Interviewer,Misunderstand me oh that wasn't your question but can I at least answer that no okay oh if you're in your career as a.
Tyson,Scientist if there is one question that you wish to address before you go to the great cave with the bigger or wait.
Interviewer,Forever for the bear to come out and stay there what would that science question be or do you like your previous.
Tyson,Question better yeah okay so i'm gonna give an answer but then I want your permission to give you a kind of a.
Interviewer,Cop-out answer if i give both a full answer and then a cop-out answer that my full answer is I wonder if in fact the.
Tyson,Human intellect is sufficient to actually decode the full operations of this universe in which we live and it's.
Interviewer,Not specifically an astrophysical question it's just more we are in intelligent species because we defined.
Tyson,Ourselves that way we don't have the benefit of another species to compare ourselves with.
Interviewer,Against whom we might fail miserably and so when we compare ourselves to chimps we sit up righteously and say we have.
Tyson,Poetry and the hubble telescope and philosophy and the trim just stacks banette stacks boxes to reach a banana.
Interviewer,Yet there's only 1% difference in our DNA but then you'll say what a difference that 1% makes and I would say.
Tyson,Maybe that 1% dna difference corresponds with an equally small difference in the intelligence between a chimp and humans.
Interviewer,Use i can't believe that no no well imagine some other species that visits us that's 1% along on that same scale.
Tyson,Smarter than us consider the smartest chimp does what our toddlers can do and there's no way you will explain to a.
Interviewer,Chimp all of dinner ready at 6:30 you pick up some some juice on the way home that the simplest human thoughts are.
Tyson,Inconceivable to a chimp and their talents are about what our toddlers can do so let's get back to this 1% smarter.
Interviewer,Alien that we've discovered corresponding this analogy we now say what would we look like to them well.
Tyson,They would roll stephen hawking forward after combing the human species and they'd say this one is slightly smarter.
Interviewer,Than the rest because he can do astrophysics calculations in his head like little Timmy over here.
Tyson,Look who just came home from preschool Oh Timmy you just composed three sonnets isn't that cute let's put it up on the.
Interviewer,Refrigerator door oh you just derived the fundamental law of calculus isn't that kid put it up on the refrigerator.
Tyson,Their simplest thoughts would transcend our deepest thoughts and maybe they to them it is obvious what dark matter is.
Interviewer,And dark energy maybe to them particles popping in and out of existence is a trivial exercise in their understanding.
Tyson,Of the multi-dimensional space-time continuum and we are here groping at the sides of a wall not knowing how tall.
Interviewer,Wide or deep it is because we have the limits of the human physiology evolved off the plains of Africa just to try to.
Tyson,Understand the entire universe so i lose sleep on that question each night so that's my weight did you almost say at.
Interviewer,The beginning of that answer that you are wondering we may be something of a mysterion that you you you're not sure.
Tyson,I'm not sure the world is so the universe is so complicated that it may be more complicated than we can ever.
Interviewer,Fathom no that's the hubristic way to say it it's not how I said it okay how did you.
Tyson,Say it again we might not be smart enough okay not you Brist 'ok if you're hubristic you would say we are smart but.
Interviewer,The universe is just really complicated that's not what I said when I said we might not be smart enough.
Tyson,To figure out a universe that could be trivial to the brain of a more intelligent species okay so check your.
Interviewer,Hubris at the door otherwise yeah you will not bask in the cosmic perspective that so much of this.
Tyson,Discussion brings upon us so may a now give you my cop-out answer my cop-out answer is I think often about the.
Interviewer,Questions we do not yet know to ask because discoveries yet to come but when they arrive will put us in a new Vista a.
Tyson,New place to stand enabling us to see questions undreamt of an unimaginable or we got there so when I again lay awake.
Interviewer,At night i ponder what kinds of questions lay beyond our reach because the questions that we even know.
Tyson,How to pose there there those are not even interesting to me anymore because we knew how to ask the question I want.
Interviewer,To know the question that is beyond everyone's reach and by definition I can't because we haven't gotten there.
Tyson,Yet but that doesn't mean i i shouldn't dream of that frontier and and.
Interviewer,That sounded like a coder to me i gotta say like I could hear the orchestra playing - yeah can I offer a better.
Tyson,Coder yes and then we'll let you go but sorry we went long try not to ever forget that the history of this exercise.
Interviewer,This beautiful exercise where we find out where we fit in this great unfolding of cosmic events and phenomenon that the.
Tyson,Larger grows the area of knowledge the bigger that area grows just to remember so - grows our perimeter of ignorance it.
Interviewer,May be that as much as we think we know as much as we know we know as much as the more things that we ultimately learn.
Tyson,For all we know we could be steeped in the center of infinite ignorance which then provides job security forever for.
Interviewer,Science and society run it forward .
Tyson,doesn't make me jittery or mess with my gut and it's good for you it's actually nutritious and it comes in these easy-to-use packets that you can take anywhere you can stash them in your gym bag your suitcase and they have given us the opportunity to give you an exclusive offer with for somatic on their best-selling lion's mane coffee and this is just for listeners this podcast you can receive up to 45% off I know it's a lot of money up to 45% off so to claim this deal you got to go to for Sig Matic.com / Rogan and this offer is only for JRE listeners and it's not available on the regular website go to fo you are SI G m atic for Sig manic.com / Rogan and get yourself some awesome and delicious lion's mane coffee full discount applied at check out we're also brought to you by.

Tyson,and up Chris De Stefano every week Chris and his producer will be listening to And discussing some of the greatest stand-up of all time from Classic Bits out of comedy Central's library to jokes from today's hottest up-and-coming comedians they'll unpack their favorite bits discuss the comedy scene call up other Comedians and generally get into everything comedy and since they record at comedy Central's headquarters in New York City you never know who might drop in so you can listen to expertly curated playlists with jokes from John Mulaney to Hannibal Buress to Maria Bamford Mitch Hedberg and in between jokes you get to hear behind-the-scenes discussions about the bit or what else Chris has on its mind it's basically two podcasts for the price of one but it's completely free.
Interviewer,there's no podcasts out there that's anything like it and you subscribe and listen to new episodes of stand up with Krista Stefano every Thursday wherever you listen to your podcasts my guest today is a good friend a brilliant man and one of the I guess probably the most famous astrophysicist in the known universe his name is Neil deGrasse Tyson The Joe Rogan Experience trained by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.
Tyson,hello yo what's going on man yeah good to see you thanks thanks I feel a little overdressed sorry about you look good you know look at that a bit of Starry Night there yeah you're really into that huh oh yeah I got I guess is that yes what's on your phone so you remembered yes yeah yeah it's on the phone sorry night what you don't like about Starry Night it's not what Van Gogh saw that night it's what he felt how do you know what he felt because this is not an representation of reality and anything that deviates from reality is reality that has filtered through your senses and I think art at its highest is exactly that if this was an exact depiction of reality it would be a photograph and I don't need the artist hmm okay so even photographs that take you to a slightly other kind of Dimension as you gaze upon them it's more than what was actually going on at the time and that's that's art taken to the.
Interviewer,craft of Photography that's why you like it that's why it's one of the reasons why plus I think it was the very first.
Tyson,painting where it's title is the background.
Interviewer,think about that this could have been called you know in the full painting obviously this is a typical yeah so there's a town there there's a cypress tree there's a church steeple it could have been called cypress tree could have been called Sleepy Village it could have been called Rolling Hills but no it's called starry night and everything in front of it everything in front of it is just in the way and how often do you paint something where the title is the background that that's my point and in this particular case the background is the universe and soap so for me this was a pivot point in art and it's 1889 which is recent given the history of paintings and you know the go all the way back so yeah there it is that your favorite painting ever I have to say you have to be you have a vest and a phone call it's not what are you doing and I have four or five ties that have this painting on them.
Tyson,different ways yeah so what would you put them all in I'm all-in what's interesting is that the town is what would have you seen Starry Night in bacon somebody did look at dig it up on the screen it takes somebody did it in bacon it's just crazy how weird yes yeah how weird go back to the original one please what's interesting about the original one is that the town is realistically depicted the trees are recognizable as trees if you ever saw a sky that looked like that the end would be here yeah exactly placenta whirling is not wind and it's not clouds because it was if it was clouds you wouldn't see the stars right let's go it's how he felt that's all I can tell you by the way that's is a real evening so that's sorry it's not even the it's early morning the crescent moon when it's that orientation means this is Before Sunrise and that white object lower on the horizon that sort of glowy that's very likely Venus and that.
Interviewer,us to trace what's over what set of weeks this painting was actually painted so it's kind of like forensic astronomy has anyone done an analysis of like where he must have been yeah it's well-known yeah he was he was in a real place and so that really pull this out of his ass right I mean it was he painted what he saw folded into what he felt yeah heavy that's how art should be I think yeah otherwise what do you need artists for.
Tyson,make cool shit the cool stuff is something that they felt and it came out of them yeah they feel stuff they artists feel feel the the natural world in ways different from the rest of us.
Interviewer,and that's why they're artists do they or do they just express it with all sorry yes they not only yes we all can feel it but to be able to express it that that's a whole other Talent right just to Camp you know what I think about often why do you why do we all know who Paul Revere is all right we all we is a household name yet is there any other War ever fought in the history of the world where a household name is the name of the person who told other people the enemy was coming.
Tyson,we can mention his name but we can't list the generals that all fought in that war why it's because a poem was written about him and he had this mundane job let me tell people the enemy is coming and so the artists in this case the poet.
Interviewer,elevated the mundane to something that forces you to to reckon it with your understanding of this world what Joyce Joyce Kilmer his most famous poem it's about a tree dogs piss on trees you drive by trees you don't even know they're there yet a poem about a tree I'll never see something as lovely as a tree oh my gosh this so the art forces you to pause and just reflect on things that you took for granted things that became ordinary in your life and they were elevated to to they get beatified by the talents of artists that's the word oh beatiful you never know we had a fight yeah I'm do using it Loosely it's the intermediate step between being an ordinary person and being a saint.
Tyson,beatification of someone in the Catholic church I would have thought it's making something more beautiful oh babe okay I don't it could have I'm gonna risk be at bu yeah could it could come from that but to be it be beatified is the first steps on route to sainthood yeah that's if I remember the word correctly hair goes oh you got it pulled it up the definition to make supremely happy Christianity declare to have attained blessedness of heaven and authorize the title blessed and limited public religious honor she was beatified six years after her death so I think you can't become a saint unless you previously been beatified I think that's the rule but I'm looking at the number one definition there to make supremely happy so that's a nest interesting yeah that that yeah that moved ahead of a definition of beautify yeah so we got to be out of fight with the verb was up there you had on the screen Roman Catholic Church he beatified Juan Diego Indian.
Interviewer,have a vision of the Virgin Mary synonyms canonize sanctify holla consecrate so I think if you take something ordinary and you subjected to the interpretation of an artist it can be beatified and elevated on a level where it becomes a household recognition of its importance in this world hmm so okay my brother's an artist my brother's an artist so I'm kind of art Fine Art but also paints and he teaches history of art so I I've had this sort of baptism my whole life being exposed to him I'm the you know the Sip The Sibling scientist but the have an artist in the family I think everyone should have an artist in the family I've got an uncle and of course the the whole steam movement science technology engineering and math the artist got in and say wait I'm so stem the stem movement kaito is human they want to throw in the a to get art as part of that movement science technology engineering art and math changing from stem to steam the steam so you get full steam ahead Steam.
Tyson,better word in that well they're both good words for what they need but that just sounds like a bunch of awesome stuff like it does and at yeah I'm not throwing comedy and building houses you know it seems like you're getting very it's like the LBGTQ a I like things get really squirrelly when you start adding more letters yeah you can add letters but if it doesn't spell anything then the memorization has to kick in but steam you don't have to memorize that it's already there for you so it's cleverly conceived I think it the abbreviation was it's tacit recognition that these are elements in society that advanced civilization and and grow the economy actually so in fact this hardly any growth economy in the world that isn't growing because it has been for not having been touched by science or technology everything just think about it.
Interviewer,so if you're around running at you don't have them on your show but if you want around saying I don't like science science is bad science is evil okay well then you will die in poverty if you elect officials who believe that as well well the fuck thinks that science is bad in 2019 and how did they express this they express it through sighs okay so you know I'm saying like are they saying it online I have a book coming out in a month called letters from an astrophysicist okay it's not it's not out yet I've got it it's not how did you get a copy but I got don't even have my copy yet okay what I'm saying in there there's a whole chapter on just angry people who don't like anything including science and one of them it's a riff he just said I hate to admit signs it and that science would bring some of the worst things that's ever happened to humanity and pollution and this goes on and on and on and on and on and so I reply is Letters from an astrophysics and I reply as.
Tyson,only in is rationally as is possible when you get attacked that way but what I'm saying is not everyone Embraces everything that science does and some will cherry pick it you have the science deniers for a global warming of science deniers with vaccines if sites and Aires with GMOs yet there's there's all manner of science denying going on in modern society and you know we in a free Society what you going to do right the people can think what they want but if the if thinking what they want influences policy which then affects everybody then your science denial has consequences to the economic health of the nation and by the way it's not only economics it's your the economic health is your physical health because medicine flows through advances in science as well as our security well there's people that deny some aspects of science while conveniently using other that's where it gets weird right you're driving a car that's relying on.
Interviewer,GPS using a phone to complain about the global-warming hooks you know you're correct one of my more more sort of popular tweets was you remember when they have the photo of the black hole From A Distant Galaxy and it was Banner headlines maybe a year ago less than a year ago Banner headlines and first photo ever be of a black hole and it was an astounding engineering achievement to accomplish that it was multiple telescopes all around the world pulling the data to get it right and it was one of the greatest collaborative efforts we've ever undertaken in my field of astrophysics okay and everybody was loving the results so all I tweeted was scientist report first photo of a black hole.
Tyson,public scientists report humans are warming the Earth.
Interviewer,oh no you brought it up okay scientist we produce the first-ever image of a supermassive black hole 55 million light years away the response scientist we've concluded the humans or catastrophically warming the Earth response that conflicts with what I want to be true so it must be false well that is the cherry picking of science it is a cherry picking assignments but the global warming thing is very much connected to a certain type of ideology if the certain type of person thinks of themselves matter to me No Nonsense purse what I'm saying what yes it does matter what I'm what I'm trying to say is that is a demographic that has cherry-picked science to deny human-caused global warming there are other demographics demographics that have cherry-picked other science to deny other things and it's not all located in one political Spectrum in one political Branch right so you tend to find liberal folk complaining that the conservatives who have embraced.
Tyson,no the good old global warming platform are denying science and then each science on their side and many of those same people are rubbing crystals together to be healed by the crystal energy or they're denying vaccines thinking that there's somehow bad for you and so so all of this requires some or total rejection of mainstream science and we're living in that world now and I don't know I don't think it'll stop the progress of civilization but it can certainly slow it down and occasionally stall it well that is certainly a problem but how big of a problem is it like how many people are really in denial of Science in 2019 and it's got to be for me in every country that's not what matters what matters is in a free country that you elect officials who are not official yes you elect people who are scientifically literate yeah they don't have to be scientists or if they're not scientifically literate they should be.
Interviewer,"self aware of that and then listen to people who are right so do you think what they're doing now is they're they're doing what their constituents would like them to do that's why I don't be politicians over the head ever I don't do that we're Republic where democracy whatever they believe if they think the Earth is 6,000 years old and they got elected it's because the people elected them believe they're sitting there with is 6,000 years old or because they're willing to let that one go because they believe in their pocket possibly that's a good point because you have a portfolio of thoughts and beliefs or because he's such a profound Christian I mean he's so profoundly Christian that he's just want any of literal definition who are connected to science that don't including the pope by the way you know can you get more Christian than the pope all right he believes in science now this new pope is pretty interesting if you read if you read his encyclical from a couple of years ago it's it's it's a scientifically literate."
Tyson,doc document yeah and know this okay so it's not he's still religious right so Jesus still rose from the dead and there is still Miracles and all the rest of that in the New Testament so he's not in denial of that but given that he is saying oh my gosh here's something we the religious community and scientists can partner behind and that is we want to save life on Earth and so we have to be better Shepherds of what is going on on this Earth and one of them is we don't want to flood low-lying countries in the South Pacific where the average sea level is 10 feet above sea level or whatever it is you're going to lose these countries if you keep melting our our our the at the ice caps because that would include a North and then we'll land in the north so the glacier ice that's land-based ice right because any ice that's in the water floating that can melt and it's not going to change the water level so it's why you can do this experiment is really cool fill up your glass for some few cubes of ice in a glass.
Interviewer,water fill the glass up as much as you possibly can without spilling it and the ice is bobbing above that level okay because ice is about 10% buoyant on that about 10% of an ice cube will be lifted above this is this is a this is the iceberg equation right all right that's the tip of the iceberg well you see the 10% above and 90% is not visible to you this is by the way I don't want to get the too many off ramps here but that's one of the one of the things that they did right in Titanic okay if you look at the earliest Titanic movie that was in black and white they see this huge Iceberg on the horizon and then it can they can't swear away from it because it oh my gosh it doesn't have no no the iceberg that cuts the bottom of your boat is a little bit of ice sticking out above the water because 90% of it is underwater and that's where the damage occurs and in the James Cameron Titanic the iceberg that they hit above water was looks like a little chunk of ice it all that couldn't hurt anything all the damages under work anyhow.
Tyson,back to this so do this experiment and then let the glass sit there and let the ice melt and the water level will stay the same.
Interviewer,because when ice melts it gets takes up lower volume than it was when it became ice hmm and that's why pipes break I thought pipes break just because the water expands yeah I just described that in the opposite direction well so because as it freezes it but didn't know it gets larger that's what expansion means what kind of what's with your vocabulary here right now but I'm saying like don't worry so so your ice company City temperature the Ice Cube is sitting 10% above the water level and it melts and becomes water the water takes up 90 percent of the volume of the ice right so that just melt back into the water and it doesn't overflow even though it was sticking above the waterline when you had the glass so now let's do the opposite okay there's water in the pipes how can I tell you something that might blow your mind no.
Tyson,sure that allowed I don't know what how many times did your mind you at least once a day yeah at least we need your mind blown okay here's how it works okay so let's put water in the pipes okay and then the temperature drops the pipes have a certain strength right copper pipes you know they're rigid I grew up around breaking pipes okay so we'll have to use its so the waters in there and now the temperature begins to drop okay the water wants to turn to ice but it can't because the pipe is containing it so just sits there okay at 32 degrees as water even though the temperature outside is dropping below 32 degrees okay and it still sits there gets the 30° 29 the pipe is squeezing the attempt of this water to become.
Interviewer,ice having active squeezing it prevents the temperature from dropping okay and you as the temperature drops depending on how strong the pipe is and and the temperature gradient across it as the outside temperature continue to gets to now 25 degrees the pipe is still holding onto the liquid water that and it's still 32 degrees inside there and it holds onto and it's keeps happening it keeps happening you get a point where the pipe can no longer contain the water and the water freezes spontaneously.
Tyson,it just goes right down to that temperature and the pipe is helpless in the face of this so the point is the stronger the pipe is the lower the temperature has to be outside for the freezing water to break it so theoretically if you had a pipe that was made of a stronger material than copper you can get even lower than you get an even lower temperatures how low can you get because when things freeze they have to expand so what no only when water freezes why does water expands when it's a it's a remarkable fact about water that is shared by very few other ingredients most things when they cool they shrink as all men know oh so so so most most materials because things cooler the vibrating molecules slow down and they take up less space water is the opposite of that as it passes down through so so I'm going to describe to an extraordinary fact about water and why we're alive today okay so watch that has to take a lake.
Interviewer,that has fish in it okay temperature drops outside and the lake slowly begins to get cooler because it is a tenth time lag between the air temperature and the waters that's why the first freeze the the lake is still there it's got to be called longer I so what happens the water gets cold on the surface okay and.
Tyson,it begins to okay what is called on a surface and it begins to shrink so that waterfall Stitch shrink that makes it denser it falls to the bottom fine it does that down to about 4 degrees Celsius as it goes from 4 degrees Celsius to 0 degrees Celsius the freezing point it begins to expand.
Interviewer,and become less dense than the water so now as the water wants to actually freeze it stays on top when it does freeze you freeze the top surface of the lake well how about the water below it it's insulated from the dropping air temperature and the fish don't die.
Tyson,imagine if ice were denser than water what would happen you'd freeze the top layer it would sink the bottom is frozen fries the next layer it sinks and fish would be systematically forced to swim in shallower and shallower Waters until they were all freeze-dried on the top surface of the lake and all fishes would be dead every winter I think it's very like think it's fish what Lane you suppose say fishes fishes is it is a double plural you can do that yeah you know her dish would be dead you know like all dear would you say I'll dears well because you generally is one if you had multiple kinds of dire yeah oh so if you had likes it could yeah but but but it's rare that they're all in the same place you only have one kind of deal with me but that the ocean has many kind of fish in the same place oh yeah that's interesting so you would say fishes fishes you're talking about it's a double for its different kinds of plural fish yeah double blow my mind you didn't know you didn't know that again no no no I didn't know I never thought of it that way the many fishes in the oh yeah yes.
Interviewer,sorry this is in the sea yeah so multiple plurals of different kinds of things to get where ocean water freezes because that's what our boys soccer saltwater do you have the reef fishes up there is a nominee that happen where there was two or too little oxygen in the water and somehow the frozen fish got pushed out and a wall of ice the South Dakota where whoa so there's too little oxygen I don't know if I can explain that in there if you look at the if you look at the Green in the water most likely its algae so that happens with certain lakes that get polluted with certain types of algae kill the lake but by doing that just like and well you get it in the ocean to get these zones but I don't see how you get frozen fish though that's incredible but we should also stop go back up yeah scroll down so you could read it for fish Frozen a wall of ice and South Dakota's Lake and he's National Wildlife Refuge that's incredible man is that a video Jamie yeah I guess just a picture though that's what I don't know how to approach because they can just swim to where it's not frozen so I'd have to say I did.
Tyson,more homework on that one to see what caused that wow so my point is because of this property of water how weird that ice floats it insulates the bottom layers of the lake and fish can survive over the winter that's because of his work to write insulates you can inside you get a like a nice yeah sure yeah yeah I mean if you put a barrier between you and the changing elements outside that basically an insulating layer have you ever ice fishing no I never never it's a good way to get away from the wife person in New York City people go ice fishing I'm sure and since what do women go ice fishing to get away from their husband they do yeah okay like why do people golf you know ice fishing is particularly weird because you have to continually scoop out the ice and maybe even drill again right cooked so that works because frozen water is less dense than on Frozen water and it's one of the rare ingredients for which that so and it's likely there would be no life on land.
Interviewer,it anywhere on Earth if that were the case if the opposite of that were the case so what is a very special ingredient to life on Earth it's cited by Many religious folks is saying see Earth is sacred for these it's in the list of special ingredients for what make earth habitable for life that that is a really strange thing though that if you can contain it somehow and incredibly strong pipe yes but it won't freeze yes it went first what is the temperature variant though guy like is there a number well that's why doesn't matter my pipes don't freeze when it Just Hits 30 degrees outside that's not when you hear it it freezes when it gets really low when you crack yeah then it'll just it'll break the copper like it's paper now here it like it's like it's not now.
Tyson,on the flip side of that try this at home take an ice cube that's like at 30 degrees okay how would you measure that pull out an ice cube and just because they'll be at near zero fahrenheit if you if you have a good freezer just pull out and leave it on the counter put it on a wooden cutting board okay and just let it sit there for like 10 minutes and it's temperature will come up they'll be a point where it hasn't melted yet but you can take it and squeeze the Ice Cube and you can force it to melt by squeezing it because you're forcing it into a smaller volume that it currently contains and the only way you can accomplish that is if the ice turns to water then it will occupy a smaller volume so the active squeezing ice can actually melt it so if you had some sort of a pipe that could physically construct like something that had threads a tent that could wind down to a smaller size you can stick a cylinder of ice in it and you can slowly crank it down yes yes it would melt yes you.
Interviewer,melt if you had some machine that squeezed I see ya and the colder the ice is the hardest the more you hard it would be for you to squeeze it and to accomplish that so it's sort of fun with ice if I can what else you can do this is a harder experiment to do if you take us a mesh like a screen mesh that's to be sort of wider openings than a screen door would so what would this be like a fence like a chain link fence and behold it horizontally and get a big block of ice and just place it on top a block of ice is heavy what will happen is the ice the weight of the ice will melt the ice in the contact points of the chain itself because it's feeling that pressure to squeezed into a smaller volume but by the time it melt the ice has now passed through the grate and it will refreeze on the other side so you can actually pass a block of ice through a chain-link fence.
Tyson,just by pushing it yeah it's pretty it's pretty cool it's a slow experiment but it's wrong.
Interviewer,I mean depends on the temperature the I can hide and how and how much it weighs right because the pressure is what this is why this is why you can I skate why can you skate on ice because the edge of the blade is very high pressure on the ice and its melting a bead of water you actually gliding on water when you're skating you're not skating on slippery ice really yes I thought you were just cutting the ice with the blade well so the blade have you ever seen a sharpened blade it's not just flat there's actually a concave cross section to it so each Edge the left Edge in the right Edge is is basically a knife edge mmm okay not quite as sharp as a knife but it's you can feel how it's sharp so that when you lean on that edge either your inner Edge or outer edge your entire body weight is being held up on this on a very narrow surface area of the blade so the pressure is Extreme it's like you know thousand pounds per square inch you don't weigh a.
Tyson,pounds but you're not skating on a square inch right so you you do the math on that and what you can have is you will skate and you're actually what makes it so slippery on ice skates is because you're moving on a bead of water that freezes right behind you as you go past it dude.
Interviewer,yeah so it's possible for ice to be so cold you can't really skate on it because even that pressure is not enough to melt it how cold it have to be that I last I did a calculation was really cold like tens of degrees below zero how does dry ice work oh it's just Frozen carbon dioxide that's all so here's the difference here's a difference you have a block of Frozen H2O and a block of Frozen CO2 so there they are it turns out the air pressure on Earth is high enough at sea level is high enough to allow the ice to melt and sustain a liquid state.
Tyson,okay let's CO2 under air pressure normal air pressure it wants to melt but it can't sustain a liquid and it goes straight to gas.
Interviewer,if we had much higher air pressure you could you could have CO2 melt and have liquid CO2.
Tyson,so now Watch What Happens so so kind of blow your mind again this is just this is really good stuff okay it's good like physical chemistry so here you go so watch it happens so what happens if I reduce the air pressure okay well the transition from Ice to water is still the same it's not affected but the boiling point is affected as you know cooking times have to be adjusted on mountain tops because when you boil water is not 212 degrees depending on the height of the mountain there's less air pressing down that that's preventing it from boiling okay the boiling point is not some absolute fact about the water it has to do with what the air pressure is sitting above it you have extremely high air pressure water has to go too much higher temperature before it boils so our so the boiling point of water this reported in all textbooks is at sea level at one atmospheric pressure.
Interviewer,that's how you get 212 degrees if you start reducing the atmospheric pressure it's 210 degrees 205 degrees 200 degrees hundred ninety degrees hundred eighty degrees $180 oh yes and so that's not as hot as 212° she got to cook the food longer all cooking times are increased for this reason so now watch I'm not done with you uh let's keep reducing the air pressure okay theoretical or like possible on Earth no no like Himalayas yeah but or take it up you can Ascend in some kind of copter or some kind of device okay our air balloon or whatever but I'm saying you can do this experiment in a laboratory okay okay you keep reducing the air pressure boiling point keeps dropping it's hard in 70 degrees hundred fifty a hundred twenty a hundred degrees Fahrenheit 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
Tyson,50 degrees Fahrenheit 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Interviewer,32 degrees Fahrenheit.
Tyson,holy shit what happens the ice melts and becomes water the water evaporates and become Steam and all of that's happening at 32 degrees there is an atmospheric pressure for which water ice and steam coexist and it's called the triple point of water and all ingredients have a triple point.
Interviewer,wow what is the a Mars mission Mars is very close to the triple point of water so you can have you can have a simultaneous bath in certain regions of Mars a simultaneous bath because the air pressure so low is like one one-hundredth earth's air pressure it's very very low so you know a place where a pot of water ice cubes and steam are coming out all at once it's at the triple point so so so here's the lesson here is we live life in our world at one atmospheric pressure at one room temperature atmospheric pressure and we Define what is normal based on that life experience based on how how our senses interact with that environment but the actual universe.
Tyson,is far freakier than what we that what our senses are exposed our five senses are exposed to on Earth.
Interviewer,what did you think about Elon musk's idea about nuking the poles of Mars in order to make it warmer yeah so some of these are kind of pie in the sky ideas right but let's let's get to what he's trying to get at what you want to do is you want to introduce warmth you want to block the ozone the you want to block the ultraviolet so that you can protect organic life alright so we have an ozone layer it's the three oxygen atoms 03 and oxygen ozone likes ultraviolet light so ultraviolet light comes from the sun it gets eaten by ozone gets eaten and when you do that the ultraviolet light doesn't make it to Earth surface so even though they sell where wears sunscreen and sunblock 45 yes that's for the 1% of the ultraviolet to gets through the atmosphere if you're above the atmosphere you are fried so the because ultraviolet.
Tyson,is highly hostile to organic molecules and what we're made of as life so you want to protect you want to give life a chance so you want to not only heat Mars you want to find a way to block the ultraviolet light coming from the Sun so you need some mechanism if not ozone where it just live underground for example okay and so so I don't think we should think of the idea as a literal thing but just it's a general principle of what you want to accomplish on Mars in doing so you want to warm it you want to protect what could be the future of biochemistry and then you see it and you and then you wait you want to wait too long you want it so to speed it up if you could and then you terraform Mars SpaceX has I visited him a couple of times he's he's got a mug you can buy there then it has Mars on it okay and then you put hot liquid in it and Mars turns to a narrable.
Interviewer,blue green marble that's all so yes very good and it doesn't tell you that when you so I got a Mars mug you know and you show it off and oh my gosh what did that happen is an earth mug but it doesn't look like Earth there's a lot of people that go on special teams so we think there's a lot of water that was once on Mars which is a certainty and we think it's just sitting Below in a permafrost so you wouldn't have to bring water to Mars by the way in the really distant future you can just redirect a comment and get all the water you need but how far distance that the comments everywhere dude we're in a shooting gallery yeah that's not what I asked oh how far away do you think it is before we could redirect far away in time yes okay sorry.
Tyson,we know how to do it but there's no real incentive so there's no engineering funded engineering plan to do it but we don't have to do it on paper we know how to do it in a conceivable way oh yeah so they're so first of all it happens with or without us because we are in the shooting path of countless thousands of asteroids and comets so what you would do is you'd find one that's headed close to us anyway in the seventh orbit down the line or the hundredth orbit down the line and then you lie deflect it in such a way that it would then collide with Mars or even Earth if you wanted if we're if needed some more fresh water yeah I heard that there's a possibility they State the problem is if something really big that would fill Lakes worth of it that collided with Earth that would just be bad for life on Earth because it's a spontaneous deposit of energy that can change the climate and do what you want to do that on a planet that you're trying to terraform isn't that the speculation.
Interviewer,water got here in the first place so if the jury still out on that there's their tags in the oceans in the water molecule that tell you that the water must have come from more than one source so that's what's confusing things we want to be a simple thing at all came by comets or it all came from inside the earth who volcanoes volcanoes emit.
Tyson,lakes and historically lakes and oceans worth of water just out of there out of their calderas so so the problem is what as we say in science overdetermined this plenty of comments to have delivered all the water there's plenty of water that could have come out of out of volcanoes to give us all the so but in the oceans it's clearly a mixture and so the final word is still out on that what do you think about what's going on Hawaii now with the protesting of the building of this largest and latest Telescope yes the the TMT Thirty meter telescope which would be the largest ever by far of any kind of telescope the history of astronomy is one where bigger telescopes become bigger buckets to collect light that's the only telescopes today are the same as telescopes when they were invented they're just bigger right the principle behind them is bigger because what they're doing is simple all you're trying to do is get as much light as possible and.
Interviewer,we're like you get the dimmer is the object you can detect and the farther away is the object you can see and so for every generation of new large telescopes that have been built it is it has increased and deepened our understanding of our place in the universe so that's just the that's the background the proposal is for a 30-meter telescope largest-ever on the big island of Hawaii and Monica where there are other telescopes there another that's where the cactus right yeah I think sci-fi it's with a cactus I think they they cited it in a place that sort of tucked behind most sight lines to it but that's not so much what's important here it's that the native Hawaiians from what I've read view the mountain as a sacred place and so to put a telescope yet another telescope there becomes sort of invasion of sacred land.
Tyson,and so so yeah it's it's a there's a standoff last I looked I mean people protesting in the streets and there's some native Hawaiians who Embrace this because it means jobs high quality jobs engineering jobs we got to build it got to maintain it there's an entire supportive infrastructure for that that means jobs and it's done in collaboration with the University of Hawaii and the all the other telescopes are partnered with the University of Hawaii where people are educated there and so so at the end of the day you have to ask well how are you going to make decisions going forward are you make them democratically then you take a vote or you do you want the natives to to be the deciders of their own fate and is that Democratic okay so the natives vote okay or is it the few people who are protesting do they win the day I mean it's complicated and it's very.
Interviewer,Barry there's a lot of nuanced issues going on there there's there's a branch of thinking that the United States government and and normal Municipal leaders have no authority over it there's some who claim that this is native Hawaiian property that does not belong to any Municipal entity of the US government so therefore even state representatives have no say right so there's a lot going on there okay but if I were to weigh in this is how I would do so okay I would say first.
Tyson,I think what should happen is.
Interviewer,I don't know if they even have if the infrastructure I don't know how the system is set up but if they could set it up this way if the mountain is viewed as Sacred by the natives.
Tyson,the native should have entire say of what happens to the mountain okay that's how I think that should be so now what you want to make sure is that whatever decision gets made and voted upon by the natives that is fully informed you are you don't want to vote being misinformed or under-informed in any election let alone whether you're voting for a telescope on your sacred Mountain okay otherwise you're voting out of nowhere right yeah unit you're influencing your future based on partial information and decisions based on partial information are bad decisions no matter what okay so I would say hold a vote with the natives and make sure everybody's fully informed and here's a bit of information I just want to add to the information okay you know what we do as astrophysicists we study the universe.
Interviewer,rather passively at that we sit there at the end of a telescope and wait for light to reach us it's not a petri dish where we stir it or heated or freeze it or crack it or we just kind of there communing with the cosmos.
Tyson,my PhD thesis was significantly fed by data that I obtained from mountaintops at telescopes I got my data from mountains in Chile Senator Lolo and it employed all the natives of the natives the local local guilty that's another telescope that so there's all these telescopes that all have specific access points to the universe they're not all asking the same questions right and so it's the collection of all the data that gives us the complete understanding what we think is a complete understanding of the universe so what we do is try to understand our place in the universe and all I'm going to say is that if you have power over what happens on that mountain and it's sacred to you.
Interviewer,because.
Tyson,whatever that is.
Interviewer,it is something important to you and your sense of your understanding of your place in this world.
Tyson,that's would be spiritual significance I can tell you that what we learn as astrophysicists from those mountaintops.
Interviewer,gives us a deeper understanding of who and what we are in this universe.
Tyson,so I would say that whatever is your concept of God.
Interviewer,be it the the creator of the universe the spirit energy that pervades all of space and time whatever is your concept the discoveries of astrophysicists bring you closer to it.
Tyson,I get your perspective let me be the opposing view they feel I'm not trying to know I know you know this is just information couldn't this is information and I walk out of the room and then y'all vote right I'm not you know we believe in democracy here and majority rules that's it that's kind of a good thing it's kind of worked right but if it's not majority rules I don't know how they're going to make decision but let's say invent a future where the the natives vote if they vote I wanted to make sure they heard what I just said and and now take control of your own fate I just don't think they care I think they've decided that that's a Sacred Space and they don't want anybody doing anything to it then dozens their decision them you think that's okay I don't I don't judge.
Interviewer,people's but if you wanted to make a convincing appeal to them no all I would say what I just told you that's it that is all I would tell them and when they vote I want them to understand that fact I could take it one step further and say.
Tyson,mountain tops because of the access they give astrophysicist and and by proxy us all to the universe.
Interviewer,our sacred places to scientist.
Tyson,okay now it's not sacred in a religious sense but it's sacred in a in terms of a pathway.
Interviewer,to knowing and understanding who and what we are in this universe we place great value on that so but it's not our land it's with you know it was a specifically these things have Europeans didn't come to Hawaii and find find Legions of scientists are conducting experiments okay they found native peoples governing themselves so so that's that the consequence if it gets voted down and that's permanent and there's no way around that.
Tyson,that telescope is still going to be built it just won't be built in Hawaii well where will it be built though they have to be built on mountaintops yeah so there are the foundation issue right yeah you want to be above you know schmutzy clouds and Haze and and you want to dry environment so there's less rain I went to the clouds are you visited yeah very good the CAC more than 10 years ago the first time and it was I got very fortunate it was a night where the moon was not out yes one is not that it was drummers weird thing yeah you want the darkest Sky you can we were worried as we were driving up there that was really cloudy but we drove through the clouds and we've got to the top and we got to the observatory and it was the most amazing without telescopes just we there was telescopes there but without telescopes it was the most amazing view of the sky at ever seen in my life and it changed my perspective of our place in the universe it looked like we were on a spaceship.
Interviewer,like we were flying through the universe because of the diffused Lighting in on the big island because it's all set up so that it doesn't ruin what they're trying to accomplish at the CAC when you tomorrow for collections in the wrong place it's amazing not only that if there was a moon out and you did Ascend up through the clouds the Moonlight illuminates the clouds and you are an island in the middle of white cotton yeah and you're not even connected to the Earth it's what you imagine Mount Olympus would have been I've been out there for them when that happens to it the God's up there and there's kind of this their place it's there so so so yes and so any my brethren my fellow astrophysicist who have also observed from mountaintops by the way it's becoming a lost art because when I know it's not lost but becoming something we don't do anymore something called service observing will you put in your observing programme and it's Hannah to a technician at the telescope who point the telescope gets the data.
Tyson,and sends it back to you so the Next Generation doesn't have the experience that my generation did because it was a pilgrimage to the top of the mountain and you converted your life's path you converted your life schedule to become nocturnal and in so doing you you know this is the journey was long enough because you're in the middle of nowhere now you got to go nocturnal and by the time you're ready for this you are communing with the cosmos it is you the detector the telescope and the universe.
Interviewer,"and there's an eerie silence up there too because you don't hear anything the hum of maybe the the drop the motor of the telescope but that's it and so all I'm saying is if they choose to not have it the tell us we will go somewhere else one of them is the Canary Islands these are also volcanic hilltops not as high as as Mount aquella there's at 14,000 feet by the way I should have checked at what temperature water boils at the top of Mount of K we could have rounded that story out but I think it's around a hundred eighty degrees actually I think I did actually calculate it one time but anyhow so so you'd find a Mountaintop and we'll put it somewhere else and the data won't be as good but that'll be a consequence of it and none of that will go to Hawaii how do you think that's going to get resolved though if you had to guess I don't know I."
Tyson,I just don't know a lot of people are against it including Jason Momoa Aquaman's against it oh uh-huh he was out there protesting yeah and so we can get celebrity types to put the weight of their name behind it it magnifies the cause of others even if they're in the minority and so I like I said I think natives should hasn't been totally know who all the natives are is it is there some listings so that they can all vote for this one thing you would want people voting who are not native if you're voting on whether it's so sacred you don't want to put a telescope there you'd want people who have a an indigenous indigenous.
Interviewer,concern for what goes on there and Indigenous and reference to Hawaii is relative everyone listen to the word indigenous is relative yeah especially with Hawaii because it means we re only indigenous people are black people in Africa okay a really good life human life began in Africa you everyone else travel to where they were so so native it's you set a time frame to declare what is native and what's not yeah and the native in its in its simplest form is are you born there so I'm a native New Yorker I'm born there but I wasn't the original settler there I would my species did not form on Manhattan Island so everybody travel to where they are they just got there before the Europeans and so that has become the definition of indigenous art Were You There When the Europeans landed then your indigenous but to other life forms on that on that rock on that Hawaii's are a volcanic.
Tyson,like it's a volcanic archipelago you know how that happens by the way you have all these multiple volcanoes in our string and a string you ever wonder why.
Interviewer,how that happens sure you did wonder what you did you know why oh because there's a hot spot beneath Earth's crust it just sitting there okay and when you beneath the earth's crust stuff doesn't move around the way it does on Earth's crust Earth's crust shifts okay so that hotspot gurgles up makes a volcano then the hot spot goes dormant but the cot that the Shelf still drifts you still have continental drift so it drifts then hotspot says time for me to gurgle again it grows up now you get another volcano and then it goes dormant that volcano goes dormant it's shifts you get another one any time you see an a chain of islands jet guarantee they're made by volcanoes over enough time for continental drift to a shifted the plates over the hot spot of Earth's mantle so do you think what their concern with is the eventual spoiling of this beautiful natural resource that slowly but surely people are putting up houses there and.
Tyson,developments and all these different things and then the scientists are saying we need this sacred land because we're going to put a volcano and they're like look there's already a there's already a I mean we're going to put a telescope there's already a telescope up here enough you think that's what it is they're trying to Halt the progress of civilization or it mean maybe progress is a bad word the expansion of civilization yeah I mean thick let's go back what did Teddy Roosevelt to he said we got to preserve these lands yeah because they're beautiful and by the way he said that after he shot all these elephants and tigers lions and tigers and bears yeah I mean I hail from a museum the American Museum of Natural History would where he's the patron saint of that museum what happened was he realizes how important this land is and how beautiful it is and he is the he's the patron saint of the national park system so so that's the secular version of sacred Rite we don't say it's sacred but we've all decided as a.
Interviewer,Unity that we care about these lands and you don't want to drill on it you don't want to put housing was it Lyndon Johnson's wife Lady Bird Johnson who said our freeways that were so carefully building after the second world war the Eisenhower freeway project okay hi you know the interstate system is this is our country we want to keep it beautiful so certain stretches over there are no Billboards Billboards would you know would change your relationship to Nature so certain stretches of Interstate or secularly sacred if if I can say that so I remember visiting visiting Australia and there's the the famous rock in the out in the outback the oh lure Hulu please help me get the I get my correct pronunciation of this old luru and it said it's I'm told it's one.
Tyson,coherent geologic rock it's not just an assembly of rocks and so I don't know enough about the geology of it but I do know that the Australian Aborigines eluru and okay iconic Red Rock look at that cool thing okay so that is one sort of geologic thing and and climbers want to climb it but that's cute it's miles in circumference okay so we visited it I've rented a bicycle with my wife and kids and we rode around it okay so now that is sacred to the local indigenous peoples.
Interviewer,so they don't want you to climb on it well I'm a rock climber right you know what do you care I'm not going to ruin it I'm not going to they don't want you to climb on it and I try to think to myself is there a counterpart to this that would sort of wake up a Westerner to say I get it all right now suppose some people from some natives from Alaska or from the some tribes from Africa or some Aborigines came up from these remote places of the world walked up to the Vatican and said we want to climb the walls of this Vatican just for sport what would we say we want to climb the walls of st. Paul's Cathedral in downtown London what would you say no yeah but all those comprable me these we went we want to repel down the Tower of Big Ben.
Tyson,you're going to say no get the fuck are you would say no.
Interviewer,these are important structures to us now are you going to say or the equivalent well we built those yeah the natives didn't build the rock right exactly okay it depends on how important that detail is to you all I'm saying is on the level of weeks say this is sacred you say that is sacred and now you're going to have different rules for who's climbing what I think it'll Fort they force you to take pause so here's an argument in full in like supporting what you're saying look at what's going on with the Himalayas I mean it's the human shit that they had they leave behind there well the climate so disturbing yeah the climbers yeah it's horrible it's really horrible I mean there's tons of it tons of human waste okay so what you do there is if it's still not a problem that people are climbing it's that they're leaving waste you don't stop the climbers you tax them at some level so that now you have clean up Crews that come up after them yeah but it's.
Tyson,no it's incredible the bring anything back good so there you go you're all Maxim you make it worth it all right but you understand like they were here to leave the bodies up there right you know that they can't protect her that's what I heard well why you think they could bring tons of shit when they can't even bring bodies here's what I'm saying when they invented Cars and Cars were killing people in the street because people don't know how to cross the street they don't know where to cross the street people don't know how to stop the cars they say will cars are actually a pretty useful thing do we ban cars know we make stoplights oh people across our we make crosswalks oh let's put Lanes to the cars don't hit each other and let's make air bags so that you don't fly through the windshield all right so there are ways around problems if you value the thing that it is that you want to do so people even crap up there you make them bring it back or you develop a system that enables the stuff to come back no matter what and if you can't do that you don't want it messed up then cancel the whole.
Interviewer,we didn't cancel cars we got really Innovative about having kids a big difference between cars and human shit that's left in the side of the mountain I think the real problem too is I think if you credible you mountain climbing and you want to keep doing it then you solve the problem this would Engineers do that's all they do but he's working problem having over been able to bring those bodies back because of the physical limitations of the human body it's barely you barely have enough juice to climb it's so thin they are so thin it's so dangerous the energy drawn you is so long leave those bodies there so we have to human shit that you're talking about or is that all there's no that you're talking about the fact that humans were there that we got we're not very clean about our presence that's what you're talking about well we're just being human we have to go when you gotta go you gotta go when you gotta go up there you just open up the hatch and let her rip down the side of a mountain and the resulting you know in the space station they.
Tyson,your urine and your your crap congratulations to them because that put Engineers on the problem when I mean my chocolate they extract all the water from it and then what's left is highly dried and he drank their role yeah yeah water is water its water molecule that's the thing about by the way by the way every Grant water people's pee is in it that's correct yes but you got to buy a bottle of water here hey vampy okay this has Napoleon's penis yes yes there are more molecules of water in this bottle then there are bottles of water this volume of water in all the world's oceans so in other words if you drank this and peed it out.
Interviewer,okay you have enough molecules in your pee and your sweat and then and in the the moisture that you exhale all that goes back into the environment scattering into all sources of water or the world and there's enough of those molecules to occupy every half liter of water that that covers the surface of this Earth so that given enough time you scoop a cup of water out of there I don't even care if you filter it the H2O is still there that is water that has passed through the kidneys of Abraham Lincoln mmm Genghis Khan.
Tyson,Joan of Arc mmm.
Interviewer,Socrates Plato know Jesus can I get a bottle of juice and trying to get my Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure list going here okay you just ruined it but yes Jesus would be included in that so would Socrates yes so that is the by the way the same is true with breaths of air there are more molecules of air in Every Breath You Take then there are breaths of air in all the atmosphere of the Earth.
Tyson,so when you exhale there's enough of those molecules to scatter and the the air currents will do this to scatter into every breath of air that is inhale so when you take a breath of air you have molecules of air that went through the lungs of Jesus.
Interviewer,we're all connected and there's no way around it and the water that we have is the water that we have right we drink it we P it yeah because the the atmosphere comes down as rain yeah and the rain is the important difference is a lot most of the water on Earth is salt water that you can't drink rise a limited amount that's fresh water how much of a by the way all the Glaciers are fresh water because that's its frozen rain right frozen rain here's something that no one talks about when the glaciers melt where does the water go.
Tyson,just tell me you know the answer just.
Interviewer,and the ocean back in the ocean okay so but this is now non salty water going into the ocean so you're mixing fresh water with brackish water and they occupy different places in the vertical profile of the ocean and because salt water is heavier than fresh water so it's freshwater occupies the top right it's not as salty as the water at the below and there are circulations in the ocean not only up and down you know Northern latitudes Southern latitude like the Gulf Stream there's also circulation top to bottom and the combinations of all these circulations create the stability of the ocean if you disrupt that oh my gosh they're animal two fishes that can't live anymore where they used to be because the salt level is different and so some animals might go extinct some weather patterns will change because the ocean affects climate so these are this is why climate modeling is so.
Tyson,cold yet so complicated just because a lot of variables that show up.
Interviewer,why can't we take the salt out of the water you can't it just takes energy you can do it but why isn't that been being done on you can you have to ask you will you he was paying for the energy where you get the energy from it's an energy thing but would think that would be very valuable me think about how many people blind valuable enough yet that's the point well is it that it's pure money dude it's just money you can ask what does it cost to ship a bot up a half pint of water from Fiji okay whatever hell is the square bottle that you buy in Fiji Water is it Fiji right yeah Fiji Water what does it cost to to bottle that in Fiji ship it here relative to.
Tyson,desalinating the ocean.
Interviewer,"it's cheaper to ship like the Fiji they'll be a day when that's not the case and future Wars are going to be fought over who has access to fresh water and the value of water will go up and by the way the value of water and space is $10,000 a pound."
Tyson,"so if you if you last you a comet and he say this is a lot of fresh water yeah you could I guess you can bring it back down to Earth but that's expensive you're better off selling it to NASA for nine thousand dollars a pound because it costs them $10,000 a pound to put water into orbit see you better off keeping it up there and somehow or another yeah and so if you harness water in space you're better off trading in space with it then bringing it back down to a planetary surface at the moment the economics favor that what is the desalination process so it's simple you just evaporate the water it's basically a still it's it's it's a Distillery right so here's here's a pocket of water with that's highly salty and you just heat it the H2O evaporates leaving sodium chloride behind and at the ends you get this salt deposit at the bottom of your dish at the bottom of your vessel."
Interviewer,oh wait a minute what happens to lakes that used to be there that salty Lakes they used to be there that aren't there's a salt deposit that's the source of our modern-day salt this is I tweeted the other day that all table salt is is all table salt is sea salt it just came from long-buried prehistoric evaporated sees so salt mines and I was I was told by some geologist I had I had a narrow and narrow usage of the word mind I think for mine I think of a hole in the ground but mining operations include surface operations as well so they're surface lakes that have that have evaporated and you get salt from that as well as the minds that you would dig down deep below so that whole all that is a mining operation my tweet only reference the buried ones but that's all but it's all from evaporated water so all from evaporate it's all sea salt is the point now nuclear power plants rely on Steam right isn't that part of our weekly I just finished.
Tyson,just to finish the point so you evaporate the water and the salt left maybe you might want to use that make some sea salt out of it table salt and that evaporated water condenses out over here and that is distilled water right now you might want to mineralize it so it tastes good because distilled water doesn't taste good places not really healthy to drink it as you probably know you drink distilled water it goes into equilibrium with your minerals sucking minerals out of you so it has the same minerality that your body does and then you pee it out and you'll systemically drain yourself of important electrolytes yeah so generally the water that you would say tastes good and you enjoy has some mineral bits some some kind of mineral minerals in it now nuclear power plants don't they the process is using that nuclear energy to create steam to operate turbines and yeah basically all of our electricity day comes from essentially the most electricity is coming from.
Interviewer,turbines that convert steam to electricity so sorry so you heat water the water makes steam the steam turns a turbine and the Turning turbine generates electricity isn't it so so it's a matter of where do you get the energy to boil the water that's what it comes out is it Cole is it oil is it is it nukes is it wind is it Hydro all of this if you get a hydro plant oh by the way then a hydro plant they don't have to make Steam because they have the water the water pressure at the base of the dam moves through the turbines in terms of turbines in a make electricity they don't have to eat anything.
Tyson,because they have the water pressure to do that anyway that is also solar power by the way because the sun evaporated ocean water the water lifts up becomes a cloud the cloud moves over ground over the land the cloud rains into the lake that is above the dam.
Interviewer,so the energy that got the water up there in the first place is all solar so you should think of hydroelectric and solar as well as wind energy because wind is the uneven unequal heating of are on Earth surface and that creates air currents that's also solar power is also this also learn isn't it conceivable that you could come up with a combination of desalination and power plant where you're using the heat to combine you know to make the turbines move and then you steam it off and that's where you get the water from that would be a good s an interesting idea and I don't know how much that's been thought about what you're saying is I'm making steam anyway yeah so why don't I do it suck all the water out yeah and make that's a nice to for one kind of thing three-for-one you get salt that it sold out the other side it's salt gets all you fresh water fresh water and you generate electricity yeah to do patent it no I'm as free for anybody who wants it could take that and run with it.
Tyson,I have high hopes for tidal energy because there are certain places on Earth with tides are very powerful and they're very and you just put some paddles in there and you'd sort of and it and it works both ways when the water comes in and out is it Battery Technology that's the reason why La isn't completely dependent upon solar because it seems like this is the spot to do it like it never rains I mean if it rains here 50 days a year that's crazy or any Desert right and we're next door to the Mojave Desert right so so one of the problems is by the way the deserts are are generally localized to certain latitudes on Earth it's because of General circulation on Earth so the air pockets on Earth there's a lot going on earth air moves in a lot of ways but there's a there's an overriding circulation of air that has are sort of rising up at the equator.
Interviewer,imagine a cylindrical movement of air that the Gerdes the Earth okay so just above the equator you have a cylinder rotating where you have are rising and just below the equator you have a cylinder rotating the opposite way so that there is still rising at the equator okay so are rise at the equator is unstable it makes clouds the equator is one is the cloudiest place on Earth practically one of the cloudiest places well how about the other side of those cylinders where the air descends.
Tyson,okay okay when you have descending are you don't make clouds.
Interviewer,well how big is the cylinder it's about 30 degrees of latitude wide.
Tyson,so you're rainiest places on Earth are at the equator that's where you get the Amazon rainforest in the lake and your driest places on Earth or 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south.
Interviewer,because the cylindrical movements of are have descending are there so the Mojave Desert the Sahara Desert the Gobi desert they're all around 30 degrees north latitude.
Tyson,so this so we live on the surface of the Earth where there are forces operating that are so much bigger than us that we don't even think about it why is it an India would be a desert because it's right in that zone where it not for the seasonal monsoons it doesn't rain much in India except when it's monsoon season so the monsoon is sort of the exception to what would otherwise happen there and that's why when loves the monsoon if they hate it but they love it it cools the whether they get sources water there it is so the ask you the question again okay I got it sorry oh so so so Battery Technology like what why is until a completely solar it should be it's not.
Interviewer,some of it is cost La is soaked are heavy and plus you know there's a Lamborghini passing me at 20 miles an hour on the 405 that this is the land of wasted horsepower right so any place that has a lot of sunlight should be thriving on solar panels and you guys aren't I looked around very few have very few homes have solar panels and I don't fully understand that you could if you did that then you'd run your own run off your own power you can do this yeah you can do the major Difficult by the way and so so yeah I mean the price might have to come down a little further you don't really see the full price of oil it's it's subsidized in ways that are not obvious to us you know we built the roads with our taxes so that car companies could sell you a car that you drove on the road that they that was built for them if they have to build all their own roads the price of gas to go in the car would have been much higher.
Tyson,the price of your car would have been at all that would have been much higher if the car companies how to do it what I'm saying is I make a product and I want you to use it but there's no roads oh I convinced you to build the road so you can buy my car and drive on that road that's a weird way of looking at say but it's a way to sit full cost accounting it's full cost accounting what is the cost of coal it's how many people died of lung disease of Naman ultra-microscopic silikov oh Kendall County osis okay that's the longest word in the in the Random House dictionary is that yeah that's basically black long yes basically black like you can break it up the new mono ultra-microscopic silikov oh with the silicates in can oh Connie osis so there's all medical it's except stapled together to make that word so so what is the cost to their health their death their the air quality asthma the total cost of oil is not what you pay at the gas tank.
Interviewer,it's other things that we shall out that are not realized in the actual cost of that source of energy If You full cost accounted what all this really costs then the solar option would look way better than it does relative to it that's all I'm telling but when you're talking about cars and car manufacturers having to pay for roads isn't that like against France isn't that like restaurants having to pay for toilet paper no restaurants going restaurants have to pay for land that you would park your car on.
Tyson,to go into the restaurant not in New York City but in places where everybody has cars if you don't have valet parking my restaurant will not occupy the entire plot of land I just bought it's going to be some it's going to be 1/4 of that land and all the rest are going to be parking spots I have absorbed the cost of your parking your car in me in my acquisition of that of that real estate for example to make a convenience of people could use your facility correct but I bore that cost as as restaurant or right or maybe I'm renting of course but that's that's how does that relate to someone the car manufacturers being forced to pay for the roads or that they should be that would have been interesting had they because then it would have changed the pricing of everything but why would they be are you going to make a car and no one has a road to drive it on then there's it's what it's your responsibility then you don't have a business but don't you want a car yes so we all agree car.
Interviewer,good they move fast they get you where you want to go right so how do we as a society make it easier for people to get where they want to go well we all chip in and we make roads it's not entirely to before there were cars car nobody's thinking you know I want to go to Chicago tomorrow and I'll be back on Thursday no one is even having that thought before they were email no one's thinking I don't send you an e-mail right these are not thoughts so I'm just talking about all the forces that had to align to make it actually work I'm okay so now what's holding back electric cars well I might not be able to charge it it takes a little too long to charge compared to my other vehicle are there enough Chargers along the way well these were questions that were asked when people got cars have cars and it takes guess is there a gas station oh standard all says we'll put a gas station there because you're buying cars and so it's a whole family of businesses coming together and you're paying for a big part of that it's not just the car you paid for the roads so I'm saying.
Tyson,I'm not complaining about it I'm just describing as a reality I get it I just didn't understand the the comparison to car manufacturers paying for that they say if I make them car and I want you to buy my car I need a road so I'm going to build the road oh wait a minute I convinced you to build a road that's even better oh my gosh I made it a national priority oh it's a security problem we need a we need a military design Interstate System that's what the interstates its military that's why it goes through mountains instead of over them that's why they're long stretches of straight away so you can land an airplane on it that's why they built above the road that's why the surface roads are not the same thing as highways because the highways are not on the surface because they built up why because tanks can drive on them without decomposing the road what's specs did we put this to to the Autobahn the Germans invented the modern highway system they invented the Cloverleaf they invented the off ramps they invented all of that and their armies can move on their roads like it was nobody's business and eyes.
Interviewer,Howard said hey we will get me some of that he comes that's probably not how he said it I'm guessing but he comes old convinces us all that we need to build an internist I got nothing against the interstate system I'm just giving you the foundational facts for it and by the way Interstate System cost as much as going to the Moon about a hundred billion dollars in total cost seems like a bargain compared to how many people use it versus having to watch the moon and it grows the economy that has a lot of a lot of but basically it was sold as a as a security need because if you're at War you need to move materiel and personnel and you might have to land an airplane in an emergency way and so all freeways do this you're gonna crash a plane do it on a freeway.
Tyson,happens yeah but do it because you might land safely and if you don't land safely the road comes to you to get to the hospital don't crash in a forest we can't get to you right can't get emergency vehicles good call yeah you know if you seen this new Porsche has a new electric vehicle that they're about to release in this revolutionary groundbreaking technology what allows from recharge much faster you could charge up to 80% in 20 minutes because it's double the well pull up the information was it wattage or amperage well what just just a couple of things lunch different batteries can't cheat physics so so yes some batteries charge faster than others but what's what really drives the charging speed of battery is the is the voltage over which you charge the battery and it goes as the square of the voltage right so Supercharger so if you charge a an electric car in your.
Interviewer,hundred and 20 volt home electricity it could take 30 hours if you go to 240 volts okay it'll take you know ten hours if you go to 384 volt so you keep going up that drops precipitously and you can get a voltage where the thing will charge in a few a couple hours yeah we have a supercharger here we do yeah we have some set up here for my Tesla so there you go with special yes quickly the s yes yeah cool piholland yeah so you charge it and at most 90 minutes I'll think they call it that anymore I think they aren't the only superchargers know there's the the the Tesla I think they call it a like they have like an S Raven they have anymore no it's not the p100 D that's the that's the heart they don't call it a capacity okay now they I think they have a based on whether it's a single engine or double engine they've simplified things that's a removed all the labels to make it a little Slicker sleeker so did in the Porsche is it just the.
Tyson,up there selling a higher voltage charger to you or is it is the battery so completely different Google 10 interesting things about the new Porsche to I can how do you say that I can that's the Articles reading to them that's cool so my concern is batteries are still kind of 19th century technology yeah you know invented the battery voltage Alexandra Volta that makes sense he's cool yeah voltage voltage results come from him vole yeah all these guys got you know they got famous so that Tesla we got a car named after the guy had a nose a car there's actually a unit of electromagnetism named after Nikola Tesla well yeah it's Weber's per square meter I say so it's a it's like the the density of magnetic field strength within a certain area through through a surface so Betty charge bite inductive plate the.
Interviewer,"wretched Porsche claims it's a Porsche Turbo charging system charges at 350,000 watching kilowatts it 15 minutes eighty percent in just 15 minutes oh that's cool it's not clear how Barry Marshall will prevent battery overheating maybe they won't have a good luck bitch so God could be vaporware but we'll see but what they've already been doing it what but it's game on that's what that means yes game on whether it works or not it's like people Tesla's on notice everybody's on notice yeah oh my gosh I'm going to lose market share because people want to buy an electric car and so you didn't want something that's going to charge fast and that's the number one complaint that most people have over electric car or you find a way to okay so that's one way but another way is you find a way to swap batteries as quickly as it in less time than it takes to fill a tank yeah you know how much time do you stand there with your hand on the nozzle waiting for the gas to go in right so they would have to have a mountain of battery sitting there waiting for people to just come in and take it any worse than a mountain that that it did a than a."
Tyson,one can reservoir tank of gas there's no different what caused that any different probably larger volume right possibly but so what if it's economic you just do it right and you get the batteries all at the bottom of the car and it's going NASCAR you run in pop it up take out the battery put this on your off do you think that's the future why not that's better than charging the battery you don't have a cardia know I do I add as of yeah I do have cars now keep didn't used to I didn't used to so expensive as hell to garage it in New York they just went up the price just went up the big the big price point of that was when did the average cost to garage a car for a month in New York's in Manhattan equal the average cost of a two-bedroom home in the United States and we passed that cost of rent.
Interviewer,yes you have a question or two it was like some $600 a month or something to rent a parking spot to read a parking spot right one spot one spot I'm not sounded every month you can rent a home in many places in the suburbs somewhere for 600 kind of car you drive so I now have a Tesla yeah so I ponied up there expensive by the way sorry yes I have the X so that's my sort of utility vehicle the x is there the SUV a very high acceleration as you know and but yeah I did there's no maintenance on it right there was no oil change there's no you know the only moving part is the what you turn in the wheels with right the no Pistons nothing so you know cars really should have been this a hundred years ago and then we would have had a hundred years of clever engineering to perfect that gives you the documentary who killed the electric car no I haven't but I know about it and I know some of the background story behind it and the electric car was one of the first concerns because electricity was all the rage a hundred years ago what's Electrify the city's this days.
Tyson,this Edison there's test everybody wants to do everything electric and the car had just come out let's do it electric so this was not a New Concept and it's unfortunate that more sort of innovative thinkers hadn't been brought to task on how to perfect the electric car speaking of Tesla and electricity will what did you think about Teslas initial idea that Westinghouse shot down to sort of broadcast electricity so people could just pull it out of the air yes so the people in the Nikola Tesla fan club somehow feel that he got wronged in his life okay and surely some of that is true with regard to Pat his business Acumen and patents and who owns the patent and who does does he have good business sense is he is Savvy or as as sneaky whatever other words you might apply to Edison all right so I get that.
Interviewer,but his contributions to electromagnetism are real and recognized in the world of physics like I said there's a unit of electromagnetism named after him so don't come crying to me say he was not recognized by my people okay he's recognized he had some ideas that were a little out there and out there on a level where.
Tyson,it almost certainly would have not worked and here's why okay electromagnetic energy is communicating between us I see you that's because visible light is reflecting off of your scalp okay to me it's reflecting off of my nose back to you you can ask how much energy is in that will not much it's not much energy in a visible light photons if you stay too long enough you might feel a little warmth from it but no you're not going to drive a car with that energy and not going to run a motor with it okay.
Interviewer,well if what good is it oh you know what we found we can use electromagnetic radio waves which are the lowest form of electromagnetic energy lowest energy level of all over there we can use right away is not to transmit energy that's not the point of it the point is to transmit information and information became what characterized the modern era and that's why in the 1950s and 60s when everyone is imagining flying cars and motorized sidewalks everything is running on energy because they're thinking energy is going to be free in the future but they didn't figure was that information would be free or easy to transmit and to generate and to store and to to delete and whereas the energy that would take to move things and to drive things that would be a problem no one saw that coming nobody saw that coming so.
Tyson,as your photons get higher and higher energy yes you can start doing things with them yet X-rays and gamma rays but that's not what Tesla was referring to he was talking about moving radio waves through the space that would charge things up you can't pack sufficient energy in your radio wave to do anything we need to do mechanically currently current well back then would it be sufficient it might have been something you could have done with your radio waves because the needs were no but that knows no I take that back that was the height of the Industrial Revolution that was the age of the machine the age are the giant turbines radio energy is not touching that well but wasn't it possible that he was considering it for things like radios or light bulbs or household items would it be possible to use that power for that.
Interviewer,so now what so what happens so the radio waves if you had enough power and radio waves to generate a light bulb to power a lightbulb well hat through the air Are you standing in the way of this this energy has Pathways we now send energy through wires because you're not standing in the way of the wire the wire is buried the wire has insulation it would require sort of suspension you want to move it through the air and you want to walk around like no that's not how that works what up but I've heard people moving in our energy through the air to power something that itself could kill you.
Tyson,the energy powering through the moving through the air could kill you unless you you bring a little bit amount and then you store it and then use it later you could do it that way.
Interviewer,sure some sort of batteries yes you need a storage system but you would still probably have some sort of residual effect of having this stuff broadcast through the air and who knows what it would do to human health if you needed that much energy right now the energy to transmit information is so low that it no it has no effect on your health that's why I can pull out my cell phone I'm in a brick with this fake brick is fake brick I'm in a bills rubric that no it's not this it is go touch it I don't believe you go ahead was a real Brooks go touch the bricks man Jesus Christ thinks we got fake bricks who do you think we are.
Tyson,okay oh you thought I was a liar how weird.
Interviewer,now let me be honest so so it's a venir a brick veneer okay so the whole thing I real building so it's not structural brick slice the end up bricks and then they mortar it in and everything real bridge and make it look okay so so we're both right but it's not structural real favor so here I am I'm real fake so we're inside I can put my cell phone and have a phone call yes these are microwaves of a frequency that can penetrate walls send information to my cell phone and I can communicate using information and not have that energy kill me but it's not enough to power the actual it is not enough to power the device correct so anticipate esoteric everyone is thinking he's got the solution to the Future transmission of energy no he doesn't well I don't think anyone saying that but he sent his fans do but back then there were no computers back then there were no television but we did have machines it was the era of the big machine right but I don't think he was insinuating that you could use.
Tyson,don't know what he wanted to factory I don't know what he would have powered with it if not light bulbs and other things you know one thing you brought up that's really interesting you talked about light reflecting off of things you wear that BMW painted a they painted one of their cars vantablack I saw this is the jet black yes I saw my soul and recently lack yeah no light can bounce off of it and so not only can't drive it because people won't be able to see it at night it literally saying like this is just a theoretical be just like what would you want to do you could line it was with the pull of trim edge of it because Mercy I saw one in a parking lot it's fuck it's very bad as she saw one in real life it's that's not what I saw I saw a sports car ocean saw vantablack car they have them I saw a sports car that was it was not exactly the car you have up the I don't know what that is what I saw BMW that they painted vantablack okay well then Advance the black is available on their badass low to the ground sports car and so what I'd know it's not available commercially what do you want me to say I'm saying that for BMW it's not.
Interviewer,it's not something they're off I'm in La you have all your cars here and he said if everything showcase here what I didn't see it in New York I saw it here in La well I'm sure some may be wishing to be a preview maybe somebody else did and I'm just saying BMW if someone did it BMW didn't make it themselves okay someone must have done I mean you can do it it's a real thing vantablack real collar so one of the principles of stealth is that if you send a signal to it it never comes back to you so you have no sort of radar measures of its existence correct but there are two ways you can do that one of them is you cannot reflect back.
Tyson,okay but by absorbing it right okay so jet matte black will absorb it and not reflected back but if there's enough energy coming at it it will heat up because you can't get something for nothing here it'll heat up the skin of that and could be bad for the occupants that's what they said about the article the article about vantablack if you put that in the desert forget it well they were saying even in Los Angeles you are so hot exactly dick so another way to do it is the signal comes to me and I reflected in a direction that is not back to you.
Interviewer,so the B-2 bomber is not only non-reflective back to you it takes the signal and reflects it and double bounces it so that all your energy gets sent in other directions and not back to you so it doesn't then keep the energy that was sent to it so that's another way to do it another there's another stealth which was featured in one of the recent not recent four years ago James Bond movies where light that comes at it the light that's behind it.
Tyson,goes around it coherently and continues to come towards you so that you think you're seeing what's behind it and it's not there you are seeing what's behind it but the path of that light went around the vessel and continued on its way to you.
Interviewer,so you think you're just seeing the grass in the tree but there's a car sitting right there.
Tyson,you know about this technology no yeah right now it exists only for very look up stealth light Ray stealth and so the material has to be able to know what is behind it you saying small objects only so not only with that only works in one site line whereas if you needed functional stealth everybody looking at it should every path every sight line to it should be able to see what's behind it on the other side of that side of the way it reflects things but yeah it's it carries the light beam around it and sends it out the other side you have to find it yeah.
Interviewer,you know what you have is you just look like a solid block and a person was looking at it and you see their eye out the other side it's really freaky.
Tyson,it's a future of stealth what are you thoughts on digital privacy what do you mean well like phones here like phones like you ever talk to someone about something and then you see it on your Google feed you see ads yeah so we don't I mean I haven't researched this but my wife tell her we were once gifted one of these you know what do you call those things that you talk to oh yeah whatever the Google one is is that Alexa was home Google at home no Alexis is Amazon price so it's Google at home and she said don't turn that on I said why not because they'll be listening and I didn't believe her at first and then I started hearing stories and so so I don't have one but it's not coz I know that it's listening or not well yeah substantiated there's being actual setup they've apologized for actual human contractors listening into conversations that people have had.
Interviewer,having sex having arguments like it's real yeah that seems like it should be a problem so what's your question to me what am I well for it or my old one well what's your question no my question is one of the things that you're getting out of their ability to scan things is there tailoring things to your liking like you know your phone tells you it's 22 minutes until you get home I get it and I'm like bitch how do you know where I live exactly I didn't tell you where I live I got here it is and I'm just old-fashioned about this okay I'm get off my lawn about this yeah I'm the old man in a rocking chair on the porch saying goodbye Sonny get off my lawn but you're also scientist okay but I don't want to okay I wear multiple hats I'm also Dad I'm also a husband I got all these hats for all those things in this particular case I'm old man and my old man sensibility is.
Tyson,if you track what I shop at a store what I buy in a store.
Interviewer,and then send me coupons based on what you think I'm going to buy next based on what I've bought before which is kind of the same thing you're describing you have denied me the chance of stumbling upon something that I never thought of buying.
Tyson,and that takes away my freedoms and I don't want that how they denied you the chance of stumbling upon something different it's not diabolical it's just in the Casual flow of Life I'll give an example I walk into a wine shop is it can I help you.
Interviewer,and I say.
Tyson,if you help me find what I'm looking for it's a guarantee that I will never find what I'm not looking for.
Interviewer,and I'll end up spending less money in your wine shop.
Tyson,that's a weird way I look it's the art of browsing dude you're old enough to remember when I got to look up this word in a dictionary and you get through six other words oh I never knew that we're let me read that you learn other words en route to the word you're targeting I understand okay wouldn't that that is how I feel and that's how I think about my interaction with this world I'd like the randomness the randomness of it enriches my life and if you're going to advertise to me because you think you know who I am maybe you do.
Interviewer,But ultimately end up spending less money because it's the diversity of how I think and what I buy and what I think of buying and how I buy it and how much money I spend that is the richness of the life I lead you're trying to channel me into some product something that fulfills a what do you call it when they have the study whether you're going to buy something or not the survey that no no the the table of people do you like this product or not focus group am I just a focus group to you if I am you don't know me.
Tyson,and I want to experience this world by stepping where I've never stepped before and buying something I've never thought of buying and if you know my previous habits you're assuming I'm going to stay that way for the rest of my life and maybe most people do and maybe I might do that but if I do is because I chose to not because you have decided that that's how I should be well don't you think that just seem annoying I'm sorry are you getting a little excited sorry don't you think they're just doing that because they think it would be effective to advertising that way so if you go Googling new Nikes and then as you're looking at something in the Google ad pops up and it's for new Nikes I said hey Neil I know you were looking at these boys we sorry maybe I just need a little nudge I mean it's not I don't think that's that diabolical.
Interviewer,I'm the old man on the porch I'm saying the Next Generation might feel completely different steam I say I love it they know exactly what I want you heard about the case where they were the I read this I haven't read verified it but it's completely plausible it was a teenage girl who was Googling pregnancy tests because maybe she got pregnant okay and the fact that she had searched pregnancy test she got coupons in the mail for baby products.
Tyson,her parents had one of the wide what is this.
Interviewer,she got outed that's a little weird yeah but it's the kind of thing that can happen that seems that seems intrusive certainly the second pregnancy it's no in every way no be don't tell me it's not intrusive because you want to buy 90 being you physical things that's not just something that appears on your Google feed you can cook a glance over what's the difference between send you mail to your mailbox and filling your advertising space in front of your face with product with only one other people can see it I walk by your computer I can see it don't look yeah I guess I'm arguing in principle rather than in detail okay well let me take the CounterPoint in on the positive side what they're doing in terms of particularly Google in terms of you're driving right and in terms of using of Google Maps and documenting the history of all these.
Tyson,driving and especially with things like ways which they acquired is they've developed a much more efficient product than Apple which would Apple does the Apple Maps they shred everything you do this they do they did they all where you've been and where you're going that's correct but Apple Maps sucks so you have to because they don't have enough data they don't have nearly the amount of data Google has Billy what is Google giving you that Apple Maps isn't.
Interviewer,they're telling you you're 22 minutes from home you time for you to drive home what do you value in that well yes and also it's not a map wait hold on to their programs far better I can ask it how long it'll take me to go somewhere rather than it knowing what my what my daytime schedule looks like and then coming in like you said how do you know bitch you know I had that same reaction as you did and I said I wonder what's causing this it's a little creepy and again I'm the old man syndrome some ten-year-old kid that's only ever known this and becomes 15 and 20 that is life to them right why would they even maybe they're not going to complain about it but I'm the old man on the porch but do you know I'm saying get off my lawn sort of intrusiveness or at the very least this connection that you have to these devices and that they have to your patterns and your information is seems inevitable.
Tyson,that doesn't mean I have to welcome me with open arms but I agree it's inevitable I agree plus you have security cameras everywhere everybody knows where you are if the KGB had access to people the way we in the during the Cold War the way modern the United States has access to us.
Interviewer,we would say oh my gosh you have taken away your country's freedoms where the free leaders of the Free World and you guys have imprisoned your entire population oh my gosh.
Tyson,the KGB would give their right arm to have the monitoring devices that are actively in Pratt place here in the United States today mmm we know where you are we know how long you stayed there we have records of it we know what street you were walking on we don't necessarily moderate but we can dig it up if we have to and with facial recognition I can track you wherever you are I feel like there was just a facial recognition I use it now it doesn't have I'm wearing if I'm wearing a hat or sunglasses it still knows who the hell I am yeah.
Interviewer,yeah it relies on so many points you get so many points of cheekbones and nose I separations and everything I think ratios of numbers are highly powerful probes of the structure in the form of things to say you know Fibonacci Sequence right that could be in there if you have a Fibonacci head it doesn't everybody's face not fibonacci's I think is a little overplayed fibonacci's little overplay it especially once you get a nose job huh so it's gonna cheat you can find it in nature and sales in this beautiful but you've overlooked all the places where it doesn't show up in nature so appear so many times it doesn't appear in more places than it does appear right but in a lot of living things yeah living fence behind cones yeah pineapples there's a lot of sunflower seeds it's very or sunflowers flowers for yeah really weird isn't it.
Tyson,yeah that it I mean it's just this random I mean they're not random but this well if the next thing you do depends on the previous two things you did you get the Fibonacci series I mean that's often the case with say you know think of things in your life you do where the third thing you do depends on you having done the previous two things in this exactly the same way that's not everything in your life but you can surely find some things to do that hmm I think it was Camden New Jersey where they had such a crisis that such that was so Random no it's not because you're talking about surveillance yeah Camden New Jersey had such a crisis of funding that I think there was a brief period of time at least I don't know if it's changed where they literally didn't have a police force and one of their Solutions was to put surveillance cameras everywhere and the idea was to sort of try to capture all the shit that was going down here it is the surveillance city of Camden New Jersey community of six years ago.
Interviewer,crime and the intrusive tools they're using in hopes of stopping it right yeah this was I mean I don't remember reading a question after this happening it's let me take away your freedoms for your own safety mmm yeah this is this is a well-known you know Benjamin Franklin wrote about it which is famous Benjamin Franklin quote about security and freedom yeah he who abandons freedom for security deserves neither or is getting neither or something yeah so so this is not it yet they that can give up essential Liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither Liberty nor safety.
Tyson,those who sacrifice liberty for safety for security deserve neither he who would trade Liberty for some temporary security deserves neither Liberty that he's got all combinations yeah and he want to cover that bitch all permutations on that one this is what I mean I don't wanna leave any room for misquoting he understood that so your your security you give up some security for privacy I think yes and I don't know if it's a well-known place where that should be drawn and you can actually get an entire generation born into a state where they think that's normal mmm we all know think it's normal you have to show ID to walk into an office building well my gosh what would that look like during the Cold War you have to show you in the United States you have to show your papers just to walk into a building well they're also changing oh my gosh he's system where if you don't want to travel with a passport you're going to have to have a new for to go through the day a federal driver's license federally endorsed driver's license I just went through that last week yeah right.
Interviewer,so when did that go into play when is that going to play out it's for everybody like next year or something it's very soon if you want to travel in a particular way if you don't drive any that doesn't matter fly right we want to fly correct correct and I carry my passport wherever I go so it's not really a problem for me but so carry passport everywhere you go if you want to just jet out of the country yeah that's nice how is your brain wired my would think you know what shape you know if I had four passports then you say do I want to leave the country yeah whoever there anybody in a you know Espionage movie there's somebody who has five passports in a safe setting the head and with the with wads of cash of every currency so so I think I worry that we're sliding towards a state of.
Tyson,total monitoring on the premise that we're all better off for it right and it's like the frog in the heated water we don't feel it day by day but it's happening because we all agree that we can be hand and patted down just to get on an airplane we've all accepted that because of a handful of people a handful of historically handful.
Interviewer,historically handful not even a handful in this moment just historically and for the people we also yes take my luggage x-ray my luggage take away my liquids Pat me down and I'm okay with that well that's a transition and I'm okay with security cameras in the street it was okay in Banks we understood that but now when I exit the bank and I'm in the street when I'm walking and they walking in the park so I don't know I don't know the future of that I really don't know I saw the movie 1984 recently not a very good way of the book is better than the movie and I hate to be the one of the people who say that but I was reminded how you can create an entire state.
Tyson,where everyone is kept in line because somebody is telling you we are fighting this battle out on the front lines I'd forgotten this from the book They're fighting a war on the front lines you never see the war you never hear about the war you know anything about the war other than it exists and you have to do things a certain way in country so that your country can protect itself from these evil people that want to take over and destroy your way of life so everybody's under control some big brother well what they didn't anticipate though was these social media companies would be the guards are The Gatekeepers of your privacy because that's what's interesting is that you voluntarily give them all your information that's not government's rights its Twitter and Facebook Google and all this is all the stuff that we use on a daily basis that has access to everything that you do this almost.
Interviewer,inconceivable to someone outside of this generation that there would be a company that would provide a service and through that service you would give up all Notions of privacy privacy yeah because literally you have a microphone that's listening everywhere you go you have a bug right there you can ground with you I mean I don't remember what you've been you've been pinned bucked right yeah really is you breathe end with a lapel you will get ads for things you talked about and that has been proven so what is that what is it is these passive listening devices that only picking up keywords it's no big deal it's just keywords the frog in the water that's why I'm telling ya so I don't know where it's going to go like I said I'm a little old folk old fogey about that but I think will resolve it you think it should be regulation generally if you have something good and it gets abused you regulate that's the whole point of right that's where here alive today because of Regulation because they're a nefarious people who in control of powerful forces operating on society.
Tyson,would gain at the expense of everyone else and would not be good for the progress of civilization so you regulate okay airlines are regulated so that you don't die all right we have the safest record now ever for commercial airlines American carriers the safest ever look at look at not only how many people have not died relative to when we grew up we grew up through at least one or two planes crashed each year you'd lose me to one of 300 people every year that was like the Baseline number that number is near zero now and way more planes are taking off and Landing that at any time when we were kids so it's a double it's a double progress point for not only the Transportation safety administration but engineering technology and everything we care about we want to fly so you regulate you make sure these are inspected this often.
Interviewer,you don't the pilots don't fly more than this many hours you this get soiled this gets replaced it's one of the triumphs of modern engineering the aerodynamics aerospace engineering as a branch of what we do as civilization is one of the greatest achievements there ever was a great Jamie did you find that stealth stuff found it there are cars that have black velvet no no no car this is be a laboratory laboratory okay.
Tyson,look at laboratory stealth light something try that yeah yeah I found lamps or cloaks that people wear that sort of seems like video oh yeah yeah that seems like fucker evening yeah there's a lot of blood in Harry Potter the the the was a cloak that they wear the invisibility cloak that would be this principle yeah if it existed within with that there's a bunch of videos of that but it seems like they're just using After Effects like Adobe or something like that Deb fuck with the video rather than create an actual product that because there was a woman in an office that had a blanket and she held up the blanket and you could only see the whole office you wouldn't see the blanket at all you'd see what's behind her behavior she lowered the blanket you can see her and then from the blanket down twice and that just a green screen of the yeah that's what it was I think she was holding up a.
Interviewer,in blanket if I had to guess this might be it still gets stuck martyr out of no no no no sorry sorry no no there's nothing to do with that that's that's the map of dark matter in the universe three dimensional map I've tried to give that a shot no we don't know what it is so don't worry about if you don't understand that but it's too goddamn confusing for me I know it's not confusing at all it's like it's something out there that has 85 percent of the gravity of the universe and we don't know what the hell it is it's not going to be using it's not confusing it's if you don't know what the hell it is it's confusing by Nature okay I have more nuanced definition of confusing confusing is I am confused I don't know how to think dark matter is I don't even know what to think I need something in my head to be confused right dark matter has there's no we don't know what the hell do you anticipate a solution to that or some sort of a sure I want my eyes it in Hawaii I hope I had damned might have been yes telescope had been yeah listen folks it's not the gdt there be the goddamn truth.
Tyson,if the TMT Thirty meter telescope so yes solutions to we you don't know part of the what it is to explore is not knowing what it is that you look at you will find and all these telescopes the launched ones as well as the ground based ones we have enough foresight we're mature enough is a field to know that even though it's designed to look for certain things that were part of the program that you set up for it you want to have a Serendipity mode for it you want to be able to say let's point it in some random Direction and see what shows up without that you could miss something in plain sight if you're only looking for one thing that you think is there extrapolated from what you knew before and the way I think of is you know there's the old saying as the area of our knowledge grows so too does the perimeter of our ignorance hmm.
Interviewer,so as a Terry goes to more places to look over the fence and stare into the abyss of ignorance that awaits you.
Tyson,so dark matter is sitting on the other side of the fence now the way I've heard describes the bonfire of our knowledge grows brighter the area of our ignorance is illuminated.
Interviewer,okay that I had to think about that yeah similar to what I saw and more things are Youngman if the bonfire is your knowledge yeah that's lighting the way as it grows bigger you go wash it you see more stuff you've never you've never noticed before I get that it's the same principle that's a giant one though man 85% savings to the gravity so yeah it and you add that to the dark energy we know what that is either right Dark Matter Dark Energy comprised 95% of everything that's driving the universe so everything we know and love the chemistry the physics the biology life planets stars is 5% of the universe now so we people of theologians and folks say well maybe God is in the other 95% may be okay yeah may God's dark matter will not be crazy well people say that surprise yeah but I don't know why Dark Matter would care about gay people whether yeah well they're not chicks drive cars.
Tyson,yeah yeah depending which religion he ran right yeah all the religions got they're saying wearing but yeah don't you know I'm God what is think I'm Dark Matter yeah we my the way just in in letters from an astrophysics physicist which isn't out yet but again I don't know how the hell you got the book but it's there there's an entire chapter where I am conversing with people who are strongly religious there's a conversation I have in there with Orthodox Jewish person a Muslim multiple fundamentalist Christians and we're talking with the age of the Earth and why and why do we think one way or another and so that's there's a lot of intimate stuff in there that I generally don't go public with but I would did it one on one with those who had written to me about these challenges they were facing in life and they wanted to know what an astrophysicist had to say about it what's the youngest version of how old religious.
Interviewer,"and thanks to the Earth is what's the how was the successful years sick that's question yeah Christian well 000 of all not all Christians by the way no no of all religions I don't know the age college is like a month old I guess I don't know enough about how old all the religions think the universe is right the youngest you're going to get the youngest Universe going to get from a devout Christian is 6,000 years the oldest is around 10,000 and but far away from billions Mormons are a unique one because they think you get your own Planet when you die."
Tyson,yeah and what's going on that what I want my own Planet nobody told me that it's odd how one religious group would would comment on how Preposterous another religious groups comments great are I love that you know I was once I don't know if you know this I was once quoted after I think the Scientology documentary came out on HBO and everybody was talking about Owen clear at least I think that was it and there was a lot of chitchat about it for a couple of weeks and one of the news outlets I forgot who.
Interviewer,called me up and said do I think Scientology should be a religion.
Tyson,classified as a religion as an authentic religion and you can as well why they calling me why well because in Scientology they're aliens and if there's space beings then travels to give up this information oh sorry so that's how I got brought into this conversation because of the sectors of Scientology that involves space beings okay all right so my answer was.
Interviewer,we live in a country that protects the free expression of faith based systems provided they don't subtract from the rights of others so I will not sit here and judge.
Tyson,whether they tens from space exhume Souls from volcanoes at least a third of what I just said is accurate that's from from the Scientology or whether a man born of a woman is the Son of God who died and rose from the dead I'm not going to compare those and judge whether one of them is more authentic than another when they're both founded on belief systems and so in this country belief systems are protected.
Interviewer,and we've all bought into that and so you know the headline was Tyson defense Scientology and of course that's how you get clicks that's was the click bait of my comment wanna get clicks you got to distort a little bit there are some rational people who in the comment thread said that's not what he said of course yeah but isn't it more interesting when they do do that and then inside the actual article itself to give your full quote so people can see the deception the real confusing thing is when they take a chunk of your quote and they will contact you take it out of context which they love to do so you don't I just go to jail for that by the way up so that's interesting so for me I'm an observer of that not a complainer about it so is that how they're doing it okay so maybe I can shape this phrase differently to minimize the chance of that happening in the future minimize the chance of you being lied about correct so for me that is a landscape there's some land mines here there is some trap doors here there is something and so for me.
Tyson,one who communicates on that landscape that's just information for me hmm to navigate it slightly more nimbly in the fryer Hmm got it interesting gravity is one thing that I want to hook up on gravity yeah I'm always hooked up on gravity because as you should be well since we've talked last I've been reading a lot about and one of the things that confuses me the most is that we don't really understand what gravity is we know its effects we can measure them we know how to measure them we know what that mass is involved but we don't really know what gravity is there's a similar question in the book but they got a little more philosophical than you just did but they both lean philosophical it's science can describe how gravity works but can they describe why it works can we so this is the how why yeah duality.
Interviewer,and allow me to just answer it from a how y point of view then we can apply it to gravity okay after I say that in science if we can describe how something works and predict its future Behavior we claim to understand it and we move on you can ask deeper question about it why is there gravity what is the meaning what is the purpose and go ahead but I'm good with what I've done and I can land a spacecraft on Mars inside of a crater in a hole in one using my understanding of gravity so I'm pretty good with it okay.
Tyson,so I'm not distracted by the more philosophical side of that why does it work okay Einstein so Newton was deeply puzzled by how you can have something called and which he coined the phrase action at a distance okay he wrote down the equation that worked he wants an equation moon goes around the earth goes on the Sun the moons of Jupiter go around Jupiter he.
Interviewer,accurately described that with his equations of gravity okay he said one day I think we're going to find some way that they're connecting to each other but I don't know what that is right now but I know my equations work he called it spooky it was spooky to him as his word spooky action at a distance all right fast forward three hundred years.
Tyson,300 no fast forward two hundred and fifty two hundred thirty years get to Albert Einstein.
Interviewer,gravity is the curvature of space and time.
Tyson,and you're moving on the curvature of that fabric that's gravity oh my gosh is it even a force then is it even so there's no need to think of it as an action at a distance and in a phrase first uttered by think was John Archibald wheeler a student of Einstein and he learned relativity from John Archibald wheeler effect that's where I met my wife in relativity class and graduate school it's space matter tells space how to curve space tells matter how to move.
Interviewer,it moves on the curvature of space you don't need an action at a distance there is no action it no it can't do anything else but do that.
Tyson,it's like you have a funnel and you take a ball and you roll it on the funnel the ball can only do what that funnel tells it to do and it'll Cirque if you give it a sideways motion it'll start spinning around there's no magic hand coming in there it is following the curvature of its space time continuum.
Interviewer,this construct that you provided for it so now I can describe what gravity is doing I even have a mechanism for it.
Tyson,are you going to still ask me why is there gravity.
Interviewer,is that answered not fulfilling enough to you even in the why Department.
Tyson,because it will why would a particle curve space you can just keep doing that that's fine.
Interviewer,but is there a point where Lee where you'll be satisfied with the answer though that answer is my why.
Tyson,I can say well why did this half liter of water drop off the edge here well it's no longer the forces are imbalanced and it's a no but why did it fall well there's nothing holding up why did there's a point where it's not especially productive to continue to think about the world that way.
Interviewer,because what I'm claiming is answers to the how.
Tyson,when you understand the how enough.
Interviewer,are tantamount to having answered the why question.
Tyson,that's all that's what I'm telling them out in terms of the ability to measure it and accurately use it correct so you can say okay but isn't it you gotta borrow yes we can say well why did you go bald well okay the hair follicles at a when you start in your late 20s and early when you go bald when you start losing your hair probably late twenties early thirties yeah that's the that's common if you have your hair when you're 30 you'll probably have it for the rest of your life that's the how that goes you start losing it up right going up till you're 30 so you can say well the hair follicle begins does not producing the did that keratin whatever we get the explanation then you say well why does the hair follicle stop doing that then you say oh well because the DNA has a pre coded about the hair kind of thing well why does the DNA have the hair well because so right but we know far more about how and why people go bald then we do about what gravity really is correct I'm telling you gravity really is the Curve.
Interviewer,of space and time.
Tyson,that gets us the big bang and everything we've ever known or just space and time but it's also based on mass right it's based on the amount of any concentration of matter and energy and or energy will curve the fabric of space and time and The more mass movement of matter on that fabric of space and time we call gravity.
Interviewer,and I'm good with that okay but you seem a little oddly defensive about something that scientific.
Tyson,no I have to sound good with the but you you are because you kind of Defending it no you can say well defined doesn't matter you need to know why no huh why they're saying no I'm saying why does matter and energy curve the fabric of space and time you can ask that okay why and I don't have an answer if I can say well that's all I'm asking well nobody wants to what I'm telling you is ok you don't need to know what got you to the point where we had to walk to that point where you're why I got on answered I understand that but before we got to that point I answered otherwise but I'm not disputing that good good so what I'm telling you is that I can answer your why question most of the time but then you'll come back to a point where there's a point where there's the why doesn't have the answer so you say why did it falling say there's a force of gravity operating on it why did fall that way because of the curvature of space and time I'm answering your wise I understand then we'll why does matter and energy curve.
Interviewer,space and time okay that's a frontier we're still working on that but that's all I'm asking that's good that's what you are a man of science so you're a person that should probably Embrace wise accept many people ask why questions they're really want to no purpose I'm not asking purpose well then that's something which is furious many other people who ask why questions oh okay I don't think I don't know if this Gap is like Randy why did you bang the table I was angry that purpose there's a purpose behind it that's okay so yeah if you're why is just a curiosity of what's going on that's one thing if you are inquiring about purpose then you get some theological okay because when your theological yeah I'm not then religions give purpose to lightly I'm not doing that right but I just think it's amazing that something that's such a massive part of life on this planet that we stayed glued to the ground because of gravity can you pull up my Instagram account that I only post.
Tyson,you have an Instagram account now as you had a fake one for a while yeah like I told mine actually I know the guy took it over he gave it to you oh do you think I read it yeah no no actually I'm sorry there's one instagram said I right people think this is a real account in it's not can I have it back if it's an account that's an impostor and followers don't know it it's illegal right so so there's there's one that says fan of Neil Tyson yeah and that's a different one okay that's the guy I know so I only post arthouse photos Okay that I've taken most of which I've taken so just scroll down and look for Muscle Beach there it is click on that okay so here's my cat go to my caption Go full screen on that and my cat okay for most of our life on Earth we either resist or succumb to the force of gravity at Muscle Beach gravity losses every time.
Interviewer,that's not true I was proud of that caption you know you call me out on that caption that's nonsense gravity never loses gravity doesn't even have like little tiny losses it's not like there's a war gravity losses about those just listening to this so I was at I was in Venice California and the sun was setting behind some guy who's doing who was doing hand-pressed hand presses suspended up on this chin-up bar right and it was really it so it was cool he was silhouetted there's a palm tree there's the beach he's there gravity's going to beat that motherfucker let me tell you eventually but while he is it while he's there he's conquering gravity are you getting too old you haven't conquered gravity lately no I work out all the time I'm not buying it he conquered shit he's pulling Rank and outside work out and you don't because I see your knowledge Man Billy well.
Tyson,when I've talked to other astrophysicists and science where we let me ask are these conversations supposed to have like a theme or purpose or is it just you sit there and just whatever comes your head you send my way you and me yeah well clearly it's just whatever comes my head I don't know you say you don't do that okay that's just episode number to my success is that a threat thing about all the different people that have our yeah of course it's like impossible of course Fighters and scientists and Scholars and crackpots is like a bunch of different people coming through here man I can't have any agenda all right I mean that's probably the only reason why this thing is it's successful as it is but that's a weird one for people that this one thing that is so powerful but what is oh gravity that's a weird one for people yeah I mean it seems like you're frustrated by all the various questions no like no you seem a little little.
Interviewer,they're my real quick because I find that I thought you were taking your why to ultimately mean no no purpose if it's just why I'm claiming that many responses to how are also responses to a why hmm that that's that's the point I'm making and I don't like splitting definitions well ultimately understand gravity I think we do that's why we can land things on Mars well we understand we do what that's why your cell phone gets time from GPS satellites that is pre corrected for Einstein's general theory of relativity because they're in a different gravitational field than you in orbit then you are on Earth surface and we got this again angry yeah we got Stein is triumphing we're running short on time here so I set you something that I wanted to ask you what sent you an email did you get that email I did I did he's about a black hole that landed in a mysterious place in our understandings yes yeah so let me let me.
Tyson,give that I'll give the the the sort of Reader's Digest version of this okay okay.
Interviewer,there are black holes that are TJ me they're black holes that are formed at the consequence of the death of stars okay okay and we think we understand the formation of stars well enough to say well stars born with this much mass and it'll lose certain amount of mass over so I called Stars lose Mass because there's so much pressure and so much energy coming out of carries particles with it so they lose Mass the sun is losing mass as we speak it's called the solar wind so everybody loses Mass out there the question is at what rate are you losing mass is it a lot compared to your total mass is it small so very high mass stars are not especially stable objects they remain stars for a hundred thousand at most a million years and they'll explode and become a supernova if you're more massive than that they will not explode because the gravity is so strong that it cannot explode against the strength.
Tyson,the gravity and it collapses into a black hole so we expect black holes to have slightly less Mass somewhat less mass than the most massive stars that we know how to make so if you have a hundred times the mass of the sun star it will lose half its mass over its life and you have a black hole that's 30 times the mass of the Sun or 50 times a man sits on fine put a pin in that in the centers of galaxies there are supermassive black holes.
Interviewer,hundreds of thousands millions times the mass of the Sun and we call their supermassive and their black holes we call them super massive black holes because that's how we roll as astrophysicists all right well could you have black holes somewhere in the middle of these two extremes we do not know a phenomenon that will give you a black hole that's in between that will birth a black hole that's in between these two these two categories you can make a black hole that eats its way there.
Tyson,fine but we don't know how to make one and we think we my colleagues who've done this think they've discovered a black hole that is sitting in this sort of Netherworld where there's no evidence that it ate to become that massive and we don't know how to explain it by the formation and death of stars and is nowhere near the supermassive black hole in the center of the Galaxy so it is the frontier of research at this moment so it's just a newly discovered type of black hole and it's in a mash regime that this physically impossible you know headlines we're reading the headline now black hole shock the show me the the where this appears Express so this is a British I think they're British this anyhow it's a news Digest for science so black hole shock Theory swirl around the discovery of a physically impossible black hole so scientists don't use the word impossible unless.
Interviewer,sits violating a known law of physics so I bet that was a edited editors title and I don't have a problem I don't mind a little bit of sensationalism there you can say it is a black hole that comes from and if it comes from an object it is an object we know nothing about and have yet to discover we're not going to say it's an impossible object mmm every time we point the telescope to the universe we find something that we never predicted or understood and it adds to the knowledge base already have whenever they do discover things and then it becomes what we know and understand like the supermassive black holes at the center of every Galaxy that was a fairly recent discovery in terms of it was kind of surprised because we saw the centers of galaxies were behaving really weirdly things stars were moving faster than they should have given how much gravity was tugging on them and we said dude something's got to be there.
Tyson,and it's got to be really small because we're tracking Stars really close to the middle well if it was made of ordinary matter how big it would have had to be really really big so this has to be really really small in order for this to happen the only thing we know that could fill that small volume and have that much gravity is a black hole so suspected for a long time it was confirmed that as a common thing by the Hubble telescope and first photographed by this recent result in the Galaxy m87 Messier 87 is what it's that's the name of the Galaxy and you can determine how big the black hole is based on the size of the Galaxy we can determine the mass of the black hole by how fast stars are moving at the distance they are from it so in other words so so we're Earth orbiting the Sun and we have a certain speed we're going about forgot how the what 18 miles per second I think that's the number 30 kilometers a second that's our speed around that's a speed around the Sun that's pretty fast okay.
Interviewer,if the sun had more mass.
Tyson,instantly that speed is not enough to maintain our orbit it will start spiraling in towards it if the sun had less mass that speed is too high to be in this orbit it'll take it to a sorry it's too fast to maintain this orbit it'll climb us out to a higher orbit slow us down and we'll be in a higher orbit with a slower speed so in other words for any object.
Interviewer,at any distance there's only one speed you can maintain and have a stable orbit around it so when we see stars orbiting something in the center of the Galaxy it is a straightforward Astro 102 equation to calculate how much mass the thing is orbiting and you get the mass and you can't see it it's small it's a black hole.
Tyson,and that ladies and gentlemen is the end of the podcast this book will be available when someone comes out in in in October 1st week of October I'm very proud of this book it's my most heartfelt thing that I've ever done well when it comes out I will take a photograph and put it up on the Instagram and the Twitter not everybody know about yeah and it's it's a it also has letters from people in prison a person who just learned that they were had terminal cancer I mean there's a lot of people reaching out responding to letters yes it's me respond and their letters I can't fit all of their letters some are very long tones but most of the their letters in there and all of my correspondences in there so it's my most heartfelt contribution to this universe and StarTalk is still a pot still going still go start talk with Pump It Up and 50 episodes and a television show yes so would but we can see if we can have a new season we don't know yet that's to be announced but we're going through is always a podcast and I we got a.

Tyson,Thank you.
Interviewer,"All right. I don't want to play Scrooge here, but make us all get excited about this tonight. Why should we care?"
Tyson,"Well, it hasn't happened for 60,000 years. So no one was alive today who was alive back then, so why not take advantage of it? But really, Mars is close to earth every couple of years. It's just that now it's kind of setting a record and people like records. So I'll take any excuse I can get to have people look up, especially city people."
Interviewer,Let's talk about the folks who really aren't terribly interested in science and space. Make them care. What is it that they should find most fascinating about what they hopefully see tonight.
Tyson,"Because when they look at Mars, when they find Mars which, by the way, is the brightest object in the night sky. It's not as bright as the moon, of course, but there's nothing else as bright as Mars tonight and for the rest of this weekend and the week after that and the week after that."
Interviewer,"Well, let's talk little bit about astronomy for dummies here. Can most people actually see Mars tonight with a naked eye, or do you need something more?"
Tyson,"Yes, your eyes are your best telescope for the moment. And you just look Mars is opposite the sun. So sun sets in the West. Go look in the East about an hour later and the only bright thing that's going to be there is Mars. Now as long as you don't live near an airport..."
Interviewer,"Which might obscure your vision, or you live in New York City where the lights block out everything."
Tyson,"You might think that you're seeing an airplane because it's bright enough. But if just sort of hovers there and doesn't go in for a landing, it's Mars."
Interviewer,What are you going to see if you look through binoculars?
Tyson,"Binoculars you will get a better view tiny little opera glasses you'll get a much better view of it and you'll see the intense color, the very deep, amber, almost reddish color of Mars. The Romans knew this and, hence, it's the god of war, the color of blood."
Interviewer,You're going to see that with a high-powered binocular?
Tyson,"Very high powered, or, better, even a moderate-powered telescope. This is kind of an entry level telescope here. They get bigger, but with telescopes you will be able to see the ice caps. And we have ice caps."
Interviewer,"Finally tonight, a lot of questions raised in this NASA report, what some describe as a scathing report on the leadership at NASA and a lot of debate about whether you can ever convince the American public it's worth exploring Mars."
Tyson,"Well, I can tell you this"
Interviewer,Can I touch that?
Tyson,"Oh yes, sure, sure."
Interviewer,Wow.
Tyson,Now you've touched Mars. This is from our collection at the American Museum.
Interviewer,I didn't know I was going to have such an exciting ride today.
Tyson,"Yes. Not many people get to touch a Martian meteorite. I think this will go on display in our new meteorite hole (ph) opening up (UNINTELLIGIBLE) in about a month. But you should know that there's this came from Mars. There are bacteria that we know that could survive a trip through space. And we think Mars might have had life before Earth did, and maybe Earth life was seeded by Martian life."
Interviewer,"So you and I are Martians, basically, you're saying."
Tyson,Martian descendants.
Interviewer,OK. Thank you for the lesson.
Tyson,"Oh, it was a pleasure."
Interviewer,"And next time you decide to hold a class nationwide, we will all join you, Neil DeGrasse Tyson."
Tyson,Just keep looking up.
Interviewer,Very exciting. We'll be looking up as well tonight.
Tyson,Thank you.
Interviewer,"All right. I don't want to play Scrooge here, but make us all get excited about this tonight. Why should we care?"

Interviewer,"And next time you decide to hold a class nationwide, we will all join you, Neil DeGrasse Tyson."
Tyson,Just keep looking up.
Interviewer,Very exciting. We'll be looking up as well tonight.
Tyson,"I once showed an image of the asteroid that took out the dinosaurs striking Earth. You see pterodactyls flying in the atmosphere, a Tyrannosaurus rex down on the ground; it's all beautifully painted. Someone in the front row suddenly asked, ""Is that an actual photograph?"" I was just ready to give up at that point and go home everything I'd lived for was for naught haha."
Interviewer,"But most questions, are they fairly intelligent?"
Tyson,"Yes, that particular one stands alone. Others, even if they might at first sound like not good questions, I try to turn into good answers. There is always a place I can take someone's curiosity and land where they end up enlightened when we're done. That's my challenge as an educator. No one is dumb who is curious. The people who don't ask questions remain clueless throughout their lives."
Interviewer,You do have a great way of making complicated science easy for the average person. Were you born that way?
Tyson,"Maybe it isn't really that complex to begin with hahaha. The first time I ever explained something to someone in any important way was eighth grade. We were learning matrices in math class. It seemed so simple to me how to use and manipulate them. But I also remembered not understanding them initially. So when I saw others struggling, I thought, ""Maybe they are not thinking about it in the same pathways I am."" I realized that there are pathways of thought that might not be obvious to some people, and when you learn of them you can make acquiring knowledge much easier. Then I realized that the more ways I thought about how I knew things, the more useful that could be to others still struggling. In other words, there is a difference between those who learn something instantly, and those who struggle. I don't know that the first group would be as useful in teaching others."
Interviewer,"There is debate about whether a manned mission should go back to the moon first, then Mars or go directly to Mars, as the unmanned Curiosity rover just did. Your thoughts?"
Tyson,"Destinations distract from the conversation of what should be happening. ""Where should we go first?"" implies that space is a sequence of priorities rather than access being the priority itself. Yes, NASA is underfunded, but I will not prioritize spending in an underfunded budget. And as long as NASA is underfunded, it implies that space is a luxury item in the spending on national priorities. I don't think it's a luxury item in fact, I think it's fundamental to many things at the top of the list of our economic health. My goal would be to have the country build a fleet of launch vehicles that can take us anywhere we want the moon, Mars, asteroids, the moons of other planets for whatever the need is at the time, whether mining, touristic, militaristic, scientific or security because an asteroid is headed our way. We didn't build the interstate system to connect New York to Los Angeles because the West Coast was a priority. No, we webbed the highways so people can go to multiple places and invent ways of doing things not thought of by the persons building the roads. Highways build capacity into your country; it's the creativity of citizenry that exploits it. So we should be able go to all places in space at the same time by whatever means the needs and urges of the sectors choose."
Interviewer,We love it.
Tyson,"We chatted about UAPs a few weeks ago, yes."
Interviewer,"Yes, sir."
Tyson,"So, we should make I should make a few obvious first points, that there has been inequality and hunger and poor and racism and all these problems. All that long predates anybody`s attempt to fly in space."
Interviewer,We have your tweet. That`s wild.
Tyson,"It will reach twice the height of the elevation that his rocket will attain, just to put that in context."
Interviewer,"Well, let`s talk about that. Let`s talk about that part."
Tyson,Yes.
Interviewer,"You`re getting us exactly to that next larger question, because new things are often attacked by virtue of being novel, and not for any substantive reason."
Tyson,"Well, if it becomes a huge tourist industry, then there`s value. All right, it`s an economic a previously under-realized and underexploited way you might spend your vacation. OK?"
Interviewer,Yes.
Tyson,"But when everybody gets it, the product is actually better and much cheaper."
Interviewer,They`re a lot smaller now.
Tyson,Yes.
Interviewer,"Well, so then let`s talk public/private."
Tyson,"Well, OK, so that happened with aviation, OK? Private enterprise led aviation."
Interviewer,"Beautifully put, politically so."
Tyson,"Actually, just for the record..."
Interviewer,Got you.
Tyson,... Earth is in space. And we`re all on Earth.
Interviewer,"Dude, wait a minute. Whoa."
Tyson,Deal with it.
Interviewer,We`re in space. Man.
Tyson,Yes.
Interviewer,"All right, see, you always end with just one more explosion."
Tyson,"Yes, the night sky they see when they go up to the high altitude..."
Interviewer,Yes.
Tyson,... you can wait until sunset and see the same sky.
Interviewer,Respect. Respect.
Tyson,Just thought I would throw that in there.
Interviewer,"Dollar, dollar bills, you all."
Tyson,"Good to see you again, Ari."
Interviewer,"It's true, nothing in the book. We've strayed now far from the topic of your book. But since I have you here and you're a science person, I'm going to ask you to science for me a little bit."
Tyson,"I'm happy to opine on this. This only matters because today we segregate nearly all sports by gender. Otherwise, why do we even give a  what someone identifies with? We live in a free country, and with consenting adults and people's free expression of who and what they are."
Interviewer,"Now, on an adult level I agree with you. But I think it does matter what we teach children."
Tyson,"That's what I'm saying. So there's the matrix of what you are biologically, how you express yourself, who you choose as a sexual partner. If we actually live in a free country as we tell ourselves, people's freedom to behave in any of those ways should not concern you at all. Nor are they requiring that you behave that way. Okay, this is for their own freedoms because we live in a free country."
Interviewer,The WNBA won't be in business for very long if that's the case.
Tyson,"It would just be, you'd have to find some way to compete people against each other, if you still care that sports is an interesting activity."
Interviewer,I guess the area where it does come up in a non-sports area.
Tyson,"Yea, tell me, because I don't know."
Interviewer,"So, you talk in your book about the education of children and teaching children about science. Right now, children are being taught about the quote unquote ""gender spectrum,"" which is not scientifically based. That is a theory-based idea."
Tyson,"No, wait, wait, wait, hold on. People express themselves on a spectrum, so you learn that."
Interviewer,"That's a social point, not a scientific point. Meaning, we express ourselves based in different languages. Is that something we teach in a science class, or is that something that you teach when you're teaching a language?"
Tyson,"So, whether the fact that people want to express themselves on a spectrum, on a gender spectrum, whether that fact is something you want to put in a sociology class or in a science class, maybe that remains to be determined. But it is a real fact about real society."
Interviewer,"Well of course, nobody's denying that people  identify how they want to identify. So, the question is, What is the relationship of that to biology? The argument is made that trans women are women, for example, and what that seems to mean is that trans women are identical to women. Now, if people want to say trans women are not biological women, obviously that is the case. But people don't seem to want to say that, although that is obviously scientifically true. Trans women are not biological women. Biological women are biological women."
Tyson,Oh! I didn't realize how loudly it got announced.
Interviewer,"If I found out about it, it must have been loud."
Tyson,Part of me just wants to stay home and keep working rather than collecting an award.
Interviewer,"Not a bad thing to be given an award for spreading knowledge, considering the strain of anti-intellectualism in American culture."
Tyson,I don't think of what I do as spreading knowledge. The phrase You're lecturing me is never a compliment. So I realized that's not what I should be doing if I have any interest in compelling people to become scientifically literate.
Interviewer,What's your secret?
Tyson,"I've found that no one complains about pop culture being a source of someone lecturing to them. If someone's telling you about Kim Kardashian, you're not going to accuse them of lecturing to you. If I can explore an intersection between pop culture and science literacy, then it generally will not come across as a lecture. You're surfing a wave already created by a pop-culture force. During the Super Bowl, one of my tweets was A 50-yard field goal, in the University of Phoenix Stadium, deflects about one-third inch to the right due to the earth's rotation. Now, we've all seen field goals that just hit the post and bounce out, so the rotation of the earth prevented a goal! Everyone is interested in the Super Bowl and long field goals, and I judged that there would be deep curiosity in the fact that the rotation of the earth could affect the outcome of a game."
Interviewer,"A third of an inch? That seems like a dramatic effect, actually."
Tyson,There are other stadiums where it would be half an inch. It depends on the angle of the stadium relative to the longitude.
Interviewer,Did you put any money on the game?
Tyson,"I don't bet on things I can't control. . . . Actually, I enjoy roulette."
Interviewer,Why roulette?
Tyson,"It's the purest of random. If I'm ever walking through a casino, the roulette will call to me and I'll bet on prime numbers just for fun."
Interviewer,I love a good prime number.
Tyson,Who doesn't love a good prime number?
Interviewer,"This morning, I finished watching an interview that Stephen Colbert conducted with you. You conversed about religion. I really want to believe in a soul. Is there some essence?"
Tyson,"Well, we live in a free country, which allows you to believe what you want. Because you think that something is true does not require that it is objectively true. The value of science concerning itself with objective truths is that we can make decisions and statements that affect everyone, which is why legislation really should be based on objective truths, not what is going on in your head.In my memoir, I've written that when I die I want to be buried so that the energy content of my body will not go to the air or to space, which is of no use to any other life form at all. I would like my energy to be returned to the flora and fauna upon which I have dined my entire life. And so if you want to call that energy your soul, okay, but it's in a very different form at that point. It's being shared with other animals and plants. Generally when people think of a soul, they think of their identity existing without the corporeal body and then still retaining some sense of yourself. There is no evidence that that happens. But for belief, evidence doesn't matter."
Interviewer,That's what faith is.
Tyson,"Here's something that intrigues me: If you have faith, you believe regardless of the evidence, yet if there's ever evidence to support faith, everyone goes to it and points to it."
Interviewer,A tortilla that resembles Jesus!
Tyson,Everyone goes to it.
Interviewer,People will always want evidence. A random universe is a frightening universe for most people. It's terror.
Tyson,Doesn't have to be.
Interviewer,Did you grow up religious? Was there a point in time when you consciously moved away from a tradition or were you always a freethinking guy?
Tyson,"I was raised Catholic. But if someone says I was raised in some religion, that's insufficient information to actually know what was going on. The real question is Was the religion in the household? The answer is no. Important decisions in the household were executed rationally and secularly. So as a result, the foundations of my reasoning derive not from religion but from the rational analysis of circumstances.Today, waiting for the train, I stepped into the sunlight to warm up, and because I'm coming to eat lunch with you, I'm thinking: What an amazing thing that there is this star and I can literally feel it warming me.There are two ways you can receive energy from your environment: One is molecules bumping against you. That's the air. The other is radiative energy. That's what you're feeling from the sun. When they say Get out of the sun, out of the heat, the air is the same temperature; it's just you're exposed to sunlight."
Interviewer,Nature is wonderful and terrifying at the same time.
Tyson,"Nature is not here to keep you alive. It has just as many ways to kill you as it does to sustain you. And if you cherry-pick this fact, you are left thinking that earth is some haven for life, but 96, 97 percent of all species that ever lived on earth are now extinct from the actions of the earth itself and an occasional asteroid to stir the pot."
Interviewer,"When I was a kid, Pluto was a planet. I feel bad for Pluto."
Tyson,"The problem is not whether Pluto is a planet. The problem is the enumeration of the planets. There are nine planets. What is the name of the fifth planet? There's the false feeling that the memorized sequence from the sun is actually science, but it's not. If instead we had taught the solar system as Well, you have these rocky objects that orbit the sun. Some are what we call asteroids, some are called Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. And there are these icy things that orbit the sun. We have comets. We have Pluto. We have some moons. If you later learn that Pluto was reassigned to ice bodies, you'd say, Well, that's great! That's how it should be. It's better to understand something than to memorize something."
Interviewer,It's hard to see an overall arc of human existence bending toward anything except doom.
Tyson,"I see people saying, My gosh, what's happening to the world? Consider that between 1939 and 1945 an average of 1,000 human beings were killed per hour. Humans killing humans. Is there anything you're going to say today that rivals that? There was a day when the Ferguson trial would've only been local news. This kind of perspective allows me to be a little more hopeful about the world than other people."
Interviewer,I'm 62 now. Maybe it's my own existential dread.
Tyson,Your mortality is descending on you. I take to heart a line from Desiderata.
Interviewer,"I remember the song. You are the universe,."
Tyson,"You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees or the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it's clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. One of the other lines I take to heart is Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. So, I used to dance. And when I was dancing, I wasn't writing books, giving lectures, raising a family. While I enjoy watching dance, there is no part of me that says, Gee, I wish I were still dancing."
Interviewer,What about wrestling?
Tyson,I thoroughly enjoy watching wrestling.
Interviewer,You left those things behind is what you're saying.
Tyson,"That's not how I think of it. I think of it as that was a chapter I've written, and there are other chapters of my life that I'm writing. Many people who are unhappy are unhappy because there was some point in their past where there was some glory day, and as they get older they're not creating more glory days. They reflect on a time that they will never reach again, and it brings some level of dissatisfaction into their lives. I have circumvented that by simply making incumbent upon myself to always be productive in ways that are consistent with my physical body, my mental state of knowledge, but more important, my presumed growth in wisdom that would come with age. The problem is when people stop writing chapters. There's no reason why you can't keep writing chapters of your life. No matter who you are, no matter your state of education, you can take on hobbies, you can take on activities, you can travel. You can continue to connect with people."
Interviewer,I read the recent National Review story on you. You seem to inspire animus just for being smart.
Tyson,"William F. Buckley Jr. founded the National Review. He was an educated man and you didn't have to agree with him, but you could still see where his views were formulated and how they came about and where he was coming from. You could have an academic, intellectual disagreement with him and still go out with him and have a beer when you were done. It left me wondering what he would say of that article in his magazine. It was clear to me that this article had to create this liberal straw man beyond my actual professional identity so that they could attack this liberal straw man."
Interviewer,At no point that I'm aware of have you aligned yourself with a political position publicly.
Tyson,"If you want to attack someone that way, I'm not your best guy. If Richard Dawkins is speaking, he's speaking about religion. If Al Gore is speaking, he's speaking about climate change. Look at their Twitter feeds. There's a strident posture there, and strident postures can trigger huge followings. And they do and they have. I have fun in my Twitter stream. I'm not trying to convert anybody to anything."
Interviewer,"ou have more than 3 million followers and you're following 40-some people, a large number of whom are comics."
Tyson,"I have a very high respect for professional comedians. What they do astonishes me. You have to be really smart and absorb everything, repackage it, bring it back to the person, and make them laugh at themselves. I can make people laugh during my talks because they didn't come to have me make them laugh. It's added value. So my job is way easier than that of a professional comic.  No coffee, thank you. Never had a relationship with caffeine."
Interviewer,"You're better off for that, I think."
Tyson,"I enjoy hot chocolate every now and then, and if someone smuggled coffee beans back from Brazil, if that's the construct, I'm not going to be antisocial about it."
Interviewer,Nothing in the morning?
Tyson,"I wake up and I go to work. I don't look for the cup of coffee. The universe is enough of a draw for me, to awaken me and have me bound out of bed and go to my office."
Interviewer,"People talk about God the same way. When you speak about the universe, there's an evangelical aspect."
Tyson,"I'm revealing information to people. I'm not creating it. And to the extent that people embrace it, I think they're empowered by it, because any time you have a bigger perspective today than you did yesterday, it's got to be only for the good of your mind, your body, your soul."
Interviewer,"I remember seeing the moon predawn on a road trip when I was a kid and being astonished, frozen by it. I've lost the ability to feel that way."
Tyson,"A sense of wonder. Science literacy is an antidote to that, because there's the manifestation of the forces of nature at work everywhere and at all times. There's the occasional criticism of the scientist that to a poet, a rose is a rose, but to a scientist it's got some Latin genus species name, and on the premise that somehow the scientist has sucked the romance out of the natural world. But what they're not getting is that the scientist has the capacity to see it just as a rose but also has the capacity to see it as these other things. That's an enhancement, not a substitution, of one's appreciation of nature."
Interviewer,"You once wrote, We are not just figuratively but literally made of stardust. If that's not poetry, I'm not sure what poetry is."
Tyson,"The context is I describe the formation of elements and stars: They scatter into the galaxy and then they collapse, and there's gas clouds and dust clouds and they collapse and become a star system. It's a long run of science recitation, and I end it with that line."
Interviewer,Are there science groupies?
Tyson,"At an event recently, there was a woman with the tattoo of my image on her arm. She would count as a groupie, I think. I was never a rocker, so I don't know the full range of behavior that a groupie can express, but I think the difference may be if you're a rocker and a groupie has access to you, they just want to be there. In my case, it's a little different. The most heartfelt encounters I've had are people saying, Because of you I majored in physics. Because of you I took up aerospace engineering, and my life has been a joy ever since. So, yeah, it's a following, but I don't take it lightly. It's an awesome responsibility, as in magnitude."
Interviewer,Do you kill bugs?
Tyson,Do I kill bugs?
Interviewer,"Insects. Do you kill them? If you're swatting a mosquito, do you think twice about stardust?"
Tyson,"I know that if I infiltrated the domicile of practically any other species of animal, they will attack me by whatever means they know. So if I find an insect in my home, it's a goner. I don't capture them in a net and then release them outside. I have no such time or patience for that. But I don't go out of my way to destroy them in their own habitat. They live where they do, I live where I do, and we share this earth. But if you come into my house, don't expect to survive the experience."
Interviewer,Something that I deeply believe in was reinforced by seeing you quoted to this effect: The universe is a hilarious place. I really think that's true.
Tyson,Except the actual quote is I happen to think the universe is a hilarious place. I don't assert opinions. I hardly ever give opinions at all.
Interviewer,I've noticed.
Tyson,Let me say that differently: I don't ever require that someone else share my opinion on anything. I don't care. We live in a free country. Have whatever opinion you want. It's your opinion. I have my opinions. I don't care if you have my opinion.
Interviewer,You've said I don't judge in a number of contexts.
Tyson,I'm very careful about what I say and how I say it.
Interviewer,What do you do for fun?
Tyson,You're presuming that everything we've discussed was not for fun.
Interviewer,It's a self-consciously stupid question. But if you'll humor me: any hobbies? Do you collect watches? Stamps? Build model trains?
Tyson,"I like reading old science books. I like going to shows with my wife, plays, musicals, comedies, dramas, that sort of thing. We enjoy going to restaurants that are slightly more expensive than they probably should be on the hope that there's some bit of culinary magic that we discover and maybe learn how to make for ourselves or that will draw us back. And I like drinking good wine. I have a modest collection of fountain pens. I like using liquid ink."
Interviewer,That's pretty hardcore.
Tyson,"No, it's just old-school."
Interviewer,I know you grew up in the city. Do you have a passionate attachment to any of New York's sports teams?
Tyson,"I did to the New York Knicks in the early '70s. They were a winning team back then. A high school classmate was ball boy for the Knicks, and my shoe size was the same as that of Walt Frazier. He would throw away shoes after every few games. So my guy would pull them out of the trash and bring them outside. For about half a year, I had a supply of sneakers."
Interviewer,Game-worn by Clyde.
Tyson,"They were expensive sneakers, and I liked Pumas."
Interviewer,What size?
Tyson,"Twelve and a half. Clyde wore 13, but when your feet are that large, a half size is not a problem."
Interviewer,The Knicks haven't managed to rekindle your interest?
Tyson,"No, and even if they were winning, I don't know that they would. It was just a moment in time. But I like watching extreme excellence in anything. I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Jordan. Who didn't?"
Interviewer,"I didn't, but only because I was a Cleveland fan. I've since come to recognize his greatness. Back then, I took it personally."
Tyson,"If you have a cosmic perspective, you don't take anything personally."
Interviewer,hey everybody how's it going out there and listen Earl and.
Tyson,m touring I'm doing a lot of touring and one of things I'm doing is I was supposed to be in Toronto at the Ricoh Coliseum on September 29th I'm still going to be in Toronto if I'm not canceling but there is a strike in Toronto there is some sort of a strike at the venue and because of this we had to move to another venue because I didn't want the show to be shut down we moved from the Ricoh Coliseum to what used to be the Air Canada Centre now called the Scotiabank Arena it's it's still a union place but it's under a different Union contract and they are not under strike so.
Interviewer,"cause that we have to move cuz otherwise it is there is a real potential that if they don't resolve the strike by then the show be shut down so the good news is that the show is sold out so if you have tickets the tickets will be honored they're going to email you all the details I just wanted to alert people as many times as possible but the good news is 1,200 extra seats are now going to be available because this is a bigger place okay so that's September 29th at the Formerly Known Air Canada Centre now it's called the Scotiabank Arena that's where the show in Toronto is going to be my friends Joe Rogan. Com for all details and I'll let you guys know the moment that tickets are available cuz right now it is sold out this episode of podcast is brought to you by Black Rifle coffee that is what I'm drinking right now I'm hopped up on it's delicious they make fantastic delicious tasting coffee in their founded by former Special Operations vets who combined their love of coffee with the."
Tyson,the outdoors they deliver badass Rose to order order roast to order coffee delivered right to your doorstep and it guarantees you're getting fresh premium quality coffee with every order in addition to great coffee and gear have a coffee club that makes things very easy no lines no running out just great coffee shipped right to your door every month bullshit free and when you join their coffee Club you actually receive discounts and offers not available to other customers not only does Black Rifle make one hell of a cup of coffee they also give a portion of their sales to Veterans causes so when you choose Black Rifle you choosing a company that supports our vets and serves coffee and culture to those who love America they also have all kinds of other great shit they have gear and hats all kinds of cool stuff but the coffee really is fantastic it's delicious as some of the best coffee I've ever Drank in My stupid face and visit black.
Interviewer,rifle coffee. Com Rogan and you receive 15% off your order that's Black Rifle coffee. Com Rogen and again I can't recommend the coffee Club enough it's it's great to take your mind off at you have to think about it and again you get discounts and offers not available to other customers Black Rifle coffee.

Tyson,vid tell us the best ever joke about Bitcoin I can't tell him I don't want to give away is joke cuz I think he's still doing it but it's amazing back to the show the cash card is a free customizable debit card that you can use at stores or ATM and its link to your cash app balance as if it was a checking account didn't even let you direct deposit your paycheck run to the app so if you're looking for an alternative to traditional Banking and many people are millions of Americans have already started using the cash card and there's never been a Rewards program like boosts with boosts you get into discounts every single time you swipe your cash card at coffee shops Chipotle Shake Shack & Beyond just tap a boost in the app and play with your cash card the cash app again is also be most convenient and inexpensive way to buy sell and withdraw Bitcoin it's the shit and you should check it out download the cash app for free and the app store or the Google Play bark.
Interviewer,and don't forget when you download the cash app enter the reward code Joe Rogan all one word you will receive $5 in the cash app will send $5 to Justin Brands fight for the Forgotten charity haha my guess today is probably the most famous astrophysicist of all time it's right there. Going on a great guy a brilliant man and incredible science educator and just one of my all-time favorite people that I know please give it up for Neil deGrasse Tyson.
Tyson,The Joe Rogan Experience.
Interviewer,why aren't there flying cars.
Tyson,you just jumping right in you don't say hi you don't say how's the wifey how's the wife and kids buddy man how's life how's your boy called it the astrophysics for people in a hurry that's one of the New York Times Best Sellers for 67 weeks that's pretty intense if that's that's a lot for any book much less for a science book and so that tells me while all these Trump books or wafting in and out this is Bob doing like a quart like a cork on the ocean waves as the book of The Moment by the Praises Trump or criticize or criticise ISM come in and off of that list to this tells me that there is this unserved hunger that people have there's a curiosity that this is serving and it's.
Interviewer,astrophysics for people in a hurry that's kind of a that's very purposefully juxtapose it's like neurosurgery in 4 easy steps you know if you saw a book with that title do you have to pick it up under what's going on. To kiss your ass again but I will say this about you and I think it's important you make learning stuff about astrophysics fun and that's what's missing you know it's not that people don't like to be educated that they don't like to learn these don't want to be bored that's a perceptive point because you think of the image we have of let's say you're in a school where most people don't go to college if you're in high school and then last day of school comes what do people do they toss their papers in the air as they run down the steps what's the rock song.
Tyson,attitude must mean the school didn't train you to embrace curiosity that learning was a chore and now the chores are over so I think the education system needs an adjustment forget whether or not you go to college cuz you can spend more years not in school than in school even if you do go to college what you want I think her lifelong Learners lifelong curiosity where once you're trained and and and your curiosity is stimulated we all had his children your children don't need to be talked to be curious they are curious to the point of destruction of whatever it is they touch or what is this egg on the counter what is this glass what is this plate what's under a rock what happens when I pull a leg off a daddy long enough they are experimenting with the world we don't think of it that way but that's what it is they're all.
Interviewer,born scientist and I say this often you spend the first years of a child's life teaching it to walk and talk and you spend the rest of his life tell her to shut up and sit happens if this this is the wrong combination So speaking as an educator I think a missing component of school is at is at the teachers at the curriculum I don't know but when you get out of school you should say to yourself damn I want to learn more it's almost universally accepted to that that's when you're learning ends when you get out of college it's over do you say when the job market shifts you're not ready for work cuz you don't know how to think you don't know how to learn ride-ons the difference in the workplace between the person who gets an assignment is a tie-dye Joey Janet I need you to do this that's not in my job description I'm not trained for this kind of person in the workplace another kind of person but here's a new task I need you to do wow I've never seen that before right.
Tyson,Brian two completely different species of human being and what the world needs more of is like the the second case where you take a new task and you say wow I got to learn how to learn on my own I'll ask people who know more you just you just embrace the act of learning to satisfy your curiosity and I think this book is capturing that in the public something 60 how many weeks is 67 weeks.
Interviewer,so you're alive I can't can I say that you can tell me shyt I could say it okay I can I sync your podcasts a great time as well the success of your podcast in the success of a lot of science podcast up I love of science curious podcast stuff to blow your mind is one that I really enjoy I really love Radiolab they've always got to look really interesting science wow and I love Chuck Nice shout-out to check 9. You like we wasn't all that check he's great I like what you're doing is you're making learning interesting and that's why it's so fun it's it's it's it's there's excitement to it need bring a comedian like Chuck on with you things get silly but they're also the curious and you getting these experts and everyone's talking about these various subjects and and as you know not only your.
Tyson,self as an Exemplar of this. Stand up comedians are some of the smartest people in the world they have it that the Avenue women's Puffer that a little serious gas and for sure and there where they notice things that you don't know they see the same things you do and get to shape it in a way you never thought possible and then you end up laughing at other things that yourself was it your idea to do your show with stand up so so to what we have been there several of us who created this concept and we there's hella Matos is one of the partners and then another one who's never left but.
Interviewer,what was in that picture I get his name in a minute of us who David Campbell is his name the three of us got together and applied for a National Science Foundation Grant what we said was there programs out there that serve people who already know they like science.
Tyson,but who serves the people who don't know they like science or better yet the people who know they don't like science there's nothing for them because they've already rejected it did not going to tune in to Science Friday cuz they don't like Science Guy on NPR right so what we thought was supposed to be bringing a celebrity we've all that the pop culture draw this is a pop-culture scaffold we bringing the scaffold and clad the scaffold with science because whatever the celebrity does it doesn't matter there's going to be science in that person's life we had the guy who portrayed Gollum Lord of the Rings.
Interviewer,but their ass like the technology necessary to portray going as a lot he portray that live that was not some Latin later animation he is live and he's got his whole body wired up for this and he is that voice and he is portraying it so so whatever it is that you have done that you do there is such as evidence that science is everywhere you're not going to be you can't say I'm done with science let me sell my textbook and move on to other things as practically anything else you do has been touched by science and so StarTalk is a celebration of that and it jumps species and so now we're on TV now all right this is a TV show on National Geographic Channel star talk and then since you started this by the way that I didn't come here to talk about you would you started this is our fourth year in a row where were nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding information.
Tyson,programming are you going to keep doing Cosmos too though so so I have one week remaining out of what 7D shoot days to finish shooting Cosmos possible worlds premiering spring 2019 that's the third installment if you trace the first one to Carl Sagan back in 1984 I use your segment on wolves on how wolves became Dogs showed it to my kids and the Little Wheel spinning like what and what you didn't see it I'm sitting at the at the campfire and this is in the snowy environment I got wolves walking around me there on these fishing wires.
Interviewer,cuz they are not dogs right okay they they they want correct it's like should I rip his neck out now or later when I'm more hungry do not eat there's no eye contact with them because they do don't they don't see you as anything other than something that could possibly eat and so you can interact with them the way you would with ordinary dogs on these fishing your high tension fishing wire that you can't see against the snow and they're like hooting and hollering around me as I described in the name of that show is and the Wolf shall become the shepherd yeah I friended a commercial with wolf and this is commercial was running up this mountain in the wolf is there and at the end of the commercial they had to get the wolf to snarl so what the trainer does is he shows the wolf some meat and then he pulled the meat away from the wolf.
Tyson,and the Wolf snarls and they're like in in the commercials over after that like I did There's No Going to be near the wall like that switch is turned on yea and it's it's crazy like once that thing snarled everybody just backed off and the trainer let her know like once I get to this point we're done like there's there's no more and that think like okay everybody were done the original the privilege of hosting in 2014 and 2019 written by Andrew Ian and she's the the Widow of Carl Sagan butt and highly enlightened and so most of their to the the the the soul energy if you will the what makes Cosmos distinct from other.
Interviewer,from other documentaries where your soda sitting there learning you put your thinking cap on your learning cap on in Cosmos it's your feeling cap you not only learning you're also feeling the science and its relationship to you to civilization to the world to the universe and her infusion of this she's a highly scientifically literate right producer and so I just give a shout out to her just working with her husband at the light is Cosmos on Apple TV or 2 premiere on Fox and then went internationally on Nat Geo its and went to Netflix so it but I think this run of Netflix is going to drop until the next one comes in I think they want to clear the clear the landing zone for the next Cosmos Netflix is it available for anyone to get right now right now I should be I haven't checked that's great cause I have it on my DVR and I'm scared.
Tyson,delete it so now I have like 6% ER looks like what's that Morgan Freeman show through the Through the Wormhole it's it's an opportunity to be entertained and learned which I think is what everybody misses or and I think it that's that's what's missing in most public education people are bored and you take these kids with so much energy and then you make them sit still and watch something that's not even remotely stimulating by a person doesn't really care to be there right right and they know they know this they know this into if not explicitly the enthusiasm is absent yeah they could feel it there and just it's the worst way to learn it's the the worst way and it's so hard to skate once you get out of.
Interviewer,system it takes forever for a lot of these people just get their excitement about education back don't I say when I dress teachers we all by the way I'll do this right now in this room that we have only three of us but let's let's take a show of hands in your life with all the teachers you've ever had and every class you've ever taken how many had like a singular influence on who and what you became give me a number it's going to be I'm betting it's 5 or fewer probably more like 3 year for teachers your number.
Tyson,well this was the one that I talked about on your show the last time I saw you guys for coming out to start my pleasure it was a science teacher that I had when I believe I was in 7th grade and told me that if you really want to hurt your brain look up and recognize the fact that that goes on forever that this is infant and then just think about what that means infinite that there really is no end to it. But how many teachers such as that were so influential on you he might be the one for me it's like two and a half and I've had scores of teachers yeah okay a hundred teachers at least so what I tell teachers is be that teacher to your students we've all had those teachers be that teacher and in every case it wasn't because the topic was something you knew in advance you would like it's because their energy for sharing your passion and love for the subject.
Interviewer,palpable I just spilled out of him and went into course through your veins in your arteries and you walk out of there thinking wow that was the most interesting thing I've ever done in my life you don't even care what you get on a test after that because you got touched and you became enlightened participant and that exercise in that exploration it's so hard for them to even get kids attention so yeah this is some ratchet latches going on for that could be in some places have the energy of the teachers gives maintaining order I think the success of your book the success of your show your podcast and many of those other really intelligent podcasts are showing of there's an appetite for the stuff out there yeah and I'm delighted to be a servant of that Curiosity and this brought this just cuz it's not even out yet this is your hearing like now live this is it your live where to buy.
Tyson,what is this accessory to war about this this is like another but I just this is coming out in 3 weeks is this about the bass War acessory to war the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military.
Interviewer,if you're in a hurry. Do not buy this product this is not this is not what this is not an Impulse items at the checkout line this is you got this is this is all about by the way we know what role the physicist plays in war that fizzes his makes the bomb invented the bong the chemist perfect Napalm the biologist.
Tyson,weaponizers Anthrax well we sit at the end of a telescope and wait for photons to cross the universe and enter out detector and we go into conferences in argue about them so there is no obvious connection between what we do and military strength hegemony dominance empire-building it's just not obvious that's why the subtitle the unspoken Alliance it's not a secret it's just this not there isn't no it's there but it's not nobody's talking about it do you realize I'll just give an example okay if you needed more reasons to think the Columbus was a dick okay let me add 1/2 it between us when we were kids and today I do have something.
Interviewer,Smiley redeeming to offer about Columbus if you have the time I just want to start off with that on his third voyage he's in by the times of his third voyage he'd already planted enough Spanish flag that Spain had already begun to set up governments and infrastructures in these places that he had found basically Concord and so-so in one of the places I visited it's in the book accurate with the thing is Hispaniola one of the island today he has to get back is his third voice 1503 or 1504 to get back to Spain he doesn't have enough resources not enough food for his crew so he asked the natives would you please give us some of your stock that you have collected from your farming now this particular group of Native only makes exactly the amount of food they need.
Tyson,need to tie to the next crop they don't have Surplus so they said no we don't have Surplus sorry Columbus knew that one week hence coincidentally it was going to be a total lunar eclipse with a moon in its orbit around Earth enters Earth's Shadow the full moon enters Earth's Shadow and disappears and that the geometry of that event it's just a simple lunar eclipse with a geometry so that some light passes around Earth Earth's atmosphere and takes on sunset colors that leach into Earth's Shadow giving the moon if you can see it at all deep red Amber hue.
Interviewer,almost the color of blood Columbus said he knew about this cuz he had read the tables the eclipse tables all right we have eaten enough about the solar system at the time to when we got that okay actually but then it was just the known world with horses in the middle of the known universe. He says to the natives if you do not give us food my God which is more powerful than your God will make the moon disappear and it will turn blood red that will happen in one week you have one week to comply some of them was skeptical.
Tyson,sure enough right on cue the moon begins to disappear according to that that is a famous would cut you got this those viewing the video this is a famous would cut and noticed the natives bowing to him and he stands probably cuz he knows the science he knows the astronomy he knew this and so he invokes this to dominate people would not get scientifically literate and within seconds of this beginning they bring them all the resources he wants and he gets but we don't know what happened you know I'm back at the island where the people survive the winter but he got back to the island Universe has been invoked in it almost one of the National Labs day today as basically since their Inception are charged with.
Interviewer,tracking the nuclear arsenal of the United States are nuclear-powered the nukes that would go into nuclear weapons they think about this you realize they hire astrophysicists always working there you know why because there's a room there two rooms I mean I'm simplifying this was basically there two rooms adjacent to one another and a computer between the two of them the most powerful computers in the world and there is code running on those computers that calculates the energy yield of hydrogen Fusion.
Tyson,that's exactly what an astrophysicist cares about when stars blow up okay the sun is undergoing nuclear fusion right now and that's how it's making energy and when did when I'm at Stars dies they explode as supernovae this is a natural thing going on than you ever in the universe on the other side that's a classified room they're calculating yields of hydrogen bonds and they have lunch together and compare notes the government doesn't always have the best people but if you hire some of the best people to do whatever it is they want and there calculation happened to relate to a military project there you have a two-way street in progress why do you think the Hubble telescope the issues notwithstanding which will ultimately fixed when it was first launch of the Hubble Telescope launched.
Interviewer,by the military.
Tyson,looking down that's the model for the telescope had already been conceived and built and I was operating then we said we want one of those okay but we don't know that's not public that this is going on we design with the Telco gets designed as the benefit of previous versions of it having been used successfully but looking down and we look up this is a perennial two-way street of astronomy in the Old Days Inn in modern times astrophysics preventing you from eating raw don't worry about me okay fine Galileo telescope he learned that it had just been invented in the Netherlands the Dutch word for Opticians right so they invented the telescope and microscope within a couple of years of one another just transform science when did they invent the eyeglass the reading glasses.
Interviewer,but I don't I don't know when did Wheel advanced was putting two lenses in line with one another sounds trivial in modern times but that was a huge leap conceptually and what you've accomplished and it's so doing depending on how you curve them and how you grind them grinded the shape of those lenses you would get a microscope were telescope and and We're Off to the Races that's basically the birth of modern science as we now think of it and and and and conduct it because you said yourself my senses I don't trust them to be the full record of what's going on in front of me you pull out a microscope oh my gosh leeuwen hoek you got the microscope guy drop a pond water puts it under his microscope just to think to do this it's just water why do you think that's something interesting to do he said I wonder he was curious he puts it under and sees little what he described as animalcules happily a swimming animal.
Tyson,animalcules he's like the amoebas and paramecia it is reports on this to to the scientific authorities and pimple he shouldn't I say we think you might have had too much gin before you wrote this lipid.
Interviewer,why would anyone believe this that this entire creatures and entire universe of creature thriving in a drop of pond water and so the way science works is one report does not make it true you need verification they sent people to the Netherlands to verify his results in there was the birth of microscopy and then they look at everything cells that you don't do need vocabulary to describe what you're now seeing that was the journey down small then the journey went up big and Galileo perfects the telescope he looks slow I see craters mountains valleys on the moon the Sun have spots Venus goes through phases this became the Corpus of evidence for earth going around the Sun in support of Copernicus idea the earth going around the Sun my point is what was the second thing he did with his telescope he telephone.
Tyson,he contacted the Doge of Venice invited into the Clock Tower and said look at what this instrument can do for you as we look out into the Lagoon you can identify a ship's intentions Friend or Foe by its flag 10 times farther away than you can with the unaided eye.
Interviewer,Venice bought a boatload of these telescopes in the service of their military defense and this was a source of money to Galileo now he could go look at the universe this is been a two-way street ever since people have looked up an accounting of that this is its and it goes on and on the first x-ray machines for airports you're old enough to remember why would they put in because of hijackings to Cuba basically they were armed hijackings of airplanes of American carriers to Cuba and Congress are we got to do something about that by the way there's a company in Boston called American Science & Engineering that was building an x-ray detector small enough to put on a satellite to observe the universe in x-rays.
Tyson,and because no one has visible light but not x-ray that's a branch of the electromagnetic spectrum we think if they're black holes out there their region surrounding them will give us x-rays it's a new window on the universe and then they said oh my gosh there's a call for x-ray machines at airport we've got the technology that we perfected to put in a freaking satellite so the technology for those ones you walk through the airport initially came out yes yes there was a two-way street there was oh my gosh we need this for security oh my God we would we were using let's let's reply that technology to these detectors that's been a lot of the stuff with the Space Program write a lot of the stuff that they devised for use on the space station and so many other Technologies of trickle their way down in the rain and even some simple things cuz people say why is my money up there and we should be spending it down here but there's an interesting fact here that is almost never discussed.
Interviewer,the people who who think about the universe and study of the universe are hugely creative and the creative energies cannot be prescribed you can't go to a create you might but I don't know that you'll get there a maximum creativity I need you to invent a cure for cancer right now use that really is I'll try but the greatest discoveries the greatest the greatest of these comes from a cross pollination of interest that people have that where they were engaged because they were interest interested just for the sake of being interested to watch what here's an example the space shuttle it it's it's a glider when it lands okay it's got no engines got flaps there's a little bit of brakes in the tires but that's about it when it comes in.
Tyson,okay how do you make sure the thing that stays on track because they kept drifting and Crosswinds in this sort of thing and so he said why don't we Groove the road so the rubber on the road since the robber can online with the cruise and stay in a straight line because Robert doesn't slide well when you have doesn't slide sideways right easily on cruise when they realize how effective that was it's now put on off ramps to freeways if there's a freeway off-ramp it's a little tight not quite banked well enough it's going to be grooved check it out next time and you can say well okay that's pretty simple low Tech solution why don't we why couldn't we just discovered that on our own without the 20 billion dollar years space agency called Matteson.
Interviewer,but you didn't you didn't.
Tyson,how tools cordless high torque power tools were invented to service satellites in orbit by NASA because you can't of plug it into a hundred twenty volt socket when you're floating in space so the engineers said how we going to solve this problem let's make a high-torque so now that is the only way you're buying a tool today is the is the cordless variety all construction sites that I'm looking for a power outlet for these things.
Interviewer,so why did we invent this without the 20 Bellino's make sure you didn't you weren't you didn't think about it you said all I can plug it in this is great you're not even thinking what you need so yes they're all of these applications but but I don't think that's a good reason to do it but I don't think it's the best of the best reasons are my gosh don't you want to keep dreaming don't want to keep looking into the future that would be ideal but that's not Tractive to people are spending tax dollars when comes attack Towers people get super pragmatic and they go why do we need to go to Mars know what we need to do is take care of this and pay for that and we at with the deficit and the budget and Beyond so you don't mess is budget Today Is 4/10 of 1%.
Tyson,of the federal budget so if you take a dollar bill and imagine that your tax dollar and you can like cut it to whatever percent you want so let's cut for tense of 1% off of The Edge that doesn't get you into the ink you're still in the the white border around it I even notice it so my point is most of the people who say don't spend it here spend it there.
Interviewer,they think NASA it has more budget that it actually does they just think they're asking how much is a 10% 5 % you know several percent know which one half of one percent so if you going to tell me that if you can take that for tense of 1% and spend it in these other problems and solve them I would say yeah go right ahead but is this is this where you really want to pull the money from when it's the only thing that God has us thinking about tomorrow is just thinking about a future but forgot like you that's super important but for a guy who lives in Cleveland who doesn't give a shit about science no excuse me that's like the person who says okay I don't need space program why don't I have my cell phone and I have the Weather Channel and I know any funny I need this is.
Tyson,yeah.
Interviewer,you're using GPS satellites to understand where you are on this Earth You to notice me where Grandma's house is when you pull up the GPS Wi-Fi who is Hedy Lamarr I didn't know that yes yes you did actress 1941 yes she did Mark II yeah but I took it would take decades to really realize at a craft GPS is launched by the military and it's now hundreds of billions of dollars worth of the American economy thriving on this space application but it was a military intent and it was to navigate.
Tyson,the surface of the Earth to navigate and the first Gulf War was the first big use of space Assets in the conduct of military operations even when Hedy Lamarr created it with another scientist the idea behind it was for encoded encoded transcriptions are encoded information during the war while so that's a big challenge how do you encode information that's by the way the future this might might come from its I still not clear the jury still out and they're sort of opposing views on this but you know you've heard my Quantum entangled particles where I can create a pair of particles that know about one another and now they separated in space and in time and if you.
Interviewer,observe that other particles instantly changes the state of the particle back the other particle its back where I am and by the way that they communicate instantaneously faster than the speed when you say if you observed do you mean that if You observe it with anything but you have to do something people but you say that people go yeah I saw that in the secret the problem is it's a psychological thing but it physics is going to take measurement thing fry and soloist if there is an electron sitting in the middle of this table and all the lights are out I can say I think there's an electron here let me find out in the moment I turn on the lights the light interacts a photon and electron and kicks it somewhere else so the more I try to measure the position the less I know its position so because you need to.
Tyson,the measurement requires and interaction with it and in the quantum scale interactions change the state of the experiment that you're conducting we know this we Quantified it with we don't like it but we deal with it and then the act of dealing with it you can exploit that fact for other purposes we explain Quantum craziness to birth the inductive the information technology Revolution there is no creation storage or retrieval of information without an exploitation of the quantum.
Interviewer,so and by the way the quantum was discovered in quantum physics as a branch of physics was discovered in the 1920s if you were around back then and your tax buddies I don't like paying taxes what would you have said why are you spending government money I'm broke on the atom and on molecules that you can't even see them what good is it Adams right here I am you have yet to shove that where your where your tax dollar is and so it would look like you're wasting your own time and everybody else's money.
Tyson,it would take decades five decades before five decade before you realize what role that would play in Computing this creation storage and retrieval of information and buy some as a third of the world's GDP is traceable to what quantum physics does for us on a Computing scale for certain industries that would still be there without Computing but they're made more efficient with it okay so UPS tracks all of their trucks with GPS in with Computing devices then developed the quantum UPS predates the use of this these tools but you can look at profits relative to their efficiencies that are enabled by these technology as well as the entire fields that didn't exist before Computing you at all that up it's a stunning fact and my only point is that you.
Interviewer,if you want today to say why study this when we have these other problems well I do like all I do is take it back to the cave and let's say I'm in the cave and there's a mountain over there in the valley and I tell you I told her that the cable I tell the tribe leaders I want to explore that mountain inn at Valley.
Tyson,no we can't afford to send you out there now we have to solve the cave problems first before anyone leaves the k.
Interviewer,we laugh at that that's absurd claim to make.
Tyson,the caveman days I don't know if I did it but that's a crazy thought because their solutions to your problems that might exist and time has demonstrated likely Exist by leaving the cave that you can discover so for me voice is not just space all the frontiers of the unknown biology chemistry a I know those tears and then you can cross pollinate them and transform civilization the last example I want to hear you talk to interact with what I'm telling here's one you ready okay my physics professor in college.
Interviewer,study the universe love the universe study gas clouds between stars and study and why would you detect against Cloud if it's not radiating white will they give off radio waves all right and he figured out what kind of radio waves do they give off and why and in this he gain expertise in the nucleus of the atom and he discovered that the nucleus can resonate.
Tyson,depending on the mass of the nucleus it will which means depending on what Atom it is on the periodic table it will resonate slightly differently when exposed to the same electromagnetic field he discovered a new phenomenon in physics called nuclear magnetic resonance.
Interviewer,it was then take a clever medical technologist to say wait a minute if you can distinguish one heavy Atom from another.
Tyson,money making machine out of that put your body in it and I can vent distinguish one kind of tissue from another and just was born the magnetic resonance imagery the MRI arguably the most potent tool in the Arsenal of modern medicine why can diagnose a condition in your body without cutting you open first that is based on a principle of physics Discovery by a physicist but no interest in Medicine by the way that the real title should be nuclear magnetic resonance imaging but that's the other end word you know you crazy. They didn't like that one inside the machine if the word nuclear was on it my point is that was a cross pollination of ideas with clever people on their Frontiers looking over the fence at discoveries that are being made it's how we got the microwave oven that was invented by a thermodynamicist.
Interviewer,microwave this is a World War II attempt to communicate using microwaves and they found out some guys chocolate bar melted in the microwave field this is what they happen there they did some more test and of course the water molecule and other molecules common in food respond to microwave it vibrates them.
Tyson,ferociously and so you put food in a microwave cavity the water content of the food vibrates.
Interviewer,action Cooks the food there still people do today would say a nucleus cuz if so fast I have no tickets just friction okay friction it everybody scared that it fucks up the food does it know it just it just eats the water and gets scared the woo-woo people do okay so there's certain foods that don't respond well to the flipping of the water molecule and one of them is like bread products gets hard chewy and leathery and tried and you still good if you overdo it and get well that's kind of it I'm trying to think you wouldn't grill a steak in a microwave you would heat up the meat uniformly and that's that's all it would do him pretty fast but it's a mess and it splattered all over so you pick the foods that are best for that situation as you would pick the foods best you wouldn't you wouldn't put.
Tyson,toast in an oven at 350° bread tomatoes we have posters for that right so different things in your kitchen do things best you wouldn't make ice cream in your you know did you spend your toaster oven that people are afraid of microwaves the one thing they're afraid of is not it's not that you're afraid of microwaves that they're afraid of things they don't understand what happened to their food that makes it less good correct and it's just it's it's not the not knowing that people fear my wife's friend's mom will not eat something that comes out of a microwave really cheap quotes that as part of what makes her healthy drinks a lot of water she refuses to eat microwave food.
Interviewer,the whole life is around not using microwave or she won't eat anything that comes out of the microwave I'm glad that she doesn't she can live a long happy life as such she let her reheat food old school okay one of the hardest thing is reheating lasagna if you don't have a microwave on shrew best I can possibly going to cook it again just eat a bowl of pasta just in general soup or adding any nuclear radiation correct with radiation than the normal sense other than electromagnetic radiation it's already light from the bulb which tend to use radiation in the context of stuff that would hurt you so that would be radiation of high enough energy to hurt you and microwaves are not in that category I never even thought about with microwaves do until this conversation really.
Tyson,frequency of microwaves that beautifully pairs with the water molecule and it vibrates it brilliantly thing that has no water in it it's not really very you snapped jerky it's like it's hot it's my cousin microwave oven heated the plate is cuz of my food and the food that's why I could usually pick it up at the handles.
Interviewer,that's right it doesn't burst of flame burst into flames this is crazy what is the difference between MRI and fmri expertise you're about to head to the little I know that MRI they put you in there in your stationary and then they make this map of whatever part of the body they're studying is typically your head all right but you can do it on for your joints in other parts of your body that might require this level of three dimensional analysis and it's a 3D map of what's going on in the park that they surveyed and so you look at it for the slices through that section so you might see in MRIs of your brain of your skull and they take slices you as much slices go through you see like the eye socket come in and then go out again where the nose cap and and you can look at it at all sweet imagines front back side to side up to down so so depending on the sophistication the machine fmri.
Tyson,looking at your brain while you were thinking so time is now an active coordinate of what's going on and they're measuring it as they're talking to you about ice cream sundae with a cherry on top but think of a naked person who you'd want to have sex with and that I have to stand for funks functional right and so it's basically a real-time observation of what's going on it's really highly criticized case but she was convicted of a crime I believe it was murder because she had functional knowledge of the crime scene.
Interviewer,and the arguments against it were like if you're going to be accused of a crime clearly you going to study the evidence you going to talk to a lawyer going to go over some things you going to be my I don't know if fmri is that precise yeah they don't think it is that's why I was very disturbing that this was used in court it's like you remember when these Italian geologist were I think they were try because they should have known about an earthquake before it happened and then scientist how to say hey guys this is not how it works like this shit can just happen that's so you know I don't but that's what I do know that let me share a couple of things with you that thought deeply about recently there are three kinds of truths in the world because we're at work at 3 let me get I'll give you 3 OK the Rudy Giuliani kind you're welcome.
Tyson,impact that okay are you ready okay I'll turn the fact I do something called it objected truth and objective truth is something that is true whether or not you believe in it and the methods and tools of science are uniquely conceived to seek out and establish objective truths and this time in referring to the invocation of the scientific method no one scientific result result research result is true.
Interviewer,until it is verified by other people's research results using a different experimental method with different walk her it from another country we when your competitor says I think you're wrong let me show how your wrongfully reproducer experiment and get the same result when you have generally the same results emerging that is a newly discovered objective truth about the natural world and we have a check your Tuesday not later shown to be false.
Tyson,that's an objective then you have personal truths.
Interviewer,these are true that you hold dearly Jesus is your savior Muhammad is the final Prophet on Earth you you know Abraham is your these are your personal troops there's a heaven you're going to no one is going to take that from you not in a free country where freedom of expression and speech and religion is protected it's a personal truth the problem here is you can't convince someone else of your personal truth without some Act of persuasion and in the limit and act of violence okay in the limit in the limit this how you get Holy Wars so I have this personal truth and I require that you share my personal truthful wise that's a recipe for disaster and not a belief because the people who hold the belief will tell you that it's a truth so I don't want to take that usage of the word away from them okay so you're giving them and giving them the word truth but modifying it to say personal truth.
Tyson,that's correct I'm not going to abuse it that way for the millenia I'm not going to okay they feel that is true and it's true in their bones I'm simply saying that because it's your personal truth you cannot require that someone else share it and in this country because the United States because God is not mentioned in the Constitution itself a controversial thing and it stay by the way Ashley God is mentioned but it's been a very insignificant way that the constitution is a Godfrey document and because it's a God free document it protect.
Interviewer,your expression of religious face because it means the government has no say in who and what you believe or why.
Tyson,if the Constitution said mention God and Jesus will there it is is Christianity built into the fabric of the country and if you want to be some other religion you can have a hard time cuz we can set laws against it this is why so many religiously persecuted people came to the United States to escape their country where they could not practice their religion a little differently or lot differently from what was going on in their homes in their Homeland to call it truth I would rather not call a truce but I I'm I'm a big word guy and I respect what happens to words I don't always like it but I respect it and so I'm going to say there's an objective truth which is true whether or not you believe it is your personal truth which is true to you.
Interviewer,search what is a political truth or truth is something that is true because it has been incessantly repeated.
Tyson,and then you just believe it and that's what I don't know what's Hillary Clinton's first name it's crooked is actually Hillary okay I thought it was crooked Hillary this is was incessantly repeated in the Trump campaign example of it but the point is if you keep saying.
Interviewer,if you keep saying that the New York Times is fake news it just keep saying that eventually people believe it and it becomes a political truth because the politicians repeated it so what's a political true that people believe it or it's a put Uncle truth because people believe it so you're trying to preserve the true fundamental meaning of the word truth and Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris had an infuriating and frustrating podcast where they went over the meaning of the word Truth for more than an hour and I like I said you can do that and philosophers like arguing and debating meaning of things for me it's however people using the word that's the meaning I can see that but we can see why I don't call myself an atheist dictionary definition of atheist and a butt.
Tyson,what is the definition of atheist in practice it is what leading atheist do and it's their conduct in this their behavior is what they say and it's it it's the it's their attitude that is what an atheist today because they were the most visible exemplars of that word and most of their conduct I either don't agree with or simply don't engaging what don't you agree with I don't debate religious people and tell them they're idiots I don't and it doesn't work. It works I just not it's not in me to do that I I don't Purge myself of words that have religious foundations in them I wants in my Facebook I had a friend going up in orbit to repair the Hubble telescope one of the astronaut and I said godspeed and then I gave the astronaut's name people who wrote In in the scratch that I thought you were an atheist how can you say Godspeed Faith he's got angry with me and I said.
Interviewer,okay first of all this phrase is deeply historical in the space program when John Glenn was want to have mine was godspeed John Glenn every Mission recent human beings into space somewhere there's that reference in the NASA family by the way in just one minute the atheist or arguing that I was using godspeed as a phrase they all have used the phrase goodbye haven't they see you later goodbye at work come from it's from God be with you it's a contraction of those three words and why would you say this you would say this is someone leaving the city wall where it's dangerous okay back when did city-states you're going to your God be with you to bring protection for you between one city hall in Hemet.
Tyson,crabs look out for you so now what is the source of danger if you're going to space it's not alien space muggers it is the fact that you had space Marauders it's the fact that you have high speed and high speed is the source of essentially any death of anything that's in motion if you were part of that disaster so got speed is like a space equivalent to God be with you is that was really the origin of the saying it should they say that before they was space travel to they say Godspeed I don't know the actual origin of space travel out of the term I don't how far back it goes but I do know it became common after John Glenn cuz I'm not going to say it to Yuri Gagarin cuz they were there all atheists in in the Soviet Union but here in America in America godspeed John Glenn and I respect that tradition and so I said that and then they jump so if 8.
Interviewer,jumping on me for having said that clearly I'm not an atheist ask me my favorite Broadway musical Dalton what's your favorite broad Christ Superstar I still use BC and AD in my writings okay I still do it don't use BCE I don't use BC all right don't see even you cut coppin attitude right there right now I saw your face you got the years ago I'm going to tell you so BCE as you know since were before Common Era and c e stands for Common Era so this is D religious if buying a D & B & B C okay yeah the course they reference the same calendar okay well who invented the calendar we all currently used in modern society is called the Gregorian calendar was invented by the Catholic Church by Jesuit priests.
Tyson,in the 1580s assigned by Pope Gregory to fix the problems in the calendar because I'm start screaming at you.
Interviewer,the Julian calendar put forth in ancient Rome.
Tyson,had one modification to previous calendar they had a leak day okay.
Interviewer,did I delete a.
Tyson,and okay Lisa is how often every four years this was good cuz when we trying to track which one it is earth goes around the Sun and so we say alright how long does that take go takes a year but it turns out we're not actually tracking how long it takes Earth to go around the Sun without tracking how long it takes Earth to repeat its seasons.
Interviewer,and the repeat the year that corresponds to our seasons is slightly different from the year the car spawns to how long it takes to go around the Sun slightly different and that difference was not recognized in the early calendars and that difference accumulated so that by the year 1584.
Tyson,the vernal equinox the first day of spring did not occur on March 21st occurred on March 10th it's shifted from the calendar date that's what happens if you don't match the cycles of things and the pope said we're not having any of this especially since Easter might land on Passover and we try to distinguish a cell's mightily from the Jews so let's fix this the Jesuit priest got to study this he looked at the cycles of the heavens the Sun the moon the stars and they came up with a new calendar to Gregorian calendar a modification to the Julian calendar you don't have to do to invoke it had to take 10 days out of my calendar to jumpstart to put the first day of spring back on March 21st then it happened in October 1584.
Interviewer,why is there Bentyl 10 days out of the calendar amortize rent to pay for 3 weeks instead of 20 days instead of 30 to figure that out okay point is this was hard earned in the whole world uses this calendar it is the most accurate calendar ever devised you ask Watch What Happens.
Tyson,e leap day overcorrected the calendar.
Interviewer,n overcorrected over correct yes yes so you need to leave here so notes are the weekdays every four years that one day every 4 years was slowly putting too many days into the moments into the year okay the Gregorian calendar figure this out and headed put 10 extra days since the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar first jumpstart get rid of the 10 days never sings wind up again okay now how do you prevent this from happening again.
Tyson,cause it over correct how long do you have to wait to remove a leaf day that you would otherwise put in.
Interviewer,ay okay it's every hundred years so every hundred years that would be a leap day.
Tyson,you remove delete Day by an even smaller amount okay so how long do you have to wait before you have to put a leap day back in.
Interviewer,every 400 years.
Tyson,so the year 2000 was a century year which normally would not have a leap day except it's a century year evenly divisible by 400 so they put the leap day back in and everybody on February almost everybody everybody except the astronomers on February 29th in the year 2000 set it's just a leap year cuz it's divisible by 4 no it is a rare leap year it is a century year divisible by 400.
Interviewer,that corrects it back and so now you have a stable calendar for tens of thousands of years I got to give props to the Jesuit priest I'm not going to say no I'm taking the Christianity out of this reference cuz they figured out the calendar that we all used and it's a fucking awesome count sorry to drop an F-bomb then I'm not just because some atheists are telling me to rid God out of everything in the universe that I'm not doing that I'm going to say they came up with the calendar for the reasons workers they didn't want to confuse it with Passover the motivation is whatever it is but The Sciences is good and so they're so intercessory to war we go back many centuries the editor said we should use BCAA cuz it's a liberal forward thing I said I'm not using BCE and CE and by the way there was no year 0.
Tyson,you know why there's no use here cuz the Romans came up with the calendar and they counted using Roman numerals and Roman numerals don't have a zero it was not yet invented went from 1 BC to 81 BC is before Christ ad is anno domini in Latin the year of Our Lord in Islam in China and in in Hebrew culture is Israel in particular have access to the Chinese calendar the Muslim calendar Muslim of course dates to Muhammad Chinese calendar dates to actually a planetary alignment in 4700 BC they don't they use a different system and the Hebrew calendar dates to like the beginning of the universe as interpreted in the in the Torah so they have access to those but when the conducting international business we just simply that used to be.
Interviewer,my calendar just get over it in China do they use it constantly and consistently or do they alternate between the Gregorian calendar and something else and my friends and colleagues conducting business the world's business is conducted in on the Gregorian calendar with a 12 month calendar with it with the year as reference at by everybody else doesn't have to be done that way in terms of flake is there as anyone ever done a study on possibly creating a more effective more accurate calendar doesn't invoke leap years and the problem is the length of the day does not cut evenly to the time it takes Earth to go around the Sun always be fractions of days that you're accumulating and then what do you do with him you wait till you see me like today and put it in or take it out what did the Mayans in a lunar cycle calendar.
Tyson,that it was like the really accurate calendar for 10:00 better than any Greene County you know what to believe the people 5000 years ago somehow knew more about the universe that we do today just know why is that why they want to believe that I think I don't know for me that's one of the great puzzles of Life why do people want to believe that the Egyptian somehow had some access to the universe they knew someone killed some incredible shit but that I would take that away from doesn't the physical presence of these incredible buildings leave the possibility that maybe they had some dollars that we lost.
Interviewer,most knowledge is a real thing I don't want to belittle or would diminish the significance of real knows we forgot how to draw in perspective you know from ancient times had to be rediscovered in the as I understand from the artist had to be rediscovered in the Renaissance the archway of the Roman Arch had to go to be rediscovered okay so yes yes you can lose knowledge but if you look at the knowledge we have gleaned using the method of Modern methods and tools of science they go far beyond our five senses in our access to the world.
Tyson,to say that somehow they knew something that we don't using our tools that's just false sorry that just it's just it's not possible but we know the physiological limits of your ability to know what's going on around you is fine but as a scientist I have dozens of Senses but I can measure things that your five senses can't I can measure the magnetic field around Earth electromagnetic field how much are microwaves a coursing through your body now we have no sensors for this I can see auras fine I can see other things that affect in your body now I can tell you if ionizing radiation is passing through you I've Geiger counters I can do that you can't you'll final you will eventually learn what you were supposed to ionizing radiation because you're you'll get cancer of your organs in your limbs fall off I can see that we know far more today guess perhaps attending no not even perhaps than any other time I'm conceivable history.
Interviewer,but it is possible that they knew some things like how to build a pyramid yes that we really just don't understand today.
Tyson,I don't know what it means to not understand how to build a pyramid today we have we have a hundred and fifty story building so we do not thinking about hearing this stuff I can tell you this you know where the first thing that was built by humans ever know that's only part of the sentence the tallest thing humans built.
Interviewer,after the pyramids.
Tyson,I think it's a building in Dubai.
Interviewer,so in other words what's the first thing after the pyramids right after what is the next tallest thing we built stable structure after the pyramid what.
Tyson,18 whatever the TV 918 say that late 1800s in Paris the Eiffel Tower that was the first stable structure we built as a civilization that was taller than the pyramids show the Egyptians new day new architecture they knew no one's taking that away from them.
Interviewer,but the claim have some secret knowledge of the functioning of the universe no no deal in the fact that we're dealing with the very very most recent 2500 BC they built you just have to be more ingenious more interview we otherwise would have to be yeah how do you move the blocks how to how do you make Stonehenge those those rocks are nowhere in the region they would carded from Subway they found a place where those rocks were with would have been mined removed and yeah those are some big ass rocks yeah that's her the one that's impressive because they're just big like what did the thing about the pyramids are so impressive is the Precision in the sheer numbers 2600000 stones are best understanding of Stonehenge is that it's a functioning Observatory they can actually predict eclipses.
Tyson,so do I get the judge I just got here bitch slap you there.
Interviewer,impressive.
Tyson,Solstice that are not stones but they're 56 holes which is three times the the serous which is the cycle of eclipse is of the matching of the orbits of the Sun in the moon in the sky the path of the sun in the moon in the sky and when they match up you get in the clips is there is it cost for joint or a guy named that's absolutely what it is.
Interviewer,there's a book publishing in the 1970s by a guy named David.
Tyson,Dawkins Richard Dawkins what's another one of these bookings Richard Hawkins just look up the Stonehenge decoded just look up the title that book it's highly convincing and we all were all there with it there's no sense of justice study of the position of the stones in relationship to the weather OK Daryl so he at age 15 on an expedition and he was the Expedition head oh wow so lucky for you it was good and that stuck with me which is why I named this phenomenon in Manhattan where the sun sets along the street side so I need that manhattanhenge back to my early days thinking about the alignment of the Sun and Ski.
Interviewer,pictures that we might bill for those viewers are listening to Don't Know twice a year the Manhattan Street grid which is not perfectly aligned north south the Manhattan Street grid will that the sun will set exactly on the grid and what's up there now that image what's not obvious is that picture is taken along a street that is itself 3 miles long and then you're crossing a the Hudson River and then there's New Jersey on the other side so people try to zoom in on it but really what you really should do is zoom out front and then you get the vanishing point on it so if you all those are zoom zoom then let's go to that one looks more like like my photo back to that other one.
Tyson,yeah so that's on 34th Street the one you see now and then you get this sparkly like that happens twice a year. Sort of crazy wild light effect that looks yeah there's an image on his Instagram that is linked on my Instagram the most recent photo okay afro oh yeah that's wrong that's my first I was at 1419 poly 1974 wow so I would have been 15 I think about 14 or 15 year path of curiosity set go back the other one but they go back to all the all the pictures there.
Interviewer,how to go to the bottom like they're you got okay that might be the first ever manhattanhenge photo what year is that from I took that in publishing 2002 before September 11th this is July I'll check it before September 11th right right and then I had a means to publish it and right then they noticed it it's a green light and traffic is ready to knock me over so so no one is in the streets doing this but now they're tens of thousands of people that pour into the streets on these days we post what day you get manhattanhenge from the American Museum of Natural History my day job and then that goes out the Press gets it and tens of thousands of people spill at the street blocking traffic and even think of all the ways Traffic gets blocked in your day.
Tyson,all it was too many of them was it you that name this structure if you made of stone it's a Stonehenge why isn't it possible to construct the calendar the doesn't have leap years.
Interviewer,what you would have to do you could do it but what would happen is it means you care more about the year than you do about the day so what would happen is you would celebrate the new year at like 3 in the afternoon right and then the next year you're celebrated at like.
Tyson,12 minutes after 3 in the afternoon and then 20 minutes if you would you would it would sort of move through your calendar and then that means you cared more about the year the chart you care more about the timeshare that right you we always want to celebrate New Years on midnight and by the way New Year's Eve celebrated in 24 time zones not all at the same time so she thinks of that is a moment yeah it's really a calendar event that's why he took it celebrated over 24 hours 10 hours difference so therefore if you were to do it Astro physically you would know the exact moment where we were turned in our orbit.
Interviewer,and everybody would celebrate that instant in that would be so then the whole world was celebrate the new year at the same time that means you value it differently it's not a midnight celebration it's a you could do that unless chill sounds Celestial yeah so that would be the only way yeah but that's the only way a day doesn't cut evenly into the year. Don't you have nothing to do with one another is no reason why that would have till we we we so in other words let me say it another way just cuz you looking like you're like you you're looking off in space here so there's New Year's okay let's count 365 days.
Tyson,when we do that.
Interviewer,we are not.
Tyson,at the same place we were when we last celebrated New Year's Day New Year's Eve okay around something I'm supposed to work so I use those two words that we're not in the same place but we celebrate New Years anyway when we be in the same place a quarter of a day later 6 hours so we would celebrate the next new year at 6 a.m. nobody want to do that was the end of the next new year at noon the next year at 6 p.m. and then the next to your kind of alarms back again blast Elite day that's the fourth year we have put in a leave day see so it's our love of the day yes that keeps us fucked up with the world when it comes to the year pick one and then that's how that's how you do it on the moon right I didn't get on my nerves.
Interviewer,I didn't study their calendar as deeply as I should have and wanted to especially back in 2012 and everyone said how the Mayan calendar runs out so therefore it's the end of the world I was thinking I was thinking was the end of the world baby at the Maya sets out like but that was back when you know before that what had happened it was you know George Bush was president like 2007 and everybody was thinking Jesus this is this is going to be the end of it so what so every decade there's somebody predicting the end of the world sure I'm actually quite entertained by this exercise at Billboards all around La just a few years ago that that's a different end of the world that's a guy with a radio Podcast church that he until you push to forward to that's it's an entertaining we live in a free country it's having is that we live in a free country.
Tyson,where freedom of speech is protected and you can practice any religion you want and they didn't learn much science in school that's a part of it that's part of the fact that you have this in our world I don't mind it actually I find it entertaining but it becomes an issue two people such as that gain power over legislation over the rest of us believe the world is going to end on October 19th in the fine just impose your personal belief on me and your personal belief.
Interviewer,is not true for everyone it's only true for you yeah that's a problem I ended up jackets with a true friend wants if you if you can have governance you going to want a basic governance of what is objectively true.
Tyson,cuz it would apply to everyone independent of your belief system.
Interviewer,yeah I agree with that hey by the way there there there are things that we not sure or true yet that we're still researching that's not what I'm talking about isn't as an objective truth I've been verified by multiple scientific studies not just one study this was the problem with the the cholesterol study there's a commercial study that said everybody on the course to drop their cholesterol levels okay saying it would be good for your heart and all the rest of this because a series of countries were studied where they have longevity and low heart low heart disease and low cholesterol intake happened to leave out France.
Tyson,it happened it just wasn't in the study and a couple of other places that have high cholesterol intake but don't have higher heart disease.
Interviewer,so that study was flawed but was hard to replicate it because it went over many years and it was thousands of people and so everyone just jumped on it.
Tyson,you don't have a scientific truth and this is a general problem with medical results because the Press is waiting at the at the at the journal editors office oh here's a new study that shows at this gives you cancer that must be true and how comes they have lockers you want to be the first to report it and then it gets emblazoned in people's heads and not everyone reads the follow-up no one could duplicate that study know what so there's a flaw we don't even know what the floor is we know that no one else could get those results so it's goes in the Dustbin of scientific research most research and any Journal of the moment will ultimately shown to be wrong.
Interviewer,that's the bleeding edge of science it's a it's a great place to because you're in the you're in the trenches and you don't know what is true you can't look up in the back of the book with the answer is to double-check you don't even know what the question is to ask half the time.
Tyson,that's very frustrating for people that don't get it and it's exciting for the knowledge. Expanding and growing but it's very frustrating for people that really don't have the time and you know maybe did get some outdated nutrition knowledge answers right now without the need to go to to to research it or to go on the frontier the lack of Education in the lack of lack of curiosity about it's one of the scariest things about new generation 2 kids right like when the new generation 2 coming up if they know last in the generation before that's when we really start to freak out that be a problem although I have good confidence in the 30 and under Millennial I called you have to be only ever known the internet and devices so what do we say recent.
Interviewer,and he's like my kids are millennials so they're 20 ish so he's a little old so 25 and under I think are the Millennials when they were 10 the internet was around a marketing term so you can mark it to them differently so to me I would put them in the same been just as you were thinking there they have a different relationship to science and technology did not Dental fear the science or the technology they embrace it because it has shaped the civilization that is unable their social life it has but through this like the one who thinks I tweeted I think it was from Scientific American yesterday news yesterday that it's a little bit misleading but want to think they said it's only 64% of Millennials have a strong belief these things these coasters are terrible they look great but then things stick to the bottle was it made of metal a metal coaster.
Tyson,stick shift when it gets moisture.
Interviewer,you know about this we flipped it over and it took it over and then it what happened.
Tyson,what is a 64% of what of Millennials are not or only 64% are convinced the world is a ball the world is a circle that Laura's what is a spheroid so it is called oblique I'd like to see how that question would ask if they know that we are oblate and the thing is asking is Earth a ball that's a no we're going to ball on a slightly wider below the equator than a bit at the Equator so wear a pear-shaped oblate spheroid but it's not a pair that you would find normally if you found that. Like this fucking pair that shaped like a ball so these distinction these references and measurements are so small that if you found it on the ground you say there's a perfect sphere.
Interviewer,does the geographic Globes and you rub your finger over in the pile and you get the the the Himalayas yeah yeah you get the Rockies and gross exaggeration a real yes I do realize if you took Earth with all those mountains valleys and hills in it and truck it down to the size of a cue ball you'll be smoother than any cue ball ever machine.
Tyson,I guess.
Interviewer,yes think about it why I think think about this okay.
Tyson,no the Marianas Trench off the coast of the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean down okay thinking of the depth access to the deepest part of Earth's crust the lowest point on Earth's surface the Marianas Trench right off the coast of the Philippines the highest point on Earth's surface.
Interviewer,"the tip of a K1 K2 Japan I think it's K1 why would you name the tallest peak K2 good point about a mountain climber but I'm I'm just thinking where is k1 okay I think it is okay so now what's up how high up is that was 28,000 feet so it's like 5 miles up okay."
Tyson,the distance.
Interviewer,between the lowest point on Earth's surface and the highest point on Earth's surface is 11 miles.
Tyson,that's here to The Comedy Store that is less than the length of Manhattan.
Interviewer,oh yeah we are 8000 Miles in diameter.
Tyson,and those two points are very far separated from one another if you are cosmic Giant and you came up to Earth and you rub your finger over Earth's surface.
Interviewer,it would feel as smooth as a cue ball to you wow in fact it in this it in this book have a whole chapter called on being round which is all about this all about our perception of what is rounding what is not I had asked you to debate what men Flat Earth guys know I don't know I know we talked about it and we're going to have them on Skype not what we do and I think this is a diabolical plot so that the next time we can ship people on mass into orbit they all want to be the first in line cuz I know we're going to send them so they can see the round her they could be the first ones in space just so they can stop annoying the recipe I don't think you're correct I do have people that have met that don't believe because they the problem with YouTube videos is in Sprite with a lot of things but one of the things about being unchecked while you are discussing things as you can say things you can use big words you can sound articular.
Tyson,I'm smooth and you can do it in a very professional-looking manner will be passionately passionately convincingly charismatically and you your unchecked but if you did that in front of an expert and you showed him that along the way to go. That's not true stop this. It works. Let me show you why this is incorrect let me show you how you can prove that this is incorrect show you eject of truth about this is not happening render your argument invalid so people don't have any education and then they watch one of these YouTube clips they start actually believing this stuff makes sense because it's on track and I would say it's not about whether they've had education it's about whether the education they had teaches them skepticism of information and teach them how to inquire you realize it's just as intellectually lazy.
Interviewer,to believe everything you see as it is to deny everything you say yes why should someone.
Tyson,no automatically that Earth isn't flat yet I tell them in the next breath that the entire universe was once a small as a marble.
Interviewer,both of those sound equally Preposterous has evidence to back it and the other does not a very strong scientific theoretical and experimental underpinnings so when you are trained to inquire you don't either believe everything out right or reject everything out right you're trying to ask questions you train to probe deeper than the layer of information that comes to you that's what should be taught in school and it's not you did give you a book and say learn this and you'll get tested on it and then when you're done learned this what is an also there's a problem with being a inexorably connected to your first belief do when you have an idea and it's in your head it's very difficult for people to shake that I didn't they start arguing that idea idea becomes a party right down and they dig their heels in deeper an opposing view is presented themselves to these idea right it's it is who they are.
Tyson,so I try not to base my character profile on something that is not yet verified as objective truth this is very good thing to do it's only reasons why I don't have tattoos on my body.
Interviewer,stretching my face go on one of the reasons is there's nothing I am so sure about that I want to put it indelibly on my skin there's nothing I value in my mind body and soul so much in this moment that I want to indelibly etched on my skin cuz I want to leave room for me to have a possibly more enlightening thought later that would override whatever was my decision in that moment and since I count myself among the lifelong Learners I'm learning stuff all the time and say wow.
Tyson,that's good I didn't know that what that that's even better what time do you learned recently that you went okay let me know.
Interviewer,okay so the only recently I think I knew this when I was a kid but if you're playing basketball when you're shooting okay and you say oh that didn't go in oh my God she will let you know the rim they can maybe make the room a little bigger IQ score more often do you realize.
Tyson,two basketballs can fit exactly side-by-side through the opening of a basketball hoop.
Interviewer,really yes I guess it makes sense to basketball's top squeeze mind-blowing moment but that gives you perspective next time you watch a basketball game Fish how these guys can fly from the from the foul line in a in a Airborne slam dunk and not miss.
Tyson,because the area of the opening is four times you do the math it's four times as large as the ball itself right because of the different position so you could be.
Interviewer,so it's not that easy to accomplish but knowing this you realize how much easier it is to score then you might have otherwise thought I wonder if basketball recent it was a recent Revelation to Revelation basketball players occasionally practice with a smaller hole I think about this all the time I see if I was a basketball player you don't have practice with a heavier than you would never throw you off your ball it's a long time ago I bet they still don't they no longer do it because it's different the gripper I had matters to hell's going with f and in baseball you throw faster pitch to give you less reaction time the pool tables are very small pocket opening.
Tyson,nobody's supposed to a five and a half inch and so I would also a ball in the street in New York and still using basic with broom handle and so when the first time you play baseball officially is like wow and so stick ball players tend to transfer very well to baseball when your kid because you're at your instrument is bigger to smaller parts about it is Brazilian soccer players how good they are and the heat tributes to a different game that they play with a heavier ball that they do indoors it's a small heavy ball and because they do it in tight quarters and involves incredibly fast footwork for okay and movement and then these guys take that footwork and movement and it translates amazingly well to an open.
Interviewer,soccer field if they calculated that because what you would do is what should have always twice as much then it would only go half as far when you kicked it so then you make it feel half as large.
Tyson,I don't think they did drop the reproduce almost all of the Dynamics of the soccer game I think it was based on just trying to play a game and looking for the field is half the size right minigame base that makes sense playing sports on other planets with different routes very very fun thing to do if your a dork and people say dork and I say yeah thanks for the compliment Nerdist okay there it is accepted as well and also be the people that were like but now a nerd is like you can be a science nerd and people like it that's a girl yeah I'm an old movie nerd you can say that.
Interviewer,take a picture must have told you this last time I was on your show when I was a kid I was bigger than other kids I was always one of the tallest two kids in the class out of 30 sharks bigger than others in the day and I was also physically fit and Physically Active athletic but I was squarely in the geek Camp okay I had my slide rule back in the day walking down the corridor.
Tyson,you know you were also wrestled back I was Captain in my high school wrestling team so I was a geek person who could actually kick your ass okay and I saw how my fellow Geeks cuz that's the community that I socially car karaoke with treated by the football quarterback in the popular kids and the kids who are all beautiful and the ones who and I imagine my future as a superhero defender of the Geeks so that you put up a little you know bat signal whatever geek signal a few digits of pi tonight come flying wedgie in progress right I would just land and I grabbed the bully and and rip them off the the counter and I would just save the day this is there's my superheroes football players remote always it's okay I think they were awarded for the violence they also have brain damage.
Interviewer,cool kids spring literally across the board the majority of people who play football have CTE in as far down as seventh grade sentence for chronic traumatic encephalopathy encephalopathy... Encephalopathy like Mike Tyson so let me tell you that story about Christopher Columbus please so the dick story your story just something else okay I think him coming to America.
Tyson,was the most significant thing to ever happen in our species.
Interviewer,silence.
Tyson,not internet porn porn in another medium wow not a matter of gas does it exist or does it not okay I think was the most significant event to happen in our kind of amazing when you stop and think about the fact that at that point in time other than the Native Americans who lived here who is living in nomadic tribal existence very few people that had the wheel that had firearms that had all these things that it already been achieved in the rest of the world have made their way to this place when I watch okay here's how it worked so I presume that you have some skepticism of this claim as most people would especially the the Columbus haters were out there all right. I don't really have any nepotism about it to let me describe to you why I think this is true.
Interviewer,you can tell me what you would you agree or not alright.
Tyson,we are hunter-gatherers we haven't settled down yet early humans and we're basically wondering we're following the herds alright Anthony ice age hits.
Interviewer,what what is an ice age and Ice Age means it is so cold that when the moisture evaporates from the oceans goes to the clouds the clouds go over the land it doesn't rain it snows.
Tyson,and the snow falls and it stays.
Interviewer,so the water that had lifted up from the ocean does not return to the ocean it accumulates on the land and this accumulation when it's significant and sustained we called glaciers.
Tyson,glaciers is not itself a snowfall it is compressed snow that's basically change State into this this ice river that flows very slowly back to the ocean but the oceans are getting drained faster than they're getting replenished so during the Ice Age the ocean levels dropped.
Interviewer,exposing the Bering Strait land bridge between Asia and what is now Alaska basically North America.
Tyson,the our ancestors will come out of Africa going to Europe so I'm staying other is kept wondering some stayed low above the Mediterranean others went hi they populate Asia they keep walking because it's on land bridge there didn't even.
Interviewer,just more land so they walk and they enter North America from there this kind of way you can go with South at that point the weather gets a little better and.
Tyson,the glaciers melt back into the oceans the oceans level ocean levels rise closing the land bridge.
Interviewer,stranding a branch of the human species.
Tyson,"for 10,000 years those humans who made it across that land bridge and spread out into North America Central America South America."
Interviewer,have only a few families as their parent genetic as their genetic origin okay well it's like some research as like a family lineages populated the entire North or South American continents in the land bridge breaks.
Tyson,now you have Europe Asia Africa.
Interviewer,and North and South America and they know nothing of one another.
Tyson,two separate branches of the human species the Vikings notwithstanding maybe they found came over and they didn't even if they did their influence was near zero relative to the Europeans influence here.
Interviewer,"this is a branch had this continued this how you speciate this is why the species on Australia history of mammals they would they have pouches right no other mammals do that they split off and they have all their own way okay so 10,000 years is not enough to grow three heads or do you know 12 fingers."
Tyson,but our species as separate now Columbus crosses the Atlantic.
Interviewer,"makes contact with humans this is the first time that has happened in 10,000 years."
Tyson,we have rejoined two branches of the human species.
Interviewer,we are now one common genetic group.
Tyson,and that genetic cross-breeding continues to this day we we fly to any corner of the world inmate okay in the meeting already began immediately yes it would diseases that Columbus brought to North America much written about that let's written is that he brought syphilis back to Europe First cases of syphilis in 1492 from the Native Americans what did they have no problem with it well I don't know the details of how the physiology of the natives dealt with that or whether it mutated you know how to make people know that I'm not among them that's fast just look at you look at the graph of syphilis reported syphilis cases in urine it all began in 1492 when he came back so.
Interviewer,this was a hugely significant event the rejoining of the branches of the human species but yea though I would imagine that that makes sense that is the most important event that led by the way Native Americans you know it's famous Infamous problem with metabolizing alcohol okay with Native American you know what else has a problem the Chinese.
Tyson,Badoo yes yes so it's an Asian issue well so who stayed in it so you look at who populated North and South America.
Interviewer,after the year before the land bridge is whoever was right at the edge of Asia then the land bridges are so so so Asians and and North American at the natives of North and South America have more in common with each other because of this then most other pairs or groups you might grab around the world but my point is obviously there's a lot of blank Columbus were but he just happened to be the guy who did it first Europe was coming to the new world no matter what everybody was trying to find it the faster trade route to the Indies and so it would if it was in Columbus would have been Arnold's mednik whatever it doesn't matter somebody did that and the rest is as they say history so personally I think it's the most significant thing to happen in our species otherwise we'd still be to stranded branches of humans.
Tyson,it would be fascinating though like Australia stranded to see what would happen if this is gone on for hundreds of thousands of years that would have been a different story right into your yeah that's a big concern about aliens right one of the big concerns is that there's some sort of a virus that you pick up from somewhere I think that's harder to accept so free Tampa what are the chances that a oak tree would catch whooping cough different species tend to be very species targeted so there's a jump man with a mammal does a vertebrate to vertebrate but so yes that can't happen but the more different the life for MS.
Interviewer,it is sensible to suppose that the less likely you going to share the same diseases that's all but NASA regardless has safeguards in place but in the event that happens so it's it's called the planetary Protection Program Vanessa Scott is a whole division of mask it's protecting Earth from bugs that could be coming from space on our own spaceship that we bring back and it protects destinations from us there's a certain sterilization levels that we invoke the Cassini spacecraft.
Tyson,we plunged that back into Saturn it is death when we were done with it and ran out of money we're done with it plunged into Saturn to vaporize we didn't leave it in orbit around Saturn why cuz it might have crashed into one of Saturn's moons that might have life.
Interviewer,if someone hits sneezed on the spacecraft before it got launched we don't want to contaminate the life that we were later going to one day want to study.
Tyson,that's what we plunged it into Saturday that's why that is why cuz they were worried about that maybe hitting your Ropers like she's dead and you can't track it or guided anymore then it's a it's a while it's a while card am I there other moons that have some ocean water the Water World basically and the concern is that we would introduce life suppose we did it crash and then we go back later and find life and it has DNA just like here but was it our life that we can't aminated with.
Interviewer,you don't want to confuse the future science of it so that's what that's the plan can you even watch a science movie like science fiction movies I know you had a real problem just right here okay let me let me just go on record okay okay.
Tyson,I've been deeply misunderstood with my comments on movies.
Interviewer,deeply misunderstood deeply deeply and so I just stopped was last time you saw a movie comment in my Twitter stream they haven't you haven't I've kind of just wasn't the Matthew McConaughey movie did you comment on that one the one where they at where am I right now then thought I was just being nitpicky it's not fun going to the movies with you why would you did say that can never happen and so so my intent was my intent did not match how people received my intent my intent is here's an observation that I think if you understood this it would enhance your appreciation of the movie Let me Give an example please do Star Wars the Force awakens they've got you at.
Tyson,that's only that introduced bb-8 okay fella cute little fella and in there they have they like the updated Death Star member the old death star has no power to destroy a planet and that's devastating this one.
Interviewer,it can suck energy out of a star so that the star no longer exists then it could take these energy beams and kill six planets at once it's no longer just a one Planet Killer 6 or 8 whatever the number was it was like high single-digits okay well I did the math on this and I tweeted and I I said first okay if you take all the energy from a star.
Tyson,you become a star but maybe they got a containment mechanism I'll give it to them it is the future after all the future but what a long time ago in a galaxy far is another another Another Universe of civilizations okay but they have Lightspeed and we don't so it's the future of our technology even if it's the past of our time who so so you do the calculation and I forgot the number but I got. I calculated how much energy is stored in a star.
Interviewer,that's enough energy to explode a thousand planets oh my gosh under-represented the energy that it sucked out of the house at all out of the start and I thought this could have been more badass than even they came up with in this movie that is the nature of my comments not could this happen could it not happen let me give you a perspective So So 20% of people just get pissed off 80% really like it and they want more but that 20% they they cut me no slack and I'm only doing this for people to enjoy it if I have that level of hate mail I don't need to continue it I've tried to basically stop. I have these thoughts to myself but I don't have the urge to share them I got to teach you the art of post and drop.
Tyson,okay this what you do you post something don't know people going to get mad you drop your phone and you walk away with too many human being I get that but you don't because you still changing your behavior here's my rebuttal rebuttal rebuttal it okay if you're watching a movie that takes place in 1958. Peace and there's a car from 1960 and I'll be crazy and someone who's a pretty good do you complain that the person noticed I know you praise their expertise I get mad at the movie and if you would get mad at the movie if you're watching a Jane Austen. Peace and of 1870 whenever they took place and someone gets out of the carriage.
Interviewer,what tie dye bell bottoms you would cry foul don't take you up I'm exaggerating it obviously had instead of a derby you would cry foul if you were a costume designer and we would all be impressed by that level of knowledge that you exhibited I am bringing a level of science to bear on a movie that is no different from anybody else's expertise who was out there that we have praised for that invocation yet people are not granting me that Latitude to make those comments I don't like what these generalizations I don't like this is what you're saying people are not doing this no a small vocal minority that are assholes and those the people that you're all turn your behavior for that's what I think is ridiculous about that. Because my eyes are you talking about gravity in the fact that hair wouldn't do that in the space stations weren't that close together on.
Tyson,it's assholes my tweets are offerings do not but I'm not I don't want no problems urinating responses that's the problem the only problem is you're reading responses know you do is wonderful 20% freak out is high for me when it's five percent then I take notice how do you say 20% like what are you doing calculations you actually do know a hundred twenty of them that's just run into 20 assholes and so 20 assholes out of the millions and millions of people that follow have decided to reach out and you're altering your behavior for assholes.
Interviewer,I like those quotes I like when you when you when you break things down cuz I didn't know those things I like thinking about like the hair and grab it was like oh yeah I fucking shit be standing straight up in the only reason why I mentioned it but it was long here would happen to you but it was long hair in space it standing up on head Cheryl's it's a completely obvious thing that was omitted from the filming of gravity yeah but you have their hair and makeup deaf dumb reason exist so so what am I to I might take a poll I might put it by my pillow.
Tyson,how do I force feed curiosity have to listen to your feed no one else to wash it anybody anything you pretty offerings out there like you said is that for speeding and not knocking on someone's home wake up bitch read my shit that is true I'm not forcing myself on your property to hear me talk about your movie first I said BBH way cuter than artoo-detoo and I use like 5 days in the way just to just to start a fight cuz that that's a fun fight right then I said by the way aren't bb-8 a smooth metal rolling spherical ball would have skidded uncontrollably on sand.
Interviewer,in-home movies were moving around on Sand right yeah it would that's why you deflate your tires to drive on imagine Steele tires on a sand dune holy shush oh yeah so if you have a hard surface just below it a dusting of us and then you court yet then you can dig into it connects to the heart surface posted this and people you're ruining the movie for me and then people started these assholes again when you say people you just listening to assholes smart people going to read oh yeah yeah this is stupid it would roll around.
Tyson,yeah I'm just a fucking thing some tractor Treads it was actually happened as a result I think I'm getting phone calls from producers to make sure you don't treat them good so you keeping them on as you know I might be most famous among the movie commenting for the final scene in Titanic okay if you knew about this but would you say about the final scene we know where the Titanic sank the longitude latitude we know what time of day tomorrow so at the P of o v the point of view of rose as she's looking up deliriously to the sky is only one sky she should have seen it was the wrong sky.
Interviewer,whose horse that was worse than that the left side of the sky was a mirror reflection of the right side of the sky did you call James yeah I know the sky I dis is what I do yeah okay so no reply 5 years later I bumped into him at a meeting or NASA hosted meeting with some explorers and some scientists I brought it up to him and he says well at the time I was not overseeing post-production and that's when we added that I'm immature Lee 1in to grovel at my feet for forgiveness did you go to that one of them too but that's not what happened so then 5 years after that I brought it up again when I bumped into him and then he said you know last I checked the Titanic Titanic is earned more than a billion dollars worldwide imagine how much more it would have heard if I got in the sky correct.
Tyson,that's a stupid answer from an asshole so that was okay I have nothing more I can say you're cuz he's right okay no he's not he's right out of money and it would have made the same amount of money that's true but that's not the point but he's wanted you fucked up bitch week later I got a phone call so high I forgot he said I work post-production for James Cameron he's producing a director's cut where he's adding new footage and he tells me you have a sky he could use so the Centennial release of Titanic.
Interviewer,released in April 2012.
Tyson,oh yeah that's right yes so it's got so us we actually put it so he did come through so here's what happened Seth MacFarlane calls me up and said I'm making a movie about a talking teddy bear and I need to know the sky over a town outside of Boston in 1985 on Christmas Eve looking North Northeast.
Interviewer,you got a sky I said I could get back to you a half hour later I sent him this guy that was the sky that the kid wished on to Wilford where Ted came to life Ted had the correct Titanic did not see that one Titanic zero on that so the point is to put people started thinking about it and it's the highest compliment I ever got was Andy Weir who wrote The Martian.
Tyson,he said to himself while he was writing the novel he said cuz he's an engineer so he has the fluency and he's also knows how to write he's right creatively he said if Tyson were looking over my shoulder what would he would he tweet about this or not and so that put them on notice to make sure that his calculations were accurate and the Martian is one of the most entertaining Lee accurate Explorations how to invoke science to not die that there ever was so for me that was a very high compliment and it was kind of worth it all of the naysayers that to know that Andy Weir came through on that.
Interviewer,yeah so why stop I'll maybe maybe I'll change I think you need to learn how to post and drop or just think about it like this post a little walk away walk away just go do something else man you don't need to look at that shit you don't need to look at what people are going to say make sure that there's no typos that's always a struggle I care though I'm sure you do care about what how people can think.
Tyson,out what I wrote if it's a way that I had not considered.
Interviewer,ay I like knowing it it makes me a better Communicator when I'm in front of an audience I'll know what percent will think one way vs. another and I can modify what I'm saying to be more precise into as we say in physics to reduce the impedance between the signal in the receiver so if there's a better match between the communicator and the audience I understand that but if you see call jokes that people just took the wrong way oh yeah I'm trying to just didn't like what I'm saying but surely like you see the word cock in a response you know the person is an asshole right there's just certain things you just see like you're cook like okay enough to listen anymore now I know what you are right you see that still know the times are the fucking Sky instead of fill in the blank I get those are just assholes well I have pretty sure I can so it's not but it upsets me it's that I'm here to serve you not to piss you off or not.
Tyson,there's some people that cater they're looking to get angry and not real Avi.
Interviewer,the arrogance of thinking that you could fix other any plus years of worthless shitbag living with a couple of tweets okay.
Tyson,and you know something I don't even want to take you up on that challenge cuz you're probably right I'm telling you you got a lot going to walk away but for most people myself included in those most people I enjoy those tweets and I want something here's one so I tweeted something and somebody responded to somebody else's tweet said you know I don't really like Tyson he's such a he's so pompous okay so so I tweeted back to that person and I said thanks for your note but could you please share with me the single most pompous thing you've ever seen me do.
Interviewer,and you wrote back and said damn you would have to be reading my tweets with you I can't think of anything right now but overall I really like your work kick put nothing forward that happens all the time because people just shocked that you respond. Plus there is people can get into a stereotype mode where there is doubt that person is that and they're free every state they just decided they decide for the compass is that that's not your science educator.
Tyson,I interviewed on StarTalk I guess you were one of my gas but so too is Katy Perry that you're going to do people get pissed off cuz I said she she wrote a song by Boney an alien I don't want to find out what she was thinking there's always ways you can fuck Russell Crowe a few times or what's his name Peters sorry Russell I don't brand what is a bushel.
Interviewer,what's up Russell Peters a good friend of mine is like so what the fuck my brains out of it you're married I didn't notice so he's like an alien is my point is very odd. He's out there and I'll be like one of those guys that would be in the Men in Black aliens that they're tracking to remember that scene in the headquarters is a big boy wear to cover alien all aliens and you like Michael Jackson who just do something a little different about them you know so it would just be for the really do believe that the believe that there's aliens amongst us again and we live in a free country I'm fine but.
Tyson,you know what happens evidence at some point should matter but yet you find out about like Russian agents have been living in like New Jersey for like 30 years of the whole premise of The Surreal story to me really has happened on multiple occasions and so they wonder if the Russians won't do that what are the aliens want to do.
Interviewer,yeah so just find me one yeah maybe there are doing are you open-minded to that course oh my gosh I would love to meet the aliens have technology that we don't have to compare notes I want to oh my gosh do you go in the movie arrival.
Tyson,with a which one the Octopod to arrivals early arrival with Charlie Sheen land 7 freaky things with speaking ink ink right so so they said the physicist and an anthropologist Anthropologist a linguist and I tweeted I said you know if aliens come I would not send a physicist and Linkedin a linguist I would send it up an astrobiologist and a photographer.
Interviewer,but then the linguist got all upset and they've been started piling piling on what they all are but did you just look up the time what would her profession was so so they all piled up the big moment so I get it that's fine but there are a couple of things so for example there it is making these circles in their interpreting them but it's making them on glass so how did you know we weren't seeing them the mirror image of what he was trying to communicate that's that was not addressed in the film back but cuz your protection is of extreme importance but this happens at all Sci-Fi movies you go up to this thing you get lifted up against the force of gravity.
Tyson,that point I was just put down all my weapons.
Interviewer,what's going on it's way beyond your understanding of the laws of physics yeah you know it's like pulling out your pistol is shooting at the spacecraft across half the Galaxy 2 to come to you what are you doing clearly Superior to you in ways that you don't even know yet so just find another way to do your talking rather than sending bullets their way but is not always the case in every film I mean it's always part of the narrative is that the Primitive people fuck it up for the advanced civilization is coming here to help us or yeah it's never been good for the less technologically advanced civilization ever ever ever been going on right now currently not to sound pluggy but this one of the profiles here is a Captain Cook just a quick visit Hawaii only a couple of times in my life one of times I saw Don Ho in the show.
Tyson,he only sat down he's like big and heavy and old and he died a couple decades ago and heat the someone someone answer whatever happened to Captain Cook you know how you reply she said.
Interviewer,nobody's ever seen him since.
Tyson,people listening he's making things like he's picking things out of his teeth.
Interviewer,Motor Service in Captain Cook of late so is rumors are that you eaten by natives that happened to a lot of pirates so the bridge send Captain Cook to the South Pacific why will you look at his marching orders it's up there is what call the transit of Venus that's going to take place visible only from the South Pacific this is where are orbiting Venus it's in orbit are such that went Venus passes between us in the sun it actually is exactly between us in the sun you can watch it move the circle move across the Sun surface that it's rude device Okay so.
Tyson,if you measure that you can learn the exact scale of the solar system so you learn deep scientific knowledge about how far away the planets are and how far away the Sun is from the earth it was not known with Precision before that measurement was made so Captain Cook goes on his voyage to do this what is a pretty expensive Voyage flip over the marching orders open the envelope there use these new navigation techniques that use the sun moon and stars and map every Coastline you find and bring that information back to us.
Interviewer,within 10 years of Captain Cook navigating the South Pacific as well as the northern coast of Australia and New Zealand within 10 years Britain took control over those coastlines.
Tyson,pick a part of the British Empire.
Interviewer,hegemony at its finest on the premise that ease observing something about the universe but there was a tandem role that he played I did not know they knew that much about the cycles of the planets that they could be there they knew accurately they could be in one of the motivation part of the motivation of knowing any of this was navigation around the globe was navigation to know where you are on Earth you can get your latitude that's just the altitude the height of Polaris the north star above the Horizon measure that at night you can wait that long you know where you are and longitude ships would would be shipped with millions of dollars worth of Commerce would be at the bottom of the ocean because they didn't know where Coastline was the only way you can make a coastline and see if you have good navigational tools and tactics which involves an accurate chronometer a time keeping device for your brick and knowing what the Sun.
Tyson,when stars are doing in your sky so the astronomer in that day was crucial to the mapping of the earth and whose mapping Earth is it just geologist for fun no it is Nations wielding power over regions beyond the beyond their own coastlines hear back from 17 what do I get to 1757 James Ferguson.
Interviewer,1757 here's a quote of all the Sciences cultivated by mankind astronomy is acknowledged to be and I'm doubtedly is the most Sublime the most interesting in the most useful for by knowledge derived from this science not only the bulk of the earth is discovered but are very faculties are enlarged with the Grandeur of the ideas of conveys our minds exalted above their low contracted prejudices notice he lifts mapping the Earth First.
Tyson,very talks about how exhausting and a grander so yeah it's an exercise in dominance in hegemony in power under the guise of studying for all this texting help there's an auction to little earlier the the the the Muslims used in extra laid okay dude got by the way what's the number it's a third or two is that I forgot that the fraction around a half of all stars that have names in the night sky have Arabic names.
Interviewer,because in the Golden Age of Islam a thousand years ago navigation was a big deal and they navigated using astrolabes which is sort of the the the Islamic counterpart to the Sextant octant they were used what is Master P or ask her if you can find a stroller that looks so different discs that you can replace the penny of where you are in Earth to be to know where you are more accurately so this is all navigation so that was almost like chips for a GPS device found that somewhere you go ok aliens been a heavyweight.
Tyson,Champions at thousand years ago so you know this is 700 years ago 600 years ago 5 the Ottoman Empire and spreading their influence and they've got they've got astrolabe to this is this song you don't even worry about this in school can only hear about the rest of Europe Christian Europe.
Interviewer,so this mess device and these are dolls that turn looks like I would have had to complete looks like art it looks like some bizarre looks like an alien and simpler one that has the spirit of an astrolabe but I don't know that if they would have called that an astrolabe the other think they go way back and so detective the most decorated ones or the ones from the Middle East the point is.
Tyson,GPS is no different from the navigation Tools in in concept from the navigation tool that Captain Cook invoked for Britain to then take control over all the South Pacific that they did it is where are we and do we know this information with precision.
Interviewer,and so and what happens if an enemy for steaks out our GPS and we have so much depended on it what are we going to do we got people now working on using navigation by pulsars can't take those out cuz those are cosmic you're sending highly time two pulses that reach Earth in different places on the sky and by measuring them you can and the time delay between one and the other you can actually localized yourself on her surface with extremely high Precision it without any use of satellites.
Tyson,what's the future of navigation where you were insulated from a rogue nation that might want to take out your satellite the Trump space horse you know that whole lot of trump haters out there and but if you want to hate Trump rationally you want it not hate him no matter what he said you wanted valuate statement by statement what he says right that's what you want to do he says I want to space force think about that okay and it was Second World War II there was the Air Force except they were not their own Branch they were part of the army was called the Army Air Force and then we realize a command and control in the air needs different kinds of soldiers there cuz they have to be Pilots it's a different kind of decision making different kinds of tactical actions you would have in the in the theater of operations and so it was sensible to spawn off a new branch of the military call the Air Force no one today would question whether that was a good idea.
Interviewer,today you should know that operations in space in the vacuum of the universe is a different regime that you're operating in from moving through the air.
Tyson,your Hardware looks different your your strategies are different your decision your command and control is different so it's not a crate just cuz it came out of Trumps mouth doesn't make it a crazy idea that you might want a space for us if that guy had proposed to space force in 2001 when I was on a commission appointed by George W bush to explore the future of the United States space Aerospace industry how come it should have 12 I put it on the table Air Force generals their former members of Congress people from Lockheed Martin and people say about the Air Force's currently overseeing space United States space command say but he was happy with it and so I find that's okay let's not worry about it if anybody as long as this needs of our presence in space growth but more importantly the size of our assets as long as that continues to grow.
Interviewer,what else would the military do be on protecting your borders they would protect your assets and our space that sits by day day by day or growing by Leaps and Bounds so if it's not like satellite satellite station and the value of the cost of the satellite is a diet it's at the satellite to you write the the military's now creating a whole other GPS system that is will be exclusive to them then they're going to see the current GPS to what if we done with GPS this hard-earned engineering and physics and orbital mechanics what are we done with the GPS we now use it to find out who you want to mate with.
Tyson,oh someone's in your area yeah that's what this was Tinder this is Grindr this is show me Mabel people within 20 square blocks of where I am that's a GPS on Grindr implies you're making a baby have sex with that has a certain economic value to society is so does Uber so do all the things that so does UPS tracking their trucks so it's not the cost of the satellites the value of the satellite to our economy you want that protected make sense is there a space force currently like is it real or they recruited as United States going to make a space force you would offload you would offload the space activities of the Air Force space command command primarily to the space force.
Interviewer,and then add or subtract from that in whatever way is sensible given the Neath if we have is what I want to see how about that for 12/9 should to be someone a little bit more thorough that's not how it works not scientist anti-government so.
Tyson,private Enterprise is not good at doing expensive things that have never been done before I need government money does it first okay then you learn where the hostiles are we to Friendly's are where are they what patent did you need to make this happen then the venture capitalist meeting about what I'm going to make a buck on it has some has some some teeth in it how much will this cost will we know because the government did it and we think we can do it for half that price is it dangerous yes the government did this and they lost two people but we will put Protections in so we won't have that risk what is the return on the investment the government got no return cuz they didn't that's it wasn't the objective but here's how we can bring up so I'll do it second I won't do it first this is how you get the Dutch East India Trading Company.
Interviewer,they were not the first Europeans to the new world cuz where's the edge of the Earth will you find India where will you be what you don't know any of this.
Tyson,be screaming at you sorry you don't know any of this Columbus does it first he can tell you where this food and where there's isn't that where there isn't that where they want to kill you in where they don't they have that information to the mark to the mercantilist and they make a buck after the fact so they come in they come in that's how you do it came about people making planes in the garage the government so this could be a cool thing let's pay them and have them compete to carry air mail new kind of mail mail delivered by air show that's cool so now I make an airplane cuz I want that contract you say no you want the contract you make an airplane that cat has more cargo a better engine you're clever now you just took the contract from me know I make a bigger airplane that's all I see what he did there but now I can improve on that now.
Interviewer,wait a minute I don't need to carry mail I can carry people.
Tyson,this is boring commercial airplane government basically bankrolled it as did prize money for accomplishing certain achievements like Lindbergh no one talks about the fact that do is cash money available to him for having done a flown across the Atlantic solo First Cash Money no kidding I did it for the money has most of them did fly the longest the highest the fastest each of these had money associated with it so this drove the marketplace it was not whether you could make a product out of it initially cuz you got to get over the early humps.
Interviewer,you got to get through to get to know what it is that works and what doesn't so is there a plan with the space force are they going to make space weapons and spaceships there's treaty in 1962 which we are signatur okay and I talked about it in accessory to war it's at the end I hate I feel so bad doing this.
Tyson,yeah I just feel but it but it is for the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military you look beautiful with that but they're all here being shot by a Sagittarius that became a weapon in a missile that and Europe your bow and arrow guy.
Interviewer,last I checked you got a freaking bow and arrow in the back room here yes would you afraid I'll practice when the zombies come and run out of bullets I'm pulling the sword out like the chick from Walking Dead be the best weapon in fact so myself out their weapons asteroid uses of outer space in 1967 there's some modification since then but that's the basic one and we are signature to it it's over the other major countries of the world God damn space pussy shit too.
Tyson,it's a beautiful document it since try to be very forward-looking if there's an astronaut from another country who is at risk then you will go to help them without question it's very Kumbaya okay so one of my sodas now that I'm old and tired and I just I'm a realist it's why should we promise to not kill each other in space when we are not successful at doing that here on Earth and we don't even promised and I feel each other here I want to do it here on Earth space will all hold hands maybe they'll do that you know but I don't have that much confidence in human conduct I become cynical over my years and I'm angry demonstrate to me that on Earth you know how to not kill one another then I believe your space treaty.
Interviewer,so I'm saying here given that there is a treaty it says you can't put heavy weapons in space as I detail in one of the 12 years ago and I will never finish this for a thousand years I bought in the co-op in August Lane who is a longtime editor of my essays that I've written for Natural History magazine just give a shout out to my co-authors so the sort of takes your stuff in stitches together in this particular case there's a lot of ways we collaborated some of them I just dictated entire chapters 2 & but leaving out certain details that would require and needy greedy of sort of research just to get the right numbers in the right year in the right commander and the right this but I know broadly how it happened in what sequence and so then she would take that in shape that into a chapter other places I would say you know this happened this happened in that happened she would say bold that wouldn't fit the narrative as it's.
Tyson,together let's drop the middle one and take the other two that's a great so I write that up and she would Stitch it she would graft it is a better word into the rest of what was going on so this is even though their places here where I speaking first person it's actually it's it's a co-written project is that goes through it and it's not I'm just putting my name but somebody else wrote I mean I write I know how to write so we're co-authors on there but thanks for asking it was good I'm so so here's a problem that we detail here.
Interviewer,I don't want weapons in space.
Tyson,okay there's nothing more useless than a space weapon relative to Earth's surface okay I use your skull here okay everything more spherical here I guess not I'm using your skull so okay alright.
Interviewer,and I said okay I would have weaponize a satellite put a bomb in it and I want to drop over some City some some bad person wants to make that decision right up here so you got it well no it's not just that these I'm not very high above the planet and so you have to like change the orbit to a line it so that it goes over your target.
Tyson,show me some go over every spot on Earth the only go over the orbit that had print reset for it okay we can already destroy a city with an intercontinental ballistic missile and we can paint that we can aim a missile to any place on Earth and we'll get there in less than 45 minutes.
Interviewer,and destroy the whole city with nuclear weapons we can already do that there is no advantage to putting nukes in space if that's your objective not only that but suppose there's a rogue satellite that is messing with you it's beaming energy particles at you and you want to take it out how you going to take it out you going to destroy it oh now you break into a million pieces the thousand pieces not each piece is moving 18000 miles an hour I put your own satellites it risk that's the modern equivalent to in the first world war when it's okay we have a good idea cuz we can't shoot them in the in the trenches let's gas them out so they have the mustard gas Loops the wind changed directions and all the sudden you become a victim of your own weapon.
Tyson,such as would happen if space if you going to start exploding satellites that orbit so wore in space is a different thing it's not what you think it would be too what would they do so that piece will you serve outer space treaty allows you to have defensive things in space not offensive or defensive purposes it allows So Pretty Outside though could you do could you I mean could you have and then he won't have anyone have sex with tonight that's the range of stuff that GPS applies to write and took affect our economy and affect our security and then our Navy can't talk to the Air Force the Air Force can talk to it and that would be bad.
Interviewer,Army's at Wars and no longer fought just by how many soldiers have you lined up at the at the border it's what have you done strategically to render your opponent I just rented through to weaken your opponent or render them incapable of fighting this is why the attacks on September 11th worked because we had a policy that if someone wants to hijack a plane you follow the instructions you do not deny them their request because the Assumption was that If you deny the request they will start hiring people and if you follow the request it will delay when they harm them if they harm them at all and maybe everyone will end up safe it was not in the game plan that they would crash the plane on purpose.
Tyson,okay so September 12th.
Interviewer,you will never again be able to do that to the American plane.
Tyson,forget the extra x-rays that we're doing a pilot will never relinquish the cockpit ever again no matter who they are torturing in the back of the back of the plane no matter what they're doing even the shooting people one-by-one because the plane going down takes everybody out so that was a pretty easy door to close literally and figuratively.
Interviewer,but no one saw it coming you know it drives me crazy when they put that drink cart to protect the pilot and they open the door I'm about that so it's just to delay you a fraction of a second to give them a chance to go in and lock the door it's you have to get through them and they flight attendant.
Tyson,that takes an extra second you can't just run and plus I don't even allow you to stand in the aisle while it's happening tell you to sit down sit down and get through the cart and the flight attendant who will be fighting for their life at this point okay and cuz you're the plane is everything but.
Interviewer,yeah I've seen that opening now you can get through there.
Tyson,those ladies I'm going to stop me nobody who really is physically does the point is you can I would never do it if course you don't know I thought about that but I thought to myself the plane that went down I was like I witness September 11th for Black Cat 6 blocks away from 6 walking block Ford jet plane hit no cuz I was blocked from the south so but I've camcorder footage of the explosion big explosion I've ever seen and by the way one thing I noticed is that there was no Shockwave I might even the closest scientists to the event so I was all I could do was applied every bit of physics that I know there was no Shockwave an explosion in no Shockwave.
Interviewer,and later work if you have to go to make a declaration wave you atomized Fuel and then you spark it then the flame moves across the fuel it's not a it's not a shock wave it's just a declaration wave and therefore there's no Shockwave in so windows are not blown out of quarter mile away as they were in Oklahoma city with the wind might bring this up.
Tyson,what was I talking about September 11th.
Interviewer,the plane I said if I was in a 767 and we're about to crash into a building.
Tyson,if I was in the last row of the plane how much time would elapse before the front row crumbled.
Interviewer,and it met me in the back row.
Tyson,given the speed of the plane going into the building 500 miles an hour slower than that by then I would say it's a known speed and I don't know but I don't think it was because you can't turn that high speed and Ethel I turn around in a name I have updates about a second less half a fraction of a second it's a fraction how long does it take a plane to go it's only likes when it's going 400 miles of instantaneous basically instantaneous you are you are pulverized.
Interviewer,pile of goo I think they're planning on making spaceships that can shoot down other spaceships so here it would be between stuff in space that that's all stuff in space like space space space space space how about another task of a space force once you clean of space for so that we can have tourism and not risk Our Lives by a paint chip or you're not going to 18004 bolt the word or nut movie at 18000 miles an hour that'll put a hole straight through yeah right so yeah I would like to see the portfolio of a Spaceport if there is a space for us Broughton the scope of that to include protecting us from asteroid and figuring out a way to clean up the debris of space is there a concept in place.
Tyson,no no no boy when you look at that map and I know the map is not the scale but that it shows you the known satellites in space Oh well there it is to scale in the sense that they're there is that many of us that many of its relative distance you can see their orbital line so it feels crowded it's it's so crazy when you look at it it's just like it's just littered and we're continuing to launch new things up there had I joke I say one of the reasons why we've never been visited by aliens issue they came to visit what is all that that's cool another planet I didn't know the map of where everything was and how to calculate their income and get it it's not worth it when you're on your way in you have to think about it going around in a circle using a new planet they had a civilization and they left a lot of crap in their atmosphere.
Interviewer,you would have. But that's not the debris that's those are The Satellites so if you so they both track debris and sometimes launch Windows of spacecraft pieces of shit that's floating around I'm going fast as I call my dad so nuts for some crazy been doing this for 16 years what year was that.
Tyson,the first artificial anything in orbit around the Earth and there was only one thing wow from 57 to 2018 right wow one thing that's crazy now how many things the dead ones and thousands of jets how to clean it up but maybe it's some big vacuum one day I don't know but yeah space vacuum.
Interviewer,did I feel valuable if you brought it back to her put this over here there was this asteroid that collided with Earth over Chelyabinsk in the Soviet Union in Russian sorry just near the Siberia in the Ural Mountains just on the coast of Siberia border Siberia that was visible to everybody in broad daylight and you have to like a virtue eyes when it happened and they felt a shock wave the Shockwave broke windows and sent.
Tyson,600 people that nearly a thousand people to the hospital.
Interviewer,what happened well because they saw the light and they can't they got up from their table and went to the window to see what happened.
Tyson,there's a time delay between the Shockwave and the light is light travels faster than sound travel slow windows in the shock wave hits and it blasts broken glass into their face does a big Band-Aid.
Interviewer,Collision that we had basically Band-Aids but nearly a thousand people were injured so at an auction but that actually exploded and pieces of it we recovered.
Tyson,at an auction I purchased a piece of that meteorite but you or else I purchase.
Interviewer,some of the shards of glass that the Shockwave at Broken Bow part of it is a shot across our bow.
Tyson,"that's what that no one died but it's a warning there's no better way to ignore and then to have a Band-Aid cover your injuries that could have vaporize you or rented your species extinct was crazy as the ones that don't even make impact still do devastating damage eyes tunguska yes to 10,000 square kilometers of forest holy shit yeah so 315 2013 and there is a half a ton through is it iron or the actual piece would have been about the size of this room so small home wow somebody that's amazing. That small rock please look at the size of that that's not that big that's what's left over most of it is vaporized on that on the explosion is it came through the atmosphere by producing did that piece of it weighs a thousand pounds."
Interviewer,I did I give it the weight of it yeah you guys okay over a half ton that's crazy I have to read that temp to know for sure but I think was an iron meteorite I'll tell you something but I have a knife that was made out of a piece of meteorite do I though the beautiful hole Yeah it's a kitchen knife that I see I mine is like a it's like a Crocodile Dundee knife yeah that's not a knife handle for it it's just it's just a metal that would be that was in Catch-22 forged metal with the blade but then you get a pearl handle attached to the basement and unadorned.
Tyson,piece of metal that would become a you know that right.
Interviewer,there is the metal I've never seen kitchen knives the metal goes all the way down the handle and you would see you screw wooden handles on the side so you just need the wouldn't I just need the wood or the or the if I'm patting it would be pearl you know meow like a pearl handled revolver part of history and it's a reminder that if you want to think about the future of civilization you have to include a defense plan against asteroid yeah I bet if they could they would have had a space program to not go extinct is there anything that we're doing now other than occasionally looking up real good looking through with monitoring and cataloging them yeah but we don't really know what to do if.
Tyson,princess how would you deflect an asteroid look how would you destroy ask her if you would die and what part of her birthday would hit very delusional ideas about what we can and can't do with asteroids and that drives me crazy you know if there's nothing in place for this project Sentinel you can look it up that is pest ask themselves with organizing World governments to protect Earth from species killing asteroids you need the world because you don't know in advance until it's discovered what part of Earth is going to hit and was going to hit in the Indian Ocean and if Indian if the surrounding regions don't have a space program or you are there countries that do have a space program going to sit idle know what you want to do is you want to have a fund and every country pipes in a little bit of their GDP.
Interviewer,and then what you want whatever measure it however you want it whatever you think is fair do it the way the way of the UN does it okay to miss a text of the world relative to your wealth and then that money pays to save the world when we find such an asteroid that that's how you get the Sentinel project Sentinel is is just walk this through so if there was something scientist ample time there's possible is a possibility that they could actually Implement so these plans it's all about how much time you have because what you want to do is go out and nugget little bit if you're a little bit you just have to give it a sideways velocity relative to its path towards Earth if you do that early enough.
Tyson,list the sideways velocity sorba cumulates right like a ship turning slightly over the ocean of the course of time it'll be V8 quite a bit correct so that angle grows bananas the same angle but then it spreads out and it's the ocean example is perfect there's a Perfect Analogy to view that early enough you do it enough so that it misses Earth and it's still out there to harm you in another day but it won't ready you extinct on that passage how much time do we need today.
Interviewer,I would say we could probably get something built in 10 years.
Tyson,Neil deGrasse Tyson what did you just do I'm in years I'm looking for a year if we have a year with good thing about species killing asteroids is that their large and visible little city killing ones that is not City so the probably at the ocean or Thor land but yeah if it would take out a city.
Interviewer,yeah there's a branch of government part of I don't fit survive the Trump change over but it's it's part of Homeland Security where it worries about.
Tyson,Devastation to a region where the grid is taken out as well so you can't bring emergency services that bring other food water medicine any other form of transportation or communication how much stars there to putting in a more robust grid.
Interviewer,yeah what you would need is that that's a good point so you need a grid that can show to rewire itself rapidly to then bring power to a region that that's what you would need and would this sort of doing that now making a grid sort of lightning proof you no power surge proof I grew up in New York City where they were a couple of very famous blackouts when a 1966 another and when was it 1978 I think and it was like whoa.
Tyson,how should this how is this even allowed you to have a back-up plan you like a way to rewire this to redirect the electricity so yeah you need that even want that and I thought the new grid is supposed to have those kinds of protections built into it but I don't know enough about it to comment.
Interviewer,yeah what all it takes is one One impact one big one takes out the grid takes off the grid and then what GIF solar power your place we just put in a pet pet solar panels yeah yeah I used to think of it as an escape because we thought of getting it after September 11th at 3:02 something like that but now it's just a good place for me to refuel and do a lot of good writing there in this order thing look out for ticks oh my God overwhelmed with lime. Apparently that prevent you from eating meat and one of those vegetarians bread that was I think it's called the lone star tick and it is from eating the meat of mammals yes makes you allergic to alphago.
Tyson,is that what it is it's alpha-gal another great Radiolab podcast Play Chiquitita mammal it's something in red meat yeah yeah so that's one of the challenges you looked at it the other day this week cuz I have quite a few friends that have Lyme disease and it's something you do keep for life and quite a few friends like seven or eight devastating Lyme disease and Tall East Coast. What to do making love in the brush like what are they doing walking around like you know even though I go for a hike on my deck go anywhere no no sit back and look at the other one on the deck but you're out there in the country don't you want to go wander around a little bit no.
Interviewer,it's honestly not a thought my wife would from Alaska has those thoughts all the time but the power ticks overwhelms her power of curiosity those are powerful people in Alaska it's a different type of their bread differently wrong those people can survive its really interesting comes from the fact that they're all in the same risk factors together and if the if you and I have the same things I can kill us that made out of friends it's also they're overwhelmed by Nature it's like they're overwhelmed by the both its beauty and just the sheer evidence that you're insignificant I would say they're not overwhelmed they are whelmed but is the right amount of well kill the moose in his driveway who like what that's the kind of stuff in the driveway they had to be careful like getting out of the house there cash the Moose when we first went up there my brother.
Tyson,wife's sister's husband the loaded shotgun over their bed so that when the door start rattling in the middle of the night the gun is in His Arms Reach and that's good do right now not a real one real one is up there's a look they give me I don't know who visited Denali Park but I saw this 500 yards away it's not any closer than that only park there a little bit habitualized to write know where was that near what part of Alaska is in there it's got its got Mount McKinley's got the nollie the mountain.
Interviewer,shut up so where is it it's I forgot a geographically but that's not like near the Brooks range right I couldn't tell you I'm not I'm not mountain range closest sheer size of Alaska when you actually look it up over the United States or the super impose at you oh what was everything fits you like five United States most of the world that's in there my face plus you're fucking crazy and trying to place but it's really interesting about Alaska's how few people there right now and I'm in such a long action density really cool City like if you go there you like all this is a cool ass Town nice people but if you go there in the summer bring some things to cover your eyes when you going to bed at night you're going to bed go today.
Tyson,it's so-so in the winter when they go to school and dark it's not night time is it Dark Knight and Day it's just kind of like yeah because it's only for a few hours so that's light and then it's dark to see that movie was it called 30 Days of Night vampire movie about Alaska know the vampires came to the movies I have nothing against them. Just know that smarts and I don't can't put that I don't see the romance romance scary the women who.
Interviewer,dear show I love when women put on a little show she's original female movie Badass but not before and I just reminded myself of this is it Barber rig Barbarella Barber rig Jake is her name she was the woman and the original British series The Avengers he was wearing black leather true martial arts and kicked ass wasn't believable but like when she's nothing like you but you might like looks throwing guy is like to you when you're making fun of me.
Tyson,movies about space it drives me crazy people just flip and people who they are and you drive me crazy I think I will post it now in your phone you have the fuck it out of the back of your lock screen is the Stonehenge of Manhattan.
Interviewer,your manhattanhenge and you have no case on your phone or when I got the phone cuz I admire have thin this that's fine I'd like technology serving me okay so what I do when I got the phone I said let me do this with it it around yes and I reminded myself why do in in the military cadets why do they twirl their gun of what possible value is this in combat why do they do these things with their gun and then I realized you're not supposed to drop your gun ever ever so if you tore all the gun and you don't drop it it means stuck in happened to you and come back and it is always attached to your body so I sent him so when I got my phone I said let me just do this.
Tyson,stuck in happened to you in combat and it is always attached to your body so I sent him so when I got my phone I said let me just do this.
Interviewer,okay let me just do this if I pick up the phone and so when you do that then you never drop your phone does not that I'm a risk-taker is that I changed my risk.
Tyson,okay let me just do this if I pick up the phone and so when you do that then you never drop your phone does not that I'm a risk-taker it's that I changed my risk.
Interviewer,to make it so low that it is centrally won't happen and you got AppleCare are you going to fix your own damn phone if it will the screen breaks you going to get in there with a screwdriver and pop that bitch out put a new one they keep the key phrases that if the screen break I also carry relatively expensive fountain pens what happens with that I never lose them oh I see what you're saying jack up at the same pair of sunglasses now for a record number of time where is lights linzess Jakes powerful 1923.
Tyson,play 923 but I got the same sunglasses now I think 6 months once you get that then it doesn't wrap so it's not that I'm a risk-taker is I change the risk so that is low enough so that it is on par with other risks that you take routine with my smoke a lot of pot dude this is going to drop by keep doing this if you pick up the phone with one hand and it's upside down you you you hold it in places where the center of gravity flips it but you also have some sort of a skin in the back of van Gogh's starry night but it's not.
Interviewer,recognize that section is good one of the things they decide to do two asteroids to change their path spray some glue on them and it literally cause more friction in the air and cause them to deviate slightly From the Path know her long. I don't know where you just pull that out of your ass that moment friction so some shit they could put on the if it's traveling right is there something they could put on that wood aerodynamically change its path in the vacuum of space there is no aerodynamics okay so it's moving other side of time it hits her it's too late so it so it's there was a coding that they were planning on putting on some aspect of would it be the act of putting the code that's what you do is you may be thinking of you can put on an asteroid that differently absorbs sunlight relative to the other side.
Tyson,that can create a net Vector of motion in could protect the Earth from space Rock threat okay so there you go that's some click-baiting shit okay change amount of sunlight reflected by the way you do it to a part of the rock potentially nothing away from Earth and the accumulated push provided by many thermal photons if they radiate from the wow holy shit yeah somehow you added KY Jelly to this.
Interviewer,I'm trying to put this phone still here and my friend Andrew Santino he carries his bitch around case free and I admire him braver man than I.
Tyson,send it to me I sent you a list of topics do we get all of them. All of them we didn't hit innovation in other countries Mac may I please 2 hours and 40 minutes into that allowed oh my gosh call Tom really are you sure on a percent yeah you sure yeah average podcast right now the average the ones we've done we've all been like close to 3 hours okay are you ready to hood. Okay so let's go back to flying cars let's go back to why anyone would want a flying car in the first place okay.
Interviewer,at state is only one road okay there was a width of your car.
Tyson,u driving on this road.
Interviewer,d the cars behind you the fastest you could go on that road is the speed of the slowest car on the road but make sense yes this is travel in one dimension that sucks.
Tyson,at you really want to travel in two Dimensions so you take the road and wide in it.
Interviewer,t's make two lanes two lanes in One Direction we have to the other way as well just doesn't matter here now I can go around you.
Tyson,your slow ass car okay.
Interviewer,but then it's fine this is a great Improvement on one dimensional travel now it's two Dimensions okay I can shift left or right as well as move forward or backwards to move and the more Lanes you have the more two-dimensional that is okay the 405 here in Los Angeles what is it six Lanes he just 12 freaking Lanes okay you are fully exploiting the 2 dimension ality of travel.
Tyson,you still have so many cars that you say to yourself I want to bypass this traffic.
Interviewer,if you went from 1 Dimensions to two Dimensions bypassing is just another Lane.
Tyson,but now all 12 lanes are plugged and you want to bypass it so you're thinking I need to travel in another dimension.
Interviewer,I want to travel in the third dimension if I do that I can bypass all these cars I want a flying car yeah okay well the point is we already have flying cars.
Tyson,the cold helicopters was Al copters originally invented for that they called helicopters.
Interviewer,they're noisy they have to create a downward thrust of are equal to its own weight.
Tyson,if you have a flying card that's what it's going to have to do.
Interviewer,they're noisy bear they completely disrupt the terrain wherever they fly.
Tyson,so the issue is not that you want to find car you want to travel in that third dimension we already do that I would do that the call tunnels they called Bridges when you have a huge intersection you don't move people through one another.
Interviewer,Builder.
Tyson,you build one road over the other you build one road under the other you are exploiting three dimensions so that traffic can go in perpendicular directions simultaneously that's what the flying cars would have given you but we do that at intersections because it would be impossible to move 12 Lanes of traffic through an intersection the cross another freeway.
Interviewer,New York City has done this.
Tyson,we do this the New York you're in the streets there's too many cars you can't move let's move in the third dimension let's build a Subway this sounds like a guy who's trying to sell me something other than a flying car that's what it sounds like bullshit I tell you what she ain't moving in the Third Dimension the New York City subway system moves a billion people a year and they all go in the third dimension beneath the ground through tunnels tunnels that are layered on top of one another will the New York City subway system is amazing I could move that many people it's great but it sounds good as a flying car but it's as effective as a flying car has a flying car on the subway.
Interviewer,what's up guys rub his body up against yours flying car so you just fly around I'm just saying took a boat tunnels of the air and bridges are flying cars the beautiful thing about a boat that you just go wherever you want to go you don't have to call Air Traffic Control of him turning left I would take you to another dimension not someone will have to know where the hell your car flying car is going to be traffic rules that matter in the street it is with boats you don't happens if a car fails false it's just it just stops flying carpet sales you did right so I want to add another dimension to this conversation in front of me okay I it's a physical debts can I have a lot of sheets of paper and and so I lay them side-by-side I tile the desk with all my sheets of paper then there's no desk surface left.
Tyson,I ran out of two dimensional space.
Interviewer,I want to store more pages on my desk what do I do I get one of those organizers I just introduced a third dimension so now I can have pages in another dimension sitting above the page that was previously occupying another place that I couldn't have put another sheet that's three dimension yes okay if we were two dimensional people we would wonder what happened to that sheet of paper cuz we have no access to that third dimension you would it would just left our universe at this point I'll be trying to back out of the showroom and I'd say thank you but I'm going to go to flying car place so now watch but look at how much you've increase your storage by introducing another dimension.
Tyson,now imagine a fourth spatial dimension.
Interviewer,we don't have access to that but we're now feeling all three dimensions and a four dimensional creature was I will just put it up in this direction will be the fourth dimension in that regard.
Tyson,you can't imagine it because our brain evolve in three dimensions we have we can describe it mathematically maybe a wormhole in Pasadena our storage needs would be you can open the door put it through this portal to the fourth dimension Brian and close the door and look on the other side of the door nothing would be there.
Interviewer,yeah just the way on the surface of the desk if you live in the servant that someone opens the door they put the paper through the door close the door you look around and see where did it go I've no idea cuz you can't even see you can't even imagine the third dimension we cannot imagine the fourth dimension.
Tyson,but if the world one day gets so crowded that even three dimensional space.
Interviewer,has traffic.
Tyson,access to a fourth dimension would greatly help that that's all I'm saying good luck with that can people to step through what is this Jamie thing that just came out loud oh look at this that way that's why I look at this thing what is it solar powered.
Interviewer,the trailer like showing at describing image of sound does it make sound looks like it looks like a human sized drone what it looks like okay what about something like that what about something like this would really powerful magnets also the outer edge so it repels against other drones sort of maglev flying car so if you get so close oh I should be like a force-field each other so if you like it I'll be like a bumper car has but with with cushions yes yeah some sort of electromagnetic force field that you know what everyone agrees that you don't have ones that are attracted to each other but opposed by they see how big that human human sized drone is I've ever heard how loud a drone is fucking loud you can't you can't you have a conversation with shotguns are for you I wish I had never fired a gun in my life first time ever use when it's to shoot a drone that's going to be looking for.
Tyson,my window at my apartment this is fucking asshole in my neighborhood he flies around all over people's yards but I can't uncork Rush of what they already think I'm crazy.
Interviewer,this is the way I know if I shoot with a bow and arrow I'm not sure I'll hit it by the way I did that video have sound company with it has them some a little bit there's music and some description of it now this is what they have on their webpage sure that it's quieter than a car on the freeway why does an electric car North 153rd and 50 feet that's incredible about the same as as a as a car.
Tyson,gasoline car is okay today or not in top of electrical energy consumption the same icon for electric cars does for gasoline car and then down no see it says noise it shows highway just car doesn't tell you what sound does electric cars are quieter than a regular car the all you hear is there a drone of the tires but what happens is above a certain speed the the aerodynamic noise is greater than the so it'll landing airplane go to the In-N-Out near LAX which is right near a landing strip yeah and listen to the sound of the planes as they come as they come in for landing most of that sound is airfoil noise.
Interviewer,which is why you can pretty much still maintain a conversation you're old enough we remember a plane would fly over head in a city and you have to hold your conversation until it finished why what happened.
Tyson,engines got quieter and quieter which is enabled people to build real estate closer and closer to airports and not have not having sound problems for what didn't happen overnight it was slow and steady kidding I never I forgot about that I forgot that you have to stop talking when I remember it affect the Shea Stadium in New York City near near LaGuardia Airport.
Interviewer,take to the announcers had to stop anytime a plane flew over if they could I could announce the game that's crazy when the Mets win the World Series in 1969 mayor Lindsay redirected the airport traffic to not fly over the World Series games was a badass move of him of his mayor Lindsay out there now there it's a sound that's in the in the noise of the street you don't even stop and notice it you didn't even pay attention all you barely hear barely hear it and so next time you're at a Runway when its Landing it's much noisier taking off cuz it's got to gain altitude coming down its most of that sound is glider noise and evidence of this is the noise of are going over there for the fuselage if you you know the moment they deploy the the landing gear.
Tyson,next time you're in airplane landing just listen to the Ambient sound of the plane then listen to the sound after they deploy the many times was loud it ramps up hard part because of the sound of the are going around something is not aerodynamic Wheels I just never for whatever reason I never remembered that airplanes used to be louder and I think about all the time flying car yet so you need a new wouldn't want it that would look ugly if two of those colliding in the sky but what about my magnets here to lift away to the magnet solar bro.
Interviewer,plus you get some testosterone infused guy who doesn't want to let you ahead of them. I love you. Kind of she break the propeller than you both fall out of the sky it's a lot of my rage the heard of testosterone driven men okay but what if they do it but the only way they work is through like the same for a Tesla system that allows them to have you know if you don't need flying cars on the road.
Tyson,how do you figure that oh my gosh automated cars and if you were cars are us how so because your greatest asset your car most people second greatest asset twins 90% of time doing nothing.
Interviewer,you tried to work it is parked if you come home and it's parked 90% of its time doing nothing okay I come to work 10 minutes after you a half hour after you an hour and a half to you I'm using your car use my car you tell you right now you're not using my car no one's using his car forgot this is LA to New York for people with utility rather than something you try to get chicks with on the street corner. He will try to get chicks in New York to don't drop that there's a lot of people to do in spots cost you a thousand bucks a month old baby.
Tyson,I've seen some fancy cars and I've been in New York City but that's not it's not it's not a hundred percent it's not a hundred percent yeah but that's just that one stupid spot but you'll be relegated to Elaine we won't be able to drive as fast as they automatically consider that if you want a self-driving car and it wants to change lanes and communicates that to other self-driving cars near it program break. I have a roof soundtrack Joe Rogan upload Russian plot car that's not letting anybody in the Joe Rogan upload should I feel like you wouldn't change anything if there's automated cars Los Angeles I really do I don't think I don't think there be any less traffic I just need to go to make a lame that will take automatic cars and it will go a hundred and twenty miles an hour and watching everybody with their wasted.
Interviewer,horsepower in there in there in there in traffic stuck in traffic and we passed or Lamborghini doing 40 miles an hour and that was just seems so embarrassing to the Lamborghini.
Tyson,you still doing 40 miles an hour we passed the label better it was like why do you have a Lamborghini because there's sometimes when there's no one on the road but I just got to go late at night get a Lamborghini Drive late at 9 what is the peacock feathers as best as I can judge Mount Marvel Avengers nearing and science you should appreciate it then go 0 to 62 and 1/2 seconds just go burning gas gas. If I don't have to do you prefer electrical you had a car if you lived in it for whatever reason the planetarium decided look Neil you're the best ever and we open up the most amazing up whatever it's in Los Angeles California would love you to relocate and bring the car I die if I was forced to relocate and had only one car and I get an electric car.
Interviewer,yeah I mean funny like a performance class of Cheez Whiz manufacturer isn't emotion you know if there's a dynamic to shitbox it is a dynamic one thing happened to drive something else to make that happen but when you plug your car into the wall you're not asking yourself I wonder where this power comes from you can come from anyone if it doesn't sources right Hydro it could be a pet solar panels or tidal energy you could come from New Mexico come from oil or coal come from any of the hood about clean call have you heard about this clean call the president's been tweeting about it Clean Coal all capital letters I didn't know about that if you can power things with a choice of a dozen.
Tyson,sources of energy the new sources of energy compete with one another for your business and the price of oil goes up you say I'm not going to generate power with oil used it and I have a wind farm and I come online I want to sell you my wind energy nice you're the power company you buy my wind energy you send the power to the wall outlet and you charging your car don't know and don't care where that energy came from.
Interviewer,there's a book called Turning.
Tyson,oil into salt look it up so we can mention training oil and salt correct why would you do that it was a day when salt was a strategic commodity yes there was no other known way to preserve food from the Autumn Harvest to the spring set of crops so who got salted there's the book what's the woman's name Miguel Lefton and Corrin okay so I'm now describing the thesis of that book okay turning on with this all so here's what you do so we had salt if I took away your salt reserves you would starve over the winter so everybody knew where this all came from everybody knew how much they're soft cost do you do realize that Grant General Grant.
Interviewer,destroy the salt reserves of the Southern Confederacy.
Tyson,knowing that that would.
Interviewer,force them faster to surrender because they wouldn't have food reserves to last through the winter.
Tyson,all right growing up Ned did not understand the phrase you are the salt of the earth.
Interviewer,salt give you high blood pressure what do you want what you mean the salt of the earth stop saying that that's not true sodium does finish the fact so they give them something wrong with you for that to happen so don't know what this weather is chronic or not that I agree with you there for chronic high blood pressure is not just but I can increase my blood pressure Now by not peeing and taking an interesting soft but not peeing why would you not pee well cuz you retain the water is pumped through this is what it's all cuz you retain look.
Tyson,okay so so why should salt-of-the-earth why is that a compliment I remember thinking to myself but it was a day when salt really mattered okay alright so.
Interviewer,so what happens the 19th century we figure out how to can foods you can have berries and put them we can you seal you can make my heart serves name of the food is what it is another way to protect your food to have it last through times when you don't have cramps.
Tyson,wait a minute Refrigeration compare electrician I can refrigerate food I got a half dozen ways I can eat over the winter and only one of them is salt so now salt has lost its strategic value lost his Mojo lost its Mojo it's still there we still eat salted food as I get a number for the flavor but it's a different thing culture two different thing now it's a matter of choice not a matter of necessity great food came out of that you know the Salted pork in the bacon and very tasty food came out of that movement okay so right now when you buy salt do you know where it came from no I want to see Hawaiian salt Gourmet Salt from Whole Foods just buying Morton salt do you know where I came from no do you remember how much it cost no there's to cheat for beauty even remember that.
Interviewer,okay.
Tyson,if you going to turn off oil into salt what you doing is you turning energy into salt.
Interviewer,that's the value of a plug in the wall.
Tyson,design a car that can run on 5 different kinds of energy.
Interviewer,did oil has to compete with the other kinds of energy I see what you saying so have an engine that's works on hydrogen have hybrids now that work on two different things it's a start but my point is if you do that then we no longer fight Wars for oil.
Tyson,what we fight for now.
Interviewer,maybe you don't fight for Freedom how about Freedom bro Freedom isn't free.
Tyson,Freedom isn't free we just did 3 hours 3-hour crazy how time flies by Astro physics for people in a hurry that's this was old and it's the old ones. Hurry on the New York Times bestseller list six pack in the military 3 to war of course you can pre-order but it's not out yet don't buy this book if you're not in a hurry yeah this is this is a long form book yes gentlemen you have to do some thinking has no pictures I just checked.
Interviewer,that's why you would never know the grass Tyson StarTalk radio it's on its podcast it's also on Nat Geo what Sirius XM channel 121 the inside channel on my dad and Cosmic look for Cosmos in the spring To Be Alright by everybody.
Tyson,thank you everybody for tuna into the podcast and thank you to our sponsors thank you. Black Rifle coffee so the best goddamn coffee I've ever had in my life I love it it's delicious I drink it all the time in fact I drink it basically every fucking day how about that bad ass roast to order coffee right to your doorstep.
Interviewer,and you can also sign up for their Club the coffee Club makes them super easy no lines no running out just great coffee ship right to your door every month bullshit free and it says bullshit free in the copy you know a lot of times I add stuff to copy to make a juice year I don't have to do that with these fucking guys cuz they're Savages I don't give a fuk and they're rich you know they got rich selling awesome coffee visit Black Rifle coffee. Com Rogan and you receive 15% off your order that's Black Rifle coffee. Com forward slash Rogan Black Rifle coffee. Com Rogan we did it got to the show got you the ads.
Tyson,appreciate the fact that you people tomorrow to not one but two fucking amazing stand-up comedians first stop birth mother fucking Christ that's right baby the machine La macchina would you say Bert Kreischer I will be here to hang out and also to promote his fantastic Netflix special which premieres this Friday August 24th.
Interviewer,very excited I think it's called secret time and then after him Jerrod Carmichael another fan fucking tastic stand up comedian good friend of mine awesome guy and see you know too many credits name all right and then this weekend we'll see you mother fuckers in Vancouver that shit sold out Abbotsford actually Abbotsford Centre Arena.
Tyson,and then Calgary on Friday night shout out to John and Jenn rivet my friends from Alberta you fucking people love you and hope you're doing well.
Interviewer,"So, how are you feeling about the discovery?"
Tyson,"Well, part of me, a secret part of me, wanted it to not be there at all."
Interviewer,"Oh, why?"
Tyson,Because then you'd have to completely rethink all the ideas that led to its discovery. It would have opened up all new pathways of thought.
Interviewer,"Can you explain to me what the Higgs boson is, in the simplest terms?"
Tyson,"It's a kind of particle that creates a field. Other particles move through that field, and as they do, the field gives them their mass. Without the Higgs, nothing would have mass in the universe; and everything would be traveling at the speed of light, since all massless particles, like light, travel at the speed of light. So it's a very powerful particle, and that's why everyone was so excited about it."
Interviewer,How exactly did they discover the Higgs boson?
Tyson,"Any time you build an accelerator that can create pockets of energy higher than anyone has created before, you're going to discover something. It's not conceptually different from the days of the great explorers of the 15th century. They go where the maps haven't been drawn yet, so they're going to discover something. The accelerator in Switzerland, CERN, probed matter at higher energies than ever before."
Interviewer,"I heard that the Higgs can help explain what ""dark matter"" is. What is dark matter?"
Tyson,"Five sixths of all the gravity we measure in the universe has no known origin. It's a mystery. We can track the black holes, the gas clouds, the planets and stars, and all the atoms. When we do, it accounts for one sixth of all the gravity in the cosmos. We don't know what's causing the rest of the gravity, so we're calling it ""dark matter."" But we don't even know if it's matter, that's just a placeholder term. And then there's another mystery"
Interviewer,That's so scary!
Tyson,"It is completely spooky scary. If you look at a pie chart of what we know and understand in the universe, it's a four percent slice of the pie. That other 96 percent is completely mysterious to us."
Interviewer,Can Higgs help determine if there are other dimensions or parallel universes?
Tyson,"That I don't know. I don't think so. String theory requires other dimensions and other sorts of understandings of cosmology, but all the experiments  There is not some portal to a parallel universe going on in Switzerland, you can rest peacefully knowing that."
Interviewer,"When we built telescopes, starting from Gallileo onwards, the telescopes were really extensions of our eyes. They enabled us to see things farther away and brighter and better. So we said, OK, that's the universe. Well, consider the bias that that represents. It's so biased that we didn't even know to ask if there were other kinds of light out there that were not visible. It would not be until the late 1800s or the early 1900s that we said, wait a minute, there's some other kind of light out there that's below the red part of the rainbow, the red part of the spectrum. We can't see it with the eye, but it's there, so let's name it"
Tyson,So to imagine higher dimensions is a very natural thing to do. Just because your senses have their own way to measure the world doesn't mean the actual world can be plumbed with those senses.
Interviewer,I wrote an article in March about how space is really awesome. I mentioned that the Kepler spaceship has spotted potential planets that might be habitable. Do you think there are life forms as developed as humans living on those planets?
Tyson,"Well, that assumes that humans are some measure of development. It may be that we're actually quite primitive compared to other species out there."
Interviewer,That's true.
Tyson,"In fact, you could argue that the reason that we haven't been visited is that  Just think about it!"
Interviewer,What are the most common misconceptions that people have about space?
Tyson,Number one is that they think the space shuttle and the space station are far away.
Interviewer,Are they actually close to us?
Tyson,"Oh, yeah. If you take Earth and shrink it down to the size of a schoolroom globe and you shrink everything else down to that scale, and then you ask:how far away is Mars? Mars would be about a mile away. How about the moon? Thirty feet away. How about the  space station's space shuttle? Three eighths of an inch above the surface of the globe!"
Interviewer,I honestly had no idea these things were so close. Now I feel stupid.
Tyson,"People will ask me, ""When are you going into space?"" And I say, ""Give me someplace to go and we'll revisit that conversation."" I'm destination driven. Take me somewhere."
Interviewer,"So, I follow you on Twitter."
Tyson,"Oh, thank you!"
Interviewer,And I saw your tweet about marketing science to girls and that ridiculous video that the EU made with that in mind. How do you think science could be better marketed to girls?
Tyson,"I think if real female scientists are interviewed, their enthusiasm will be manifested in the interview. It'll just come across. If you look at the second video I tweeted about, the a cappella song group, they love their work!"
Interviewer,Do you ever get really overwhelmed by the universe? How do you cope with not knowing everything about it?
Tyson,"The not knowing is the actual attraction of it. So many people only want answers. To be a scientist you have to learn to love the questions. You'll learn that some of the greatest mysteries of the universe remain unanswered, and that's the fun part. That's the part that gets you awake in the morning and running to the office, because there's a problem awaiting your attention that you might just solve that day. You have to embrace the unknown and embrace your own ignorance."
Interviewer,This week on moyers & company neil deGrasse Tyson on the new cosmos and our dark universe science is a is an.
Tyson,Enterprise that should be cherished as an activity of the free human mind because it transforms who we are how we.
Interviewer,Live and it gives us an understanding of our place in the universe funding is provided by and gumowitz.
Tyson,Carnegie corporation of new york celebrating 100 years of philanthropy and committed to doing real and.
Interviewer,Permanent good in the world the ford Foundation working with visionaries on the front lines of social change.
Tyson,Worldwide the herb alpert foundation supporting organizations whose mission is to promote compassion and creativity.
Interviewer,In our society the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation committed to building a more.
Tyson,Just verdant and peaceful world more information at macfound.org Park foundation dedicated to heightening.
Interviewer,Public awareness of critical issues the Kohlberg foundation barbra jean Fleischman and by our sole.
Tyson,Corporate sponsor mutual of america designing customized individual and group retirement products that's why.
Interviewer,We're your retirement company welcome it's been almost 35 years since PBS premiered one of his most successful.
Tyson,Series of all time carl sagan's cosmos many of you may remember as I do is elegant exposition of the universe.
Interviewer,Some part of our being knows this is where we came we long to return and we can because the cosmos is also.
Tyson,Within us we're made of starstuff we are away of a cosmos to know itself over 600 million people in more than 60 countries.
Interviewer,Have now watched cosmos but in the decades since the universe has kept moving literally moving in every.
Tyson,Direction and so has science and that's why cosmos is returning this spring this time on National Geographic Channel and.
Interviewer,Fox tv it's time to get going again our guide is the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson America's most popular.
Tyson,Scientist the unabashed defender of knowledge of a superstition and clearly the rightful heir to Carl Sagan's.
Interviewer,Curiosity and charisma so fasten your seatbelt for a whole new interstellar journey through tens of.
Tyson,Millions of years and hundreds of millions of miles to the farthest reaches of outer space.
Interviewer,Neil degrasse tyson is the frederick p Rose director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural.
Tyson,History here in new york where he narrates a breathtaking new show titled dark universe I took my 12 year-old.
Interviewer,Grandson to see it over the holidays and we were mesmerized imagine trillions of stars a hundred billion galaxies and.
Tyson,Light traveling a hundred million years before reaching us here on earth that very planetarium by the way is.
Interviewer,Where neil degrasse tyson a kid from the Bronx aged nine first felt the universe subpoena him to become a scientist in.
Tyson,Thrall to the night sky he's written 10 books including this memoir the sky is not the limit and this.
Interviewer,His most recent space chronicles facing the ultimate frontier oh yes I almost forgot.
Tyson,People magazine once voted him the sexiest astrophysicist alive welcome that was a few years ago absolutely you.
Interviewer,Only got it one i know don't want no bragging rights right but you clearly got more of the star stuff that Carl.
Tyson,Sagan said we're all made of you just got more of it than we did well yeah I've been touched by the Stars more.
Interviewer,Frequently than others but you were just nine nine nine years old a really trip my parents we were all native New.
Tyson,Yorkers and my parents knew well the value of all of the cultural institutions of New York City we went.
Interviewer,Every weekend to one or another of these institutions of not the zoo the art museum that many art museums the Hall of.
Tyson,Science and a first visit to the hayden Planetarium for me by the way I would ultimately go as a school trip but for.
Interviewer,Family i go there and i sit back and i'm certain I'd love the word you said I was subpoenaed by the universe I think I I.
Tyson,Had no choice in the matter i think the universe called me because when the lights dimmed and the stars came out.
Interviewer,When i was nine i'd never seen a sky like that in my life and you met Carl Sagan at 17 when you headed to the.
Tyson,Cornell yeah well so i applied to colleges knowing full well that I was interested in the universe.
Interviewer,My application to cornell unknown to me was forwarded to Carl Sagan he was a professor of astronomy there and I was.
Tyson,Deciding what college to go to he sent me a personal letter man I'm just the seventh he was already been on The.
Interviewer,Tonight show and had best-selling book there's a personal letter said I understand you're considering Cornell.
Tyson,And you're like the universe as do i so why don't you come by I can give you a tour to help you decide whether this is.
Interviewer,Where you'll ultimately attend so i went up there he met me outside the Astronomy building and it gave me a tour of the.
Tyson,Lab one of my favorite memories is he reaches back didn't even look just reach back pulled out one of the books that he.
Interviewer,Wrote assigned it to me and i said that is awesome and I said to myself if I'm ever in a position of influence the way.
Tyson,He is then i will surely interact with students the way he has interacted with me as a priority do you remember seeing.
Interviewer,Cosmos when it first aired yeah but i was by then I was in graduate school so it was it didn't influence me the way it.
Tyson,Influenced others because i was already established but what it did tell me was that there was an appetite out there for.
Interviewer,For science if it's delivered in a way that's compelling and that's warm that's compassionate that is as though.
Tyson,The person who is bringing the science to you is sitting next to you on the living-room couch and I thought that.
Interviewer,That bedside manner is something that more science expositors should be doing and I've used it kind of as a model for.
Tyson,Me going forward so what are we going to learn about the universe um your cosmos that Carl Sagan couldn't have known.
Interviewer,About let me put it this way if sagan were around to see your series what would he learn about the universe that.
Tyson,Was unknowable thirty-some i'd use it yes so that's a good question so you need to think of cosmos not as a.
Interviewer,Documentary about science by the way since then there have been many documentaries about science and it's.
Tyson,Quite a fertile way of delivering the viewer to the frontier or bringing the frontier to the viewer so that's not the.
Interviewer,Issue here because we all remember cosmos and so many of these other documentaries maybe live their moment.
Tyson,But then they fade why did cosmos not fade it's not because it brought you the latest science.
Interviewer,Although it also did that it's because it displayed for you why science matters why science is is a is an enterprise.
Tyson,That should be cherished as an activity of the free human mind because it transforms who we are how we live and it.
Interviewer,Gives us an understanding of our place in the universe and it's these these it's it's these states of mind that you.
Tyson,Carry with you for the rest of your life so in the new cosmos that we are continuing this voyage we're continuing.
Interviewer,This epic exploration of our place in the universe we have other stories to tell beyond the ones that went on back.
Tyson,Then yes right now we we are steeped in the ignorance of dark matter and dark energy and at the time of the original.
Interviewer,Series there were no known planets outside of those orbiting the Sun we suspected they were there but right now.
Tyson,We're rising through a thousand planets happily orbiting stars that are not the Sun so these are not that's not simply.
Interviewer,New science it's new vistas of thought and imagination that place in the universe you talk about as you know.
Tyson,Scares some people someone wants to Sagan that they didn't like astronomy because it made.
Interviewer,Them feel small and insignificant in comparison with the grandeur of the universe it clearly didn't affect you.
Tyson,That way well it depends on what your ego is going into the conversation if your ego.
Interviewer,Starts out i am important i am big i'm special you're in for some disappointments when you look around it.
Tyson,What we've discovered about the universe no you're not big no you're not you're small in time and in space and you're if.
Interviewer,You have this frail vessel called the human body it's limited on earth if you have no ego.
Tyson,If you just want to explore the world look what happens here's the conversation goes differently you learn.
Interviewer,Oh the molecules and the atoms of those molecules in my body are traceable to stars across the galaxy that have lived.
Tyson,Their lives manufactured these elements exploded them in to the universe from which new generations of star systems.
Interviewer,Were formed so i look up at the night sky I don't feel small I feel large I feel.
Tyson,Connected to the universe it's not just we here on earth and that's there we are we are one and that that link for me is.
Interviewer,One of the most profound discoveries of modern astrophysics and if that that should not make you feel small that.
Tyson,Should make you feel large at your planetarium show which I went to the other day just over the holidays it did.
Interviewer,Feel small sitting there looking up at a hundred million light years coming at us but I also felt significant the very.
Tyson,Fact that my grandson and i are here in this universe together is not insignificant not only that it's the.
Interviewer,Human mind applying known laws of physics to the universe allows us to even come with an understanding of.
Tyson,What's going on out there have we figured out our galaxy so yes and no all right so the yes part is we've got some.
Interviewer,Laws of gravity and optics in motion and and yeah we can use our knowledge of physics and our knowledge of the.
Tyson,Frontier of science to land us probe on Mars within a few meters of the target spot this is tens of millions of miles.
Interviewer,Away right there is no golf shot it's not accurate all right not even a hole-in-one is as accurate as what this.
Tyson,This shot is so what we do know that has been tested works and that's quite a state of empowerment but there's a.
Interviewer,Saying where as your area of knowledge grows so too does your perimeter of ignorance hmm.
Tyson,Because this is the boundary between what you know and what you do not know outside of that area so we didn't even.
Interviewer,Know too ask why is the universe accelerating against the efforts of gravity until we.
Tyson,Made the measurement that it was so so before 1998 we couldn't even ask the question we didn't even know to ask the.
Interviewer,Question so so there's no sign that everything will ever be fully known because this moving frontier continues.
Tyson,To bring us more questions so can we measure how ignorant we are perhaps we know that what we do know about the.
Interviewer,Universe comprises four percent of everything that drives it 96 percent of what's driving this universe in the form.
Tyson,Of dark matter and dark energy we have no idea well how do you know that it's 4% because you haven't been able to have.
Interviewer,You to measure what we don't know know so that so that's a really cool question in science in astrophysics in particular.
Tyson,In all sciences you have the capacity to measure something even if you don't know what it is yeah so well so for example.
Interviewer,You could measure the fact that something is falling to the ground but not know what it is or what's.
Tyson,Causing it or why but you can measure it you can measure the Sun moving across the sky build calendars based on that.
Interviewer,And not even know that earth goes around the Sun you can and once you find out earth goes around the Sun that flips.
Tyson,Your point of view but it doesn't invalidate the concept of a year you can make all manner of measurements and not.
Interviewer,Know what's causing it we measure this thing we're calling dark matter we measure this phenomenon dark energy.
Tyson,That's forcing the universe to accelerate when you add up what we know with those two things about which we.
Interviewer,Don't know what's driving it we only know 4% of what's driving so that's humbling.
Tyson,That's humble the humblest person in this world is the astrophysicist because we fit we are face to face with our.
Interviewer,Ignorance every single day but here's what puzzles me among other things about you astrophysicists I mean the.
Tyson,Magnetized where you say you asked your physicist yeah you guys yeah you guys you're dealing as well as I saw in your.
Interviewer,Planetarium show you're dealing with true the stars a hundred million or more.
Tyson,Galaxies how do you even imagine how do you comprehend how do you get your mind around to use the cliche numbers of such.
Interviewer,Magnet we start early and i was i was on yeah you guys start start and really think big early in fact calculus as a.
Tyson,Branch of mathematics embraces the infinite you use some an infinite series of numbers or expressions you start.
Interviewer,Thinking about large things early and or a large enumeration of objects early the way I like to think of it as you can you.
Tyson,Can give analogies so one of my favorites you remember when McDonald's actually kept counting how many memories.
Interviewer,They sold like the national game exactly there that's and they had an interesting sort of the own version of a y2k problem.
Tyson,Because when they got to 99 there was not a slot for a third for a third place so there was no room enough to put 1 0 0.
Interviewer,So many of them just got stuck at 99 billion so I did the calculation for 100 billion hamburgers if you have if you.
Tyson,Lay the man to end you could go around the earth like 32 times around the earth and 10 and then with what's left over.
Interviewer,After you've done that you can stack them to the moon and back with your hundred billion hamburgers and that's.
Tyson,About how many stars there are in the universe how much pepto-bismol would you need the other thought didn't do the.
Interviewer,Pepto-bismol calculus so it's fun to think of large numbers in these other contexts and of course there are numbers.
Tyson,Larger than anything that's enumerate able in the universe the number of Google back when Google was only a.
Interviewer,Number not also a corporation google is a one followed by a hundred zeros that numbers larger than the account of.
Tyson,Particles in the observable universe so there's nothing in the universe that you can count that will add up to a Google.
Interviewer,So so what i did is a kid you just have fun with numbers and so when big numbers show up in the universe is that yeah.
Tyson,Give me more and what worries me is that when the debt goes to a trillion dollars or possibly a quadrillion dollars the.
Interviewer,National that happens never quadrillion but when it gets there.
Tyson,Do people really know how big that is i don't think they don't so we're handicapped by not knowing not being.
Interviewer,Able to think creatively about how large these numbers are I think you make me realize what I was experiencing there in.
Tyson,The planetarium when you started you said we're not going to focus on what we can see stars and planets moons and.
Interviewer,Nebulae we're going to focus on what we can't see and it was it is dark matter that's the audacity of the show I don't.
Tyson,Know any other show that said we're going to make as the topic as the central theme something about which we.
Interviewer,Know hardly anything and that was was not only a scripting challenge the the writer here was Timothy Ferriss a fan of.
Tyson,His work from way back and so there's a scripting challenged as a visualization challenge our director of astral.
Interviewer,Visualization which is a really cool title if you ever want what I think is Carter M art these are people that he's.
Tyson,A scientifically literate artist visualizer and so you bring this and others who you bring this talent.
Interviewer,Together you say here's something we don't know what it is but it affects other things let's see how the rest of.
Tyson,What we know can proxy for that which we do not know I mean this is how we know a black hole is out there just see a black.
Interviewer,Hole but you see what effect a black hole has and every weeks have it on its environment so dark things have a way of.
Tyson,Manifesting themselves dark money as well a dark energy dark matter how do they differ well unfortunately they have.
Interviewer,Similar sounding names and since we don't really don't know what either of them is H I don't think we should have.
Tyson,Named them that we should have given them fake names until we understood I thought I've been voting for like Fred.
Interviewer,And wilma that's something that doesn't give you any cosmic bias all right so I can tell you simply what dark matter is.
Tyson,But don't think of it as matter i don't wanna I'm a I'll connect this tape I don't we don't know what it is so I.
Interviewer,Don't even want to use those two words if anything it's dark gravity because we look in the universe and we see the.
Tyson,Effects of gravity and let's see let's add up all the stars and galaxies and and planets and comets and black holes.
Interviewer,Everything we know about to account for this gravity that we see we count for 1/6 of the forces of gravity we see in.
Tyson,The universe there is no known objects accounting for most of the effect of gravity in the universe something is.
Interviewer,Making stuff move that is not anything we have ever touched and that's something you call for lack of a better.
Tyson,Term dark matter but that even implies this matter what it truly is as dark gravity boom.
Interviewer,That's a problem has been around since the 1930s it's the longest standing unsolved problem in astrophysics so now.
Tyson,Dark energy we look out in the universe and we expect to see the universe we're in our universe is expanding we've known.
Interviewer,This since hubble the man level there was a man called Hubble before he came before he became a telescope yeah back.
Tyson,In the 1920s and edwin hubble he discovered not only that our galaxy is one of many he discovered the galaxies.
Interviewer,Are scattering apart from one another this was the expanding universe in 1929 so when you reveal this you say okay if.
Tyson,We've been doing this for a while all those gravities all those galaxies are going to feel each other and they're.
Interviewer,Going to ultimately want to slow us down in this expansion so you go out to measure that and that act led to a.
Tyson,Measurement that no-one believed that initially that the universe is accelerating it's not slowing down it's.
Interviewer,Speeding up these measurements were made back in the 1980 back in the 1990s a Nobel Prize has now been awarded for.
Tyson,This discovery just recently a couple of years ago the discovery papers were in 1998 so we don't know it's got some.
Interviewer,Mysterious pressure in the vacuum of space acting opposite the force of gravity we don't know what it is but we.
Tyson,Can measure its effect so it you measure it by measuring the its impact on something else precisely so it impact on.
Interviewer,The 4% that we can measure so it's the pressure that's expanding the something I use the word pressure I.
Tyson,Something is make is making the universe accelerate again we know why we got said we had a big bang Big Bang put.
Interviewer,Everything into motion i'm good with that we're good it's like me tossing a ball.
Tyson,Up into the air it's moving upward even though it's slowing down okay gravity is slowing down that upward.
Interviewer,Motion we expected gravity to be slowing down the expanding universe the opposite is happening we don't know what's.
Tyson,Causing what is the practical difference it makes whether or not we find out what dark matter and dark energy are if you.
Interviewer,Were around in 1920 maybe you would have been saying what's the practical difference of measured or measuring the.
Tyson,Behavior of atomic nuclei or atoms them so we can't see atoms why do I care this is just wood this is a wood table I'm at.
Interviewer,A leather chair i'm good to go the why D why are you investing so much energy so much so much brain energy I'm.
Tyson,Understanding what's in the middle of an atom that seems like a waste of this brilliance in the 1920s in addition to.
Interviewer,Discovering we're not the only galaxies in the universe and that the universe is expanding.
Tyson,That's a watershed decade because in that decade quantum physics was discovered and perhaps if you were.
Interviewer,Around asking me that similar question then you to question the whole enterprise yet today a third of the a.
Tyson,Third of the gdp of the world is generated on the on the creation storage and retrieval of information and the.
Interviewer,Entire it revolution cannot exist without it understanding what's going on inside the atom it is a quantum physics.
Tyson,Phenomena so you ask me a what of what i have no idea what value is come back in 50 years we'll have this conversation.
Interviewer,And i'll put you pull up the tape and look I will show you asking me of what value is the knowledge of how that works.
Tyson,One thing i took away from your planetarium show is that dark energy as you just said is responsible for the.
Interviewer,Increasing rate at which the universe is pulling itself apart right yes so I'd rather word that differently I would say.
Tyson,The universe is a is accelerating we call that dark energy so you're saying dark energy is.
Interviewer,Responsible for that there's something whatever it is we call it dark energy that's what that's our placeholder term.
Tyson,To describe what we observe the acceleration of the universe well I'm glad you explained that because by the.
Interviewer,Way this there's no nothis nope nothing known will stop this so there's been some concern that maybe space does not.
Tyson,Have the flexibility necessary to allow such rapid expansion and might space care in some way previously unimaginable.
Interviewer,Does that even mean but it does the question even have validity you mean the House of Representatives cannot pass an.
Tyson,Act that will stop as they would like to know seriously I was going to ask you because if the universe that term if you.
Interviewer,If that phrase if the universe is pulling itself apart does it ultimately disintegrate does it ultimately collapse.
Tyson,Oh there's no there's no evidence to say that we will ever recycle ourselves we're all evidence points we're in a.
Interviewer,One-way trip to oblivion but so the universe expands the temperature of the universe drops all stell all stars.
Tyson,Eventually will run out of fuel so the stars one by one in the night sky will turn off and in the extremely distant.
Interviewer,Future quadrillion years into the future there will be no light coming to us in the day or night sky and because all.
Tyson,Stars would have died and all gas clouds would have made stars that would have was going to make them and there be no.
Interviewer,More new stars created and so that the universe will end not with a bang but with a whimper and not in fire but in.
Tyson,Ice there were two strange sequences in your planetarium show and I managed to go online and look at it you become a.
Interviewer,Dark matter junkie here you got it going on you need more ice anymore so let's talk about the scene of dark matter from.
Tyson,Your show at the planet so what's going on here is you're viewing the structure of the large-scale.
Interviewer,Universe and what we've represented here are dark areas that themselves have more gravitational attraction than the light.
Tyson,Areas so the light areas are drawing themselves to the dark areas and so you what happens is as this happens over the.
Interviewer,Eons structure begins to manifest in the universe and you see this this WebWork and it looks almost organic or that.
Tyson,Looks like a some kind of neurosynaptic map the formation and collection of matter in the universe follows the laws.
Interviewer,Of physics and when you add in the dark matter this this extra gravity it turns the.
Tyson,Universe into the universe that we see that's why we know the dark matter is wheel we don't know what it is but we.
Interviewer,Know it's there because we can't make the universe as we see it unless we put this extra gravity into our simulations.
Tyson,To match the gravity that we see so you know it's something it's some thing and there's some exotic ideas for it by the.
Interviewer,Way particle physicists are convinced that it might be an exotic particle that doesn't interact with us doesn't.
Tyson,Interact with our light with our telescopes but that it has gravity so these particles are doing their own.
Interviewer,Thing invisible to us but otherwise attracting our matter into their nucleating us.
Tyson,Among them so but of course a particle physicist would think that the solution is a particle if you're hammer all your.
Interviewer,Problems look like nails but one of the more intriguing accounts I've heard is if you have multiple universes it turns.
Tyson,Out gravity can spill out of one universe and be felt by another and if we have another universe adjacent to.
Interviewer,Ours it could be that these sites where we see extra gravity is ordinary gravity in a parallel universe.
Tyson,And here we are looking at it mysteriously like what is this it's like the blind man touching the elephant I.
Interviewer,Don't what this whole thing is but here I can describe this part of it and it's kind.
Tyson,Of textured and it's no no no no this guide it's it's smooth and hard and you know you can't see the whole elephant.
Interviewer,Maybe the elephant is ordinary gravity in another universe and we're feeling it and we're making stuff up just to.
Tyson,Account for it you think that could be another universe I don't see why not because back when we thought earth was.
Interviewer,Alone in the universe we learned that there are other planets that the earth is just a planet one of many and well.
Tyson,The sun is surely special no sun is one of a hundred billion others in the galaxy the Milky Way no the galaxy is.
Interviewer,One of 100 billion galaxies about the universe we have philosophical precedent to suggest that why should nature make.
Tyson,Anything in one's okay everything else we ever thought was unique or special and we found more of them so so.
Interviewer,Philosophically it's not unsettling to imagine more than one universe we also have good theoretical grounds for.
Tyson,Suggesting the existence of a multiverse where our universe is just one of some countless number of other universes.
Interviewer,Coming in and out of existence with slightly different laws of physics within them so that makes it a little.
Tyson,Dangerous because we are held together evolved in a universe where we work to work where we work physically if you.
Interviewer,Want to visit another universe i would like you know send something else ahead of you so explain this to me why is it I.
Tyson,Felt more satisfied watching the planetarium show and as I'm sure we will watching the new cosmos then I do.
Interviewer,Personally from science fiction i mean i came away with a sense of really having experienced something authentic at the.
Tyson,Planetary that's a great question by the way there are many science fiction fans who also embrace the science reality and.
Interviewer,People who are fans of fantasy and and superheroes and science fiction and all the store the storytelling that goes on.
Tyson,On the frontier essentially everyone there knows the difference between that frontier and the real science that comes.
Interviewer,Out and they will judge the storytelling based on how much science had got right before it starts inventing.
Tyson,What the frontier of imagination would bring if you violate a known law of physics that's lesser science fiction.
Interviewer,Than the ones where you get all your physics right now take me now give me the warp drive now give me that the.
Tyson,Transporter take me beyond what we know so so but to your point I'm I think maybe it's the same effect as if you.
Interviewer,Tore the air and space museum in Washington which has the history of a flight including Space Flight that we.
Tyson,Could have made in exactly museum people could have made an exact replica of the Apollo 11 command module that went to.
Interviewer,The moon and then we'd say here's an exact replica so that's a ok but if a NASA this actual thing went to the moon.
Tyson,Intellectually that means something different to you you're I see exactly the same you can make a replica perfect.
Interviewer,Well that looks exactly with with all the blemishes and all the heat shield damage you could do that but if you know.
Tyson,It's the real thing the meaning is magnified and so yes you go to our space show it is the real.
Interviewer,Science and it is captivating you the way we'd only perhaps had thought science fiction could the saw station.
Tyson,Came first in a way in terms of popular attained in some cases but I am a fan of JBS Haldane once said I'm paraphrasing.
Interviewer,You said the universe is not only stranger than we have imagined it's perhaps stranger than we can imagine and.
Tyson,When when you realize that i are you understand why some people don't need to read the science fiction because black.
Interviewer,Holes flaying stars and orbit around them pot and planets that have life forms on dreamt of on earth this is.
Tyson,We're speaking real stuff here maybe that's as seductive as the imagination of someone standing on the frontier one.
Interviewer,Thing i took away from your show is that dark energy is the increasing rate at which the universe is.
Tyson,Pulling itself apart so how does it happen that we don't experience this expanding of the.
Interviewer,Universe as we walk down the street or sit here in this building because you live 80 years instead of billions if you.
Tyson,Live billions of years oh yeah this would be hey check out look what I notice yeah I think about things you.
Interviewer,Miss because of how short our time on earth is a the best example I can give is when you walk around say oh there's a.
Tyson,Nice puffy cloud you don't stare at it for an hour you just notice it right if you do a time-lapse of the cloud.
Interviewer,Especially cumulus clouds they are roiling gurgling boiling places of condensed water vapor they are alive yet.
Tyson,When you walk down the street you think it's just sitting there peaceful and calm if it's just a simple.
Interviewer,Cloud so even something that does change in your lifetime you don't think of as an actively roiling place the cloud so.
Tyson,Imagine longer imagine mountain building on earth imagine watching the Hawaiian Islands pop up or come up Majan watching.
Interviewer,Ice ages come and go imagine watching species of life rise up the dinosaurs and then an asteroid comes they go.
Tyson,Extinct essentially overnight on the in the fossil record that's a whole other way to see the world and it's the task.
Interviewer,Of the geologists the astrophysicist to think about how that works fortunately we have computers that can.
Tyson,Speed up time i'll give you a great example we used to have catalogs of galaxies but that's a really messed-up.
Interviewer,Looking galaxy there let's make a catalog of irregular galaxies so we have a catalog of beautiful galaxies and.
Tyson,Irregular galaxies and then people came up with theories how does a galaxy become irregular.
Interviewer,No one knew and so we realize galaxies collide galaxies feel each other's local gravity collide and it's a train wreck.
Tyson,And half the irregular galaxies are train wrecked galaxies there's a famous astronomer Gerard a vocal er who said a.
Interviewer,Wrecked lexus it's still alexis it just happened to be in a car accident so so we would learn now how do you get to.
Tyson,Know the galaxies collide you you put in the forces of gravity on a computer run the simulation and watch it unfold and.
Interviewer,There you can recreate the havoc that you see in the universe on hundred million year timescales so when a child.
Tyson,Sings are used to saying i don't think they do anymore twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are it's not.
Interviewer,Twinkling something powerful dramatic and dynamic is happening to it all right well yes and we call that twenty coin.
Tyson,Yes so yeah there's starlight coming billions of millions of light years what depends F is ago the hundreds of.
Interviewer,Thousands of light years across space and it's a perfect point of light as it hits our atmosphere turbulence in the.
Tyson,Atmosphere jiggle the image and it renders the star a twinkling and by the way planets are brighter than stars.
Interviewer,Typically like jupiter and venus venus has been in the evening skies lately and if you go twinkle twinkle little star.
Tyson,How i wonder what you are and you want you want to wish upon the star most people are wishing on planets that's why.
Interviewer,There is no coach the planets are the first stars to come out at night don't you sometimes feel sad about.
Tyson,Breaking all these myths apart terrible no because I think it's some myths or deserve to be broken apart out of.
Interviewer,Respect for the human intellect that know when you're riding on the ground and froth is coming out of your mouth.
Tyson,You having an epileptic seizure you have not been invaded by the devil we got this one figured out okay I mean.
Interviewer,Discovery moves on so i i don't mind the power of myth and magic and but take it to the next frontier and apply it there.
Tyson,Don't apply it in places where we've long passed what we already know what's going on I.
Interviewer,Came out of the planetarium and that evening I set thinking about what you said in the show about you acknowledge.
Tyson,The big bang and you and i remember that Hubble rewound the process mathematically correct me if I'm wrong.
Interviewer,And calculated that everything matter space energy even time itself actually had a beginning so turns out that was.
Tyson,Not hubble although hubble had the data that enabled the calculation the person who did that was a Belgian priest George.
Interviewer,Lemaitre he's a priest physicist physicist priest okay what a cool thing to have on your car you got everything.
Tyson,You got people coming and going with that but he calculated what the implications of Einstein's general.
Interviewer,Relativity which was the new theory of gravity would be with Hubble's expanding universe and he says the whole universe.
Tyson,May have begun in a singular point in the past and thus the Big Bang as a phrase was used pejoratively of this.
Interviewer,Idea but it's stuck well the astronomer Robert Jastrow described it like the explosion of a cosmic hydrogen bomb not.
Tyson,The explosion of a cosmic hajima but like the explosion of a cosmic hydrogen bomb yes so there you're stuck with the.
Interviewer,Analogy of the biggest explosion you know using that to describe something that's even bigger which is hard to do.
Tyson,Right i mean not to get morbid on you but I was four blocks from the collapse of the World Trade Center towers I lived.
Interviewer,Downtown and i was trying to describe to others the sound of the collapse of 107 story.
Tyson,Building and it is not like anything else so I can say well imagine two trains colliding but how many of us even.
Interviewer,Have heard or seen that whatever that is it's more than that so you're stuck if the biggest explosion we've made is a.
Tyson,Hydrogen bomb then any say it's a cosmic hydrogen bomb it is it is ah I think saying it's a.
Interviewer,Awesome hydrogen bomb cheapens the event yeah it's way begin yeah incredible flash of energy and life and matter and.
Tyson,Yeah all this holy above do you give people who make this case that that was the beginning and that they had to be.
Interviewer,Something that provoked the beginning do you give them an a at least for trying to reconcile faith and reason I'm I.
Tyson,Don't think they're reconcilable what do you mean well well so let me say that differently all efforts that have been.
Interviewer,Invested by brilliant people of the past have failed at that exercise it just fail and so I don't I don't the track.
Tyson,Record is so poor that going forward i have essentially zero confidence near zero confidence that there will be.
Interviewer,Fruitful things to emerge from the effort to reconcile so for example if you if you knew nothing about science.
Tyson,And you read say the bible the old Testament which in Genesis is an account of nature that's that's what that is and.
Interviewer,I said to you give me your description of the natural world based only on this you would say the world was created in.
Tyson,Six days and that stars are just little points of light much lesser than the Sun and in fact they can fall out of the sky.
Interviewer,Right because that's what happens during during the revelation you're one of the signs that the Second Coming is that the.
Tyson,Stars will fall out of the sky and land on earth so it's even right that means you don't know what those things are you.
Interviewer,Have no concept of what the actual universe is so everybody who tried to make proclamations about the physical.
Tyson,Universe based on bible passages got the wrong answer so what happened was when science discovers things and you want to.
Interviewer,Stay religious or you want to continue to believe that the Bible is on airing what you would do is you would say well.
Tyson,Let me go back to the bible and reinterpret it then you say things like oh they didn't really mean that.
Interviewer,Literally they meant that figuratively so this whole sort of reinterpretation of the fig house.
Tyson,Figurative the poetic passages of the Bible are came after science showed that this is not how things unfolded and so.
Interviewer,The educated religious people are perfectly fine with that it's the fundamentalist who want to say.
Tyson,That the bible is the literally literal truth of God that and want to see the Bible as a science textbook who are.
Interviewer,Knocking on the science doors of the school's trying to put that content in the center enlightened religious people.
Tyson,Are not behaving that way they're saying it science is cool we're good with that and use the Bible for to get your.
Interviewer,Spiritual enlightenment and your emotional fulfillment I have known serious religious people not.
Tyson,Fundamentalist who were scared when carl Sagan opened his series with the words the cosmos is all that is or ever was or.
Interviewer,Ever will be they've been that's scared that because they interpret that to me then if this.
Tyson,Is it there's nothing else no god and no life after for religious people many people say well God is within you or God.
Interviewer,There ways that people have shaped this rather than God is an old gray bearded man in the clouds so if God is within.
Tyson,You what I'm sure Carl would say in you in your mind in your mind and we can measure.
Interviewer,Their neurosynaptic firings when you have a religious experience we can tell you where that's happening when it's.
Tyson,Happening what you're feeling like at the time so your mind of course is still within the cosmos but do you have any.
Interviewer,Sympathy for people who seem to feel only feel safe in the vastness of the universe you described in your show if.
Tyson,They can infer a personal god who makes it more hospitable to them and cares for them in this of what we tell ourselves.
Interviewer,Is a free country which means you should have freedom of thought it I don't care what you think I just don't go think.
Tyson,Whatever you want go ahead think there's one gods two gods ten gods or no.
Interviewer,Gods that is what it means to live in a free country the problem arises is if you have a religious philosophy that is.
Tyson,Not based in objective realities that you then want to put in the science classroom then I'm going to stand there.
Interviewer,And say no i'm not going to allow you in the science classroom I'm not telling you what to think I'm just telling you.
Tyson,In the science class you're not doing science this is not science keep it out that's where I that's when I.
Interviewer,Stand up otherwise go ahead i'm not telling you how to think I think you must realize that some people are going.
Tyson,To go to your show at the planetarium and they're going to say aha those scientists have discovered God because.
Interviewer,God dark matter is what holds this universe together so is that a question it's a statement you know you know.
Tyson,They're going to say so the history of discovery particularly cosmic discovery but discovery in general scientific.
Interviewer,Discovery is one where at any given moment there's a frontier and there tends to be an urge for people.
Tyson,Especially religious people to assert that across that boundary into the unknown lies the handiwork of God this.
Interviewer,Shows up a lot newton even said it he had his laws of gravity in motion and he was explaining the moon and the plant he.
Tyson,Was there he doesn't mention god for any of that and then he gets to the limits of what his equations can calculate so I.
Interviewer,Don't can't quite figure this out maybe God steps in and makes it right every now and then that's that's where he.
Tyson,Invoked god and did and ptolemy he he bet on the wrong horse but he was a brilliant guy he formulated the.
Interviewer,Geocentric universe with earth in the middle this is where we got epicycles and all these all this tamasha nations.
Tyson,Of the heaven there was still a mystery to him he looked up and uttered the following.
Interviewer,Words when i trace at my pleasure the windings to and fro of the heavenly bodies these are the planets going.
Tyson,Through retrograde and back the mysteries are there when i trace it my pleasure the windings to and fro of the.
Interviewer,Heavenly bodies i no longer touch earth with my feet i stand in the presence of Zeus himself and take my fill of.
Tyson,Ambrosia what he did was invoked Eitan invoke Zeus to account for the rock that he's.
Interviewer,Standing on or the air he's breathing it was this point of mystery and in gets invoked God this over time has been.
Tyson,Described by philosophers as the god of the gaps if if that's how you if that's where you're going to put your God in.
Interviewer,This world then god is an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance if that's how you're going to invoke God if God is.
Tyson,The mystery of the universe these mysteries which we're tackling these mysteries one by one if you're going to.
Interviewer,Stay religious at the end of the conversation God has to be more to you than just where science has yet to tread.
Tyson,So to the person who says maybe dark matter is God if the only reason why you're saying is because it's a mystery.
Interviewer,Then get ready to have that undone welcome for two weeks now the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and I.
Tyson,Have been soaring to the outer edges of the universe in pursuit of dark energy we expected gravity to be slowing down.
Interviewer,The expanding universe the opposite is happening we don't know what's causing and Dark Matter we account for 1/6 of.
Tyson,The forces of gravity we see in the universe there is no known objects accounting for most of the effective.
Interviewer,Gravity in the universe something is making stuff move that is not anything we have ever touched up there heavenly.
Tyson,Bodies collide creating spectacular displays a fire in life but down here the collision of science and religion in.
Interviewer,The rough and tumble of democracy create its own fireworks which brings me to the controversy Neil deGrasse Tyson.
Tyson,Triggered in the blogosphere when he said this to me in one of our earlier episodes the problem arises is if you.
Interviewer,Have a religious philosophy that is not based in objective realities that you then want to put in the science.
Tyson,Classroom then i'm going to stand there and say no I'm not going to allow you in the science classroom the proverbial.
Interviewer,Alien from outer space must be scratching his bug-eyed head over that one in 21st century America why should.
Tyson,Our most noted astrophysicist have to defend the science classroom against the intrusion of religion two reasons over.
Interviewer,The past few years the number of Americans who questioned the science of evolution has gone up look at this.
Tyson,Gallup poll 46 percent of the country embraces the notion that God created human beings pretty much in their.
Interviewer,"Present form at one time within the last 10,000 years perhaps less surprising a Pew Research survey found that almost."
Tyson,Two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants the bedrock of the Republican Party reject altogether the.
Interviewer,Idea that humans have evolved so while acceptance of evolution has increased among Democrats to 67% among Republicans.
Tyson,It's fallen to 43% that's a huge partisan divide something else is happening too and no one is certain.
Interviewer,Exactly why our secretary of education Arne Duncan calls it educational stagnation consider this Pisa test tests.
Tyson,That measure critical thinking in science math and reading among high school students in different countries.
Interviewer,Show that our students aren't doing so well in math students in 33 other countries including Ireland Poland.
Tyson,Latvia of the united kingdom and the Czech Republic did better than American students in science students in 24.
Interviewer,Countries including poland ireland and the Czech Republic were ahead of ours and in reading our best subject kids in.
Tyson,21 countries outdid the american the hard truth as secretary Duncan is that the United States is not among the.
Interviewer,Top performing comparable countries in any subject tested by Pisa that's bad news for our students and the country.
Tyson,All fodder from our last round with neil deGrasse Tyson he's the director of the Hayden Planetarium at New York's.
Interviewer,American museum of natural history he's also the narrator of a mesmerizing new show at the planetarium called dark.
Tyson,Universe and this spring he'll appear as the host of a remake of the classic PBS series cosmos you can see it on the.
Interviewer,National geographic channel and fox tv welcome thank you let's talk politics for a moment go for.
Tyson,It all right according to the pew Research Center back in 2009 a comfortable majority of Republicans.
Interviewer,Accepted human evolution as a fact but now a plurality rejects it so I asked you politics can trump science can it.
Tyson,Well in a free elective democracy of course you vote who you want on your school board there is no provision in.
Interviewer,The constitution for the government to establish what's taught in schools that's all relegated to the States hence.
Tyson,We speak spanked state to state about what's in their science textbook versus another and so that's the country we've.
Interviewer,All sort of bought into if you will were born into I think it's a self-correcting phenomenon nobody wants to die okay so.
Tyson,We all care about health but above all else among the Republicans I know especially Republicans nobody wants to.
Interviewer,Die poor okay so educated Republicans know the value of innovations in science and technology.
Tyson,For the thriving of an economy and business and an industry they know this if you put something that is not science.
Interviewer,In a science classroom pass it off as science then you are undermining an entire enterprise that was responsible.
Tyson,For creating the wealth that we have come to take for granted in this country so we're.
Interviewer,Already fading economically if this cat trend continues some Republican is going to wake up and say look guys we've got.
Tyson,To split these two we have to otherwise we will doom ourselves to poverty and so I see it as a self cry don't know when.
Interviewer,It's little happen but they they know so what do you think's at stake what let's just say for Demong what is he oh no.
Tyson,It's not the democracy will still be here it's it's a matter of we're just voting into office people who don't.
Interviewer,Understand how to make how money gets generated in you know since the Industrial Revolution and before we have.
Tyson,Known the value of innovation in science and technology and its impact on an economy if that begins to go away it's a.
Interviewer,Different country we'll still call ourselves America but we won't leave the world economically and that's a choice.
Tyson,We are making as an elective democracy how do you explain that no present-day scientists present company excepted is a.
Interviewer,Household name the way thomas edison or Einstein were what does that suggest you if I had to pick I'd rather they were.
Tyson,Scientific scientifically literate and didn't know the name of any scientist because that matter is much more it.
Interviewer,Matters much more that you understand what it means to pull oil out of the ground or the energy content of oil.
Tyson,Versus win versus son versus that matters it matters that you know that an asteroid has our name on it and how it.
Interviewer,Might strike us and how we might deflect it that that matters it matters what is happening to your health this requires a.
Tyson,Level of base level of science literacy that I don't think we've achieved yet you have not fully expressed your power.
Interviewer,As a voter until you have a scientific literacy in topics that matter for future political issues and that.
Tyson,Scientific literacy spares you tomfoolery from charlatans yes exactly a science literacy is is an.
Interviewer,Inoculation against against sharleen's who would exploit your ignorance of scientific law.
Tyson,To take your money from you or your opportunity from you so the world does respond in and follow known laws of.
Interviewer,Physics and chemistry and biology we understand that so uh yeah I mean so cosmos when it comes out again we're not.
Tyson,Beating you over the head i'm not saying here to learn this or else it's an offering it's like it's like here it is.
Interviewer,And here's why it matters here's why your life can be transformed just by having some understanding of this and I.
Tyson,Not then and then i go home and speaking of scientific literacy I brought along some disturbing statistics as you know.
Interviewer,American students are performing poorly on international tests for math and science in science we came in just a.
Tyson,Head of russia and on a similar level as Italy not being Portugal in math fewer the nine percent of our students scored.
Interviewer,Advanced compared to a whopping 55% in Shanghai forty percent in Singapore and more than 16 percent in Canada.
Tyson,Welcome to the new world yeah i mean okay there's that fact that you just read now look at the rising economies in.
Interviewer,The world the rising and falling economies it's going to track those numbers the beginning of the end of what.
Tyson,We thought of as america as i grew up in an America that had as a priority leading the world in every metric you.
Interviewer,Can assemble for yourself so that's this other writing on the wall now hasn't it happened sooner because a lot of these.
Tyson,Numbers have been around for decades i have a hypothesis I need to do the experiment but it's not good enough to.
Interviewer,Only be smart at something or to score high on an exam at some point you have to step away from the exam and say I.
Tyson,Have a new thought and no one has had before and it's not a thought that you told me to regurgitate on this exam that.
Interviewer,You just wrote because there's a thought that no one has had before and how do you get those thoughts you.
Tyson,Get those in and in irreverent cultures possibly that has delayed our collapse because it is out of the environment of.
Interviewer,Not regurgitating what someone else has learned in their lifetime that allows you to make a discovery that no one else.
Tyson,Was made before you think there are too many tests we give kids to any tests I think there's an emphasis on what the.
Interviewer,Meaning of the test is i test people it's a way to find out what you know but don't then say if you don't know this.
Tyson,There for the rest of your life is screwed no no because go fine people are successful in this world fine you know.
Interviewer,Talk-show hosts and comedians and novelists and attorneys and go get the politicians put them in a room say how.
Tyson,Many ear got straight a's throughout school none of them are going to raise their hands by we throw in inventors.
Interviewer,Throw in all these people none of them are going to raise their hand okay so a Bill Gates dropped out of college a.
Tyson,Michael dell dropped out of college those people are not the success of those people is not measured by how they.
Interviewer,Performed on the exam that you wrote as professor because they're they're thinking in ways that you have yet to.
Tyson,Think because they're inventing tomorrow the only way you can invent tomorrow is if you break out of the enclosure that.
Interviewer,The school system is provided for you by the exams written by people who are trained in another generation there's.
Tyson,Something else too isn't it i mean some people say this educational stagnation that we are experiencing it's because we.
Interviewer,Have one of the highest child poverty rates in the developed world they point to the fact that high poverty schools in.
Tyson,America posted dismal scores on these tests whereas wealthy schools did very well in fact students in the wealthiest.
Interviewer,School scored so highly that if they were treated as a separate jurisdiction they would have placed second only to.
Tyson,Shanghai in science and reading and would have ranked 6th in the world in math so inequality matters yes that you.
Interviewer,Yeah and your point is that's always good but by the way my father was active in the civil rights movement in the.
Tyson,1960s and a lot of my cultural awareness and sensitivities as I'm floating in the universe were anchored by just that kind.
Interviewer,Of awareness the inequality of the unequal distribution of wealth but that's almost fundamental to a.
Tyson,Capitalist system but you what you don't want to have happen is to have unequal access ok people will sort themselves.
Interviewer,Out by who works harder and the rest of this I got that I even embrace that but if everyone does not have equal access.
Tyson,You are not getting the best people your country will falter and that's where any qualms because I have disenfranchised a.
Interviewer,Whole community of people that might have been contributing but no because they never even saw the light of day so.
Tyson,The light of the intellectual day so yeah that's bad and it is not the sign of a healthy democracy it's not even a.
Interviewer,Sign of a healthy capitalist democracy being at the top of your game intellectually philosophically.
Tyson,Politically is not a forever thing i've read history I look at countries that rise up and contribute mightily to.
Interviewer,Eradicating ignorance and to making discoveries about our place in the universe and then by change of force by.
Tyson,Change of vision by change of by short-sighted leadership the entire operation collapses look at this this.
Interviewer,Lawn a thousand years ago baghdad was the center of the intellectual it was the intellectual capital of the world.
Tyson,While europe they were disemboweling heretics ok that's weird that's why our numerals are called Arabic numerals.
Interviewer,Because they pioneered the use of these numerals and invented algebra itself an Arabic word an algorithm two-thirds of.
Tyson,The stars in the night sky have arabic names how does that happen because they had navigating devices astrolabes that.
Interviewer,Culture of discovery ended and has not arisen since I look at America post-war 20th century.
Tyson,America and say we were at the top of our game investing in science and engineering and education and yeah we.
Interviewer,Had our inequalities we had our problems but as culturally as a nation we had our vision statement we were thinking about.
Tyson,Our future we're thinking about the now we were thinking about the tomorrow that's what.
Interviewer,The world's fair was inventing a tomorrow that doesn't yet exist today when that's how you think about your.
Tyson,Country and run your country you have policy that points in that direction innovative inventive creative policy.
Interviewer,That takes you from the present into the future without it you live in the present and the rest of the world passes.
Tyson,You by you might as well physically been moving backwards because that's what you look like to the rest of the world so as.
Interviewer,A scientist i don't care who does the work next if it's not America I want to see good scientific results no matter.
Tyson,Where they're done but as an american i feel it I feel the fading of our luster the fading of our vision statement as a.
Interviewer,Nation i saw a quote recently by the physicist Jonathan Hubner who says humans are running out of world-changing.
Tyson,Inventions he says quote i think the major branches of discovery are behind us.
Interviewer,Do you agree of course not oh my gosh that is wit put I would say this to the man's face there you can't be more.
Tyson,That's let me be plain previous statements such as that made by physicists of the past have proven to be.
Interviewer,Extremely short-sighted how's that for polite okay so there's a physicist.
Tyson,One of these nobel prize-winning physicist at the in the 1800s going into the 1900s the turn of that century we.
Interviewer,Were at the top of classical physics Newton's laws were working electricity was understood this we had the power of.
Tyson,Knowledge of the laws of nature and they said but the couple of things there's still some unknowns but that's just a.
Interviewer,Matter of getting an extra decimal place in the measurement but new ID we're done we're done here just a few clouds on the.
Tyson,Horizon we're good to go don't be don't become a physicist there's nothing left to discover and.
Interviewer,What would happen in the next 20 years relativity would be discovered special relativity and general relativity the.
Tyson,Expanding universe quantum physics all of classical physics would be turned on its ear because of the discoveries in.
Interviewer,The very two or three decades to follow the uttering of that statement so of course you can't see the future that's.
Tyson,Kind of what it means to not be in the future half of my library are old books because.
Interviewer,I like seeing how people thought about their world at their time so that I don't get big-headed about something we.
Tyson,Just discovered and i can be humble about where we might go next because you can see who got stuff right and most of.
Interviewer,The people who got stuff wrong what is the toughest question you would like to answer before you die oh I hate to sound.
Tyson,Cliche about this but my favorite questions are the ones dare I use the word yet to be divined because there's a.
Interviewer,Discovery yet to take place that will bring that question into the center of the table I live for those questions so.
Tyson,That means i can't tell you what they are because they derive from something yet to be discovered and dark matter in.
Interviewer,For example if we discover what dark matter is there's going to be some question about dark matter that will.
Tyson,Rise up out of the out of the the ground and say I never even thought to ask that question in.
Interviewer,1920 no one thought to ask how fast is the universe accelerating okay how fast is the universe expanding because no one.
Tyson,Thought the universe was expanding at all you can't ask questions about the movement of a universe that you don't.
Interviewer,Even know is in motion you can't ask questions about other galaxies if you don't even know there.
Tyson,Are other galaxies so on my deathbed i will relish and all the questions that came up then ever that I never thought.
Interviewer,To ask because it was the discoveries of the future that enabled them Neil deGrasse Tyson thank you for being with.
Tyson,Me that has been great to be here thank you you.
Interviewer,The battle never ends and the choices we make in democracy often pit religious or partisan beliefs against scientific.
Tyson,Evidence that contradicts them and beliefs can be stubborn hard to give up they even determine which facts we.
Interviewer,Choose to accept partisans especially and who among us is not sometimes a partisan will twist the facts to fit.
Tyson,Their preconceived notions so when people do stupid things journalists and politicians included cherished beliefs.
Interviewer,Are often driving them sometimes right over the cliff as people in recovery say denial is not just the name of a river.
Tyson,In egypt and that's what makes it dangerous right now too powerful belief systems have converged to counter facts.
Interviewer,Staring us right in the face just as the number of Americans who questioned the science of evolution has.
Tyson,Gone up so too has the number who did not that global warming is happening and that human activity is causing this at a.
Interviewer,Time when the global scientific community is more certain than ever that you and I and everyone else are helping.
Tyson,To turn up the heat and seal our fate and here's the scary political reality on both fronts evolution and climate.
Interviewer,Change radical right republicans have made denial a litmus test you can see it embodied in this man Paul Brown.
Tyson,Republican congressman from georgia and a physician with strong religious beliefs I've come to understand all this.
Interviewer,Stuff i was taught about evolution in rheology Big Bang Theory all that is lies straight from the.
Tyson,And it's wise to try to keep me and all the folks who are taught out from understanding that they need a Savior.
Interviewer,You see there are a lot of scientific data that I found out as a scientist they actually showed that this is really.
Tyson,"A young earth i don't believe that Earth's but about 9,000 years old I believe it was created 6 days as we know."
Interviewer,That's what the bible says and when he took on the science of global warming his fellow Republicans in the House of.
Tyson,Representatives enthusiastically applauded now we hear all the time about global warming actually we've had a.
Interviewer,Flatline temperatures globally for the last eight years scientists all over this world say that the idea of.
Tyson,Human-induced global climate change is one of the greatest hoaxes perpetrated out of the scientific community it is a.
Interviewer,Hoax not true simply not true up to a point we might agree that representative Browns personal beliefs are his own.
Tyson,Business even when he is telling the extremest John Birch Society that this entire concept of manmade global warming.
Interviewer,Is a conspiracy - and i'm quoting destroy America but remember this man is chairman of oversight and investigations.
Tyson,For the science space and technology Committee of the United States House of Representatives passing judgment on.
Interviewer,Public policy and science god help us and our website billmoyers.com join a group of citizens braving the dead of.
Tyson,Winter to march the link of new Hampshire all to make candidates take a stand on the corruption of money in.
Interviewer,Politics if you think about every single important issue America has to address if you're on the right and you care.
Tyson,About tax reform or addressing the issues of the deficit on the left if you care about climate change or real health.
Interviewer,Care reform whatever the issue is if you look at the way our system functions right now you have to see that there.
Tyson,Will be no sensible reform given the way we fund campaigns that's at billmoyers.com.
Interviewer,I'll see you there and i'll see you here next time don't wait a week to get more moyers.

Interviewer,Barbra jean fleischman and by our sole corporate sponsor mutual of America designing customized individual and.
Tyson,Group retirement products that's why we're your retirement company .
Interviewer,Are we in some sort of giant scientific experiment?
Tyson,"The power of science is unique in our culture because of its capacity to predict future events, not only based on rhythms of the past, as ancients have done, but also our modern understandings of how nature works and what our interaction with nature is. And you run these models, you get the best understanding available, and we make a prediction. Do people put their head in the sand? Do they say, I choose not to believe that, not realizing, as Ann just said, that nature is the ultimate judge, jury and executioner of your ideas? So, yeah, we're in an experiment (in whether the world will listen to scientists). And when we come out on the other side, we may be better off for it, but it's quite costly to have gotten there."
Interviewer,How can the average person distinguish between the real science and the pseudo science that they see on the internet?
Tyson,"It's hard. What does the internet do? It gives you access to information unfiltered. Before the internet, there were these gates"
Interviewer,Scientists who make great efforts at public education and communication sometimes get dismissed by their peers as popularizers or generalists. So doesn't the scientific community bear some of the responsibility here?
Tyson,"There's blame enough to go around, but we're still talking about people who are in charge who are denying science. They're the ones with the actual power. Scientists don't wield the power that politicians do or that the electorate does. To imply that we might have a rise of flat-earthers because scientists historically were prevented from communicating with the public, there are other forces going on out there that require all of our collective effort, media as well, to try to fight."
Interviewer,Are human beings bad at rational risk assessment?
Tyson,"That's something that is just ignored in school. When my wife and I had our kids, I got a hold of a book that assessed all the causes of death at every age of your life, ranked by highest risk to lowest risk at every age. And you can watch things transform as you get older. Certain causes of death go away, others rise up. My wife and I coordinated to reduce the risks that were maximum according to the statistics, not that we ignored what our feelings were about a risk. That still matters, because that's why we're all living human beings."
Interviewer,Is it hard to persuade young invincibles to stay home during the coronavirus pandemic?
Tyson,"That message took a while, because the bars were all filled with the 20-somethings for so long, but they all have a grandparent (who could get infected). I think that's what ultimately did it. Otherwise, in a free country, if the risk you take only affects you, then the most you can do is communicate to that person what those risks are, and then they make their own decisions. But it's no longer a free country if that person taking risk with their own life puts your life at risk. That's an important message to communicate."
Interviewer,"Now that a lot of parents are home-schooling, how can they try to get their kids interested in science?"
Tyson,"Anyone who's had kids knows that they're born into this world curious. They're curious about everything. Their curiosity operates on a level where at a young enough age that curiosity can actually kill them. But what parents often do is constrain that curiosity to the point where the curiosity is viewed as something bad. Managed curiosity is something that you don't have to instill within children. Since they're born with it, you just have to, sort of, not get in their way."
Interviewer,Is the pandemic likely to lead to more focus on the life sciences and more people studying these sciences in medical school?
Tyson,"Often, the greatest investments that we make are the ""I don't want to die investments"
Interviewer,"If people don't like science, or say they don't like science, why try to reach them?"
Tyson,"Because we're all members of the same society and culture and civilization. And as we get deeper in the 21st century, literacy in science will become more fundamental to decisions you have to make that involve your future, especially your future health, your future wealth, and your future security. So if you don't want to know anything about science, you become disenfranchised from participating in all that it will take to improve your future."
Interviewer,"I was really intrigued by Chapter 12, which explores the cosmic perspective. If I'm summarizing accurately, it's about having the wisdom to know our small place in the universe and allowing that to expand what it means to be human."
Tyson,"If you had to put it in a sentence, that works. It's about how having a cosmic perspective can completely change your outlook on your place relative to others in the world and just who and what you are. It can reestablish, or differently establish, your priorities in life."
Interviewer,What role does the cosmic perspective play in your life?
Tyson,"This sounds like a weird boast, but it just is"
Interviewer,Here's a question from Goodreads member Spicy T AKA Mr Tea
Tyson,"Growing up, wanting to be an astrophysicist from childhood, this was definitely the path of most resistance. No one shared the views that I had of myself. Teachers would say, Oh, you should be an athlete. I'd say astrophysicist and they wouldn't know what it was, or they would ignore it, or they'd guide me to some other athletic endeavor."
Interviewer,"I'm impressed by a lot of what you just shared, and one quality is kind of a buzzword now"
Tyson,"I don't think of it as grit. I think of it as enthusiasm. Enthusiasm overrides everything. If you really love something, nothing else matters. You will do it, even at the expense of personal hygiene. You'll miss a meal. That's not grit, that's love. So my love ran deep."
Interviewer,What can a parent do to cultivate this in their kids?
Tyson,"Not that I'm Father Time or anything, but I have two kids. One aged 20 and one aged 16. What my wife and I did with them is what my parents did with me, which is, exposed us to as many different things as possible, allowed our own natural curiosity to manifest, and have that curiosity select what it wants to do in life."
Interviewer,"I have a hypothetical scenario for you. Suppose you were trapped at the bottom of a potential energy well, with no hope of reaching escape velocity. However, you were orbiting a source of light, rotating such that you were able to read books for roughly half the time. Suppose further that within the potential energy well, you were situated on a small, remote, arid location surrounded by dihydrogen oxide in its liquid phase, thus rendering you trapped. If you could have only three books with you, what would they be?"
Tyson,"If I'm surrounded by water, I'm not trapped if I can swim and I'm inventive. I can make a boat! This is not Gilligan's Island if you have creativity. Ha! I don't always accept all constraints that other people place on me! Let me just start with that."
Interviewer,I would read that book.
Tyson,"I might need the Newton to jump-start civilization if the rest of the world renders itself extinct. I trace the industrial revolution to the discoveries of Isaac Newton's book Principia. In it Newton shows that the universe is knowable. It's not a bunch of mystical forces. Things happen in the universe, and mathematics describes it. So if all civilization is gone, you need to read something to jump-start it, and that would do it."
Interviewer,Why Gulliver's Travels?
Tyson,"Oh, I just find the stories fanciful. Most people who haven't read the book think only of the one in the movies, where he's a giant among the little people, the Lilliputians. But there are all these other voyages that are so well written. And it's got so much keen insight into human nature."
Interviewer,You've been in the news recently for your suggestions for Beyoncé's baby names. What prompted that?
Tyson,"Well, what I tweet are just thoughts I'm having. I don't sit down and say, What am I going to tweet today?"
Interviewer,Are you rooting for a pair of names?
Tyson,"Quinn and Tessence, two parts of the word quintessence."
Interviewer,I'm curious to know if there's one question you just get asked all the time.
Tyson,"Fortunately there is a lot out there that triggers people's interest. None of them runs away with it, but ones that come up"
Interviewer,Wait. Lately? People ask you that?
Tyson,"Yeah. There's a whole flat-earth movement. Where've you been? You need to get out more. Just type flat-earth and watch what comes up. It's all current news... that's a hot question now. And the fact that it's a question means we're regressing as a culture. Because questions are barometers of where ignorance is most manifested. When people start saying, I choose not to believe scientists who tell me that we're warming the earth, that's an indicator of a failure deep in the educational system."
Interviewer,What do you even say to that?
Tyson,"I rebutted one of them once. But then I said, I'm not going to do this anymore, and so I don't. They can think what they want. It only becomes an issue if you think Earth is flat and then somehow someone appoints you to be the head of NASA. But there are plenty of jobs for you if you think Earth is flat, where your ignorance does not harm anyone. In a free society, in a free culture, we have freedom of speech and thought, so go right ahead. I'm not going to debate you. Life is too short."
Interviewer,I have one last question from a Goodreads member. Holly asks
Tyson,"That we would find evidence of life someplace other than Earth. That'd be very cool. Let me not even say intelligent life because that's asking too much. Just microbial life. We'd learn that it encodes information differently from life on Earth. For example, maybe it does not have DNA. I'd be really curious about that."
Interviewer,"You take complex subjects and, without dumbing them down, make them digestible and understandable for the average person. Is that a skill that you had to hone over the years, or is it innate?"
Tyson,"There is hardly anything out there that can be justifiably called innate. My goal as an educator is to communicate. Why not learn what is going on in the mind of the audience? Are they older? Are they younger? Do they lean conservative? Do they lean liberal? Are they religious? Are they fans? Were they dragged there? All of this matters, and it affects how I communicate information. It affects what words I use and what examples I'll be giving to help people understand one idea or another. What everybody has in common is that we all live in a world with some level of shared pop culture. So I value knowing pop culture on a level that empowers me to reach for it at a time and in a moment when a subject can be enhanced with it. Then I don't have to till that soil; you came with your pop-culture soil already tilled."
Interviewer,"It seems like there's a dichotomy in America where, on one hand, there's a huge interest in science, and people like yourself and Bill Nye can amass such popularity, yet, on the other hand, NASA's funding continues to be depleted, and there's still debate on how science should be approached in schools. How do you view that?"
Tyson,"Most of the science enthusiasm is centered around millennials, who are very aware of my existence. They've all seen Cosmos. They've seen me on The Daily Show and those sorts of things. They are not yet old enough to be senators and members of Congress and president. So, perhaps this is a movement coming up in the ranks. It's not even a Republican/Democrat thing. It's just, 'What should the world be?' So you get a community of people embracing science without the political baggage that older generations want to give to it."
Interviewer,"Jumping off of that, you've been active in the discussion on climate change. When will that 'debate' stop being a debate?"
Tyson,"It's all part of the same portfolio of attitudes. In that sense, it's not a dichotomy within the same demographic, which means time ought to resolve this."
Interviewer,"Does it surprise you when science becomes politicized, like with climate change?"
Tyson,"No, not when I look at how science is taught in schools. It's taught as a body of information, rather than a way of knowing. And maybe you need some of both, but the way of knowing part is clearly not there. Because if you learned what science is, how it works, and why it works, and if that becomes part of science curriculum, then you would never have anyone as an adult, who had that training K through 12, cherry-picking the emergent consensus of scientific research in the interest of their politics, or religion, or culture, or their philosophies. Because that's not how science works."
Interviewer,Do you think that will be shifting soon?
Tyson,"Not yet. People are fighting about what science at all gets put in the classroom, rather than what is the nature of the instruction that goes on in the face of it. So, I don't see that changing soon."
Interviewer,"On a lighter note, you caused a stir when you tweeted about Gravity and Interstellar. Is there any type of sci-fi TV show or movie that is a guilty pleasure of yours that you can watch without letting the science get in the way?"
Tyson,"Most movies, I don't criticize their science. Most. It's only if you really put in a lot of effort to be correct, then I'm going to be looking to see how well you did. But if you made no attempt to get the science right, like in Star Wars, for example, then I'm not chasing after you and commenting on your science, because it's pointless. I enjoyed the film Armageddon, even though it probably would get the award for violating the most known laws of physics and technology. But it was so entertainingly written, and the characters were so well delineated."
Interviewer,What is Dr. Tyson like when not talking about science or making appearances?
Tyson,"I'm only talking about science when people ask me, or if I'm writing a book or writing a tweet. My wife and I go to the theater often"
Interviewer,"At The Verge, we look at a lot of really crazy stuff that's going to happen in the next 30, 40, 50 years:self-driving cars, electric cars, private space companies, maybe even private space travel. What do you think is most important or most exciting?"
Tyson,"I'm not good at predicting the future, and my evidence of that was having looked at Star Trek in its original run and saying, okay, warp drive, sure. Photon torpedoes, I was good with that. And then I was completely in disbelief that you could walk up to a door and have it open for you. Just by walking up to the door. How does it know he's there! That would never happen."
Interviewer,The flip side of that is you have a live show coming up in Brooklyn that's themed Delusions of Space Enthusiasts. I can think of at least a couple things that you might talk about during that. Can you give an idea of what that might cover?
Tyson,"Well I think the biggest delusion was watching us go to the Moon in the 1960s and saying to yourself, Wow this is a great frontier we're breaching, we've dreamed about the Moon for centuries, and in just a few more years we'll be on Mars and then we'll be all over space. That was missing some important parts of that equation. You're missing the fact that we only declared we're going to the Moon because we were at war with the Soviet Union, we were in a cold war, so this is a war of technologies. The fact that Sputnik was launched in a hollowed out intercontinental ballistic missile shell, no one thought about the space over the atmosphere. We knew that you could control your own airspace, but how about your space space?"
Interviewer,"It seems really easy to delude ourselves about the state of space now, right? We look at a company like Mars One and say, Oh yeah, totally, that seems possible. A reality show would definitely fund a mission to Mars. Or even SpaceX, we've looked at that company with wide eyes and only now question them after a very public failure."
Tyson,"The delusion that relates to private spaceflight isn't really what you're describing. They're big dreams, and I don't have any problems with people dreaming. Mars One, let them dream. That's not the delusion. The delusion is thinking that SpaceX is going to lead the space frontier. That's just not going to happen, and it's not going to happen for three really good reasons"
Interviewer,"It feels like there's been a lot more news to discuss lately:Enceladus' ocean, there's water on Mars, the incredible flyby of Pluto, the alien megastructure star. Why is that? Is that refreshing?"
Tyson,"It's not that there's more news; there  been fascinating highlights every year. You go back a couple years ago, we plunked down the Curiosity rover on Mars. That was an engineering feat. This past year we landed on a comet; well not we, Europe. But we landed on a freaking moving comet, and that had never been done before. Each year has its list. What I think is happening, though, I think you are observing the fact that appetite for it is growing, and so there are news stories that might have just been a little farther back in the priorities of the newspaper that then become headlines."
Interviewer,"As the public gets more interested, more light is being shed on some places that didn't have much light shed on before, and that's turning up some things that are harder to deal with. There was the UC Berkeley astronomy professor who was sexually harassing students, there's the Thirty Meter Telescope controversy in Hawaii. These have become part and parcel with that growth in general interest in these fields, so how do we deal with them? How do you ensure astronomy is gender and ethnically diverse?"
Tyson,"In terms of the Berkeley professor, my field is not unique in that it contains some people who transgress sexual harassment regulations or expectations in a modern society. If it was somehow more prevalent in my field than in other fields, then that would require special attention, but I think it requires the normal amount of attention that any workplace should and is getting with regard to sexual harassment. That one got particularly extra attention because he was at a preeminent university, and he is very famous among us. So that got more attention than anybody else would have if they'd taught at a community college, or taught in a somewhat smaller institution, and or was not themselves famous. It's not more transgressive just because he's famous, it's just more newsworthy, right? That's a general challenge in our society, not specific to astronomers."
Interviewer,How does NASA affect your work as head of the planetarium?
Tyson,"In two fundamental ways. One relates to the public's appetite for the cosmos, stimulated by discoveries and missions conducted by NASA. Since there are hardly any NASA facilities in the Northeast, hardly anyone knows about GISS , it has no direct presence in the hearts and minds of New Yorkers. For many people, the Rose Center for Earth and Space and the Hayden Planetarium are the closest they'll ever get to NASA in this region of the country. So we closely monitor missions and frequently design programs around NASA science."
Interviewer,For example?
Tyson,"We recently had our annual Isaac Asimov panel debate on ""Mining the Sky"", what to do about the natural resources of space scientifically, culturally, morally, and ethically. I had an engineer from NASA Marshall, Curtis Manning, who specializes in in situ resource utilization. I got Cassie Conley, the head of the planetary protection group at NASA, to talk about what it means to go into space in search of resources, either in support of space-based activities or to bring back here. We also had a mining geologist to ground everyone, figuratively and literally."
Interviewer,What's the other way NASA connects to your work?
Tyson,"We apply for support money from NASA for programs we run. Our most visible NASA-supported programs are space shows. In the old days, the planetarium director would stand up with a microphone and recite what constellations were visible that season. That doesn't play anymore, nor should it. We know too much about the universe and the universe is too dynamic, too broad and deep, for anyone to believe that pointing out objects in the night sky constitutes astronomy any more. So we identify various cosmic objects and take the viewer there visually. We've enjoyed NASA support for each of the shows that we've produced over the past eight years."
Interviewer,How would you characterize public response to NASA?
Tyson,People are generally completely supportive. Those who grumble about science and space don't tend to visit us.
Interviewer,Context matters because ... ?
Tyson,"Often the ""why"" isn't, ""Here's the answer."" The why is, ""Here's the landscape in which this activity is unfolding."" Once you understand the landscape, it's self-evident why we are undertaking these activities. So I see almost complete support for our space activities."
Interviewer,What kind of effect has NASA had on you personally?
Tyson,"I was born the same week NASA was founded, so we're the same age and feel some of the same pains, joys, and frustrations. But the Apollo program had no effect on me."
Interviewer,Why no effect?
Tyson,"Because the astronauts were military pilots. They had crew cuts. Their skin was many shades lighter than mine. That was not an adventure that at all considered me as one of its participants, so I couldn't consider myself as one of them. It's not that I didn't appreciate what NASA was doing. I was as excited as the next person that we landed on the moon. It was a great engineering feat, a great technological feat. It just didn't influence my ambition to become a scientist. My interest came about entirely separate from that."
Interviewer,Where did it come from?
Tyson,"From my first visit to Hayden Planetarium, where I saw the night sky as never before, as undreamt of actually, because I grew up in the Bronx and I was sure the night sky was maybe eight stars, ten on a good night, not the thousands they were showing me. I thought it was a hoax. A couple of years later, I looked up with binoculars and the universe looked really different than it did with the naked eye. I realized that maybe what I was seeing from the Bronx was not the real thing. So NASA was going into low- Earth orbit and then to the moon and back, and my interest was being forged on the large-scale universe."
Interviewer,"In 1968, a year or so before the moon landing, I heard a talk by astronomer Fred Hoyle where he said space exploration was all well and good, but it would never replace looking through a telescope."
Tyson,"Unless you figure out how to get to the place the telescope sees. I think he's right for the large-scale universe, but I bet he would not have imagined what we would glean just from our own planetary system from space probes that have been as far out as Saturn. Now we know that the moons are in many ways more interesting than the planets themselves. I don't think he could have imagined that at the time. So space travel is replacing telescopes. No one is saying, ""Give me a good telescopic view of Saturn."" No, we just call Cassini and say, ""What have you got for me today?"" So Hoyle was half right."
Interviewer,What do you think our relative investment in robotic and human space exploration should be?
Tyson,"I wear two hats. As a pure scientist, I would say, ""Just send robots."" For every astronaut you send up, you could send ten or more robots to ten different places. Very few scientists, given that specific choice and given the relative cost of the two, would say, ""Send people instead of robots."" But I also spend a good part of my professional life interacting with the public. I'm a public educator and a public scientist. In that capacity, I'd say there is no question that human exploration of space has no substitute. Nobody names high schools after robots. People have said, ""Look at the interest shown in the Mars rovers."" That's undeniable, but let's go back forty years. There were robotic missions to the moon. Does anyone remember them who wasn't directly involved in them? Of course not, because people were going to the moon."
Interviewer,"In one of your essays in Death by Black Hole, you say robots are only good at finding what you know you're looking for."
Tyson,"I think a robot can find something unexpected but, yes, it's true you program a robot for what you expect to see. You program it to climb over a particular kind of rock, to look in a certain spectral band, to dig in a certain way. Something completely unexpected could go unnoticed."
Interviewer,What do you think was the most significant accomplishment of NASA's first fifty years?
Tyson,"People like to say it was landing on the moon. I'd phrase it in a different way. The most significant accomplishment was saying we would put someone on the moon and then doing it. I think we would eventually have put someone on the moon but to say it and then do it speaks to a high level of ambition. In some ways, the landing was the easy part. What you had to do to get to that point was the hard part. The Mercury missions and Gemini missions were steps toward landing on the moon"
Interviewer,What would you like to see NASA commit itself to next?
Tyson,"I'm not naïve enough to think that just because we went to the moon we're automatically going to land on Mars. What drove the moon landing was a flow of money commensurate only with times of war, because we were at war with the Soviet Union."
Interviewer,NASA got 4 percent of the federal budget then.
Tyson,"That was a war budget, and when you're at war you spend money. I think the greatest challenge now is to ask what else can drive the expenditure of money. One of the big drivers is the promise of the growth of wealth. So I think space tourism, which for a while was considered a fringe activity, may be the most important source of capital for the future of space exploration. Yes, one job of a government with foresight is to invest where capital markets have yet to tread, but then the government needs to open those pathways for others to create the market, allowing space travel to become routine."
Interviewer,We're at the beginning of that process.
Tyson,"You can smell it in the air. The entrepreneurs who are out there, the X PRIZE, Space X, have the goal of making space exploration cheap enough to attract tourists. Once you have an industry, you invite competitors that will continue to drive the price down and create more opportunity. I'm a big supporter of that notion. I think many futurists of the Apollo era were naïve. Nearly all of them said things like, ""We're on the moon now, we're explorers, we're discoverers. Mars is next. We'll be on Mars by 1985."" Reality check, please. Somebody is paying for this. Who? It's Congress. Why? Because of the communists. It wasn't because Congress thinks exploration is a great thing to do."
Interviewer,Are there good ways to demonstrate the value of NASA to the public?
Tyson,I think one of the greatest ways to assess the value of an agency to a nation is to do the following experiment
Interviewer,Although people are not aware of how much useful technology NASA has developed.
Tyson,"That's true, and that story should be told no matter what. But I think NASA has a bigger story, a more noble story to tell. The exploration and research conducted by NASA have the potential to circumvent problems that right now we're simply running away from."
Interviewer,Like what?
Tyson,"Mars once was wet and fertile. It's now bone dry. Something bad happened on Mars. I want to know what happened on Mars so that we may prevent it from happening here on Earth. Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect. Something bad happened on Venus, too. It's an experiment that has already run its course there; we don't have the luxury of performing that experiment here on Earth. There are cosmic hazards that we were all ignorant of but certainly existed in 1900. We learned of them because of space exploration. For instance, asteroid impacts. One slammed into Earth 100 years ago this June in Tunguska, Siberia. We're cataloguing asteroids so that if a big one is headed this way, we can go out and deflect the damn thing rather than build shelters and try to run away from it. Without a space program, you end up running away from problems, when in fact we have scientists, engineers, clever people who can actually stop the thing in the first place. That's what vaccination was all about"
Interviewer,One or more of the presidential candidates has talked about using most of NASA's money for Earth-related missions.
Tyson,"You want some money on the earth, but if you always concentrate on the earth, you miss the stuff coming in from outside. Not only that. Discovering that which was unknown to the generation before you is a noble quest. Only the greatest of civilizations have had the luxury to do that. America is the country I want to live in because that is the kind of legacy we have enjoyed. I recently gave a talk to 900 people and the last question of the day was, ""Suppose, in the new administration, everyone votes to cancel all science projects and devote the money to programs that help people. If you were given the choice of one and only one science project to have happen, what would that be?"" You know what I'd do? I'd use that money to build a boat and sail to a country that's investing in science projects. America would no longer be the country I grew up in, the one that believes we'll have a tomorrow different from today because we've funded creative people whose goal in life is to make a better world."
