Interviewer,"Oh, man! You're like a Dave and Busters if it was a person. Next, we got a man who wears $10,000 suits and just bought $350,000 Rolls Royce, UFC fighter, Conor McGregor."
McGregor,"Charles, I'm not going broke, so you can take your patronizing tone and shove it up your ass."
Interviewer,"Alright, I know you're not broke now, but let me ask you a question. How many high school friends work for you?"
McGregor,Six.
Interviewer,"Well, you better get yourself a Roth IRA, Conor. You know what that is?"
McGregor,Yeah. I've been in the IRA since protestants moved into my neighborhood.
Interviewer,"That is incorrect. Once again, the answer is always no.' Remember, if you own an animal that used to belong to a drug dealer or middle eastern dictator, that's a red flag. Okay, pick again, Gronk."
Interviewer,"Hell yeah, man. I just launched my own alcoholic sports drink. It's called Smirnoff Sport. Smirnoff Sport. It's just blue vodka."
McGregor,"Invest? Pfft. Why should I invest in some silly bank for years when I can go to Vegas and double my money in an hour? All I do is win, Charles."
Interviewer,"Okay. Last time you went to Vegas, what happened?"
McGregor,I lost.
Interviewer,"Conor, gambling is an addiction. I still have my issues myself. Yesterday I bet Michael Jordan $10,000 that I would get a hole in one."
McGregor,"the odds of that is fairly long, man."
Interviewer,"Okay, the question there, Trust a Stripper. Scenario"
McGregor,"I like that. She's freaky, right? Yeah, you bloody go for it."
