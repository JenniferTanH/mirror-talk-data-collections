name,line
Interviewer, sway in the morning shave four five man uh we had to get these two guys.
Eminem,On man the two co-founders of shave four five.
Interviewer,We got the one and only eminem on the line with us right now and paul rosenberg his partner in crime.
Eminem,I am uh offline off mike paul and i was talking about.
Interviewer,Quarantining and i'm quarantining with my daughter man how's quarantine going for.
Eminem,You this  is terrible like i i you know i've been writing.
Interviewer, and working out  you know just doing doing what i don't know like the fact that there's.
Eminem, no no sports on right now is really bothersome so it's like you know we don't.
Interviewer, there's there's not even anything that i mean aside from the jordan documentary that's.
Eminem, that's even like gives you a little a little sense of normalcy like watching.
Interviewer, you know just watching  like that like you try to just like i try to keep the.
Eminem, try not to watch too much news because this  is like panic mode all the time yeah and it's.
Interviewer, stressful to watch you know it's like i want to see what's going on but at the same time it's like.
Eminem, you know i don't know man we're living in some unprecedented times right now yeah man.
Interviewer, uh what you think of that jordan doc it's incredible this  is crazy bro.
Eminem, it's incredible and it's it's it's it's you know it's only two episodes in but.
Interviewer, man that  is like i don't know it's like nostalgic city yeah.
Eminem, yeah i i love hearing um like i always wanted to know the inner workings of dude's mind like his work.
Interviewer, ethic you know what i mean we used to get on the basketball court and call out his name.
Eminem, like i'm jordan you know but we really didn't know his work ethic like that part is kind of insane you know in.
Interviewer, a good way though like when you could kind of unravel how the greats.
Eminem, became great yeah you know then you find out they might not be the most likable person but you can't always get your.
Interviewer, cake and eat it too you want him to be great he might not be the most likable person.
Eminem, but he's striving to be great that's that part right there i love seeing yeah i think that anybody who is uh.
Interviewer, you know at the top of their game at whatever they do whether it's athletics or anything.
Eminem, has to put the time and have the work ethic you you don't get to be that without it.
Interviewer, yeah yeah man it's the same thing for rap it's like it's you know it takes a certain amount of.
Eminem, talent but it also takes it's probably three four times the work ethic.
Interviewer, versus the talent or or it's probably you know i mean in some cases it might be equal but it's but you.
Eminem, you don't get one without the other yeah yeah that's true you got to work hard paul.
Interviewer, what you work hard at paul will you paul rosenberger yeah i i am here um trying to perfect how to.
Eminem, live life at home having two kids and make sure that they are um learning and in school um.
Interviewer, while maintaining some sense of you know running business and uh being a a person.
Eminem, the human being that's what that's what i'm working hard at well that was beautiful dog yes.
Interviewer, man i wanted to ask you uh em you ever you ever get a chance to meet michael jordan.
Eminem, um not in person but i talked with him on the phone one time and we had i don't know paul if you.
Interviewer, remember this but we we were we were talking about doing some kind of shoe.
Eminem, like together yeah it was one of the collaborations one of the collaborations and.
Interviewer, i was on the phone with him we were talking and and like everything was cool like he's super.
Eminem, cool like and everything was good until we get to the end of the phone call and i said.
Interviewer, yo man when are you gonna come to detroit so i can dunk on you.
Eminem,And it was cricket and he was like i don't remember exactly what he said but i i think he just kind of.
Interviewer,Was like like laughing yeah and i remember getting off the phone.
Eminem,Going oh my god i think i might have just blew it because it was to me in my head it was a.
Interviewer,Complete it was a total joke right it's like you know it's it's it's so ridiculous for me to think that i.
Eminem,I could dunk on jordan right so in my head it's you know one of those things that.
Interviewer,You think is going to be funnier in your head than when you actually say it.
Eminem,So i don't know what happened after that but paul did i call you i i can't remember.
Interviewer,Who i called right after that but it might have been paul i don't know i think you you felt kind.
Eminem,Of mortified by it and and um i think i was pretty sure that.
Interviewer,That mike knew you were joking and um you know you guys have continued to do business.
Eminem,With with one another in a few ways since then so i'm sure it's all good.
Interviewer,Man it was like it was one of those things like it was one of those things that in my.
Eminem,Head just would be so ridiculous he has to know i'm joking but when i got off the phone i remember.
Interviewer,Thinking i don't think he knew i knew i was joking because you know he's very.
Eminem,I mean watching this documentary like he's very competitive right yeah so it's like.
Interviewer, i like like i don't know if he would have if he if he would have um.
Eminem,Said when are you you know when are we gonna battle i don't know what i would have said but.
Interviewer,I would i probably would have uh probably would have laughed the same way he did it been like.
Eminem,You know but i feel like i would have known he was joking yeah mike mike might have some bars though.
Interviewer,You don't know but yeah that's that's what i mean that's the other thing like he might.
Eminem,Have actually heard about my game in basketball right and he might be like yeah yeah this.
Interviewer,Actually might be possible you think he heard about your game though i'm pretty sure he did.
Eminem,Yeah it brings girls i mean you've heard of it you've heard about it haven't you yeah yeah we played once and yeah i.
Interviewer,Remember you got a nice game to be quite honest with you i not mike jordan nice though bro.
Eminem,Yeah i'm like i'm like one step down yeah one step yeah from from georgia oh boy.
Interviewer,Yeah speaking of i'm gonna tell watching him in in his work ethic like.
Eminem,It's just so incredible just to know like he wasn't he was born with talent.
Interviewer,Obviously right like he had the talent but he had to hone his craft and watching it and and watching the.
Eminem,Talent go with the work ethic like it's it's incredible man it's it's like.
Interviewer,I don't know i that's what make the greatest degree i know yeah like it sounds like.
Eminem,Like you in terms of the rap game it's guys like you and jay or e40 or snoop these you know.
Interviewer,Guys have been around y'all y'all just didn't happen to hang around like it's that work ethic.
Eminem,And then even him not even responding to you duncan is that competitiveness like that's the favorite thing i got out of.
Interviewer,The dark too is how competitive he is yeah you don't you don't see that in yourself like you you spent your like.
Eminem,Let's say the last two albums responding to people who called you out whether it's.
Interviewer,Talk show host podcast host or or mcs you don't have to do it but you still calling out mcs.
Eminem,That call you out and i feel like that's that competitiveness in you no matter where you reach in your career what.
Interviewer,Would that person say right yeah no no no it's it's definitely there's definitely some some truth to that and.
Eminem,There's some elements of that that they go into what i do but man just watching that guy like.
Interviewer,In midair like switch the shot you know what i'm saying like yeah and and have that extra little.
Eminem,Thing where he can hang in the air that long and do something different you know like.
Interviewer,If he sees the defenders coming up a certain way and he goes around him or behind the basket like it's .
Eminem,Incredible man it's just uh  it's a it's he is a uh phenomenon no pun intended uh paul rosenberg and.
Interviewer, eminem are on the line um em let me ask you about this some of the things you've been doing bro i think.
Eminem, um we've been talking about them on the air you know i told all our listeners to.
Interviewer, citizens that that i would call and and to see if you could kind of elaborate on some of.
Eminem, the things you're doing uh first of all i notice uh marshall mathers.
Interviewer, foundation has been doing a lot with you know providing food and providing meals to um.
Eminem, health care workers at the hospitals and um you guys are providing hundreds of meals.
Interviewer, even at the uh can you talk about that um providing these spaghetti lunches for.
Eminem, people and some of the healthcare workers how did that happen man what made you.
Interviewer, want to do that well me and me and paul me and paul have actually just been talking about.
Eminem, you know what what what are some of the ways that we can do our part and and try to help.
Interviewer, out and mom spaghetti was one of the things that came up so we had talked about doing that.
Eminem, um and we talked about the uh the dj the dj thing that paul could probably.
Interviewer, elaborate on a little better than me but basically what we're trying to do is is.
Eminem, paul you want to go ahead yeah no i was just going to say that there was a time um you know when this.
Interviewer, all started happening where marshall called me and said you know what okay what are we gonna do how can we how.
Eminem, can we do um you know what we do to help help people out.
Interviewer, um and then one of the things that that i noticed was that there was um a lack of uh attention.
Eminem, focused on you know making the front line healthcare workers feel good and positive just put.
Interviewer, a smile on their face so we reached out to um the guys that at union joints which is a uh.
Eminem, group in michigan that we've done some work with before we did the mom spaghetti pop-up with us.
Interviewer, back in detroit and um when we put out the revival album and um we did some.
Eminem, some mom spaghetti pop-ups on the road in 2018. of various festivals etc so we reached out to them and said hey.
Interviewer, could we do um you know what we did on the road for for some of the frontline healthcare workers.
Eminem, and they sprung into action and said absolutely um so we went and visited some hospitals.
Interviewer, on monday uh and we're going to continue to do that throughout the next few weeks um.
Eminem, just you know anything to to pitch in and um you know make these make these men.
Interviewer, and women feel good about themselves for a minute uh so that's that's one of the things.
Eminem, we've done and then the other one was um you know a lot of people were talking about how djs.
Interviewer, have been affected um by the fact that they can't go out and earn a living and you've got guys who you know play.
Eminem, clubs and um you know or or parties or you know strip clubs or.
Interviewer, what wherever they play uh uh and earn their living they just can't all of a sudden can't do it.
Eminem, so um we thought about like maybe we can create some sort of program to give them you know some.
Interviewer, some small release and and again uh put a smile on their face so uh we have this this program that we're launching.
Eminem, um now and it's called love your dj and we basically are offering michigan you.
Interviewer, got to be a michigan resident because we can't offer it to everybody so we're going to start with michigan and the.
Eminem, first 500 people uh who submit a mix via soundcloud are going to be eligible for 313 dollar.
Interviewer, cash payment for 313 for the area code and the mix just has to you know fall within a certain set of guidelines which.
Eminem, which is all going to be available um online and then we're going to select the best of that group of of dj mixes.
Interviewer, and we're going to program and love your dj mix weekend uh starting may 2nd.
Eminem, where the entire weekend is going to be programmed by these mixed submissions um and that'll be sort of a you know for.
Interviewer, lack of a better description of grand prize oh  so 500 the first 500 djs in.
Eminem, michigan are eligible for 313 dollars and right uh which is incredible uh because.
Interviewer, djs really don't have a way of getting money right now uh why why was it important for um.
Eminem, to like help out the dj's well that was one of the things that we were talking about.
Interviewer, that you know i i mean obviously our our field that we work in is music right yeah so that was one of the first things.
Eminem, that came up when me and paul were talking like you know how are dj's going to make.
Interviewer, their money you know right they're the backbone of what we do.
Eminem, right and so this was a way to just kind of um just like get just i mean how long.
Interviewer, like how many times would y'all be well i know you probably haven't thought this far out but this is kind of incredible.
Eminem, uh how long will you be willing to do it like it's a time limit we'll see how this one goes there's.
Interviewer, i think they have um i can't remember how many days it's all it's all in the rules but they.
Eminem, have a certain amount of time to submit the mix um and then we're gonna do this first.
Interviewer, weekend and we'll see how it goes you know i mean uh hopefully we'll get all 500 um slots.
Eminem, filled up quick and then we can move from there and maybe maybe open it to a broader.
Interviewer, audience but you know a little bit of a test run so we'll see we'll see how this one fly.
Eminem, and then the best ones the incentive too right paul is the best ones that that we get we'll actually put on the.
Interviewer, air you know i'll say 4-5 so the contest begins today and it ends wednesday april.
Eminem, 29th at noon so djs that are tuned in if you're in the state of michigan.

Interviewer, forward slash stream free paul yep okay uh man that's  dope man um what i'ma do is send my mix in i'ma.
Eminem, mail it to somebody in michigan and then have them mail that in to y'all probably won't get it though will we.
Interviewer, paul like well he'll have to have his people call our people and then you know what.
Eminem, we'll hook you up if it's uh you know if it's good enough like okay well you know i've been i've been.
Interviewer, working on it uh now this is really dope man i love what you're doing and i say it all the time.
Eminem, anybody who's in a position to help out others right now and taking that initiative which you don't have to.
Interviewer, i commend so even with the mom spaghetti um initiative and passing out you know food to health care workers these people.
Eminem, aren't paid enough as it is and they sacrifice and they putting themselves at risk every day.
Interviewer, and then even giving back to the community the hip-hop community because djs can appreciate it.
Eminem, and then also giving them an opportunity to be on the station i think that's dope um and then man are.
Interviewer, you doing a playlist or something a quarantine playlist that that people could tune.
Eminem, into yeah which i'm still i'm still kind of working on so i.
Interviewer, paul i sent you some stuff yesterday but uh i got a few more things that i want to.
Eminem, add to it but uh yeah it's basically you know what um how would i describe it.
Interviewer, well it's called music to be quarantined by right yeah so it's like what what what uh you know.
Eminem, what i want to what what i want to hear basically so i recommend people listen to as well.
Interviewer, right uh hey em let me ask you bro cause you know i've known you a long time man.
Eminem, and quarantined for most of the country seemed like something new but because of your fame and the status.
Interviewer, you've had it feels like and i could be mistaken i could be ignorant.
Eminem, but this kind of seemed like you've been there was a time in your life where you were already self-quarantined.
Interviewer, because of the fame because of the you know the public fanfare is that fair to say.
Eminem, yeah i mean for for sure there's there's something there's there's something to be said about that.
Interviewer, like it's you know it's uh but it but it's not the same it's not the same when you can't do.
Eminem, a lot of your regular routines and  and and you know going to the studio is like my my.
Interviewer, outlet you know and it's it's you know i can't we we can't really get in right now and do much so.
Eminem, i've just been writing you know but yeah the to to a certain extent yeah you know famous definitely over the.
Interviewer, years kind of already had me quarantined but it's the fact of knowing that you can't.
Eminem, go really go out and you can't like we can't move like how we how we normally move and.
Interviewer, you know there's so it's it's not just the same it's not just the same thing for me yeah.
Eminem, every day you know what i'm saying that it always is there's something to be said about.
Interviewer, knowing that you can't go out and do certain things like because the truth is if i wanted to go out.
Eminem, i can do certain things right there's certain things that i'm able to do regardless of the fame or not that i.
Interviewer, still can't do and like i said it you know we were talking about.
Eminem, what what to do right now and it's like the fact that that when you're home and you can't even.
Interviewer, there's not you can't even watch sports like you know there's no boxing there's no.
Eminem,  there's no baseball there's no nothing right so it's just like you can watch.
Interviewer, the news or you can bury yourself in netflix you know.
Eminem, but uh i just been burying myself in the pad you know because and and like i said we.
Interviewer, started reading rock kim's book i saw the crook the crooks corner interview and if if if.
Eminem, people ain't seen that you need to go watch it the rock cam interview.
Interviewer, that that king crook did on crooks corner is incredible and especially especially.
Eminem, if you know and understand rock kim like and have studied them like i have like it's incredible for me to watch.
Interviewer, something like that and just you know he he's he drops a lot of jewels in that man.
Eminem, you know i saw and i saw what king crook did with you too um.
Interviewer,And i thought it was good because i know you guys got a different kind of relationship.
Eminem,Being family i was listening to the i will track off the album that had king crook royce.
Interviewer,And joelle and you on it then um verses that you guys all spit you know what track i'm talking about.
Eminem,Yep okay um did how does that work was those pre-recorded verses so that was just.
Interviewer,Because it feel like every time y'all get together y'all make great songs but you mention boxing it's like a.
Eminem,Boxing match yeah you know you know how was that bringing that song together.
Interviewer,Well it was i mean it's it's kind of just like we we just we do what we do right like like.
Eminem,Us getting on a song like especially like in the in the when we were when we were doing.
Interviewer,The slaughterhouse albums it was the same thing it was like getting on us getting on a song with.
Eminem,With anybody from slaughterhouse was a problem right and and.
Interviewer, rappers like king crook and joel ortiz man they're a  problem yeah right so.
Eminem, if you're gonna get on a song with them you gotta you need to  bring it and.
Interviewer, that's one of the things that that that to me is you know it's it's it's so dope that.
Eminem, that you know crook is doing crooks corner right now too but people who might not know about crook.
Interviewer, need to look up some of his music because he's a  problem he's one of those dudes that it's.
Eminem, nerve-wracking to get on a song with him royce too same thing yeah that uh.
Interviewer, the allegory was uh  uh that's that that one might that's royce's bible.
Eminem, album you know like just listening to like i i still listen when i'm listening to that.
Interviewer, album man i'm i feel like i'm i'm halfway in a lecture hall but also i'm in euphoria for a dude who just loved.
Eminem, lyricists yeah you know i i wonder too like i when i know we ain't talking a minute.
Interviewer, but there's certain things i was curious about because i'm a big fan of don toliver.
Eminem, and i was a big fan of um juice world both of which you put on this project and i didn't even realize you knew those.
Interviewer, dudes you know um speak on juice world you put them on a godzilla joint.
Eminem, um man what was that experience like with that kid well it's it's crazy because the the.
Interviewer, whole way that that came about like um you know i've it we're talking about the crooked interview like i was.
Eminem, explaining you know explaining to crook like because i'm sure that he does the same thing.
Interviewer, like you know us us being in the game for a certain amount of time it helps us i think that.
Eminem, as as as artists and just as hip-hop connoisseurs to pay attention to what's.
Interviewer, out right and pay attention to all the new  that's coming out because.
Eminem, you know a lot of these kids coming up man they've they've they've studied the greats and you can.
Interviewer, tell and and just watching them is is is incredible because you know you you.
Eminem, you might get to push back on certain sides of the argument about hip-hop like okay.
Interviewer, uh nobody's really saying lyrics anymore and this but but that's  because a lot of.
Eminem, these kids coming up and i i i you know i i mentioned kendrick and cole a lot i know they're.
Interviewer, not kids coming up anymore but but they came before or after us right but they've studied all.
Eminem, the greats and you can tell because it goes into their pen and uh you know i just i me personally i just i.
Interviewer, don t oliver's dope as  uh juice world man it's like like his his freestyle that he did.
Eminem, like um when he went on tim westwood and rap for like an hour straight.
Interviewer,Was incredible especially for coming off the top of the dome you know what i'm saying because a lot of.
Eminem,People just can't do that and they don't know that there's a or they might not know.
Interviewer,That there's an art to that like to be able to be able to do that so you know i keep my finger on the.
Eminem,Pulse of everything that's out because i don't want to get you know swept away with the tide.
Interviewer,Because if you don't keep up with the times like like we were talking about the work ethic like it's.
Eminem,I swear to you it might be harder to maintain it than it actually was to get it.
Interviewer,So like getting to the place where i was in the very beginning of my career right.
Eminem,I know how hard i worked to get there but i i swear i feel like it i worked just as hard and if not harder.
Interviewer,Just to be able to maintain a skill set you know yeah you you always like i i find it.
Eminem,Having known you so long i i i really i keep asking you this because i find it fascinating how you respond.
Interviewer,Like you're still ready to battle anybody you know and it don't matter who it is that critique.
Eminem,You do do you do you find enjoyment in that like oh okay this is oh  that's my.
Interviewer,Motivation right yeah i'm not gonna lie i i that that's the kind of  that i kind of.
Eminem,Live for is is that not saying that i live for conflict but.
Interviewer,My competitiveness you know is is uh you know i don't know how to say it i'm i'm i'm.
Eminem,I'm not looking for it but i'm always ready for it you know when when you're a kid we were.
Interviewer,Kids growing up on hip-hop like me in detroit i didn't know the stories behind certain things.
Eminem,Right so this new beastie boys documentary is coming out so i got a chance to watch it yesterday.
Interviewer,And they you know they had sent it over uh which was super cool of them to do and just hearing old stories like that.
Eminem,Man it's just like and just like how you know i think about when we saw run dmc on tv like like.
Interviewer,Seeing them like even even when they show like old clips of when they first were coming out right.
Eminem,When it when run dmc was first coming up it was like man they're so cool right like like run swag and just.
Interviewer,D like how they're doing it right now you know when i see clips from back then i feel like.
Eminem,This  still looks cool today like you get the story you get the context but yeah but knowing the story of how.
Interviewer,The  originated to me is just it's so intriguing to me like i love.
Eminem,Stories like that i remember i i remember one day one day i uh i hit red man because.
Interviewer,I was like i asked him i i was listening to you know i collect tapes and just trying to get the you know in.
Eminem,First nostalgia purposes but i also play the tapes right because it's just something that.
Interviewer,You know reminds you of a kid and whatever so i'm playing the tape and i remember.
Eminem,Uh on the illegal album uh jamal said uh jamal said uh what the  did he.
Interviewer,Say uh something about uh got a quote from my man read.
Eminem,It says tonight's the night or whatever and it was an ad-lib on there so i was like i just asked him i checked.
Interviewer,I hit him up i was like yo red did you say uh was that you on the ad lib there because.
Eminem,And he was explaining the story and i'm like yo that's why i love old stories like that because it'd be.
Interviewer,It'll be the  that i always wondered as a kid but now it's like i know a lot of these.
Eminem,Guys so i want to you know i try not to fan out too much but.
Interviewer,But sometimes like i just love little jewels like that did you ever see the uh unsung epmd.
Eminem,Yeah bro oh my god yeah like this like headbanger yeah like how that song was made and like what happened at the.
Interviewer,Video shoot and the you know the tension it was on it because him and.
Eminem,Like eric and paris were going through some things but it was like but uh just knowing those stories.
Interviewer,Because when when when we're kids man we just see it on tv we just see the actual finished product product we don't.
Eminem,See we don't know what the story was behind any of the  at that time right so.
Interviewer,When you grow up and you learn oh that's what was going on during that time oh that  is crazy.
Eminem,Like that to me is the the the best  yeah bro uh man next time we talk man i wanna i'm gonna ask you about a bunch of.
Interviewer,Songs that in your repertoire that that you produce and you can give me some of the backstory on that i love to.
Eminem,Do that okay you down with that yeah paul you down paul.
Interviewer,Like like four flat tires sway you know that the way i am the real quick story i will tell you.
Eminem,About that is that that i i remember being on a plane i got on a.
Interviewer,Plane and i was thinking it is this this flow in my head.
Eminem,And then all of a sudden the piano started coming to me then and then and then and then.
Interviewer,And then and then and i just kept repeating the the the melody so i didn't forget it.
Eminem,And i kind of wrote the song on the plane and then had to make the beat afterwards.
Interviewer,So and and i remember i i didn't know how to like i had to ask dre how to do it because at.
Eminem,That point in time like i was still learning how to produce right so i needed to make the idea come.
Interviewer,To life so i remember and i was actually on the way out to la.
Eminem,Um at that time to record with dre so that was one of the things that i brought to him and i was telling him the.
Interviewer,Idea so we just had to keep the keyboard player play to play the melody.
Eminem,And then he had a bunch of drum sounds up on his uh on the drum machine and i just started.
Interviewer,Tapping and and uh that's kind of how that came about.
Eminem,Oh  uh man i know we got to go but dre man um just even having that access.
Interviewer,If i'm trying to think nobody is done with drake has done what dre.
Eminem,Has done but who's a producer that you really like put on a pedestal maybe not like dre.
Interviewer,But if anybody could do a versus with dre who you think it could be like could it be diddy could it be jermaine.
Eminem,Dupri could it could it be molly mall who you think it could be to just go song a song with.
Interviewer,Dre i know bro you know i mean you know i'm gonna be a little biased anyways but.
Eminem,No there are some amazing producers though man that could could uh definitely.
Interviewer,Definitely uh be on his level you know close to that level mm-hmm who you think i don't even know how.
Eminem,How to say it you know i'm trying to be politically correct but i think that uh you know dre is in in in.
Interviewer,His own class as far as there's only one direct man he's in the class by himself yeah.
Eminem,But but you know but molly mom man that dude has a lot of  hits a lot of hits and uh he's done a lot of.
Interviewer,Classic  as well as dre has you know yeah think about like the symphony.
Eminem,You know um all the ll records he produced man that that dude has done so much marley mall would be great man.
Interviewer,And then i think the other thing people get to know who he is that don't know that should know.
Eminem,How important that dude have been a hip-hop you know from rakim eric b roxanne juice crew all of that all of.
Interviewer,That stuff uh yo um congratulations on uh well i don't even know if congratulations is.
Eminem,The right way to say it but i commend you on what the marshall mathers foundation is doing with.
Interviewer,Love your dj and i want to remind all the djs if you're in the state of michigan.
Eminem,First 500 entries will be eligible for um to get a payment you know a stimulus payment almost of 313 dollars.
Interviewer,And then they will select the best of the mixers or which mix they feel like fits a four.
Eminem,Five the best and it will be aaron on shave four five but you got up until uh april 29th to enter this competition.
