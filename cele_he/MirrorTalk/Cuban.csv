Interviewer,How would you explain what NFTs are and how they are valuable?
Cuban,"It's just a digital collectible. Period. End of story. A collectible can be anything you want to collect. I collected CDs, I collected DVDs, you used to be able to buy and resell CDs and buy and resell DVDs and LPs. Now, it's just a digital version of all that. It's not complicated, it's not anything fancy, and the beauty of it is there's no hassle factor. I got some of my cards here. See this guy here? That's the original No. 77, that's not Luka , that's Jake Voskuhl the original No. 77 on the Dallas Mavericks, the one and only. A true collector of cards would be mad at me for not having it in a case and not having it all wrapped up. So, if Jake Voskuhl had a moment, I don't have to worry about any of those things. When you deal with physical collectibles, you have to worry about grading it, storing it, packaging it, shipping it, receiving it, valuing it... and the evaluations are not efficient whatsoever; one card store is going to evaluate it differently, one website is going to evaluate it differently from another. With NFTs, because it's all digital, the marketplaces are becoming a lot more efficient. They're not all the way there yet, but they're getting there and you take away all the hassles of physical ownership."
Interviewer,People who are new to NFTs always ask
Cuban,Dumbest question ever!
Interviewer,How did you first hear of NBA Top Shot and NFTs?
Cuban,"I don't even remember, but my first step was I went to a site called Mintable.app and I just started minting them. Then, I took a GIF of me walking into the Mavs arena to work out and I decided to post it for sale. I did 10 or 20 for the equivalent of $25 ETH. As I was going through setting it up, I'm thinking to myself, 'Nobody is going to buy this sh*t. Nobody.' Then, I saw this part to set up a royalty  and I'm like, 'You're kidding me!' This is the first time with digital content or goods at all that you can participate in the resell market so that's when I was like, 'I have to learn more about what's going on here.' So, I did my little GIF and I sold 20 for $25 each and then they started reselling and reselling, and I kept getting these transactions in my wallet for more and more money. I learned very quickly that I needed to learn what NFTs were all about because this could change how things were marketed, this could change how digital content is monetized and how IP is monetized. So, that's when I started digging in and that led me to Top Shot."
Interviewer,"Do you think we'll continue to see the NBA embrace Top Shot even more and if so, what could that look like?"
Cuban,"Of course you're going to see it. And it really comes down to what players do and that's the unknown. I'm trying to get Luka to sit down for lunch with me because we already got it set up to do an auction for a non-game NFT that he could do just him smiling or we got some that are drawings of him. Who knows how much people are going to bid for that if it's a Luka-authored original NFT? It could be on Top Shot, if there's a program there for players to do that, or it could be off of Top Shot. So, we'll see what players do;  that, and we'll see that extended to teams. We're trying to figure out how to use blockchain for ticketing and once you start doing that, you can start offering NFTs or moments from Top Shot as part of your ticket and create incremental value in a hundred ways and that becomes immediately tradable and sellable, etc. So, there's all kinds of iterations that these things can offer that are just crazy."
Interviewer,"We've asked you before what kind of business you'd start if you were back at square one and you've always said that you'd do something related to artificial intelligence. Now that this blockchain and NFT industry is taking off, would that be your new answer?"
Cuban,"That's a great question. So, AI has the bigger payoff right now, but it's a lot harder. Blockchain is the path of least resistance because as complicated as it sounds, it's not. So, trying to understand how blockchains work, . There's tons of competition. Top Shot uses Flow from Dapper Labs and that's one version of a blockchain. Ethereum's got theirs, Bitcoin's got theirs; there's a zillion different blockchains right now and each of them have their different pluses and minuses. So, there are challenges there. It's like the early days of the internet when everyone had a website. At the beginning, everyone thought it was hard to set up a website and companies found a high school kid who learned HTML and JavaScript to set it up for them and then they realized it was easy. This is the same thing. There's a lot of opportunities to take blockchain and smart contracts and create Web 3.0 versions of things that are being done now. Crypto is really changing a lot of things, the centralized finance. If you own Ethereum or Bitcoin or some other things, you basically make money as your own personal banker lending money, borrowing money, arbitraging it."
Interviewer,Most of these NFTs will fail and be worthless years from now.
Cuban,"Oh, of course."
Interviewer,"So, how do you decide which NFTs you're going to purchase? And why are you bullish on Top Shot specifically?"
Cuban,"Well, it's kind of spray-and-pray to a certain point. You know some of them aren't going to work and what I use to determine  is the size of the community. It's almost like Dogecoin. It's not that Dogecoin has any intrinsic value other than having fun. It's just there's a community of Dogecoin-lovers that really have fun with it and are just insane about it. And that's what I look for; the community of buyers. Beeple has insane, rich buyers; he just sold something for $69 million! 3LAU sold something for $3.3 million! King of Leon did $2 million worth of stuff. So, what you look for is really rabid, strong communities and Top Shot has the biggest, most rabid community right now. You can go to cryptoslam.io and you can see all the information. There's 122,000 buyers for Top Shot and there's nobody else even close. That tells you the community is there, and it's just starting; 122,000 is bigger than everyone else, but it's tiny versus the future market so this is only going to get bigger."
Interviewer,What are some moments that you're going after?
Cuban,"One thing to consider is that pandemic games are going to start being scarce in the future because we're going to be getting away from  and the pandemic will be weird, particularly to kids 5-10 years from now. They'll see these games without any fans and I think those will have added value."
Interviewer,"If you could create any Top Shot moment of your choice, what would it be? It can be a moment featuring you or anyone you'd like."
Cuban,"Oh, when the Mavs won , there's a picture... There's 30 seconds left and it's so stressful because you just never know when a lead will disappear. You can be up 10 points with two minutes to go and you can't be satisfied. But we got to the point where we were up 10 with 30 seconds to go and I just let out this big sigh of relief. There's a picture of me alongside Brendan Haywood and Deshawn Stevenson and some of our staff and I'm just holding onto them and screaming at the top of my lungs. That would be my Top Shot moment."
Interviewer,Your 2003-04 season opener was against the Lakers (and it was Karl Malone and Gary Payton's debut). I don't know if you remember what about that game was so unique....
Cuban,"The trash-can uniforms! We had brand-new uniforms that we thought were so cool, but we'd never had them on during a game. Well, when the players played in them, the sweat made them look like trash ! We never wore them again; that was the one time! That was not meant to be. It was brutal. We got destroyed. I was so pissed. I was just like, 'Toss these uniforms. Get them the hell out.'."
Interviewer,Does every company need to be on social media?
Cuban,"Yes. Not every company needs to post on social, but they need to be acutely aware of what is being said about them."
Interviewer,What's the biggest mistake you see marketers making today?
Cuban,Chasing trends rather than thinking through what the best solution is for any given product.
Interviewer,What's one piece of advice you'd give to entrepreneurs trying to scale a business quickly?
Cuban,Sales cures all.
Interviewer,What's the #1 marketing tool that's made the biggest difference in any of your businesses over the past 2 years?
Cuban,"2 years ago it was influencers, now it's organic video."
Interviewer,Can you clarify what you mean by organic video?
Cuban,Telling stories on video that include your company and what it does.
Interviewer,What's the one business lesson you learned when you started out that you still use today?
Cuban,"The one lesson I have learnt that helped when I was 12 years old and when I was 16 till today is that sales cures all. There has never been a business that ever succeeded without sales, and as the CEO, as a founder, and as an entrepreneur, if I can sell, I am always going to have a shot to survive, and I am always going to have a really good shot to succeed."
Interviewer,What is the biggest sacrifice you have to make when first starting a business?
Cuban,"When you are starting a business the biggest sacrifice that you probably don't expect is that you don't own your business; your customers own it, and you'll be holding on to them 24X7. If you are not, you are not going to be in business for very long."
Interviewer,What's the biggest misconception that new business owners have?
Cuban,"I think the biggest misconception that new entrepreneurs and new business owners have is that they think it's better than a 9-to-5 job because they can control their own hours and they are in control of what goes on. This couldn't be further from the truth. When you start a company, all hours are business hours, and I think you tend to think very quickly that your 9-to-5 job was easy compared to the hours in your own startup."
Interviewer,Is your day now 9 to 5?
Cuban,"My days are never 9 to 5 but I have always been very fortunate that even when I was broke and doing a startup, I loved what I was doing and the hours would go by so quickly because I was so consumed by it then, and now too. I may not be in the startup life from the perspective of, 'okay, my back's against the wall, I'm sleeping on the floor, or I am broke', but I want to win. I am competitive, I am always in, and I am always trying to learn. Whether it's one of my businesses, or a business that I have invested in, I am always trying to make it better."
Interviewer,Do you have a process of selecting a business?
Cuban,"When it comes to selecting a business I don't really have a process. I just try to be opportunistic, and look at the skills of the entrepreneur or the uniqueness of the business, and the competitive landscape. I will see how much I can help and what is going to take to get to the Promised Land to make a lot of money."
Interviewer,Can one have a good idea and a bad pitch?
Cuban,"We see so many pitches and some people think that if it is a bad pitch, the idea, the opportunity, and the company have no chance, particularly on Shark Tank, but that's just not the case."
Interviewer,Can you have a bad idea and a good pitch?
Cuban,"Yes, the other side of the equation is where even if it's a great pitch, it doesn't make for a good business if you don't know what you are doing. Even if you make it sound good, you still don't know what you're doing."
Interviewer,What are your top two tips for an entrepreneur about to give a pitch?
Cuban,"The two things that an entrepreneur needs to know, whether pitching to Shark Tank or anywhere, is"
Interviewer,Has being on Shark Tank changed the way you do business at all?
Cuban,"The thing that I have learnt with Shark Tank and really has changed my method of doing business over the past 10 years is 'nice pays off'. I don't know if I was always the nicest guy when I did business, but I was never mean, I never tried to steal, or take advantage of anybody, and I have always tried to do win-win deals. But sometimes I would get angry or ornery if I didn't think things were progressing the way I wanted them to. And just having seen all the entrepreneurs come through, and all the experience and the heartbreaks they have had, I have learnt the value of nice. Nice is so undervalued and it makes doing business so much easier. It makes the result so much better when you are just nice."
Interviewer,Does each season of Shark Tank have a different feel?
Cuban,"Each season always has a different feel. We have different guests, and as time goes on all the entrepreneurs have a better feel for what we like or what we don't like because they have watched the show so much. The deals get bigger and the companies get more advanced, so yes every season is just a little bit different and a little better."
Interviewer,Shark Tank is about to reach its 200th episode. How do you feel about that?
Cuban,"It is crazy the show's 10th season is about to air the 200th episode. I came on as a Guest Shark in Season 2. I thought, 'I'd do my three episodes and the show will be gone. It will be a great experience and maybe I would pick up some interesting businesses'. So when I was a Guest Shark, I bought every single thing that came out. I didn't think it would last, but here we are, in the 10th season and 200th episode. It has been a phenomenal ride. I hope it goes on forever."
Interviewer,"Mark, I appreciate you being here. I want to get your reaction to this report as it came out."
Cuban,"I mean, I didn't know, and I don't have an explanation. You know I can give you lots of reasons, but they don't matter. It was my responsibility, and I have to be accountable for it."
Interviewer,"I think it's hard for some people to reconcile because you are respected as a smart businessman. You have a television show, and your billing on that television show is that you're a great businessman. So how do you match that up with what you're telling me here?"
Cuban,"In hindsight, it was staring me right in the face, and I missed it. I wasn't as focused on the business as I should've been. You know when I talk about being actively involved, I could tell you every salary of everybody, every NBA player over the last 15 years. I would talk to Rick and our coaches over the years, and be there at practices, and be there on the basketball side, day in day out live it. If I was in our business office five times in 15 years, that was a lot, you know. It's embarrassing to say. There were people who I just hadn't met and hadn't talked to."
Interviewer,"There are a lot of emails of you asking about ticket sales and marketing, so there are business-side functions you were very involved in."
Cuban,No question. It all ties back to the basketball
Interviewer,"I want talk about the CEO, who is one of the large focuses of this investigation the dozen or so women who were victimized by Terdema Ussery. He was the man who was the Mavs' CEO for 15 of the 18 years that you owned the team. And I want to read off some of this"
Cuban,I didn't know that.
Interviewer,How do you not know that when you buy the team? It was in the newspapers. It was on the radio.
Cuban,"Yeah, I mean, I literally did not know it. This was in 1998, and I was running Broadcast.com, which I was sleeping and breathing. I was a season-ticket holder and went to games, but I had no idea. From the time I talked to Ross Perot to the time I bought the team in January of 2000 was less than six weeks. Should I have done due diligence? Should they have disclosed it? Yes. You know, it was just this was a dream come true. And you know, should I have interviewed Terdema to make sure he'd be a good CEO and there weren't issues? Yeah. And I didn't. I was just excited to buy the Mavs. It just never dawned on me that within my own company, within the Mavericks, that no one would reach out to me."
Interviewer,"But do you understand why? With this public presence you projected as being this tough boss, and then also with him being kept in that position for so long?"
Cuban,"Look, we did a lot of things wrong. And I wasn't there to oversee him. And so, yeah, everybody has every reason to question me. But I just wasn't there. And that was my fault."
Interviewer,"When you read through the report and you really read the details of things that you hadn't known about before, what stood out to you as the most difficult? Of what people had to go through?"
Cuban,"Just the pain that they had to go through, at my company. It was the same way I felt when I stood in front of Mavs employees for the first time, after this came out. And I apologized to them. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this was happening right underneath me. The pain that people went through, the pain that people shared with me as this happened, the tears that I saw it just, it hurt. And the way I felt is nothing compared to the way they felt. I have to recognize I made a mistake, learn from it and then try to fix it."
Interviewer,"Was there a person who talked to you, or sat across from you or someone who you've read about, that it stuck with you?"
Cuban,"It was just the looks on people's faces when I was sitting when I first met with Mavs employees after this happened and I didn't know how bad an actor Terdema was. And so I didn't know the degrees of everything. But I could just see it in everybody's face. And these are people that I barely knew, which is just bad enough that it just tore me apart. I mean, there's no other way to explain it."
Interviewer,"The Sports Illustrated article comes out. You're quoted right away. You said, this stuff isn't acceptable. This matters to me. Also though, investigators found that through an intermediary, you reached out to Terdema Ussery. And the message you had passed along to him is don't worry I won't throw you under the bus."
Cuban,"Well, context matters."
Interviewer,That's why I'm asking about it.
Cuban,"Right, so when it first happened, like I said, I had no idea how bad it was. I talked to two people who I asked to go to Terdema's former assistant, and I said, Look, pending everything that happens with the investigation, I don't want to get in a PR shouting match. And it wasn't like we were trying to hide anything, because I told investigators that I did it, you know."
Interviewer,You can understand how that sentence doesn't sit well when you read it on a piece of paper.
Cuban,"I know. I understand that completely. But again, that's why I was very forthright when the investigators I volunteered that to them. It wasn't about them asking me."
Interviewer,One of the other employees that I know  talked to you about is Chris Hyde. He was a high-ranking ticket sales official within the company. And again I'm just going to read this so I get it right
Cuban,"Yeah, I didn't know about that."
Interviewer,"You were notified about the pornography on his computer. In 2008, there was an email trail for that. And you wrote him an email saying, Hey, you better stop this or I'll fire you."
Cuban,Yes. On the spot. Right.
Interviewer,Did you ever follow up to see if he had stopped it?
Cuban,"Well, I got reports back saying he was on probation and that he was being dealt with. So I just assumed it was being dealt with. I didn't have any reason to think otherwise."
Interviewer,"So three years after that, after that email exchange with Hyde, one day he left the office for a two-hour lunch and, again, I'm going to just read this to get the details right"
Cuban,"Obviously, that's a huge mistake on my part. I was under the impression that the first issue with pornography was resolved, and obviously wasn't. And I also said if anything happens again, he's fired."
Interviewer,Wouldn't this qualify?
Cuban,"Well, that was three years earlier, and I hadn't had any follow-up. From my perspective, there were no other issues. But, again, in hindsight, it was stupid on my part."
Interviewer,"I mean, when you read it in black and white, and I say it sitting here across the table and say it for you..."
Cuban,"No, it's ridiculous. I messed up. I should have just fired him on the spot. It was a huge mistake. There's no way to downplay it, and if someone showed me this from another company and asked me to read it, I would say you can't make a bigger mistake, because that destroys the whole culture of your organization. And every time I go talk to people about business, I talk about culture. I don't have any excuses. I'm not trying to justify it. It's just I made a bad mistake, and it's not the only one I've said that I made."
Interviewer,"I do want to ask you about Earl Sneed, who you just mentioned. And frankly this is the one I have to tell you, Mark. I've known you for years and years, and when I read what happened here, I can't put together how the person I know and I've talked to for a long time OK'd a lot of this stuff. And for people who aren't familiar, Sneed was the team beat writer for the Mavericks' team website."
Cuban,One of them.
Interviewer,"And he was arrested outside the office, right at work, for beating his fiancée so badly he left her visibly bruised and with a broken wrist. She went to the hospital for it. He pled guilty to that in court. And you not only didn't fire him, you offered to pay his legal expenses."
Cuban,"Well, no... OK, that's not from my the information I had was just coming from Earl."
Interviewer,"His fiancée emailed you directly also, though, according to the investigation."
Cuban,"Right, the information I had, though, came, you know... I sent it back to H.R. And then the information I got was from Earl. And again, one to multiple mistakes applies here"
Interviewer,"There was a second incident though. He then started actually dating a fellow co-worker. And because you guys hadn't even suspended him or anything, the women in the office didn't know that he was someone who had beaten up his fiancée and who had broken her bones. And the other Mavericks employee... he got violent with her. She came to work the next day with visible bruises and swelling in her chest and face and arms. And she said she didn't feel safe in the office. And again, you guys didn't fire him. And this is where I break down again on why."
Cuban,"Again, in hindsight I would have done it differently. But, young African-American man, and this is 2014, and I had a decision to make. And the decision was, do I just fire him? And my fear and it's documented in the report, and talking to the investigators my fear if I just said, 'OK you're fired,' what are you going to do next? And what happens to the next person? And that's what I was thinking to myself. And so I set a series of rules for him, that he had to be accompanied. He had to go to counseling, and there were a variety of things to keep an eye on him."
Interviewer,I know I'm not the first person to point out to you that you could have removed him from the workplace and still gotten him counseling.
Cuban,"In hindsight you're exactly right. I'm just telling you what I thought, and I said the same thing publicly, and I said the same thing to investigators"
Interviewer,"Now that you have gone through all of this, what message do you now know that this sent the other women in the office?"
Cuban,"Oh, it was horrible."
Interviewer,"You basically told them, 'Hey, one of the guys in this office can hit you and we will still keep him here, coming to the office and sitting next to you.'."
Cuban,"I was tone deaf. And I have no excuse. I should have known better, or I could have done better. I've learned. There's just no other way to put it."
Interviewer,"In talking to you and reading all this, it does seem like another real lesson that you have absorbed through this is that it's not just about these specific behaviors, it's about the environment you set up. As recently as the beginning of this calendar year, the report details that in your business office 70 percent of the employees were male. Only 30 percent were female. There were zero women who were at the executive level to where they would be in the top-level meetings. There were zero people of color. And that even the women who did work there their salaries were not competitive with the commensurate men who did those jobs at other NBA franchises. What kind of environment do you think that set up in your business atmosphere? About the worth of women?"
Cuban,"Obviously not a good one. And once it came to my attention, we immediately jumped to fix it. It wasn't acceptable. It's not something that's going to happen going forward. We immediately stepped in and brought in a CEO who brought all of this to my attention. And I gave her carte blanche to do what she needed to do because it's not right and it's not even good business. And so we were doing everything possible to fix it."
Interviewer,"One of the things the NBA announced today is that you personally will donate $10 million to women's organizations, and that is going to strike some people as very significant, because the maximum the league can fine a team owner is $2.5 million. So that's four times that amount. It will strike some people as, 'Hey, this guy is a billionaire. That's not that significant at all. Didn't lose his team. He didn't lose any of the more basketball-related things.' What do you think of that decision?"
Cuban,I think more important than the money is the example we can set. Because there hasn't been anybody who really has had to go through this and set the tone. What's the right way to respond? And what's the right thing to do? And so the goal even more than the money is for me to get out there and teach others from my experiences.
Interviewer,Was there any point throughout this where Adam Silver discussed with you selling the team?
Cuban,No.
Interviewer,Was there ever a point you considered it yourself?
Cuban,No. I don't run away from my mistakes.
Interviewer,I know the day the Sports Illustrated article came out you addressed the Mavericks employees at the office. There are former employees mentioned in this report who felt they had to leave the company. Things were so bad they had to leave the profession because they couldn't get another job after unceremoniously leaving your company. Have you called to talk to any of them to apologize?
Cuban,No.
Interviewer,Should you?
Cuban,"Well, I don't know the circumstances. I don't know any of the individuals themselves because of the way the report is structured."
Interviewer,"If one of those employees wants to identify herself and come to you to get some closure, are you open to that?"
Cuban,"Yeah, I talked to the investigators because, again, I don't know what promises they made. I just don't know if I'd be the right person to try to solve it."
Interviewer,I wouldn't be surprised if somebody would like to talk to you personally.
Cuban,I'm not closing any doors yet. I just don't want to violate the privacy.
Interviewer,Hi i'm tom foster inc magazine's editor at large i am thrilled that for this session of.
Cuban,The inc vision conference my guest is none other than mark cuban if you're here you probably.

Interviewer,Future um in your case i don't think it's magic but i'm curious sort of what the secret.
Cuban,Is that that has helped you do that i'm just always learning you know um steve jobs famously said everything's a.
Interviewer,Remix and i i truly take that to heart you know um typically with with almost every new invention every new.
Cuban,Business type whatever it may be every new industry you try to create it's it's an extension of something that.
Interviewer,Already exists in some manner and you just find a new angle to to provide it and so.
Cuban,You know if you're always learning if you're always consuming information if you're always asking yourself.
Interviewer,You know how can i do this better or i always ask myself with my businesses you know how would i kick my own ass or.
Cuban,How would a competitor kick my ass and how do i stay ahead of that if you're always looking to push forward.
Interviewer,Then you know it's good you're going to find new ways of doing things and create new businesses and and you know new.
Cuban,Opportunities that's great i want to come back to some of the the specific ways you've gone.
Interviewer,About doing that um but let me ask you first about um something that was in the news just.
Cuban,Recently um you made some headlines you uh picked up delante west a a troubled former nba star um you you went.
Interviewer,Out of your way to find him at a gas station pick him up take him somewhere safe wait till a.
Cuban,Family member came and and i believe now he's getting uh the kind of help that he needed.
Interviewer,Um and i'm curious you know i i less about the details of what actually happened that night but your.
Cuban,Perspective on on why it's important that somebody in your position.
Interviewer,Really go out of his way or her way to to help others who are really in need you.
Cuban,Know the reality is for better or worse we all make these little judgments in our mind when it comes.
Interviewer,To helping people you know is it you know can i do it do i have the skill set do i have the.
Cuban,Time do i have the resources and the reality is right now in this pandemic sitting at home i have to time.
Interviewer,You know and i have the resources and as you know delante played for the mavs and i was heartbroken when i saw the.
Cuban,The pictures of him you know begging for money on on corners and it just so happened that.
Interviewer,One of the places where the pictures came from is you know a couple miles from my house so i went out.
Cuban,And started driving around to look for him um reached out to his mom i got found.
Interviewer,Somebody who had her phone number and you know got his new number and and started calling him.
Cuban,And for a few days he didn't return my call and at one point he did and when he did.
Interviewer,I just said delante don't move and it you know it wasn't like i took this huge undertaking and it was.
Cuban,Just it was really pretty straightforward i went i got him you know i stuck him in my car.
Interviewer,And you know found a hotel room until his mom could get there and and it is his father-in-law and you know just try.
Cuban,To help and then once we got her there you know his response to her was going to be a lot different than to other.
Interviewer,People and we worked with um an organization she had been working with and.
Cuban,She really had the hard part of getting him on the plane and getting them down to rehab.
Interviewer,But we did that and so you know it was just the right thing to do it it was you know i hate to say it this.
Cuban,Way but it was easy for me to do and so why wouldn't i do it take taking a slightly uh wider angle um.
Interviewer,Um lens at that uh how do you think about your sort of civic responsibility and the civic.
Cuban,Responsibility of of successful people and of of businesses um you know we have we have a.
Interviewer,Community of entrepreneurs here watching watching this show um what is the civic responsibility to to reach out.
Cuban,And sort of help those who are less fortunate than us great question tom um.
Interviewer,You know the business world has evolved over the past three four or five decades you know things.
Cuban,Used to be you know i remember when i first graduated from college way back when.
Interviewer,You know people talked about ibm and eds and wearing a crisp white shirt and you know a specific tie and you had to.
Cuban,Wear a suit you know and look the part always and you know we were very.
Interviewer,Formal in the business world and over the years that that's really changed and we've come to the understanding that.
Cuban,Really our our country our economy really truly is only as strong as our weakest links.
Interviewer,And it took me a while you know because look we all as entrepreneurs go through this process.
Cuban,Can i start a business you know how you know starting the business getting going um just trying to survive and then.
Interviewer,Hopefully having some level of success and then you know while you're trying to succeed.
Cuban,You're just in this grind that consumes you and it's really hard to look at the bigger picture.
Interviewer,Because you just want to survive and you want to succeed and you want to take care of your employees but.
Cuban,At some point as you reach different levels of success um when you're past that point of just.
Interviewer,Having to worry about can you pay the bills and and the reality obviously a lot of.
Cuban,People have fallen back to the point where they're concerned about can they pay their bills and during this.
Interviewer,Pandemic but if you get to the point where you're past that you have to start looking at the macro.
Cuban,Issues and in looking at the macro issues you know we the community you know we're.
Interviewer,Mostly a consumer driven economy and the the weaker the consumers are the weaker our communities are.
Cuban,The weaker our cities are and the you know the weaker the people in those communities and.
Interviewer,Cities are then the harder it is for any of us to do business and so to me.
Cuban,I think you know we really have to start understanding that capitalism needs to be compassionate because you.
Interviewer,Know there's just so many in this day and age because of social media in particular we.
Cuban,Get to see people we never saw 50 years ago you know.
Interviewer,They're right in front of us and we start to understand their impact the innova when people aren't educated.
Cuban,You know when kids aren't educated when kids don't get proper education when they.
Interviewer,Can't eat when they don't have proper housing when there's not grocery stores and you live.
Cuban,In a food or medical desert then we really are it makes it hard for business to succeed.
Interviewer,You know it makes it hard for us to grow the economy it makes it hard for us to succeed as a country and so to me you.
Cuban,Know i've gotten to that point where i can say you know what you know let's think.
Interviewer,About helping people because this country has given me so much it's time for me to give something back and i.
Cuban,Think every entrepreneur does needs to do the same thing at the scale that's relative to them.
Interviewer,Right so you might have a small 5 or 10 15 person company but you're you know you're really going.
Cuban,To be tied to a community at some level what can you do to make your community a little bit stronger because by doing.
Interviewer,That you know not only is it the right thing to do not only you supporting the people.
Cuban,That support you but you're helping the economy for the future of your company.
Interviewer,You know and as the bigger you the bigger you get as your company your company.
Cuban,The more you can do to help you know and and when you find those times that you can hire people that.
Interviewer,You may not have hired before because now you can invest in them to make them smarter and better.
Cuban,At you know what it is you do in your company you also start to open up new doors for new opportunities i mean.
Interviewer,It took me a long time to realize that you know it's a lot smarter if i'm selling to a certain community.
Cuban,It's a lot smarter and more efficient um with more upside to hire people from those communities.
Interviewer,Now they might not have the pedigree that i might have hired for in the past but by hiring people that.
Cuban,You know might might not have gone to college or might not even have graduated high school depending on the job and.
Interviewer,Training them you get a very loyal employee that understands the markets that you sell.
Cuban,Into better than you because you're probably not connected to them the way you used.
Interviewer,To be so i mean that that's a long-winded answer and a long way of saying that.
Cuban,You know the stronger your community is the stronger you can make your community the better business you're going to do.
Interviewer,The more appreciative your customers are going to be and the stronger our country is going to.
Cuban,Be as a result the phrase that keeps coming to mind to me as i'm listening to you talk about.
Interviewer,All that is income inequality you know we've all seen the stats where uh you know what it's.
Cuban,For 50 years the highest earning 20 percent uh in the us have brought a larger and larger share of our our.
Interviewer,Our country's total income um there are various other stats we've all seen about how.
Cuban,Income inequality has become more and more stark in the united states over the past few decades.
Interviewer,What is your take on on how that affects the ability for uh people to.
Cuban,Realize the dream of entrepreneurship in america realize the american dream really.
Interviewer,How how important is that issue as it relates to entrepreneurship you know it's critically important.
Cuban,Because you know it i've been in a situation where i you know i was getting paid by the hours of.
Interviewer,Bartender and you know had five roommates and you know had my lights turned off and you.
Cuban,Have that fear all the time when you're just getting paid by the hour and you know as opposed to where i.
Interviewer,Am now where i you know i can invest in stocks and bonds and companies and all the like and.
Cuban,I have appreciable assets and so when when people are just getting paid by the hour or just.
Interviewer,Have getting paid barely enough to get by they're not going to be able to increase.
Cuban,Their net worth at all i mean we can talk all we want about um you know well you just need more.
Interviewer,Discipline to save and if you save more you can invest more in you know half the country almost half.
Cuban,The country is invested in mutual funds or stocks but you have to think about that other half.
Interviewer,Because income equality as you've mentioned tom is becoming a bigger and bigger problem.
Cuban,So the question becomes how do we deal with that and you know my first company micro.
Interviewer,Solutions when i was 24 years old 23 years old um i started off because i couldn't.
Cuban,Really afford to pay people as much as they could get from other jobs so i gave them stock in the company and.
Interviewer,As it turned out my 80 employees all made good money when i sold my company you.
Cuban,Know almost 20 percent of the the total receipts from the sale of that company went to our employees.
Interviewer,And they were very happy and that worked out so well every company that i've started since.
Cuban,Then the people have gotten your stock or stock equivalents because you know the harder they work the more.
Interviewer,Value they created in those companies the bigger those companies came and when it came time to sell them.
Cuban,They benefited as well and that's something i take pride in but you know as an entrepreneur you really.
Interviewer,Should think very strongly about giving equity to your employees.
Cuban,Because you know not only will it make them you know take ownership of your company literally.
Interviewer,And figuratively but it really makes a difference in their lives as you do better.
Cuban,And if you get to the point where you have an exit oh my goodness i mean it may be enormous.
Interviewer,For them and it could be life-changing not just for them but for their families and their families families.
Cuban,And so if we're really going to address income inequality entrepreneurs ceos have got to look at.
Interviewer,How do we provide appreciable assets to employees you know um if in addition to.
Cuban,Equity i mean you know we've worked in programs where we've helped people get educations or.
Interviewer,We've helped them buy homes so you know anything you can do to help your employees you know.
Cuban,Invest in appreciable assets or receive appreciable assets that's how the income inequality gap.
Interviewer,Gets closed because anytime someone's just working by the hour it's just a flat salary.
Cuban,That you know barely lets them keep their head above board um we're not going to close that gap and.
Interviewer,I'll add one more thing you know um i went through we i'm half owner of the american airlines center.
Cuban,Where the mavs play the dallas stars we have concerts etc here in dallas and i wanted to make sure.
Interviewer,That all of our employees not only had a living wage and we were able to get them.
Cuban,Up to that 15 level and now even higher but i also wanted to know if employees any of my.
Interviewer,Employees were on federal assistance or any type of public assistance because to me.
Cuban,The ultimate insult as a capitalist was that i wasn't paying my i was paying so.
Interviewer,Little to my employees that they needed help from the government the libertarian in me just.
Cuban,Got sick to my stomach that that was a possibility now not all employees want to admit.
Interviewer,They're on government assistance of any sort but at the same time i was able to go.
Cuban,Through because you know we're all going to have employees that you know maybe make 30 thousand or forty.
Interviewer,Thousand dollars a year but have four kids you know it doesn't matter if they're 30 40 or 50 years old.
Cuban,But you know with four kids forty thousand dollars might be a good wage to someone.
Interviewer,Who's 21 but you know to somebody who has a family of six.
Cuban,That's not going to work and so you know what you can make the the argument or we can have the.
Interviewer,Discussion well is it fair is it a pure meritocracy the reality is what was important to me.
Cuban,Is you know i can't live with myself if one of my employees is on government assistance.
Interviewer,And so i went and found those unique circumstances and made sure they were compensated in a way.
Cuban,That that made their lives work better and in addition to the equity they were receiving the company.
Interviewer,And you know the response is was phenomenal my turnover rates weren't you know.
Cuban,Through the floor you know i'll give you the example that microsolution is my first company again.
Interviewer,I had one person leave the entire eight years i owned that country company and they came back and worked for me.
Cuban,After they left and so you can create a culture of gain for your employees and i think.
Interviewer,It's important to do so and that's really what compassionate capitalism starts to address that's great great.
Cuban,Answer um i want to stay on on sort of sensitive subjects for just a moment.
Interviewer,Longer um a few years back i think it was 2014 or 15..
Cuban,Um you made some headlines at uh uh conference yeah and um um you know there was a quote about you know where you.
Interviewer,You i won't even bother repeating the quote but essentially your point was that we all have ingrained prejudices.
Cuban,And one of the important things to do is is to recognize that we correct me if i'm.
Interviewer,Wrong here but to recognize that we have ingrained prejudices in order to be able to address them and.
Cuban,And move forward um i feel like that point is um more important this year than than maybe.
Interviewer,Ever before because of the really hard conversations that are being had um uh in the wake of the death of george.
Cuban,Floyd and all the other things that have gone on that have driven um you know big national conversations.
Interviewer,I'm curious what you see as the really important priorities within the organizations that.
Cuban,You own that you run um to to recognize you know the the the ways that they can.
Interviewer,Improve when it comes to diversity and inclusion what what are you guys doing to to look.
Cuban,To the future you know i learned a lot since those days when when i you know talked about.
Interviewer,That um you know to me back then you know trying to understand my prejudices.
Cuban,I always looked at everything as a math equation treating people equally was treating people equally.
Interviewer,What i said to tom i would say to sally right because that's treating people equally.
Cuban,But what i learned was treating people equally does not mean you should treat them the same because.
Interviewer,Everybody's different and you're not recognizing particularly in a business environments.
Cuban,The opportunities that come with those differences and so i've come a long way since then.
Interviewer,And particularly as it applies now um you know the reality is that as a white person it's hard for us.
Cuban,To truly understand what it's like to to face racism that doesn't mean white people don't face difficulties and.
Interviewer,Adversity of course we do you know it doesn't mean that.
Cuban,You know whatever our ethnicity is our religion that there's not times we don't face um prejudice or even racism.
Interviewer,Of course we do but the reality is you know we have to start understanding the.
Cuban,Problems that those races face and in particularly you know african americans.
Interviewer,You know there there are just certain issues that you know and talking to my employees in in depth in ways that i.
Cuban,Didn't do it when i was at that inc conference that i've i've come to understand that.
Interviewer,You know i there's lots of things that don't happen to me.
Cuban,Because of the color of my skin and there's lots of things that do happen to african americans and latinos and.
Interviewer,And you know other you know people of color um in lgbtq because of who they are and we you know.
Cuban,It you know harkens back to what i said a little earlier we as entrepreneurs and.
Interviewer,Ceos we have to start to address those things because it's smart business.
Cuban,You know when when my employees um african-american employees so i sat down and talked to a bunch of of.
Interviewer,People of color in our organization and something that came up over and over again.
Cuban,Was the talk i'm like what's the talk and the talk is when you're african-american you want to talk to.
Interviewer,Your son in particular when he starts to drive and tell him how to respond if you get.
Cuban,Pulled over by the police things like you know if you can pull over in a lighted area.
Interviewer,If you can make sure somebody has with the phone is videotaping it always comply and do everything they ask.
Cuban,Knowing that they're still you know they they're still maybe racist not and i'm not saying police officers.
Interviewer,As a whole are racist but you're still going to come across it more often than not if you're.
Cuban,African-american and you have to adapt to these things you know and part of them part two of.
Interviewer,The talk is don't be surprised if you walk into the store no matter how you're dressed and people.
Cuban,Start watching you more closely then they watch your they watch white shoppers.
Interviewer,These are the things that that are the you know what happens with systemic racism and.
Cuban,You know i think it's incumbent upon me and my organizations to start recognizing that this is an.
Interviewer,Issue that my employees face and as long as they face that they're not going to be nearly as effective.
Cuban,Or efficient um or productive because just having that natural fear i mean you know imagine one of your black.
Interviewer,Employees going out and doing an errand you know and getting pulled over or you know doing something for work out on a.
Cuban,Sales call you know whatever it may be i mean and having that fear.
Interviewer,You know it's just there's so many elements to it but you have to be cognizant of what your.
Cuban,Employees go through and to me that that's just being a good human you know.
Interviewer,When when you can be more compassionate be more empathetic have a better eq things that.
Cuban,I was awful at i'm not gonna lie i mean over the course of my career i was go go go.
Interviewer,Go go go go ready fire aim and you know if you know if i wasn't that that most compassionate or empathetic person.
Cuban,That's okay because i'm on a mission well you know we're in a different era right now.
Interviewer,And for an organization that doesn't treat their their employees with empathy that.
Cuban,Doesn't recognize the differences and the nuances of their background in their race.
Interviewer,People aren't going to want to work with you people are going to want to get out of there as quickly as possible and not.
Cuban,Only your employees are going to recognize it but your stakeholders and your customers.
Interviewer,Are going to recognize that it all as well we've all dealt with organizations where.
Cuban,We just heard something or saw something and we shook our head but we didn't do something you know if.
Interviewer,That is your organization you're going to suffer and you're not going to succeed over the long term and.
Cuban,So again being empathetic understanding the backgrounds and the needs of each.
Interviewer,Each individual really um is going to make you a better entrepreneur a better ceo and you're going to have a more.
Cuban,Successful company you're a prolific investor um and uh uh in in in companies.
Interviewer,Um one of the things we've seen in in um venture investing is that uh you know there.
Cuban,There's a a vast under representation of of uh communities of color of of women of you know anything other than.
Interviewer,White men you know are are underrepresented um i'm curious uh uh specifically as regards to.
Cuban,Shark tank um what have you done personally or what has the the shark tank organization.
Interviewer,Done to try to think about equity in in in that way well you can go to mark cuban.com and see all the companies.
Cuban,I've invested in and we we break them down by veteran owned by women owned by.
Interviewer,People of color because it's important look i am so thankful that old white baby boomers.
Cuban,Are close-minded because and anybody out there who's an investor also should be thankful because it's so.
Interviewer,Idiotic that it creates incredible opportunities for me incredible opportunities for you.
Cuban,Incredible investment opportunities incredible hiring opportunities you know i always want to invest where.
Interviewer,People ain't right i always tell people you know when you're starting a company if there's a.
Cuban,Thousand people doing this same thing why would you want to be a thousand and one.
Interviewer,And there's so many undiscovered incredible entrepreneurs people of color latino you know um lg.
Cuban,Btq that for whatever reason you know vcs and other angels and seed investors just ignore.
Interviewer,I mean i actively solicit you know go out and find them you know and shark tank does the same.
Cuban,Thing i i i think we're past 50 in terms of women entrepreneurs coming on.
Interviewer,And presenting to us and i know this season women entrepreneurs people of color.
Cuban,Even during the pandemic we had some incredible companies come on and get deals.
Interviewer,But for me i think i i've easily invested over 50 million dollars in people and women of color and.
Cuban,And disadvantaged communities because it's just super smart business and you know i've.
Interviewer,Co-invested and you know helped found all the above because.
Cuban,You know not only are there some incredible people who have who are overlooked but you know people.
Interviewer,Who invest people of color able to sell to communities that they understand.
Cuban,That an old white guy's not going to understand or a white woman is not going to understand for that.
Interviewer,Matter you know and i've invested in women who you know um understand their communities.
Cuban,And what they're selling a whole lot better um there's just so many examples of you.
Interviewer,Know i've got this guy noel doherty who does these twist combs they look like little.
Cuban,Tennis racquets for for african-american hair that let you poof it up and shape it and all this stuff.
Interviewer,He's killing it i if if i haven't made 10x on my investment from shark tank it's about to happen you know and and so.
Cuban,Just there's just example of after examples um like that that you know if you're able to invest if.
Interviewer,You're able to partner if you're able to acquire if you're able to hire it just makes so.
Cuban,Much sense because there's just so much undiscovered talent that if you just go look for it you can find it.
Interviewer,Um i saw a stat the other day maybe i had one more thing there tom yeah and i'm not saying you know what give.
Cuban,Somebody a shot because they're black give somebody a shot because they're a woman give somebody.
Interviewer,A shot because they're um latina right i'm telling you if you look you will find.
Cuban,Talent that is incredible but is ignored right it and i'm all about meritocracy it's it's out there it's just that we.
Interviewer,Don't look for it right and if you go look for it if you go ask people about it you know maybe they went.
Cuban,To an hbcu so they you know or a small public university so they don't have the pedigree that gets.
Interviewer,Through you know hiring you know um that gets through recruiters or that the.
Cuban,Recruiters like to find you know they're out there to find and talking to the recruiting offices at public.
Interviewer,Universities or hbcus they're just incredible talent out there that is better than the talent that you.
Cuban,Hired you just didn't put in enough effort to go find the best um.
Interviewer,Let me change directions a little bit um we we started out um the conversation you said you know.
Cuban,One of the things you do is basically do your homework you're constantly learning um last time we.
Interviewer,Spoke a few months ago early on in the pandemic you told me you were spending a lot of time studying up on on.
Cuban,Artificial intelligence on on ai i'm curious what you're working on right now is that still your big project what.
Interviewer,Are the what are the big areas that that you're really investing your time in for you know preparing yourself for the.
Cuban,Future yeah ai you know it's one thing to learn about ai and you know i'm not an expert by a long shot.
Interviewer,I'm not out there creating you know trillion layer models you know.
Cuban,Um or anything like that but you know over time having become more literate in ai you.
Interviewer,Start understanding what works and what doesn't work and who does a good job and.
Cuban,Who doesn't and come and coming to the conclusion that right now this economy.
Interviewer,Is an economy a i have and a i have nots because doing implementing ai successfully.
Cuban,Is not cheap it's not easy so beware of people saying oh i have this great ai person.
Interviewer,And for this the minimus amount of money we can add ai to your company or you know just invest in this because.
Cuban,I have this guy from mit it doesn't work like that the cost the overhead associated with the data.
Interviewer,And the processing is enormous but we're turning into a country of ai haves and have nots and.
Cuban,If you look at the stock market the companies that are just booming right now in terms of stock.
Interviewer,Price even in the middle of this pandemic and yeah you have to kind of you know be a little critical just.
Cuban,Because of the easy money element of the stock market right now but look at the amazons the netflix is.
Interviewer,The unity's the um you know go down the list the the cloud players whatever it may be apple.
Cuban,Netflix etc right those companies have spent a decade.
Interviewer,If not more in some cases working on ai and invested billions whereas you know the inc 5000.
Cuban,Is very difficult for them to truly implement ai you know you can use a chat bot that you.
Interviewer,License you can use you know salesforce.com or um other you know sales mechanisms you can use.
Cuban,Vid iq that implement ai at some level to help you but in terms of being an ai driven.
Interviewer,Organization it's hard right now and it's difficult to do it correctly.
Cuban,And i i just suggest that when you try to do something in ai that you take care.
Interviewer,Because whatever you think your budget's going to be it's going to be 10 times that and just.
Cuban,Because something uses ai and gives you a response or results doesn't mean they're correct.
Interviewer,Right ai has to learn right it has to get smarter over time and so because it's so expensive and.
Cuban,Companies want to implement it it's very difficult not to just say well this is a.i provided so.
Interviewer,It must be right and i'm going to go all in on it so you have to be very very you have to be very very um not only.
Cuban,Literate but aware um and i have i don't have my book right here it's.
Interviewer,This one i'm reading right now called competing in the ai world or something like that.
Cuban,Um and that's a lot about what they talk about you know that not all ai is right out of the box but you have to.
Interviewer,Start thinking about the future and how you start implementing an ai and but being careful how you do it and cost.
Cuban,Conscious how you do it can you give me an example or two i mean as you just said right now you know.
Interviewer,There are risks in sort of not doing it right and and also you know saying hey look.
Cuban,It's expensive it's hard it's uh it it it's this concept artificial intelligence that we hear all.
Interviewer,Around us and yet can be kind of scary because how do you use it.
Cuban,I'm curious you know in your businesses in basketball in an arena in things that one might not.
Interviewer,Think right off the bat are uh you know have sophisticated artificial intelligence uh applications.
Cuban,How how has that kind of technology become really important for your businesses.
Interviewer,So in basketball it's non-stop use i mean our you know trying to create a predictive algorithm.
Cuban,That that takes um video from a game or actually captures video in real time and processes it um by.
Interviewer,Through computer vision and then processing that through you know machine learning or deep learning and.
Cuban,You know through pose estimation and trying to predict what happens if this is happening what's what's.
Interviewer,Something that we haven't considered could happen or what's that what are the elements.
Cuban,Of a game that need to be considered you know i'll give you one specific example you.
Interviewer,Know what how much space does a defense need to cover.
Cuban,Literally in creating the geometry of it in order to reduce um the points per possession by 0.1.
Interviewer,Right or 0.2 and you know and then you work backwards to the speed of the players.
Cuban,And how does that compare to their offenses ability what are the trade-offs all this is part of the machine learning.
Interviewer,Analytics that we're trying to figure out um you know from a business perspective.
Cuban,Um i've got a kid ian mchugh that um oh my god let's price something it's on.
Interviewer,Markqv.com i can't remember all my companies anymore um but what he does he uses machine.
Cuban,Learning to to in essence replace a b testing so what is the best price you should charge.
Interviewer,Online for a product and don't keep on running this.
Cuban,You know real time analysis of your gross margin dollars based off price changes that you test.
Interviewer,So you know if it's you know three dollars then what happens if it's three dollars and two cents what happens if.
Cuban,It's 2.98 and it works towards finding the optimal pricing.
Interviewer,But it keeps on retesting it all the time and that becomes something that is used through an api.
Cuban,To allow you to continuously test your pricing so those are two examples um.
Interviewer,You know i'll give you one for last one um with the mavericks you know what when we're looking to sell.
Cuban,Season tickets again when we're back getting started again you know what uh what what is.
Interviewer,A customer identity pattern that we should use to give us the best the best percentage.
Cuban,Chance of closing a person um to be maverick season ticket holders.
Interviewer,You know so is it somebody that likes flowers you know if you know is it someone who likes.
Cuban,Flowers and drinks tea and you know takes the bus you know all all these specific.
Interviewer,Elements and features that we look forward to create a pattern that allows us to determine.
Cuban,Where we should look for our next customer and which one has the best chance of.
Interviewer,Closing we've we've talked in the past about america 2.0 as a phrase you've used.
Cuban,Uh over over the last uh six months really since the pandemic took hold and by that i believe you mean you know.
Interviewer,Just sort of that we're going to come out of this with a whole new set of of of needs and opportunities um i'm.
Cuban,Curious that as you know you've looked at um our world over the last six months.
Interviewer,What are some of the opportunities that that you have spotted and really how has that that evolved.
Cuban,Over time how are you what are some things you're seeing today that you know in april even or may you might not have.
Interviewer,Anticipated i think we've gone a lot farther in the digital economy than i expected we would you know um.
Cuban,Everything that can be digital is becoming digital right now and we're finding this new equilibrium.
Interviewer,Where things that we would have done going to a mavs game going to a concert going to.
Cuban,A movie theater you know in terms of entertainment we're finding digital equivalents.
Interviewer,You know the streaming business is booming we're buying you know we used to go to restaurants a lot more than we do.
Cuban,Now and but it's not like we're not eating it's not like well i can't go to a.
Interviewer,Restaurant so i'm not having dinner tonight you know we're finding new ways to to.
Cuban,Buy food you know groceries being bought online is it you know it's exploding people are buying.
Interviewer,More things online they're getting educated you know cooking shows are going online.
Cuban,Um i've got one company from shark tank alice's table as an example.
Interviewer,They used to have they help women start businesses where they teach how to do floral.
Cuban,Arrangements as one example and that was all you know they'd you know take a ballroom in a hotel.
Interviewer,And sell tickets for 75 or whatever it was and bring in 100 people to teach them how to do.
Cuban,Floral arrangements and then they could then in turn charge people for the floral arrangements they do.
Interviewer,Well that all got shut down with covid and they went online and started to do it on a streaming basis.
Cuban,And so we're seeing a lot more people become a lot more efficient at doing this so they went.
Interviewer,From being able to do a hundred people in a ballroom to on mother's day having 1400 people or.
Cuban,Something like that and a partnership with 1 800 flowers and so.
Interviewer,They they effectively pivoted their delivery mechanism to being purely digital.
Cuban,And it's grown in and people appreciate it more and it's starting to to be a lot more comfortable with that approach.
Interviewer,Now that has a bigger implication you know there's this term creative destruction you know when we got rid of.
Cuban,Records we we saw cds come along you know um and then we saw.
Interviewer,Cds replaced by streams um in downloads and that you know it was bad for people in the record industry.
Cuban,You know i went to indiana and terre haute was the rca's largest manufacturer of records.
Interviewer,A lot of people lost their jobs unfortunately but you can make the point that it was creative destruction.
Cuban,And so now we're trying to figure out what part of the destruction is creative and what part will come back to the way.
Interviewer,It was before and as entrepreneurs that's the hard question we have to start answering.
Cuban,About our businesses and that's where we need to start looking for opportunities you know today.
Interviewer,I was talking to somebody well actually i was talking to myself you know i just happened to be thinking.
Cuban,You know as we try to look at at home where you know work from home versus going back to the office.
Interviewer,And the costs associated with the time associated and the commute time associated with it.
Cuban,Is there a better way to bring people together to be creative like if i don't have an office.
Interviewer,And eighty percent of my you know work is work at home.
Cuban,What can i do with that twenty percent and my initial thought was well there you know for working remotely.
Interviewer,There's no reason why i couldn't bring the office down to cabo right or bring them.
Cuban,To miami and be on the beach or set something up that's uniquely fun you know over the summer when kids are.
Interviewer,Out of school or you know put together you know things that are just.
Cuban,You know vacation and fun and exciting for my employees because i don't have this office over.
Interviewer,Ahead so what is the balance in terms of the cost for an office versus the cost of doing special events.
Cuban,And special programs like this you know if i have 20 people in one of my companies why couldn't i take 20.
Interviewer,People to a vacation destination set up the great broadband let's say.
Cuban,In the caymans it's the hedge fund capital world so the broadband's great you know once we start to get past this.
Interviewer,Pandemic that allows all these people to work there from for 30 days and bring their family.
Cuban,And just love every minute of it or keep them in dallas going into an office you know.
Interviewer,What are the cost elements or what you know what is the impact on my business and.
Cuban,You know can i do something like that that just completely changes the game it's destructive to your commercial.
Interviewer,Office space but how what's the impact on my employees and all my business on on our.
Cuban,Productivity in our results you know is it better to do it that way so those are the types of things that.
Interviewer,I'm looking at voice activation you know how much more can i learn about alexa.
Cuban,Because we're trying to be touch free where we can do i need to reserve key words on alexa so when we say alexa.
Interviewer,Dallas mavericks or alexa by mass ticket someone else you know or buy whatever you know buy a pet someone else.
Cuban,Doesn't grab that key word like maybe you know someone grabbed a domain name in the.
Interviewer,Past so just trying to think about those those things are.
Cuban,Keep me occupied but i think in terms of america 2.0 we're seeing a lot of those things and.
Interviewer,That creative destruction is going to lead to companies that are world-class companies great.
Cuban,Advice um we are running short on time i want to ask you one quick kind of wrap-up.
Interviewer,Question here bringing it back to the purpose of the vision conference which again is sort of helping founders.
Cuban,See a way forward can you take us out with one sort of final piece of general advice.
Interviewer,For founders who are um trying to keep their eye on the future in a very difficult time when there's so.
Cuban,Much that's making you look at what's right in front of you you know what be nice make people happy.
Interviewer,You know it seems to make perfect sense just to keep your customers happy to keep your stakeholders happy but.
Cuban,That's the reality look one of my favorite sayings is sales cures all.
Interviewer,And the best way to sell is to really educate your customers and make them happy.
Cuban,And the best way to find out what makes them happy is to ask them and that's not to say you have to do.
Interviewer,Everything they ask you to do but just by communicating you're going to be better in sales.
Cuban,By communicating with your employees and stakeholders your business is going to be better.
Interviewer,And then i i'd also add to what i said earlier look at the bigger picture when the.
Cuban,Community that you work in is thriving and the people around you are thriving your brand is.
Interviewer,Going to thrive as well when people don't feel good about you or your company because you're trying to cut.
Cuban,Corners and look it's hard not to right now because you might not have any revenue.
Interviewer,You still have to look at the bigger picture because if you know the your customer base and.
Cuban,Their economy doesn't thrive you don't thrive i think that's longer a little longer.
Interviewer,Than you wanted but i wanted to get it all in that's great uh mark thank you so much.
Cuban,For joining us thank you everybody for being here at the inc vision conference um.
Interviewer,Thanks again thank you thank you as always  .
Cuban,My name is Mark Cuban and you're listening to Freakonomics Radio.
Interviewer,"Hey, this is Stephen Dubner. Hey Mark Cuban, how's it going?"
Cuban,"Great, Stephen Dubner, how are you?"
Interviewer,"Great. Nice to talk to you. Congrats on Luka, do we say Doncic? How are we saying his last."
Cuban,Doncic.
Interviewer,"Doncic, yeah."
Cuban,Thank you.
Interviewer,"Congratulations. Yeah, he looks amazing."
Cuban,We hope he is.
Interviewer,"So let me ask you this. You're roughly 60 years old, you grew up in Pittsburgh, which is one of the best sports towns. I'm just curious, in a nutshell, how you think pro sports has changed since you were a kid."
Cuban,"Oh my goodness. That's a big question. It depends on which sport, it depends on what city. Depends on whose perspective. I think in a lot of ways it hasn't changed but in a lot of ways depending on what city you're in, your teams have come and gone, are better or worse. And it just depends on perspective."
Interviewer,"Okay, let's pick a team. Let's pick the Steelers of your childhood and my childhood. Guys like Rocky Bleier and Andy Russell, even Franco, well maybe not quite Franco, but these guys would typically work an off-season job, and they weren't making money to retire on. And now, obviously, the economics are a lot different, but the economics are a lot different on the business side as well. There's just been tremendous, tremendous, tremendous growth and I guess I'm curious, as sport has become such a massive and global business, whether you think that's basically made the product, the games, better, worse, different. How so?"
Cuban,"I mean I think it's made it better because it's an incentive for more people to become professional athletes. For all the stories of athletes working in the summer there's the Whizzer Whites of the world and other athletes who chose not to go into professional sports at all. And so now the money creates enough of incentive. But again, tha, that's just part of the equation. Now there's other issues there's CTE for hockey and football, there's, soccer is much mor,is a much bigger sport in the U.S. than it used to be when I was growing up. It wasn't even a varsity sport when I was in high school. And so a lot of things have changed."
Interviewer,You're best known probably for two things
Cuban,"Oh my goodness. Most of my other sports interests are driven through technology, whether it's Synergy Sports which does cataloging and video of all things basketball. Sports Radar, which is an information service for sports. Unikrn, which is delivery for e-sports. It allows for tokenized betting for e-sports right now. What else? Axon, which does neural development so that athletes can improve their neurological responses to stimuli and their physical responses as a result. Another company that uses virtual reality and like a Wii-like technology to help kids and athletes and professionals improve their dribbling skills and other basketball skills."
Interviewer,"Now, I would say of everything that you just named there if you were to rewind the tape to 40 years ago or 50 years ago when you were a kid, most of those would have been somewhere between unimaginable and not feasible. I mean tha, that's one direction in which sport has just blown up in terms of technology. Again, do you see the technology and we hear all the time about how the data revolution is changing the way the game is played. I'm curious whether it's really having as big an impact as we'd like to think or imagine."
Cuban,"Oh yeah, absolutely. Analytics obviously has helped in terms of team strategy but that's actually become a relatively efficient market because all teams are involved and they're all hiring smart people to do mostly the same things. And then there's bioanalytics, where we're becoming smarter about the body, nutrition, sleep, genetics. There's just so many elements involved with bio analytics that it's a never ending improvement cycle."
Interviewer,"So, in terms of turnarounds, franchise turnarounds, your team, the Mavericks, have been one of the most drastic. When you came in, I guess the nine seasons before you arrived, the Mavs winning percentage is about 40 percent."
Cuban,"Yeah, we were awful."
Interviewer,"And since you've been there, about 70 percent, so that's really remarkable. So we could either say I mean if we're going to try to draw a causal relationship, we could say either Mark Cuban is one of the best owners ever, or he was really lucky to intersect perfectly with Dirk Nowitzki's career, or five, ten other things. Can you just talk about what you did that you think worked, and what are the other factors that led to that success?"
Cuban,"Well, hopefully the two aren't mutually exclusive. I think sometimes when you're dealt a good hand, not screwing it up is a talent. But I think what I did was try to change the culture. Because like any work environment, you can have really really talented people but if they don't like coming to work, or they don't like working together, then you're not going to get optimal results. And so what I came in, the previous owner nickeled and dimed everything, didn't recognize that the players were the key to the organization. We did things like spend more money on computer repair and training than we did on medical issues, and development for our players. And so I just changed that. I just flipped the script and said, look, my job is to provide the resources to put everybody in a position to succeed. And if I do that good things will happen. And so we had Dirk. We had Steve Nash. We had Michael Finley. The same three guys were awful the year before I got there."
Interviewer,What was the mental state of the organization in the building when you came in with that losing record that year?
Cuban,"Get me out of here everybody, it was a way station if you couldn't get a job somewhere else you came to the Mavericks. When players were traded here they just couldn't wait to get out."
Interviewer,"Your last couple seasons, though, have been fairly stinky at least by Mavs standards, so much so that you got a high draft pick this year. So what happened?"
Cuban,"What happened is guys get older. Guys get injured, and so you play it out as long as you can, as best you can and we try to respond and rebuild as quickly as possible. And hopefully this summer with our draft picks and and anybody we sign in free agency, we'll be able to do that and start fighting our way back."
Interviewer,"You've been fined a few times by the N.B.A., most recent one was 600k for talking about that it was essentially in the best interest in the team to lose to get a higher draft pick. I'm just curious. You're worth about 4 billion from what I've seen. Do you care much, I mean is that strategic outspokenness?"
Cuban,"In that case it wasn't. More often than not it was. In that particular case I was being interviewed by Julius Erving and I just fanboyed and said the wrong thing. Seriously. Julius Erving was my boyhood basketball hero. I mean yeah he was the one guy I looked up to, and it was the first time I'd met him. And to give you an idea of how much of a fanboy I am, of Julius Erving, when I was a kid, The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh, an old basketball movie was being filmed at the Civic Arena. And I took a bus down there just to see him jus, just to be able to see Julius Erving. Not playing basketball, just to see him. And then when I first bought the Mavs, I was at an N.B.A. All-Star game, I think it was in Philly, and I took a picture with Dr. J. He didn't know he was in the picture. It was me having someone take a picture with him in it, with me smiling. And then when he asked me to do his podcast it was just like yeah. And so I was trying to be too cool and tried to impress him, and when I start talking about being a player's owner he said he would have liked to have played for me as an owner. Then I had to show off, and that's when I said the wrong thing."
Interviewer,What was it about Dr. J as a player that you loved so much?
Cuban,"Oh, just his athleticism, his winning attitude, his uniqueness on the court and off. He had a certain style that he didn't take any prisoners and he was who he was without regrets. And I always admire those qualities."
Interviewer,"And this was also the A.B.A., which was the upstart league. I sense that you've kind of identified with upstarts throughout your life?"
Cuban,"Yeah, I would I would say underdogs more than upstarts. Maybe they're one and the same in a lot of instances. But it's not like I expected all this to happen. And so every step of the way I would try to just keep on grinding and and try to accomplish what I could accomplish and go from there."
Interviewer,I am curious who your favorite Steelers were.
Cuban,"Oh Franco Harris, Mean Joe Greene, Jack Lambert."
Interviewer,"Any dark horses, any, any more obscure guys?"
Cuban,"Joe Gilliam, the first black quarterback. Who else, let me think. There's a guy named Tunch Ilkin that."
Interviewer,"Tunch Ilkin, sure, he's still broadcasting for them."
Cuban,"Oh is he really? Yeah. So Tunch came from Indiana State and we had a mutual friend and so when he came to the Steelers I would go hang out with him and some of the Steelers and, to tell you a quick story, one time we went out with Jack Lambert, Steve Courson, Tunch Ilkin, Lynn Swann to a place in Green Tree, Pennsylvania. Horrible snowy day. I had a nasty old 1977 Fiat X1-9 which is a tiny car. And they got up, left earlier before I did. I go out to find my car in the snow, and they literally had picked it up between them and carried it up and put it on a hill, so that I had to go and figure out how to get it through the snow down the hill back into the street."
Interviewer,"Alright. So you did not become a professional athlete yourself, but you went one better and became a billionaire. And the story for people who don't know it, it reads like fiction. So can you just briefly tell us that story?"
Cuban,"I would tell you we started the streaming industry. There was a point in time in the early '90s where the Internet was becoming functional, and one of my buddies from college was like we've got to be able to use all this new Internet stuff to be able listen to Indiana basketball. And so I was like okay, I'm a tech guy. Let me see if I can figure it out. And I had just sold a few years earlier my first company, which was a networking company, so I was familiar with the technology and had a little bit of money. And so I went to work. Bought a PC, a 90 megahertz Packard Bell, an ISDN line, and just started figuring out, and we created a website called AudioNet. Fast forward a few years we go public, it's the biggest IPO in the history of the stock market. And what you probably don't realize is we dominated all things audio and video on the Internet. There was nobody close. As dominant as YouTube is today, we were that dominant then. We had a unique opportunity that when we sold to Yahoo, if they would've kept on doing what we were doing, even after the the stock market bubble had burst, there would be no YouTube. There might not even be a Google. I mean they chose the direction, and they chose to de-invest when Google chose the opposite, to invest. And that changed the course of history for streaming."
Interviewer,"So that was nearly 20 years ago, that was '99, that you sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo."
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"Can I ask you to speculate a little bit, maybe not looking 20 years forward but maybe five or ten? Big live sport events are in some ways keeping the legacy broadcast networks alive. They are one of the few destination points for watching TV these days. I'm really curious, the streaming companies and companies like Amazon that have streaming as well, they have so much money now that I'm guessing, I mean they could buy the leagues if they wanted to, So I'm really curious to know what you see the future of watching sports looks like. And will it be kind of, gradually changed so that we won't even notice so much, or you think it will be radically different than now?"
Cuban,"I think it'll be gradual but it'll be different for a couple of different reasons. One, one of the reasons sports is still so prevalent on traditional television is it's a destination. If you want to watch the Mavericks, if you want to watch the Pirates, if you want watch the Penguins, the Dallas Stars, whatever, you have to go to traditional TV, and that's one of the keys to retaining the customers, the subscribers that they have. Particularly for older viewers, which leads to a big question that'll drive some of this at some level. When people turn 40, 50, 60, do they start consuming more television or will millennials, as they age, stick to traditional digital over-the-top? That's the unknown question because you stil, for over-the-top, you still have to do work. You still have to choose from 20 apps, 30 apps which is more annoying than going through a DirecTV programming guide. And so those things have to improve dramatically, I think, before the older consumers switch from traditional television. All that said, one of the challenges for over-the-top is that there's an unlimited number of choices. When you go on Charter, Comcast, DirecTV, AT&T, whatever, you've got 250, 300 choices maybe. And that might be daunting, but it's still somewhat manageable. When you go online there's a zillion choices. There's no limit to the number of choices. You can spend a day in YouTube, so destination content is much rarer. There aren't a lot of hits online, and even when you see YouTube stars or Instagram stars, they have to create content every single day, and the same applies to Twitch. Ninja has got to be playing, there's a thing from Ninja, the guy who's the Fortnite superstar, that when he didn't broadcast one day, he lost 40,000 subscribers. So it's a whole different beast."
Interviewer,"Right. Let me ask you this. Let's look at individual sports or leagues especially with the future of the way the material's distributed, and the future of those games or leagues themselves. So let's pretend that you have the choice of three stocks to buy, and I'm going to make yo, I'm going to make you buy one, sell one, and hold one. And the three are going to be N.F.L., U.F.C., and we'll say a basket of e-sports leagues or games, Overwatch."
Cuban,"I'd take e-sports. Yeah if it's against those three, I tak, I buy e-sports, sell N.F.L."
Interviewer,Right. Okay. And hold U.F.C. for now. Okay. Let's get into both of those a little bit. First of all why sell N.F.L.?
Cuban,"I just think CTE creates a problem so participation has been dropping the last few years, and will continue to drop more. And I have an 8-year-old son there's no way I'd let him play tackle football. My brother lets my nephew play high school football but he's not that good. So it's not like he's got a future in football."
Interviewer,"Right. What about the political stuff that's happening, mostly the anthem protests? Do you think that's legitimately hurting football, or is that more of a sideshow?"
Cuban,No that's short term. that's short term.
Interviewer,"Okay, so you think CTE is the biggest barrier that'll."
Cuban,Yeah becaus.
Interviewer,That'll.
Cuban,"A parent if you don't want your son playin, daughter I guess, I don't want to be gender-specific. But if you don't want your child playing contact football, then you diminish the viewing in the house. It's like, I don't want my son to get excited about watching football. And in reality, it's crazy because, ""Hey let's watch a Cowboys game, let's watch a Steeler game."" When I was growing up, it was a certainty. That's what you did. Now he'd much rather play Fortnite or do other things than watch football."
Interviewer,"So how do we explain, though, the success of U.F.C., especially given the concern over the N.F.L. and the decline of boxing? I mean boxing used to be the biggest sport in America and it went."
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"It was hurt for a lot of different reasons obviously, but, But what do you think U.F.C., the league, has done or the sport has done that the N.F.L. maybe isn't doing as well?"
Cuban,"I think it's just different, because it's individuals and individuals can make their own choices. You don't need a lot of participants. In any given U.F.C. fight there's 10 matches, 20 guys, and so you don't need the number of participants that you do obviously for football, where there's 53 guys on a team, and 32 teams and then college football, high school football, et cetera."
Interviewer,"Right. OK. And you're buying e-sports. So say why and especially explain to people who can't get their mind around it at all. What is the appeal of watchin, I mean especially Dallas where you are has become really a hotbed."
Cuban,It's become a hub. Yeah.
Interviewer,"Yeah, I mean there's arenas, stadiums being built and so on. So why do 20, 50,000 people want to go to a stadium to watch other people play video games?"
Cuban,"Because once you understand the game it's lik, once you play, you understand the nuances of the game and it's aspirational and educational. And so if you like to play League of Legends, it's hard. But one of the ways to get better at League of Legends is to watch other people play. And to learn the nuances and to learn the strategies, particularly given that they change the rules every 90 or 120 days. And so because of that, the e-sports teams have got to practice hours and hours and hours a day. So it takes a real skill, it's a real sport, and if you like it, watching it is entertaining, educational, aspirational. And you also have to realize that anybody in front of a PS2, Xbox, PC watching these kids that play, in their mind, just like maybe we watched sports growing up, it's like hey if they can do it I can do it. And so that's the aspirational part of it as well. There's no physical hurdles. You can be 4-foot-1 or 7-foot-1, and if you've got the hand eye coordination and the the brain processing speed, anything's possible. You could do it too."
Interviewer,"One of the investments you mentioned, Unikrn, is a company that facilitates betting on e-sports. Can you just tell us a little bit about how that'll work and whether gambling on e-sports is maybe a little bit more susceptible to match fixing than other sports, or not necessarily."
Cuban,"Yeah I don't, First let me start there. I don't think it's more susceptible at all because it's much more difficult. Most e-sports are multi-dimensional chess where there's so many pieces involved that it'd be nearly impossible. There's two billion different chess moves and there's probably exponentially more in League of Legends. And why Unikrn? Just becaus."
Interviewer,Yeah and how does it work? I mean what kind of access will we have to what kind of bets?
Cuban,"Well you realize, gambling is legal in 118 countries. And so right now for e-sports in those countries, you can just go bet on who wins and different prop bets just like you could any other sports."
Interviewer,"Let me ask you about American pro sports leagues. So you're an N.B.A. owner. I don't know too much about how ""the league"" works. I know a little bit more about the N.F.L., but in the N.F.L. the owners are essentially ""the league."" Is it much different in the N.B.A. or is it pretty similar setup?"
Cuban,"No, not really."
Interviewer,Okay.
Cuban,"No, not really. Yeah, not really at all. I think the biggest difference between the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. is the emphasis put on talent. In the N.F.L., they sell the N.F.L. In the N.B.A., we sell the talent, the players. We promote the players and they promote themselves because it's mutually beneficial. I think with the exception of just a few star, this is just my opinion, the N.F.L. appears to look at their players as being more fungible. There's 53 of them. You're going to rotate X number through every year, and honestly, if the entire Steelers team was in a mall or the entire Dallas Cowboys team was in a mall, maybe two or three of the players would get recognized and so, it's a different world."
Interviewer,"That's partly cause they're helmeted, yeah? But it's more than that. Right?"
Cuban,"It's not, Yeah, it's not just cause they're helmeted."
Interviewer,"Okay. So given that the leagues operate, there's obviously a lot of differences, roster size, number of games, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But let's assume that for the sake of argument that all four major sports leagues in America are pretty similar in that they have, it's a membership and once you're in you're in. And it's pretty hard to lose money as a professional sports team because of the way revenues are divided."
Cuban,"No, that's not true at all. No, that is not true at all. Oh, hell no."
Interviewer,Give me an example.
Cuban,"I can't throw out names, but yeah."
Interviewer,Well how many N.B.A. teams in a given year are going to lose money?
Cuban,More than you think.
Interviewer,Really?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"So even with the revenue-sharing, with all the broadcast and other monies distributed evenly, and with a salary cap that guarantees that you don't have to overspend a certain amount, you're saying tha, How do you lose money? Is it by lacking gate revenue?"
Cuban,Yeah. Lacking revenue period. Just like any business.
Interviewer,"Right. But what's the major variable, is it gate revenue or is it broadcast revenue?"
Cuban,"Gate, broadcast, players, all the obvious things."
Interviewer,"Right. Okay. So that said, leagues in major American pro sports are more protected than let's say European soccer, right?"
Cuban,"Right, cause there's no relegation, yeah."
Interviewer,"Exactly. Do you thin,and it's always funny because our capitalism is more cutthroat than theirs. They're a little bit more socialist but we have the slightly more socialist setup. Which do you prefer, I guess I'd like to know."
Cuban,"Well it depends where you are, right? If you already have a significant brand like Real Madrid, you, because you can spend more money than everybody else. And they put some limits on how much money teams can lose and how much debt they can have and that's impacted things. But if you're on the bottom and you can buy a team inexpensively and you think you've got a secret formula that can get you into the Premier League et cetera. Then that's the position you want to be in if you're on the top and there's nothing that's going to impact your revenues and you're a global brand and you generate licensing and other incomes globally. You want to be at the top. The N.B.A., we're a global brand, but the Dallas Mavericks get one thirtieth of anything sold, whether it's in China or Germany or San Francisco. We don't control the generation of revenues for ourselves except in our local markets."
Interviewer,"In what league in U.S. sports do you think players, the athletes, have the most leverage and the least leverage?"
Cuban,I'd say the N.B.A. and the N.F.L.
Interviewer,N.B.A. is most and N.F.L. is least?
Cuban,Yeah. Without question.
Interviewer,"And does that have to do with roster size primarily, or does it go beyond that?"
Cuban,"Roster size, injury, contact sports. The number of college football teams providing talent. The fact that they go four years so you get to se, or most of them go four years, so it's easier to evaluate talent."
Interviewer,"Right. Speaking of college football, what's your overall view of the N.C.A.A.?"
Cuban,I think it's worthless.
Interviewer,"Yeah. Obviously there's a lot of incentive to keep it as it is. A lot of people are benefiting, although you could easily argue that the one set of people who should be benefiting, the people who are actually providing the physical labor are are not benefiting very much. If you could blow it up entirely, what would you do? Would you have football attached to college at all, would you make it some sort of a D-league instead?"
Cuban,"Yeah, I don't mind having it attached to college, but I would make it an independent entity, so that it would operate independently. Look, if I wanted to create a League of Legends team, that's not N.C.A.A. bound, so I can pay players if I choose or incent them. I can let them have a job, right? Let them go get a job, let them practice as much as they need to. Much as I could if I wanted to create a band and I went to Indiana University, my alma mater, and foun, which has a great music school, and found the best musicians for the band I want to put together, I can pay them and they can stay in school. They can practice together as much as they want. That's the hypocrisy. If you want to be a professional athlete, you can't practice your craft as much as you would like. There's limits to coaching and playing with your teammates. There's limits on jobs you can take. There's there's so many different things that are bound in stone that it just doesn't make sense. And so there's reasons why they evolved to where they are, but it's time to take a whole different look."
Interviewer,Yeah. Do you know Domonique Foxworth?
Cuban,"No, I do not."
Interviewer,"He was the number two of the N.B.A. Players Association for a while. He was the president of the N.F.L. Players Association. He was a player, he was a cornerback, played for I guess Denver, Atlanta, then Baltimore. So he's an interesting guy. A career cut short by injury, but he cashed out because he had insurance. And now he's kind of mid-life, early 30s, and he's looking back and trying to figure out how to help the next generation of athlete do better. He told us that he thinks it would be in the best interest of players to dissolve the unions, the N.F.L.P.A., the N.B.A. Players Association, because that would put the leagues in violation of labor laws, and it would give players the power to negotiate better deals and to make more money."
Cuban,"Every time there's a lock, Look I'm not a C.B.A. expert, I can't get into details. The N.F.L., there's a long history of labor unrest and the first thing they do is dissolve the union."
Interviewer,"Well, let's say that for a minute you're not on the ownership side at all and that you're either with you, let's say you run the biggest sports agency in the country, or maybe are associated with players in some way."
Cuban,"Let me slow you down right there because if I do anything relative to the C.B.A., I'll get fined again. And while I like you, it's not strategic right now."
Interviewer,"Basically you like me fine but not as much as Dr. J is what you're saying, but that's alright, I can."
Cuban,Exactly.
Interviewer,I can accept that.
Cuban,Appreciate that.
Interviewer,Let me ask you this
Cuban,"Yeah I think it'll lead to our franchise valuations doubling, literally, because there's a lot more reasons for people to pay attention, a lot more reasons for people to watch. And that's good for our bottom line. People will attend more and watch more hours of N.B.A. basketball. And same for all professional sports."
Interviewer,"All right, I got a quiz for you, or a riddle. I know you're a very smart guy, I won't be surprised if you get this right. Home field advantage exists in every sport all over the world. What would you say is the primary driver of home-field advantage according to academics who've studied this?"
Cuban,"My guess would, and it's not home-court, home-ice advantage doesn't necessarily hold true. Like in hockey, it doesn't hold true. So, I would tell you probably the energy and, so there's a couple of things. One, I know there are studies that say that the officials give benefit to home teams across all sports. People have tried to argue that that's not the case. Whatever it is, it is. And then there's the energy of a crowd. I mean, crowds do make players play harder. And then I'd also say there's just the comfort of playing in a place that you're used to shooting and playing in, hitting in, fielding in, et cetera."
Interviewer,"So what the academics argue is that it's basically unconscious ref bias. That they're not rooting for the home team, obviously, but that basically the crowd's sentiment puts the refs unconsciously in that moment."
Cuban,I think Justin Wolfers wrote that.
Interviewer,Justin wrote about race actually. Most of the studies about home field advantage come from soccer where there are some nice little instrumental variables that you can use to determine.
Cuban,"And plus, depending on the level of soccer, where you're playing, Yeah there's concern for their lives."
Interviewer,"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah like one of the best pieces of evidence came from measuring soccer played in stadiums where there was a running track around the field. So the refs are literally 20 yards further from the crowd, and there the home field advantage is much less so. But that said, you are probably most famous, as an owner, for, I don't know if you want to call it working the refs, but communicating with the refs. Just talk about that, how it evolved and how successful you think it is."
Cuban,"It's funny. Everybody's wired differently and when I play basketball, and by the way I just got done playing basketball and I've just had a Diet Coke up against my Achilles. So, I've been a basketball junkie my entire life. Everybody's got something and for whatever reason when I got to the Mavs, I just looked at the officiating, and it just drove me nuts because my attitude has always been that the three officials in basketball, no matter what the level, have more impact than 80 percent of the players on the court. And that's why it's always driven me crazy. And when I first got in and started doing my homework, one of the things that was conventional wisdom is that games weren't officiated the same in the first minute as they were in the last minute, and that just drove me nuts. And the more I got to know, the more I got to learn. Then I started to understand how officials at all levels manage games and deal with certain issues. And it wasn't always about making the right call throughout the game. And so that just ticked me off. And that just led to everything else. And so was it worth it? Yeah, I think it has been, because I can tell you that things have changed dramatically. At various times they've changed dramatically for the better. At various times personnel changed and it got worse. So we'll see what happens this season."
Interviewer,Do you think that your input on that has changed the way N.B.A. games are refereed now? At least more consistency?
Cuban,"I don't know if there's more consistency, but yeah."
Interviewer,"What are the channels by which it's worked? Have there been actual committees where you sit down and say, listen this is plainly going on and it's not right, not fair, not transparent?"
Cuban,"No, it's not even like that. It's not like I come in and say this ref is biased or this guy's got a problem. Couple of times I've done that, and it's been investigated and it's been fixed. And it's not like Tim Donaghy, it's just little marginal things. But in any event, what has changed in m, The thing that I have always harped on the most is from all my experience in business, you always want to get the best possible manager. And where I've seen a lot of companies make mistakes is they'll take their best salesperson and make them a sales manager. Well, just cause you're a good salesperson doesn't make you a good sales manager. And so using that analogy, just because you were a good referee or just cause you were good in management somewhere in the N.B.A., doesn't mean you're the best person to be in charge of the officiating group. And that's been my biggest battle, that they promote people not because they were the best for the job but because they were there. Or they promoted refs into positions of authority, not because they were great managers or not because they could get great results, but because they used to be good refs, and those guys wanted to keep on working. And so that's where I had the greatest amount of problem and that's where I think I've had the greatest impact."
Interviewer,Gotcha. There's another piece of research that argues that a lot of N.B.A. coaches are bad strategically when it comes to sitting players in foul trouble. That if a player is good enough to sit because you're worried about losing him then is his value is actually greater by playing. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on that and if you've ever talked to your coaches about that.
Cuban,"No, I agree. Because, going back to the refs, even the refs know how many fouls a guy has. And so they understand that if it's a toss-up call and it's a gray area call, they're probably not going to call it. And players are smart enough to adjust. Now on the flip side when you know a great player has three fouls in the first quarter, you're going to go at him and try to get that fourth foul, because there is a point of diminishing returns. And so typically if it's two fouls, I'm fine if Rick keeps them in, and Rick's gotten to that point. If it's again a qualified depending on the opponent, right? Because the value of that player is relative to the time, the score, and the opponent. And so if the numbers say keep him in, I'm fine with keeping him in."
Interviewer,When are you finally going to buy a Major League Baseball team?
Cuban,Never.
Interviewer,What happened?
Cuban,"Never. Oh, well two things happened. One, they didn't want me in. And two I had, my kids got older and they're too much fun. 162 games, my wife would divorce me."
Interviewer,Why didn't baseball want you in?
Cuban,"Because they knew I'd try to change things. I just did an interview with C.C. Sabathia and he was like ""What would you do differently?"" One I would teach all our guys to bat flip, every time they hit a home run, because you got to just change things up. These unwritten rules are ridiculous and the fans pay the bills, you gotta give them a reason to come. Two, I'd push for the designated hitter in both leagues so that pitchers in between innings can go right to the bullpen and warm up or do whatever they needed to. And that way when you come back on the field, you don't throw any warmup pitches, you go right into pitching and there's no throwing the ball around the infield and the outfield. You just go right in. The breaks aren't the breaks, and you go right up to bat and you reduce an hour off the game."
Interviewer,It is pretty weird. It would be like in the N.B.A. between every dead ball there's like lay up practice again.
Cuban,"Yeah, exactly you get to get shots up and everything to get your rhythm. And so there's so many ways you can speed up the game. And I would have been pushing for them and talking about them and they didn't want to see that."
Interviewer,Yeah. What would you say have been your most significant changes to the way basketball is played since you've owned the team?
Cuban,"Oh, little things. Things like the Clear Path Rule. I changed it because I showed them the math was wrong. That it used to be one shot and the ball, I changed it to two shots and the ball. Different replay things. Now, with the latest collective bargaining agreement, there's a thing called the cap-room exception. So it used to be when a team had cap room you just had your cap room. Now there's a $4.4 million exception that I pushed to get through in our collective bargaining agreement in 2011. And so that's been a big change, and I'm sure there's other things that's just what comes to the top of my head."
Interviewer,The effect of that exception is what then?
Cuban,"So, if the Mavericks have $25 million in cap room this year and we use that cap room to sign three players and fully use it, we still have one exception where we can sign one or more players for up to $4.4 million dollars. And the logic was you want to incent teams to have cap room and to try to improve their teams, and one way to improve the incentive was to create this cap room exception."
Interviewer,"Right. All right, last question. Where is LeBron going?"
Cuban,I don't know and I can't comment on other teams' players.
Interviewer,Dallas is not a team I've heard mentioned at all. Should they be?
Cuban,"Who knows. Who knows. Like I said, you'r, I'm not ready to get fined again."
Interviewer,Basically I'm no Dr. J. I've learned my lesson I stand down.
Cuban,I would never say that.
Interviewer,"That said, I very much enjoyed it and I really appreciate your time and I wish you the best of luck this season."
Cuban,I appreciate it.
Interviewer,"Hey, you going to run for some office at some point?"
Cuban,"Yeah, I'm going to run to the bathroom right now. So I don't know, we'll see what happens in the midterms."
Interviewer,"But would you enjoy, do you think, the presidency would that be a job that, I mean just in the abstract, is it a job that you think."
Cuban,"Could I do the job? Yeah. Would I enjoy it, that's hard to say. The challenge isn't doing the job, it's the process to get there. The definition of poor parenting is having kids eight, 11, and 14 and running for the presidency."
Interviewer,"Yeah but just think how cute they'd be on the posters. I mean that's a real, I mean if you want to just talk pure strategic exploitation of your family that would be pretty."
Cuban,"No, I'm not a pimp. When it comes to my kids, no. It would be the exact opposite."
Interviewer,"All right, well whatever you do, I wish you continued huge success and I thank you very much for the time."
Cuban,Thanks I enjoyed the interview.
Interviewer,While mark first of all thank you so much for taking the time man to come to your American Airlines Center you know.
Cuban,Most people you think this is a bar you talk to most people this would look like a bar but this happens to be the coolest.
Interviewer,Office in the world this is your office in the center right this is where I go to get away it's my office my mancave my.
Cuban,Bar when i need it preferably to celebrate it rather than drown my sorrows but yeah this is where I get.
Interviewer,Away well so far it's been a pretty good start for you guys eight and fours yeah you know we've got to play a lot better.
Cuban,But we'll see what happens i feel good about how the players are playing out I send you cyber dust you have they sing.
Interviewer,About how i felt on yeah dee will cuz a lot of people thought he was but he's a very well yeah and he's still not 100%.
Cuban,Healthy so you know as he gets more comfortable and gets a little bit feeling a little bit better he's going.
Interviewer,You better i feel that as well he's he had at one point he was one Paul was two if you remember that yep I know it's not.
Cuban,A regular guy so if he's got the fire again he could do some stuff yeah I think you know he's just feeling his way.
Interviewer,A little bit and once he gets that confidence up a little bit more he shows those flashes of brilliance and I think.
Cuban,I feel the synergy when i see it so there's some synergy with the team so so let's get right into it at the time that.
Interviewer,We have here together mark biggest difference between being a millionaire and a billionaire well would.
Cuban,You say the difference like the difference between having a hundred dollars and a thousand dollars worth a.
Interviewer,Dollar you know we're a penny and a thousand dollars it's no difference no no no it's huge difference I mean I've.
Cuban,Been i've been blessed i mean i made a lot of money at a relatively young age and was a millionaire a few times over.
Interviewer,But just in terms of what you can do and the opportunities that buys there's no comparison at the billionaire mom yeah.
Cuban,Yeah this is crazy now how do you stay so so so humble I mean you gotta be the coolest cat in entrepreneurs everybody.
Interviewer,People who follow you you got a lot of opinions you just don't know it I'm sure behind closed doors I see your.
Cuban,Interviews sometimes you know you don't but still the level of the one thing that always impresses me with you is.
Interviewer,Because sometimes you know how guys get to a higher level they have so many people that hey Mark can you give me.
Cuban,Money can you give me money kidding do this you still are very accessible how do you balance that accessibility and.
Interviewer,Still running all the businesses you run well people you know that I'm close to I know what's going on and so it's it's.
Cuban,Really easy you know and if i don't know you you know reach out to me on cyberdust and I've got 30 seconds to.
Interviewer,Decide whether or not i want to know you you know I don't do a lot of meetings I don't do a lot of phone calls I don't do.
Cuban,A lot of sit downs i do almost everything through cyberdust or email and that makes me a lot more efficient.
Interviewer,And gives me a lot more time in terms of people wanting things you know it's the best problem in the world to have and so.
Cuban,I try to be nice i try to be considerate um but you know people people know me know what's important to me and what's.
Interviewer,Not and either you fit in that or you don't that's good to know you know I finish your book and I watch.
Cuban,A lot of three pages of it but you know what the one part in your book with the edge that I think every entrepreneur.
Interviewer,Needs to real it's true literally i think every entrepreneur even if it's just the edge part well that's why I.
Cuban,Made it so short and sweet right i want people to see stories I wanted people to see you know that if I can do what they.
Interviewer,Can do it um and i don't want to get them all bogged down and you know this little story or that little story and.
Cuban,Try to you know try to sound smart or be smart I figured you know the things that have worked for me and the things that I.
Interviewer,Use to motivate myself if i could keep it short and sweet people would actually read it and you don't get comments all.
Cuban,The time this is the first book i've read in years and I read it all in one sitting and that was my goal and it gets.
Interviewer,A lot done into one city yeah it's something I guess a lot done in one sitting okay for four bucks you can.
Cuban,Afford it yeah absolutely and so if you haven't read about if you're watching you got to get the books.
Interviewer,"One of the action items at the end mark so question I read the story you know the whole $7,500 ring the eighty three."
Cuban,"Thousand a 85,000 the whole day you know the the Motley eighteen year old and then the sixteen year and all that stuff."
Interviewer,That yeah but i'm curious if if you and I were buddies in high school okay we're 14 years old 15 years old and we know.
Cuban,Each other uh-huh would i bet on you being who you are too no chance really no chance tell me why I.
Interviewer,Mean i had my i had my good friends and you know we we hung out and I was a hustler there's there's no question I.
Cuban,Was a hustler even in high school oh yeah and into business in a big way um but I don't I don't think people saw to.
Interviewer,Me it wasn't like people look to me oh he's he's destined to succeed I'll show you a picture of me in high school when.
Cuban,We leave i'm not gonna let you take a picture of it all and you'll see why now you got everybody curious you want you.
Interviewer,Can describe it but yeah i'll show it to you but yeah I'm not gonna let you put on camera no worries so in high school.
Cuban,You were the fungi were you were you were you always the guy that made people laugh when I was into sports not I.
Interviewer,Wasn't great at it i was just decent um wasn't technology guy I mean I I was into learning I was I was I was a.
Cuban,Business guy i was i was the guy reading about business all the time reading business books all the time.
Interviewer,You know going to junior achievement i was a junior achievement geek why do why were you reading business books because.
Cuban,I want that's what i knew i mean i was wired that always you know I started my first business when I was 12 I was.
Interviewer,Buying and selling baseball cards buying and selling stamps anything I could do to make money I was hustling and trying.
Cuban,To do so i was in the business but i not so much were it was all my friends were into it with me so they wouldn't know me.
Interviewer,Spell cards yeah baseball cards you name it I mean I grew up in Pittsburgh and so I would probably even less than 12 years.
Cuban,Old i would excuse me go up by a bunch of baseball cards that I collected and I would package I would say okay you're.
Interviewer,Guaranteed to have a pittsburgh pirate in this package and I would charge three times as much and I'd set up on this.
Cuban,Park bench down in the park down it's got Township where I grew up and I'd have these little sails and it was great.
Interviewer,I've made money you know i mean it was you know and I learned as much about business when I was nine ten and twelve.
Cuban,As i learned any other time i'm obsessed with baseball cards there is it anything no I wish I know I wish I still had on.
Interviewer,But they're all long gone i gave it to my brother who knows what happened something about cards man I don't know.
Cuban,What it is you explain it to somebody they think you're not so bad now you learn yeah back then that's how you know.
Interviewer,You had your favorite players and you know you didn't see they weren't on TV every day you.
Cuban,Read about him in the newspaper there was no internet and so baseball cards were a way to connect you know I had my.
Interviewer,Willie stargell i have my roberto Clemente cards so you're not talking about your tie back yeah there was no.
Cuban,Pick it back then yeah so um beck was just getting started right so gonna you know I don't look at it more I looked at.
Interviewer,It just hey this is the home affinity it wasn't like okay these were going to be valuable at some point so yeah but it.
Cuban,Was just you know it was just a means yeah now you have the Honus Wagner card you know I'm not like yeah that'd be a.
Interviewer,Cool card yeah but i've just i mean just look look around you right I mean I got stuff I'm just not into like I'm not a.
Cuban,Big collector tech guy well i got your gift man I'm with you now I wanted to get you something and what can I get.
Interviewer,This guy you may have it but i hope you don't have my wife but I hope so so let's get into entrepreneurship a little.
Cuban,But we already have but i you know going into it now to focus on a little bit what would you say out of all the.
Interviewer,Reasons in the world not regular but you have the talent you know all these keys to success etcetera what would you say.
Cuban,Is the number one reason why people fail not necessarily why they make you the complete opposite right lack of brains.
Interviewer,Lack of effort lack of brains lack of effort yeah they just they don't do the work they don't learn you know when you.
Cuban,Walk in the room when you start a business and you start to talk about somebody you're never in a vacuum with.
Interviewer,No competition you know and unless you're just extremely lucky and if there's going to be competition that.
Cuban,Means somebody else knows your business as well as you do when you get started and if you walk into a competitive.
Interviewer,Environment and they still know more about the business than you do and more about your customers you're going to.
Cuban,Lose and but most people don't consider that they don't do the work they don't learn more about their industry they.
Interviewer,Don't know even about their business i mean and so you've got to put in the effort to know more about your industry.
Cuban,Than anybody else and that's that's the brains part and that's the effort part as well because look if you're competing.
Interviewer,With me you you better know what you're doing otherwise I'm gonna kick your ass you know and you're not gonna outwork me.
Cuban,And so you know the combination is usually what kills businesses early on more than anything.
Interviewer,Do you think so there's a part that people say you know mark made it because mark is a special again he became an.
Cuban,Entrepreneur you know this guy made it all these guys made it because they have this special gene or whatever it is.
Interviewer,Do you think there's a proven formula that if a brand rookie guy he's got a lotta ambitious gun out of this rap but.
Cuban,Not a lot of knowledge and how to do you think if he follows a formula he's guaranteed to make it as a porno okay so.
Interviewer,You don't believe there's a guarantee to make it no because who knows you're gonna be competing with so if you put.
Cuban,Two two people both following the same formula both in the same industry right which one wins yeah maybe they both can.
Interviewer,Win and both be successful but you know so I don't I don't think there's a DeVault default template for success but.
Cuban,I think there's things that you can do to put yourself in the best position to succeed you know so I talk about stuff.
Interviewer,In the book you know i talk about the one thing in business you can control his effort you know um going out there.
Cuban,And sales curing all you know so i i think you know and I agree with your point that there are things that if you.
Interviewer,Do them you put yourself in the best position to succeed but you know if you just walk into a buzz you know a buzz.
Cuban,Saw and somebody else is doing them a little bit better you know what happens now are you saying - to compete on your.
Interviewer,Level there's no we're just look we're just any level right just as even if you put a formula for me I followed it will.
Cuban,I eventually be able to make a quarter million a year if I followed up one day but I'm not talking about a hundred.
Interviewer,Million you guys pick where - right right so how would this be wise right yeah it was a business plan competition.
Cuban,And they were talking about making big money reselling travel plans and making $3 in affiliate commissions right it's.
Interviewer,Just not gonna happen you have that's just more you have to be smart you can pick the wrong things and you know.
Cuban,You're talking to you know alluded to earlier about entrepreneurs being born or built you know and I think they're I.
Interviewer,Knew i was wired to be excited about business how or why I don't know but you know and there's certain guys they have.
Cuban,The genetics to jump out of the gym right certain guys you know that you know when they golf they have the muscle.
Interviewer,Memory and and the discipline you know dirt the Biscay may not be the most talented guy in the NBA but his.
Cuban,Discipline and his focus to do what's necessary to be successful he's willing to do and combine it with being seven.
Interviewer,Feet tall and being skilled you know it makes him an amazing basketball player so it's understanding what your skill.
Cuban,Set is finding the right place to use those skills and then going for it you know will that make you 250 grand.
Interviewer,As if you picked the right industry but whatever industry you pick if you outwork everybody if you try to be a.
Cuban,Little smarter than everybody if you try to be a better salesperson and everybody if you try to be better prepared than.
Interviewer,Everybody you've got your best chance because if you don't do it and somebody else does yeah I have the same work like.
Cuban,Someone's trying to take it all away from you you know work you actually work like someone's spending 24 hours working.
Interviewer,24 hours to take it all away from you and that's kind of the way I look at it when you were younger did you have was.
Cuban,Your father into business was your mother was there an uncle somebody that did well in business that you admire.
Interviewer,With or somebody you read about they said I like rockefeller I like Carnegie nothing nothing so it's just purely user.
Cuban,I said i think you know my dad did upholstery on cars my mom did whatever odd jobs um but my.
Interviewer,Dad was always like if you want something you have to earn it and to his credit he never said no you can't do.
Cuban,That so whether it was selling garbage bags baseball cards stamps whatever it was he.
Interviewer,Never held me back and so i think that was as important as anything and you know sometimes being young and trying.
Cuban,Things are so naive and you don't know any better all you do is learn and if you fail it.
Interviewer,Doesn't matter and so whether i was 9 10 12 1621 the failures were irrelevant and you know whether you're you know nine.
Cuban,Twelve sixteen twenty one twenty two twenty four you know I'm sleeping on the couch you know I have a car with a hole.
Interviewer,In the floorboard you know I'm living like a bum and like a student and so what did I have to lose.
Cuban,And so i think that influenced me as much as anything so it you know my dad was like go for it.
Interviewer,You know don't why not what do you got to lose you know you have to sleep on a different couch so I think that that was.
Cuban,Motivation as much steve said you had the encouragement from others your support go do it so do you think like.
Interviewer,Let's just if we put 10 guys here you interview them okay you could within a 5 10 minute minute.
Cuban,Interview say this to is not gonna make it as an entrepreneur could you pretty much know that you know I'm not very.
Interviewer,Good at interviewing it the issue is my interview skills more than free Gollum horrible Shark Tank interview well yeah.
Cuban,It is but i get to do due diligence after the fact right so I get my hunches but I get your check yeah I mean I can I.
Interviewer,Can typically tell right i can tell um but by um their passion I can tell by their focus.
Cuban,I can tell by their preparation you know there's a whole realm of things than any business here you know here's here's the.
Interviewer,Business you're in and here's a thousand things that influence whether or not you're going to be successful and really.
Cuban,To me by you know through my experience and businesses I can put myself in his position and say okay here are nine.
Interviewer,Hundred of the thousand things he has to be aware of and then go through and ask and by how many of those or her issues.
Cuban,They've been able to address already that kind of gives me a sense of how hard they're willing to work you know.
Interviewer,And i can tell by the questions they ask me so all I have to do is say okay what do you want to know and you know when.
Cuban,They start saying what should i do they ask you yeah what you know and that's fine right and I want them to ask.
Interviewer,Questions but you know people like to say you know the only stupid questions are the one you don't once you don't ask.
Cuban,That's not right right because the questions you ask tell everybody tell me tell whoever more about you than.
Interviewer,Anything else you do because in particular tells me about your preparation if you ask me questions.
Cuban,About just basic things that you should have known and you should have down to a science.
Interviewer,That's gonna disqualify you almost more than anything I've read this cyber that's we send out by the way but now I.
Cuban,Got to get the questions right i said okay I'll take that as a challenge that's another bird I stopped flying.
Interviewer,Sound like when i have a saw it was great yeah so no it's phenomenal what the question you asked are critical are.
Cuban,You reads it's complete opposite on the way you you know the traditional way of thinking and I always ask the question.
Interviewer,So mark you're now you know whatever your net worth is billions of dollars you own a sports team you have.
Cuban,Businesses you're in shark tank you're on TV shows everybody wants your time how hard is it for you now this is the.
Interviewer,Thing i think about because for my so i run a business it's harder for me to make friends now and let people in my.
Cuban,Circle but i'm not at your level how is it when a person like you is it still easy to make friends now I'm not out.
Interviewer,There you know at this world i'm not out there looking me you know I don't need any new writing buddies I mean my high.
Cuban,School buddies are still my friends my college buddies got rugby buddies um the guys I when I first came to Dallas that.
Interviewer,Were my friends then are my friends now you know I've got three kids you know so it's more you know my family just takes.
Cuban,Up so much my time along with business up I'm not you know and even back in the.
Interviewer,Day when i was single i was still successful I could tell the gold diggers from the the real friends I mean you.
Cuban,Know it was pretty easy got it did association play a big role with you or not really yeah for you yeah as you.
Interviewer,Were so determined it didn't matter nobody could influence you influence other PA I just I just want to do my.
Cuban,Thing made sense make sense um couple words I'll just put out that I want to see what you think about it because I.
Interviewer,Watch you and i watch some of these other guys and I see a sense of paranoia and I don't know if you read the book.
Cuban,The only the paranoid survive ten twenty great book that was written do you think there needs to be a healthy level of.
Interviewer,Peril absolutely they're nice too oh yeah I mean I I always say you know for every one of my businesses I said what.
Cuban,Would i do to kick my own ass you're right so whatever business you have there's somebody's trying to put you out.
Interviewer,Of business there's somebody trying to to take a bite out of your business and it's better for you to figure out how.
Cuban,They're going to do it rather than they do it and so yeah that's being paranoid and so you have to be paranoid you have.
Interviewer,To anticipate other people's next moved and moves and you can't ever you know downplay the competition you know I was.
Cuban,Telling i was at a business plan competition this morning for at a college and they were kind of being.
Interviewer,Dismissive of the competition and so you can't ever do that you know they're out there trying to take you down and.
Cuban,They're not just gonna sit still and if you're good really really good you're gonna inspire them to work even harder.
Interviewer,Faster better and so you have to be you know very self aware of what you're good at and what other people are good at and.
Cuban,You know a healthy dose of paranoia makes a bit dear me it's very helpful so that's interesting you say that so.
Interviewer,Sometimes you know you'll be a little bit too paranoid you know you're being too concerned about this too concern.
Cuban,About that the other question for you would be mark you don't run one company you run many companies you're doing.
Interviewer,Deals all the time and there is this notion that you hear multitasking right on the you can multitask you can do this.
Cuban,So your brain if i were to take a hundred percent ok 10 percent here seven percent your 6 percent here how do you.
Interviewer,Process all of it here in your mind with the difference that has to be something I'm really good at right you know I just.
Cuban,I process things very quickly and that's always been my strength I can I can identify what's going on typically.
Interviewer,Faster than anybody and and crying right through it and plus you know I because I force everybody to email or cyberdust.
Cuban,It's all coming from one flow right it's all one funnel and so I'm not bouncing from meeting to meeting thinking okay.
Interviewer,What did we say in that meeting we're having to take notes and then we're having somebody take notes you know it's.
Cuban,Like it's already in writing it's in an email and if it's in cyberdust is like having a face-to-face and when I see it.
Interviewer,I respond to it immediately kind of cyber has forced me to respond to it immediately.
Cuban,Um and so that that allows me to keep things organized and stay on top of things and you know so you know anything.
Interviewer,That's unread that's my to-do list and that's all I stay on top of it got it so I've become a phonetic side of this.
Cuban,There's an every other hour i'm chicken side when you told me you know go check outside with us and then from there I we.
Interviewer,Got everybody on the company now everyone out here the only way you gonna get to see this first you got it and I.
Cuban,Would like the link i will do what i mentions to get everybody closer but I love the product and we'll get to that.
Interviewer,Because i want to explain how i see side with us you're not as a CEO as a customer because I want people to see.
Cuban,How i see it as a customer let's talk about speed when people ask me and say hey you know how do I get speed going I.
Interviewer,Want to see your perspective on this because cyber does has a tipping point you know you got Twitter has a tipping.
Cuban,Place but everything is about the tipping point in your mind how does one entrepreneur increase the speed in areas.
Interviewer,That they can increase there's certain things you can't be in one way speed of growing your business all right.
Cuban,So how fast can i grow yeah i mean it just depends you've got to know your own skill set right and you've got to know.
Interviewer,How that fits within your company's lifecycle um you know some companies are slow slow grind and you just have to.
Cuban,Understand that and you've just got to bide your time and still until it starts to click and then grow with it quickly.
Interviewer,You know if you're trying to release a product that needs to be ubiquitous you've got to go as fast as you can and.
Cuban,And then you know release a product yeah no long yeah and and you know there's a lot of people will say you know.
Interviewer,Perfection is the enemy of profitability right and that doesn't mean you have to to us a perfect product you know.
Cuban,Cyberdust is perfect and we still haven't it's been almost two years we still haven't advertised it yet because.
Interviewer,We know it's not ready yet you know and so it's been a slow growth grind because that's we wanted we want feedback you.
Cuban,Know we want to keep on learning we're evolving but it really just depends on what the product is that you know a.
Interviewer,Barber shop right isn't an app is it a service is it a product but you know the the key is looking for the low-hanging.
Cuban,Fruit what are the app what are what customers are willing to write you a check or commit to it you know so that.
Interviewer,They're willing to integrate it into their daily lives or integrated into their daily business and so getting a.
Cuban,Commitment either through time or revenue is typically what I look for and so if I can get a commitment then I'm.
Interviewer,Gonna be able to learn i'm gonna see how they use it to they sustained usage and then once I get the next one you know.
Cuban,Hopefully it came a little bit faster than the first one then I can ask for referrals and then the next one then the.
Interviewer,Next one and i just tried to ramp it up you know when I bought the Mavs we had no season ticket-holder base and so.
Cuban,Literally it was a matter of just putting a list of former season ticket holders and a white pages back then you.
Interviewer,Know on my desk next to my phone and making phone calls you yeah me yeah because if I'm not gonna do it I'll find.
Cuban,Someone else to do it right so just get on the phone hey this mark you know I'm the new owner of the Dallas Mavericks.
Interviewer,We've you know i'd like to invite you back where again it's not though this is my business you we can't get regular.
Cuban,Sales gets or something make those calls wants to get to a corner you're a guy that's a billion you're making them but.
Interviewer,That's all you know and that's fine and good right because everybody's got their own goals right and but still I don't.
Cuban,Want anybody at the mavs to be able to said well he's not willing to do the work right there's you know if I walk.
Interviewer,Around i'm picking up all the papers i'm not saying go get that picked up I'm like okay that's trash I'm picking it up.
Cuban,So but in terms of speed of growth it's really you got to get that first customer first and then when you get.
Interviewer,That first what did you learn reiterate get that next customer and then hopefully as you learn more and more.
Cuban,Through the process than the next one the next one the next one becomes coming by and faster you know it's interesting.
Interviewer,When we walked in here and i appreciate that on two speeds we walked in here typically when I want.
Cuban,To know how does to work for somebody you got to ask people around them or you can ask the processor to work for you.
Interviewer,Right we get the right answer so that's the security guy had this guy said oh you know mark country's gonna say hi to.
Cuban,Everybody he's gonna do this he's gonna do that and they were all like fans they love work yes cuz we have cameras and.
Interviewer,Microphones that's classic that's classic okay let's transition to a different subject let me see what time.
Cuban,Okay let's transition to a different subject with college you went to IU yep right now you got a lot of people.
Interviewer,That say forget about school you know you're out of school they're idiots oh you think they're idiots.
Cuban,Tell me what if you're gonna have and run a business if you don't understand accounting you're already behind the.
Interviewer,Eight ball can't you hire a guy that's good no second day they still have to communicate to you right I mean there's.
Cuban,People that don't understand the concept of you know the difference between profits and cash you know oh your.
Interviewer,Accountant might tell you you're profitable but your cash is going down you know not understanding that.
Cuban,Breakdown and and when you don't you thing you need college to learn that yeah I think you do right because it may.
Interviewer,Not for some people look if you're so self-motivated that you can take an online course in accounting and teach.
Cuban,Yourself everything you're way ahead of the game anyways but most people aren't and I'm not saying you have to go to.
Interviewer,Indiana I'm not saying going an expensive school I don't care if you go to a community.
Cuban,College and take accounting and spend 99 bucks for the class just you know spending the money forces you to be more.
Interviewer,Obligated to do it but accounting finance lesser extent marketing sales of the school offers that these are.
Cuban,Although that's the language of business and so while it's possible to teach yourself these things and while it's.
Interviewer,Possible to hire them when you're starting your own company you don't want to have to spend money.
Cuban,Hiring an accountant right you're already probably gonna have to hire a lawyer to set up your your well let me.
Interviewer,Take that if you've gone through all these classes if I don't have to hire a lawyer to incorporate right you'll.
Cuban,Probably figure out yourself and so your cost of opening up a business drops but even more important and all that that's.
Interviewer,That's the block unit tackling that's the language of business you know the thing I learned at Indiana that was more.
Cuban,Important than anything else i learned how to learn and learning became far more important.
Interviewer,To me because the one certainty in business is that it's always going to be changing the if you're not always.
Cuban,Learning to this minute if i'm not continuously learning if I'm not just absorbing as much as I can absorb.
Interviewer,Someone else is going to kick my ass right so you talked about paranoia the the greatest source of your paranoia.
Cuban,Should be knowledge if someone else knows more than you do and if you're not learning if you don't know the Lord if.
Interviewer,You don't know how to learn if you don't have a thirst for learning and acquiring information you're you're Sol do I need.
Cuban,To go to school to have that though so make it maybe let me restate the question would be the question the.
Interviewer,Question will be do i need to get a bachelor's degree so what's you just obviously necessary you have to have the.
Cuban,Degree okay write something branca you have to have the knowledge holy I totally agree with that fair enough okay.
Interviewer,Let's so let's skip that part and go into a little bit of politics and you know our conversations start I said mark.
Cuban,You know i said man you gotta get up there because you got such a big fan base people want to hear your opinions.
Interviewer,About politics you may want to run for president one day and we were going back with the thing and I said mint.
Cuban,People got to know who is what is mark thinking about cuz a lot of times CEOs don't want to touch polyps right they.
Interviewer,Don't want to touch it at all for whatever reason if you were the president today Mark Cuban is the.
Cuban,President February 1st 2016 what are three things you're attacking income inequality right.
Interviewer,Improving the ability for companies to raise capital through IPOs I think that'll have a big impact on the market.
Cuban,You've touched that on inc you said that on the incas well so let's talk about income inequality rl1 so how do you do.
Interviewer,That so right now let's just say you're making thirty five thousand dollars a year and you're clearing fifteen hundred.
Cuban,Bucks a month after tax okay and you live like a student I don't care if you have thirty forty fifty what sure you're.
Interviewer,Living like a student and you're able to save five hundred bucks a month okay where you sleep are you staying at home.
Cuban,You're living at home right with your hey two-year-old parents you're 50 years old um there's a lot of that right now.
Interviewer,Yeah unfortunately and so you're saving six grand a month right well right now with interest rates near zero.
Cuban,Surrounding you or six grand a year um so you're saving six grand a year five hundred bucks a.
Interviewer,Month which is amazing that's what every Republican wants you to do that's what every Democrat wants you to do try to.
Cuban,Control your own destiny now you put it in the bank or do you put it in stocks no one trusts the stock market no one.
Interviewer,Really knows what they're doing right no you put it in to a fund but the problem is if you put into a fund because you're.
Cuban,Not making a lot of money if the dishwasher breaks right you get penalized for taking and show that money.
Interviewer,Out so we're in a situation right now where it's if you put that money into the bank which is really only the safe.
Cuban,Way you know six thousand a year and a year you'll have six thousand and sixty dollars okay sure you're just not ever.
Interviewer,Going to be as bad if that right and the point being is you're never going to improve your place in life right where.
Cuban,The 1% really the reason income has become so unequal is I can hire anybody I want to help me pick the best.
Interviewer,Investments and i do most of it myself but I'm decent at it right so I can put my money in stocks I could put my and.
Cuban,Hedge against the risk i can put my money in whatever but I'm liquid so I don't have to worry about the dishwasher.
Interviewer,Break-in guy if you would have six thousand dollars how are you going to keep up right how are you going to.
Cuban,"Improve your position in life even if you spent twenty years saving six thousand dollars a year that's $120,000."
Interviewer,"But you've earned $1,500 in interest that whole time right and while 120 thousand is good you're not gonna be."
Cuban,Able to live off of that when you hit sixty five or seventy years old right not at all so part of the challenge is.
Interviewer,How do you allow people to accumulate capital okay without the risk of waking up one day and not being able to get the.
Cuban,Money out for their dishwasher or their car or paying for their kids school right we're not um we're finding that.
Interviewer,The stock market is way down and they're basically wiped out and so to me that's the first thing to address and so I.
Cuban,Think you know one ways the federal Reserve I don't think you mess with the Federal Reserve but I think you come up.
Interviewer,With savings certificates savings bonds that literally pay a little bit more that allow people to save for their.
Cuban,Future because i think that helps people protect their future that allows people to build more of an asset base and that.
Interviewer,Takes them you know gives them a comfort level that they're gonna be able to survive is.
Cuban,As they age and take care of their expenses and maybe then maybe they can buy a house you save up enough money.
Interviewer,Earn enough and an interest or whatever it may be to buy a house but you just you know it's not so much pulling the.
Cuban,Top down as in bringing the bottom up and then I would also increase the minimum wage and the way I would there's.
Interviewer,A couple different ways to look at it but in my mind like this past December we gave everybody here a raise to a.
Cuban,Minimum of $10 an hour and the reason i did it is I found out there were people that work for me that were on government.
Interviewer,Assistance in one way or another you know might be a program but I hate the idea that I'm subsidizing somebody you.
Cuban,Know the fact that i'm not paying enough everybody's taxes is subsidizing this person's life you know you think about.
Interviewer,That and so you get a lot of business owners saying oh you can't raise the minimum wage well all of us pay for the.
Cuban,Fact that you're not paying that person enough and will it change the competitive balance well if everybody's.
Interviewer,Having to pay more then the competitive balance still say it's somewhat competitive will the markets change some.
Cuban,But it's not so much that i think raising the minimum wage is a great idea but what I don't like is the fact that.
Interviewer,We are subsidizing low wages for certain for businesses and so I think you know maybe there's a better way the minimum.
Cuban,Wage so i'm just talking off the top show that sure of course but the bottom line is that people who work for me.
Interviewer,Shouldn't have to use government services funded by everybody and until we get people off of that incoming.
Cuban,Inequality interesting it's just gonna be kind of convoluted your approach will be the government doing something about.
Interviewer,It well it's not so much the government doing something about I wanted to get people off the government assistance got.
Cuban,It right so how about this part you know there used to be time when the whole Ford Motor Company came out with you.
Interviewer,Know working 9:00 to 5:00 and when they came out with this after the Great Depression you know what that's why at.
Cuban,Night 9:00 to 5:00 is only a 90 year old system right so when they came out with that you and I said okay I'll give you.
Interviewer,30 years of my life and i'm for it you know we said hey but what are you gonna give me if I give you 30 years of my.
Cuban,Life so they said we'll give you a pension right in 1984 we have 130 something something pension plans.
Interviewer,Thousand one hundred thirty seven thousand pension today we have 24 right I think we've gone away from that.
Cuban,Because it sounds like from what your concern is on income inequality is the first point.
Interviewer,"You made is $500 a month times 12 months $6,000 so long term 20 or 7 or $20,000 which means they may not have long term."
Cuban,Money for retirement but if we go away from the pension plan so do they probably go right away to the.
Interviewer,Pound and advise companies well the problem with pensions is the uncertainty of business right so what's happening.
Cuban,With pensions now serna they've got to grow them just because to support the amount of money required for the.
Interviewer,Employees they can't they can't find that return right so if if I either got a if everybody's Arne only earning 1%.
Cuban,"And your pension matches your salary i mean okay just for the and you're making $36,000 a year I've got to find a way as."
Interviewer,A business owner to fund thirty six thousand dollars per year for the you know so that you're making twenty or.
Cuban,Seventy right right a math for that's 65 to 85 yeah but but if you're only earning 1% the rule of 72 says it takes.
Interviewer,Three years right so i've got a you know you don't get 72 years so I've got a fun three-quarters of it or whatever so what.
Cuban,Would it be with the solution will be you know we can move away from this topic would it be given an incentive for.
Interviewer,Companies who do give pension plans up to this I just don't I don't think companies it's mathematically yeah I did.
Cuban,Yeah i don't think it works simply because there's too much uncertainty on the are not big thing of it the key of.
Interviewer,It is what what elements of certainty do you put on businesses right a pension is a certain amount that you have to pay.
Cuban,But you're it's uncertain how much you're going to earn you know if whether it's minimum wage or some other way of.
Interviewer,Doing it or you know working so that whatever it is right so that you don't need government assistance then that's.
Cuban,Just part of your current business you know and so it's really I guess it's more about coming to you or I as a.
Interviewer,Business owner and said okay if you're making a million dollars a year would you be okay with making seven hundred.
Cuban,Fifty thousand dollars a year and your attack on another 250 on it know whatever there's no tax no tax no no tax.
Interviewer,A way they say to you why don't you pay your guys more that's what you're a guilt type thing right you know and so.
Cuban,You know i've said i would react of Ehrman government of dollars I know you like a cross a type of yeah let's go out.
Interviewer,There and do this like what did you do my drive yeah how much more money look I've literally received that.
Cuban,Happening yeah i've literally written checks to the Dallas City Treasury you know when the Mavs won a championship I.
Interviewer,Paid for the pray that when we needed extra police overtime I wrote the check for it because it's not fair to ask all.
Cuban,The citizens of dallas to pay the taxes for something that benefits me like that would you consider yourself a capitalist.
Interviewer,You're full on capital oh yeah but see what's changed with capitalism it I mean I'm a hardcore we're not a full on.
Cuban,Capitalism you know that we know we're not that what we've evolved right and so you know 90 years ago the Henry Ford.
Interviewer,Days sure if you didn't have a job and you couldn't afford it you found somebody's floor to sleep on and you.
Cuban,Went with your family or whatever you know and if it was 12 to a room that's the way it was and then over time we.
Interviewer,Started having you know you know with with FDR we started having you know basic services that we would provide for.
Cuban,You and then over time with lbj there was more services right and and welfare services and now you know we're not.
Interviewer,Gonna let you drop dead in the streets we want you know you anybody can walk into a hospital or or now we want you to.
Cuban,Have these about them i think it's right I think it's you think it is right look I'm so what would call you a Democrat.
Interviewer,And no no hell no no no look there's there's different things for different reasons right if we as a society decide.
Cuban,That we don't want people dropping dead in the streets or you know just dying at home then there's a cost to that and we.
Interviewer,Can't expect insurance companies and hospitals just to pick up that cost for decisions we make as a society just like.
Cuban,We want tsa at the airport just like we want you know Homeland Security you know should we say look don't pay for it.
Interviewer,We'll just all get blown up right there's certain minimum services that we've all defined that's evolved.
Cuban,Capitalism and we all have to pay for that but at the same time that doesn't destroy the root of capitalism and who.
Interviewer,We are and and the incentives right it just means that we're gonna take a chunk off the top now on the flip side of that.
Cuban,How we do that how you pay for it that's a different beast is the government too big yes.
Interviewer,Is the government inefficient yes if for every you know I'd rather the government have one half the employees and just.
Cuban,Write checks to people you know the old helicopter dropped of cash you know just drop cash on the people.
Interviewer,Because they're just gonna spend it these are people who can't afford to say economy yeah and so I'd rather you know.
Cuban,You talk about what would you do as the president probably the third thing I would take all these services we have.
Interviewer,And cut i would say to everybody okay here's two years three years severance and then I'm gonna take 75% of what's.
Cuban,Left and just consolidate it all together and write everybody who qualifies the cheque right and then you.
Interviewer,Know to go to you know you know yeah but you use that money or but I get crushed by all the union's right because there's.
Cuban,Like yeah this would be anti control votes now yeah exactly so it's very anti-union we you know in somewhat.
Interviewer,Somewhat socialist and you can argue about creating distance and you'd have to work those things but the one.
Cuban,Certainty is governments to big government is inefficient and there's way to cut ways to cut back on the.
Interviewer,Amount of money you spend so what does it take to pay for all the services we as a country feel are legit for our.
Cuban,Citizens whether it's health care security whatever it may be and what's the best way to do that and I literally.
Interviewer,Rather than saying here's 30 programs you have to sign up for and here's all the overhead associated with managing.
Cuban,Those services and monitoring and checking for fraud here's a check here's your $800 a month you know in addition.
Interviewer,To social security no accountability no account of no accountable right because now because you can't get it anywhere.
Cuban,Else right now you this has got to take care of your life if you don't do it they're sorry.
Interviewer,Right we've eliminated the excuse there is a limit to where listen if you do nothing with this there's nothing else.
Cuban,We can do right at that point is they sense yeah at that point you know your family's also getting paid right you're.
Interviewer,On your own right but trying to say okay you've got to do this program this program this program this program is.
Cuban,Just so saturated with overhead it doesn't work that is such an interesting topic that's off the table so would you.
Interviewer,Be comfortable with a capitalist like Donald Trump being our president um the capitalist side yeah I don't have a.
Cuban,Problem with in i like donald and he's smart I just what's concerning is the way all.
Interviewer,The candidates republican or democrat are trolling for votes I mean they're just pandering you what do you need what.
Cuban,Do you want me to say i'll say it in order to get you vote he's sane would hell yeah.
Interviewer,You think he's saying whatever people want him to say pretty much yeah now Wow within the realm of what gets votes.
Cuban,Right so within the realm of what gets most right so yeah it's not just when you want me to say right so I need I.
Interviewer,Need to appeal to ultra-conservatives in order to get elected in the primary and so if I'm appealing to.
Cuban,Ultra-conservatives what to all cultra conservatives want you know we started with immigration that fit now you know.
Interviewer,Everything he says and does it's okay what's the playbook for getting voters for the primary now do I think once he's.
Cuban,Elected president he'll follow through for all those with all those things no because most of them won't work and he's.
Interviewer,And do i think he's smart enough to figure that out and then just do the right thing after he's elected yes so.
Cuban,You know with like a lot of candidates and politicians you vote for not what they say but knowing that 99% of they.
Interviewer,Say won't come true what they'll do the rest one who's gonna follow through with a lot because they know that what you.
Cuban,Already know he's not gonna get a wall built right he's not gonna get all these things done it's just not gonna happen.
Interviewer,And there's no money to do it so slice those off and what will happen when you just put the guy in the office so what.
Cuban,Do you think that the american people should ask about Trump as a president if there's one question what would it be.
Interviewer,Is it the same thing you're saying that do you really think he's gonna deliver on all this now because he knows I mean.
Cuban,Look when when he him and all i'm not this isn't just Donald right this is everyone at every single Hillary right.
Interviewer,Because when they put the other tax pay all we're cutting the tax to all this we used a number from this tax group right.
Cuban,It doesn't add up right and they say oh it's gonna cost you know 30 trillion dollars over ten years.
Interviewer,Oh no the economy will increase so much right right you know it's BS right do you process the boat though you got to.
Cuban,Pick somebody to vote for house what comes out look we got 12 months right show me nothing matters too late yeah.
Interviewer,Right and so we got lots of time and you know things will start right now they can play Alice in Wonderland and.
Cuban,Just throw things up and it doesn't matter right I mean because none of their tax plans work and then Hillary or.
Interviewer,Bernie saying okay tax the 1% and that'll pay for everything doesn't work right.
Cuban,Won't work you know hilary's um pay for college her plan is ridiculous it'll increase college costs not reduce you.
Interviewer,Know so they don't they don't think them through they just say okay here's here's my justification but over time don't.
Cuban,Have to start thinking them through and they'll have to start dealing and addressing some facts and then at that.
Interviewer,Point in time you say okay knowing that none of this is ever going to pass who's still going to be the best president.
Cuban,When it's all said and done it's gonna be very interesting it is very very interesting on what's gonna happen so.
Interviewer,Let's do it let's do a couple things here with fun and then we'll go into cyber to wrap it up sports you know.
Cuban,Dallas and what happened with our you know we can say runaway bride if you want to call it oh yeah it's super got.
Interviewer,It runaway bride with what happened with them if you were to ever call back this.
Cuban,Season let's just say because my opinion is this I think if the clips don't pull it together this year I think.
Interviewer,Something's gonna break apart that's my opinion I don't care if he called us he wants to come and plead Alice would you.
Cuban,Ever take a battle never so now he's ever stating ever you never say never right everybody deserves the second.
Interviewer,Chance Chum you know dee will said no to us initially and we brought it back.
Cuban,Interesting right so you know i just care about winning and I'll put winning above ego anytime I.
Interviewer,Noticed with guys that get to your level that there's got to be a level you have a strong memory because you know enemies.
Cuban,Everyone's got a target we got enemies but there's also a level of forgiveness when it comes down to it you're here to.
Interviewer,Win right oh so just make sense if the opportunity arises yeah why not why not right I I mean look it's basketball it's.
Cuban,Not thermonuclear war right it's not like you shot my cousin you know or you know we're just you know cut off us.
Interviewer,Pinky right it's basketball oh my goodness we think sometime we you know when we drink some of these exciting.

Cuban,But on the flip side ios batteries seem to last longer so there's pluses and minuses to both so yeah I don't know if.
Interviewer,You heard him say this ios batteries tend to last longer to all my droid friends out there yeah okay.
Cuban,So let's talk about cyber yes uh-huh this has become the app that I check probably the most on a daily base.
Interviewer,Outside of youtube good and youtube i checked because of what we got going on but this is a very very exciting app.
Cuban,Tell me the story behind why cyberdust sure um back in 2013 I had a trial against the SEC the SEC accused me of.
Interviewer,Insider trading and in the trial as part of their discovery they took all my emails and some of the most innocuous.
Cuban,Emails you know when i wrote them thought okay this is really you know this means absolutely nothing they would.
Interviewer,Take and they turned him into like oh this is proof you did X Y & Z like I said I had one of my buddies Lee that is.
Cuban,The world's worst stock trader and i said that in the email you know cuz he asked me about the stock that I was.
Interviewer,Accused of insider trading mama calm and I said you know no stay away from it because I knew he would just lose money.
Cuban,Figure out a way to lose money and i said and you know when when the SEC asked me about it I said no he's the.
Interviewer,World's worst or threatened said no you knew this stock was going down and you just said that to protect him I'm like.
Cuban,That's ridiculous right so if someone was that as simple as that just when you're in an adversarial position.
Interviewer,Whether it's the sec or any lost interest right if you've ever done a deposition right whatever you say the.
Cuban,Other sized attorney is going to try to turn it into something to their benefit sure and and with emails with text it.
Interviewer,Loses context and when you really think about it the minute you hit Send on an email a text message a Facebook message.
Cuban,Whatever it may be the minute you who it's in you lose ownership of it but you don't lose responsibility for it and.
Interviewer,We're not talking about judging your ownership but not responsibility very interest right because if I send you an.
Cuban,Email you own it now that's right right if you want to say you know when I if I said the sky is blue what an amazing day.
Interviewer,You know and then you know something comes out and you say see he sent me this email he doesn't.
Cuban,Really believe this guy is green you know he may have said this guy's free he's a liar right see Cubans a liar you.
Interviewer,Know and so you can take anything i said you know if if my daughter has a friend who you know finds her lost iPad which.
Cuban,Would be a calamity and she says i love you for this thank you so much you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Interviewer,And some little schmucky little kid says Oh from Alexis I have this email and she says she loves me see right that.
Cuban,Responsibility that context can change forever that's why I started cyberdust so from a business perspective I do.
Interviewer,Didn't like the fact that i lost control of all my emails no matter where they were.
Cuban,Since particularly since i do everything via email at the time I didn't like the fact that anybody could keep it whether.
Interviewer,Or not i liked it or not right from and so and I also like the fact that because it disappeared it was like.
Cuban,A face-to-face conversation so when you and I talked via cyberdust it's like talking here now sure except now it's.
Interviewer,Being recorded but you know - the camp - the camp it's right if you take the picture name doesn't say Dave doesn't so.
Cuban,Nominal but even yeah but even if you take a screenshot right not only does it not say who it came from but it sends me.
Interviewer,An alert and you know you talk if someone were to have a whole group of screenshots trying to reassemble a.
Cuban,Conversation you're gonna know something was wrong in the first place right because you're not gonna if you want.
Interviewer,Them to save it you're not gonna have that conversation inside with us if I'm sending you something I want you to save.
Cuban,I'm gonna say i'm what's your email right cuz you don't you you use email less right but you know you still can.
Interviewer,Use email here's a contract here's you know let's discuss the terms we need to memorialize that's great but for having.
Cuban,What would otherwise be in a face-to-face conversation for anything that is just a business conversation I'm.
Interviewer,Gonna use cyber dust every time and so that's why I created it and when we created it you know like anything else.
Cuban,Like any other business i thought this would be big for kids right sorry it's like kids it's the post snapchat.
Interviewer,Generation that really is into it people who think in terms of words people who communicate ideas you know as opposed to.
Cuban,Here's a picture of my lunch you fell it commented on snap check if they has made a very big.
Interviewer,Mistake they i need a very big miss yeah they said every say yeah and that benefits cyber does I mean positioning.
Cuban,Wise that was not a good move on there right now and that's okay I mean they're fine not worried about anything.
Interviewer,But at the same time you know we're kind of like if you will snapchat for grown-ups.
Cuban,You know when once you get past here's pictures of my lunch at for grown-ups yeah you know if four people wonder so.
Interviewer,If you've only used snapchat you're trying to figure out what it is right because snapchats all about pictures.
Cuban,It's not about communications cyber to us is about communicating ideas it's a you know you can send links you can send.
Interviewer,It from one to one person and then send it to a hundred or a thousand or a million people that follow you cyber.
Cuban,Dust is about being able to have a private conversation privacy creates honesty if we're having.
Interviewer,A conversation and you and i could talk about politics and I can beat like we did and I could be brutally on and you.
Cuban,Were and i was right because it's not going everywhere and the minute if you took a snapchat a snapshot I'm not.
Interviewer,Talking about anymore right right and and then I can it's not for me right because it doesn't have my hair so that.
Cuban,Privacy really makes people a lot more candid and if you and if you're in a big business as an example your lawyers will.
Interviewer,Always tell you you know write an email knowing that someone else is going to be reading it and it could be a lawyer from.
Cuban,An opposing counsel right you don't have to do that with cyberdust you can just be honest and to me that moves forward.
Interviewer,The conversation and makes businesses more effective do you think politicians people who are of influence that.
Cuban,Everything is held against them do you think people would you know public figures they need to start transitioning.
Interviewer,Away from twitter to cyber that's what you're saying oh yeah and there's a lot to do and they just do it on a private.
Cuban,Basis you'd be shocked at the be a level names and the people that use cyber dust and then if told me and the politicians.
Interviewer,And you know because i can see that i'm oh yeah this morning you know 90% of our usage is 9:00 to 5:00 you know and so.
Cuban,You know it's putting doing it on Twitter whatever your whole whether you're 16 26 66 right everything you do.
Interviewer,In social media creates a footprint that says who you are anybody I hire right that's going to direct for me I'm.
Cuban,Looking at twitter i'm looking at Facebook I'm looking at their Instagram I'm following them on snapchat because.
Interviewer,It all creates a profile who they are and now there's machine learning that's going through and analyzing these things.
Cuban,And saying okay patrick is this and i know that because here's all his social media posts and it's going to be a whole.
Interviewer,Lot worse if you're 16 17 18 and you've got this whole long history or some of this it's not an issue obviously and.
Cuban,They're coming out with websites are coming I would wait to try to audit you to be able to figure out what you think.
Interviewer,You're yes of course there are everything you know everything well I'll tell you my opinion outside with us so.
Cuban,Some of the people that are watching is I love cyber that's when I first switched to cyber does and I started.
Interviewer,Messing with it the first couple things was well you know what how do I know who the message comes from all group and all.
Cuban,You got to do is hold a picture comes up which was all right yeah all these different colors how to know who is this.
Interviewer,So i had to do that then you know the screenshot you have to learn the screenshot that if you have to get.
Cuban,Something that you want to save hey get this email screenshot I can save that okay great that helped me out but I put.
Interviewer,It in three different categories so i use dust as a text right that's how I look at dust right I use blast as they.
Cuban,Tweet how i look at it right as you can send it but the good thing is I have groups right on who I can tweet to right.
Interviewer,Just great really right yeah then i like the group dust right and on the group dust I can look at that as group me.
Cuban,That's group text it's just privacy it's private it's an oh group me is becoming very slow so fun whether I'm running an.
Interviewer,Organization sales organization a company it doesn't matter I can categorize those three and it's working.
Cuban,Amazingly well for me right now so i'm I'm a big fan of okay yeah cyber dust in a major major way so it's like I get.
Interviewer,Like i follow you on cyber too so i get your motivation he's enough and I'll be blasted a lot right you get the stuff.
Cuban,That i put out there on whether it's on business or motivation or stuff like that so and the cool part about it when.
Interviewer,You tweet something like on your twitter on your Instagram on YouTube right no matter what you tweet or put out there.
Cuban,Someone's gonna bust on you for it right there's always going to be a troll that trolls you from one way and in the back.
Interviewer,Your mind you're always thinking okay how somebody going to nail me on this you never have to do that on cyber is.
Cuban,Because if i say something you don't agree with and you come back math suck well 30 seconds later it's.
Interviewer,Gone right and i can block you and you don't know it and and but the better part is no one else sees it on Twitter.
Cuban,If they say well you know what you suck right your company sucks everybody sees that's right right and.
Interviewer,You don't want to deal with that knowing that everybody's gonna see there is one very very good point you just made I.
Cuban,Didn't even think about that so you're not talking about me saying you suck I'm held to it.
Interviewer,Right you're saying it's a brand another person says you suck right so when I go sir yeah when I go search for your.
Cuban,Company very good point so when you search for Mark Cuban or M cube in my Twitter handle you see all the people.
Interviewer,Say oh you're an idiot cube and you suck why did you do this why did you do that right I don't put anything of.
Cuban,Consequence on twitter anymore Twitter's like a PR News we're a lot less on Twitter than you were taller.
Interviewer,Years ago not even a question on it's night and day not notice about anything a consequence I put on cyberdust and.
Cuban,Blasted up right and so a patrick says oh that was an interesting concept we can have a conversation and it's private.
Interviewer,Right on twitter if you say something that I'm interested one I'm living it to 140 characters - we could go to direct.
Cuban,Message and do it that way but you could still keep it all right three everybody else is going to see the conversation.
Interviewer,And it's going to jump in and add their own two cents and so it becomes such a public medium that you can't it's no.
Cuban,Longer social whereas was cyberdust if 30 people respond respond to something I blast out there I can deal.
Interviewer,With them one to one and if i like something I can say hey would you mind if I read last this or you know.
Cuban,Screenshot it and send it to everybody and if I want to I can and so you get the best of all worlds yeah I'm a big.
Interviewer,Big fan of it you know we use it in so many we have everybody in the field getting it use it and then the.
Cuban,Interesting thing is the speed is very it's getting faster faster and faster it was a little bit but like this within a.
Interviewer,Month could change every month you're seeing something worried that's not gonna better and better I love it I'm.
Cuban,Looking forward to using it a lot more as well so III have a feeling you know I was in.
Interviewer,Front of a group of guys and i see guys go get cyber does a challenge sometimes is you know Gary Vaynerchuk he got big.
Cuban,On youtube early with my library you had some some of these Twitter guys with himself he's got 1.1 million followers.
Interviewer,But on twitter he got involved right off the bat right so yeah I've got 4 million right.
Cuban,And it helped that i was there like i said my suggestion to everybody is if you're not on if you if you don't have a.
Interviewer,Big presence on twitter if africa it's a lot easier go get a big before cyberdust got 5 million users I'd rather have a.
Cuban,Little we get the right sir but yeah so if you add yourself so if you want to get followers and you're looking to.
Interviewer,Build a following on twitter it's really hard right and you know if you built enough build up a thousand followers on.
Cuban,Twitter it's probably taking you multiple years and half of them are dormant or BOTS right on cyberdust there.
Interviewer,Are no bots first of all and if you add yourself to chatters then you're going to be able to get followers and we have.
Cuban,A follow friday like twitter does right and we'll put out there people to follow but also we're going to be improving our.
Interviewer,Discovery mechanism significantly here over the next two months and so because to your point we want regular everyday.
Cuban,People to be able to get a thousand two thousand five thousand followers we're on Twitter they might have 150 followers.
Interviewer,And most of those are just follow backs or bots and so it they're not really a consequence so no doubt about it.
Cuban,Twitter they did a number saying twitter their biggest criticism is only 24% of users are real oh really.
Interviewer,Everyone else that's great not real because they sell thousands fake followers because you know now that I.
Cuban,Can write fake file right right and then you know so that's yeah none of the world bots don't work you can't bought.
Interviewer,Ours you can bot cyberdust that's great that's great well you know again mark.
Cuban,Thank you for your time i want to give you this book and I want you to open the front of everybody I just want to show.
Interviewer,You if you actually have it or not they do have it you can give it away to somebody and I use I these incredible.
Cuban,Specials wow nobody's no life i don't have five of these but I have at least four now is it a first print for studio.
Interviewer,Without a person further this is the first French first edition 1957 I found it oh um Beverly Hills it's not a third.
Cuban,Edition it's first first of all set original what that's amazing Wow yeah and I got it for you because when.
Interviewer,We were in nashville i got up and asked you a question I said hey book that impact you to most you said and ran.
Cuban,After shrug that's it I can now really get better to get it for you so there was another three weeks.
Interviewer,That we really fell like the tenth time thank you that's research it's a great gift thank you so much and folks.
Cuban,Everybody out there watching this you obviously know everybody loves this man for his honest direct.
Interviewer,Whether you like it or not he's gonna give you the direct opinion on anything with business one share this video with.
Cuban,Other people to go get cyber dust app download it and tell your friends to also get on cyberdust and start using it.
Interviewer,And you know many times you'll be surprised you sent him a message you'll be surprised with him responding back.
Cuban,Trying to respond them all and i guarantee you I'm gonna try to motivate you like like Patrick I try to do as.
Interviewer,Many motivational great love you so much yeah what's your user at cyber dusted a conviction also is just plug my or an.
Cuban,Hour yeah blog member blog maverick once again thank you I don't appreciate about that.
Interviewer,"Mark, good to have you with us."
Cuban,"Thanks for having me, Steve."
Interviewer,"You're in the media business, so let's ask a Shakespearean question. Whither media? One question, but you've been involved in so many aspects of it."
Cuban,"It's a great question. Everywhere. I mean, you obviously have lived and breathed the media your entire life. And, you know, as we've become more and more digital, we've evolved to expand from just beyond to Internet to mobile devices. And, you know, it's interesting, because we're have a Renaissance in computing power. Used to be, we got excited about what would happen on a desktop and that created video and other opportunities. We got excited about faster Internet. Now, with mobile devices of all sizes, from phones to iPads and other tablet type devices coming, you know, media isn't about picking up a newspaper at the airport or stopping at the newsstand. It's using whatever device you happen to have with whatever time you happen to have available to you to consume. And I think that's great for media, overall, because it means we're consuming so much more."
Interviewer,"You've made some observations about how, if something is free, be prepared to die."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And if you're No.1, be prepared to be upendedpreempted, as you put it."
Cuban,"Yes, sir."
Interviewer,Can you explain?
Cuban,"Sure. You know, there's a consciousness that goes with all technology. You know, there's again, going back in history, when I started working with PCs, there was those who used PCs and those were, you know, old-school, and paper-driven. But people paid for software. People paid for content. And then, over time, it evolved to once the Internet hit and the marginal cost of delivery of content in other items was free, because, you know, one more bit in your bandwidth pipe didn't really cost you anything, we started to see people give away content, in particular, for free and there were companies that were built on delivering whatever it is. It could be search results as content. It could be aggregating information, a la Drudge Report or some others. And they made their living based off of advertising around that content."
Interviewer,"YouTube, you think is something of a villain, in terms of live video on the Web, as you said, 10 years, what's to show for it?"
Cuban,"Well, no, it's not so much that they're a villain, I think they've created a misconception. Yeah, they are a villain, you know. In their own way, right, you know."
Interviewer,"You're an entrepreneur, you can get  with that."
Cuban,"I can get away with that, yeah. When you buy a market, right, there's some villainyI don't have the right word, right, but there's going to be a bad guy. And in YouTube's case, they, you know, I've always felt they stole content. You know, and Viacom feels the same way; they've sued them for it. But the, I think the bigger picture now, while they're litigating that in court, is that You Tube has subsidized the bandwidth of the Internet. You know, five years ago, if somebody would've said, Steve, we want to post this video online, the conversation then would've gone to, Well, how much is going to cost us? Where are we going to host it? Where are the servers going to come from? Now,  anybody who wants to post video online, it's presumed to be free."
Interviewer,"So, talking about Google, Google TV, and all of that, you've made the point, they're going into it."
Cuban,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,And you made the example of House.
Cuban,"Right. One of my favorite shows, right."
Interviewer,"And if Google puts up a kids thing, instead of what they perceive as a rival."
Cuban,"Right. Well, yeah, I mean, with Google Television, Google's kind of taken Microsoft's place as the dominant player in the current leading technology, if you will."
Interviewer,"Taking online. How, on advertising, how do you get real revenues from that, when you have networks, exchanges, where they try to commoditize everything?"
Cuban,"You don't. You really, really don't. I mean, it's the unwritten lie. You know, that, well, if I create a website, and I generate enough pageviews or have unique users, then I'll just be able to sell advertising. But the reality is, you know, there's unlimited inventory. Anybody can create it, so there has to be some value proposition, whether in the quality of the content or just sheer, absolute numbers that allow you to generate revenue."
Interviewer,"So, even if you have unique content, it's, in the old days are old days. A year ago."
Cuban,"Yeah, weeks ago, yeah."
Interviewer,You get a premium for it. You think the squeeze is going to be in the opposite direction?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,It's just pennies instead of dollars?
Cuban,"Yeah, no question. Just because great content is subjective, obviously. You know, you always hear people talk about the music business, which is the ultimate a la carte business."
Interviewer,"How do you get paid for content? Especially now, we consider, like, bread and butter, it's free."
Cuban,"Right, right, right, right. You know, there's an interesting lesson going on right now, with Facebook and Google. One of the most unique lessons of Facebook is that most of its stuff's not indexed in Google. And it's doing just fine. You know, 500 million unique users, yet you know, Google's, and I don't mean this to sound like, let's just, you know,  step-on-Google interview. But when they're."
Interviewer,Why not?
Cuban,"Yeah, why not, huh? But when they're the dominant player, I mean, just like we used to talk about Microsoft all the time."
Interviewer,Exactly.
Cuban,"But, you know, Google's stated intent is to index all the world's information."
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"Now they're, like the commercial says, There's an app for that. And that's information that Google no longer has access to. So how does that transition to media? Well, the fear always was if I'm not participating with Google, I'm not going to have access to all those people. That's disappearing. So between Facebook, who generates probably more usage outside of it than maybe even Google for a lot of scenarios, for a lot of content, Twitter, which generates a ton of content. I know my own blog, Twitter generates 90% of the referrals that I get. Google is just a de minimus amount. And so now we're starting to see that there are other sources. And, you know, we're starting to see a greater influx of real-time data being created by media sources as well."
Interviewer,"So it's not like Easy Pass, you know, pay 10 cents for this or pay 90 cents for another?"
Cuban,"Because, you know, if you're interested in good content, your time is of some level of value, in trying to determine whether it's worth it to pay a penny or not, just going through the process makes it not worth it. So, there's got to be an, that's why Amazon is so dominant. Your credit card's already there. It's easier just to, I mean, I'm spoiled, I'll order shampoo and shaving cream and everything, and it'll just show up because it's just easier than getting in the car and doing whatever."
Interviewer,"Sort of like cable, you do it once a month, and that's it."
Cuban,"And it's there, yeah. And it's simple, exactly. Great analogy. And I think newspapers have got to put themselves in the same position. That's kind of the chicken and egg right now. I don't think the difficulty's going to be getting people to pay. I think it's in how you get them to pay. And it may well be that like the cable analogy, where it's already bundled, and you pay one bill, and you know, it's cheaper than if you had to do a la carte."
Interviewer,"So instead of maybe a site, you have an app?"
Cuban,"Well, an app is going to be one part of it, but you've got to get people to use the app. But I think you might even glom on to what other people are doing. So, you might say, Amazon, what are you selling? Netflix , would you like to include newspapers as part of it? You know, for an extra $1.00, you get access to these 15 newspapers, then we just pay back the newspapers per turn, just like Netflix does with movies. And so, you go where the credit cards already are. You go where the perceived value is greater than the incremental."
Interviewer,"So it's not content, it's marketing."
Cuban,"It's both, right? But I think you've got to get there, but it's got to be easy. It's got to be the path of least resistance."
Interviewer,"And, so, just to be philosophical for one second, what you see unfolding against the monster Google as the alternatives are coming?"
Cuban,They're here.
Interviewer,They're breaking them up.
Cuban,"Right. And it's really a question of how to package and market, and make it so that it's the path of least resistance. Because Google has always been so fast and so easy, it was the path of least resistance to get to news."
Interviewer,Path of least resistance.
Cuban,That's the difference.
Interviewer,"And you keep emphasizing with things like Facebook or Twitter, enjoy your dominance,  other things are coming along."
Cuban,"No question. You know, we're, mobile is changing everything. You know, we're in a boring stage of the Internet, if you will, where it's a utility. Ten years ago it wasn't a utility. If you put together an application on the Web, there's a very good chance it was going to break. And, you know, five years ago, if you started, you know, when, look at Twitter, it still breaks sometimes."
Interviewer,So it's not going to go the way of wire lines?
Cuban,"No, it's not going to go the way of lines, but there's a lot of change. I guess the bigger point is, the philosophical side is, the rules are going to be rewritten again because of how we integrate mobile devices into our lives. Not just outside the home, like we use them today, but inside the home as well."
Interviewer,Where's that leave cable?
Cuban,"I think cable's in a good spot, right? Because they're the better packages of television, which I don't think goes away. One of the driving forces that I think people miss all the time is big-screen televisions are the No. 1 consumer device. You know, when I started HDNET in 2001, a 40 inch, you know, plasma that was, you know,  wasn't even 720p, was $12,000."
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"Now, on the way over here, I'm reading on, you know, in the back page of one of the newspapers that you can get a 40 inch television for $398, and a 32 inch all hi-def, HDMI, all the fanciest of the fancy, right?"
Interviewer,Wow. You're a great entrepreneur.
Cuban,I try.
Interviewer,"Well, the economy."
Cuban,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,"Washington doesn't seem to recognize, if you don't have entrepreneurs, you don't get innovation ."
Cuban,"Well, I mean, you obviously know, you have been talking about that better than anybody."
Interviewer,"So what's the most alarming trend you see right now, and do you see correctives coming along?"
Cuban,"Well, the most alarming trend is that Congress thinks they know what they're doing, when everybody knows that they don't. And you get a bastardized solution, as a result. And you know, the more pages in the bill past probably 100, the more the law of unintended consequences is waiting, just to kick everybody in the butt, and the whole economy."
Interviewer,Sort of a perverse Moore's Law.
Cuban,"That's exactly right. It's a very perverse Moore's Law. And so, I've always been of the mindset that the American spirit is what sets our country apart from every other country in the world. You know, we're just raised that there's a unique opportunity for any one of us should we decide to take advantage."
Interviewer,The idea of taxing so-called carried interest.
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,Not a good idea.
Cuban,"Actually, I'm going to disagree with you. I like the idea of carried tax and carried interest because I like to say short-term, but there is no such thing as a short-term tax, right?"
Interviewer,"So, if you own the U.S. government, like you own the Mavericks, what would you do to unleash the entrepreneur?"
Cuban,"I would do a couple things. One, I would say that any equity investment in a company with 25 or fewer employees, held for, pick a term, three years or five years, when you sell it, it's tax-free."
Interviewer,Reduce the capital gains.
Cuban,"Reduce the capital gains, but with a holding period. Because I think part of the flipside of where we have some problems is money in this country now has become fast money. It's become traded money, as opposed to shareholder-driven, as opposed to enabling capital. You know, over the past 10 years, you know, there used to be a progression."
Interviewer,"This gets, how do you revive the IPO market? I mean, especially for smaller companies?"
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"Your $25 million, $50 million?"
Cuban,There's nothing.
Interviewer,"No bankers, investment bankers interested?"
Cuban,It's funny you say that.
Interviewer,So Sarbanes-Oxley kills small businesses  unnecessary expenses.
Cuban,You are exactly right. You're exactly right.
Interviewer,And why do you think that is?
Cuban,"I just think the money is gravitated towards fast money. And, you know, I think the hole has been created, because investment banks, once they started going public, in particular, they just went to the biggest, you know, wherever they could find the biggest money. As much leverage as they can get as quick and as fast. Look, if I'm Goldman Sachs , and I have a whole quarter's worth of trading days where I don't lose a penny, I make money every single trading day, would I rather do that, or take the next Broadcast.com public? Or any small company public? Would I rather spend the money on going out there, and evaluating companies?"
Interviewer,"So let's say on banks, instead of 30-to-one, you're now restricted like a real bank, 11-to-one, 12-to-one. You have a stable dollar, so you don't get the juice of stability of trading in commodities and currencies."
Cuban,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,"You lower tax rates, or give holidays for certain periods of time."
Cuban,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,"You think boutiques, like what you're talking about, can rise up and fill the void that the big ones have left out there?"
Cuban,"Yeah, because there's going to be guys like me."
Interviewer,"Like going against a big retailer, if you have a boutique, people will pay up for specialized services?"
Cuban,"Absolutely, positively. What's happening right now, Steve, and it's really just over the past 12 months, there's kind of a groundswell that's, I don't want to say underground, but it's not being covered by the mainstream media, of companies like one called Y Combinator, which is just a little angel funding, where it says, You know what? We're probably not going to invest more than $100,000 in you, it may only be $50,000, it may be $25,000. And you're going to give us some preset amount, 10% of your company, and we're going to help you grow."
Interviewer,So a version of micro-lending?
Cuban,"Yeah, only micro-VC, if you will, right? But now, these things are springing up everywhere. Myself, I posted a blog post called The Mark Cuban Stimulus Plan about a year ago, right? And I just started getting these great ideas out of the woodwork. I thought, I'm probably, I think, nine in the past 12 or so months, where I've invested $250,000 or less and just found these great companies. And you can do it now because the cost of technology, you know, even when I started Broadcast.com, just to get a basic PC was $3,000. Now an iPad or a PC or a laptop is $400, and has 10 times the power."
Interviewer,So give some of the things you invested in. I love the name Naked Pizza.
Cuban,"I'm not going to touch that. Naked Pizza's a perfect example. I posted The Mark Cuban Stimulus Plan, I got an e-mail, and they were, like, You know, when the Mavericks play the New Orleans Hornets, you've got to come try our pizza. We think you'll like it. And I did. It was, like, I got to eat a whole pizza that I loved for under 800 calories. And I'm, like, You just convinced me that the product's worth it, right? And so, the guys are, busted their butts, bust their butts, but they were, because they'd taken out some loans, because there were some other elements that they kind of got ahead of themselves, they needed a small infusion of capital."
Interviewer,Wickler?
Cuban,"Yeah, we have Wickler, it's just a very simple company that any public auditoriums, or bars, restaurants, that have big crowds, they face an issue with the fire marshal. And you see, like, people standing with these little clickers."
Interviewer,"Right, right."
Cuban,"Out at the front door, which is ridiculous, right? It's, you know, you can't even do it. So Wickler has a system where it automates that whole process and then with password driven, it connects right to the fire marshal, just to say, Hey, we've got a big crowd, just so you don't freak out, and B, feel free to come in and take a look at our numbers, online, as opposed to you getting in your truck and driving out there and making a big stink. And we're also looking at another company to complement that, it's called Motion Lift, that has a camera that has some really cool software that identifies through heat and visuals, the difference between bodies and live people and other devices, right?"
Interviewer,"So, in essence, it's like the '70s, terrible decade, but you had Southwest Airlines ."
Cuban,Yep.
Interviewer,"FedEx , Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, all of these things."
Cuban,"Absolutely. Yeah, and look, Oracle with Larry Ellison, Microsoft with Bill Gates starting in New Mexico out of his parents' house. You know, Michael Dell."
Interviewer,"So the takeaway is, if the government just stepped aside and, if there's a need, entrepreneurs like you are going to find a way to fill it."
Cuban,"No question. The hard part is, you know, they're so far in, or so far up our, you know, how do you get them out, right, and what's the progression?"
Interviewer,How do you shoot the elephant?
Cuban,"That's exactly right. How do you shoot the elephant? And, you know, I'm not smart enough to have."
Interviewer,Maybe I should say donkey.
Cuban,"Either way, both, how do you shoot both? How do you get that wild game out of the living room?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. Mark, thank you very much."
Cuban,"Thank you, Steve, I really enjoyed it. It was a great interview."
Interviewer,Good fun. You're terrific.
Cuban,It was a fun interview.
Interviewer,How did you develop your entrepreneurial mindset?
Cuban,"I've always been competitive, goal-oriented and self-sufficient. It's like I tell my kids, 'you have to go figure life out... ' My dad was the same way; neither of my parents went to college and so it was like, 'we can't help you... if you want to do this, you're going to have to figure it out... ' and that's how I got started. I realized early on that I had to develop confidence in selling- whether it was selling garbage bags door to door, or anything else. Learning to sell took away some of the fear and gave me confidence to start any kind of business."
Interviewer,How did you get over the initial fear of starting a business?
Cuban,"Fear depends on your context, and how much you think you have to lose. You may be young or broke and have nothing to lose. In that case? Either you figure out a way to get something, or you don't get it. Simple. That's like Shark Tank one of the reasons I do the show is because so many kids and families watch it- and it helps people get over that initial hesitancy to start a business. There was a time I was living with 6 guys in a 3-bedroom apartment; what did I have to lose? If a failed, I was still broke and if it worked? Maybe I wouldn't be broke. As I got more successful, I had to be more prepared and I think that is where people fall short. Everyone has ideas, everyone goes to Google to look up ideas to see if anyone else is doing it... . They'll run it by friends... and then stop, dead stop... because they're afraid people might look down on them if they fail or because they think they need to go out and raise a lot of money in order for it to work. Here's the thing you need to just get out there and try it. Taking that first step is your biggest competitive advantage; most people won't do it."
Interviewer,Why is sport used so often as an analogy for business?
Cuban,"Business and sport are both about competition. You're not working in a vacuum, and you can't go back to the start when you're losing. If I figure out the strategy and get way ahead of you, you can't just start-over. In sport, like in business, there's someone out there trying to take it all away from you. Your competitors aren't sat there thinking, 'you know what, let's just split the marketplace... ' they're saying, 'you know what, if I have a chance to take 100% of the market, and I can do it legally, that's exactly what I'm going to do... '."
Interviewer,How do you maintain your focus in business?
Cuban,"In business, you can drown in opportunity. When things are going well, you stay with it no-one wants to quit anything that's fun and going well. it's when things start to slow down, or you're worried about competitors or have uncertainty... then you start to think, 'I'm an entrepreneur, I can start something else... ' and that's the biggest challenge for any growing company you hit that first resistance, or any other challenge, and start thinking 'do I pivot because this is harder than I thought? Or do I dig in?' it depends on your responsibilities... . I've always thought about my employees and customers first, I can't let them down and they always bring my focus back. I never want to be the guy who says, 'yeah, I wanted to do this, but I didn't have the perseverance to stick it out... '."
Interviewer,How do the best businesses stay competitive?
Cuban,"Being an entrepreneur doesn't mean you have one shot, or one idea, or start one company. Just look at Amazon what makes them the best company in the world is that they keep inventing things to make their business better, and they know how to create product. Sometimes it doesn't work, like the phones, and then other times its revolutionary, like AWS or their delivery service."
Interviewer,How are you able to successfully enter multiple markets and industries?
Cuban,"One of the greatest skills you can have as an entrepreneur is loving to learn. I read all day, and my kids have taught me how good YouTube is as a learning resource to get additional knowledge that I wouldn't have utilised before."
Interviewer,What does philanthropy mean to you?
Cuban,"I've been very fortunate; my next dollar isn't going to change my life; it is what it is from a marginal value and utility point of view. That's obviously not the case for other people and so I look for points where I can leverage that dollar to work- I like to find people or groups in need, and rather than creating a charity or working through a charity, I'll pay their bills. I like to have a direct impact and try to be very efficient. In my experience, when you work with larger charities, efficiency can drop considerably."
Interviewer,What do you hope your legacy will be?
Cuban,"My biggest legacy is my kids. Beyond my family? I haven't done my best work yet I have a long way to go. I'm proud of the success I've had in business, I've reached a lot of goals that I never thought I would, and my life feels unreal, like a dream. I may not look 25 years old, but I feel like I am, and I know I haven't done my best work yet."
Interviewer,How concerned are you about this whole situation?
Cuban,"Well obviously, very concerned, but it's not necessarily about basketball. Obviously this is much bigger than basketball. I'm concerned about will my kids have school or not, I'm concerned are we all doing the right thing because this is obviously new territory, this is certainly a black swan event in my experiences, and so basketball actually becomes secondary. But in terms of basketball, as I said earlier, nobody at the Dallas Mavericks is an expert on infectious diseases or their spread, and so this is not a situation where you fake it to your make it, or try to sound or act important. The NBA has hired people with expertise in those areas and they're working with people from the government and other expert areas, of other people with expertise. And so we have to defer to them. And that's exactly what we'll do. If the NBA, effectively if one player, two players, whatever it is already have it, we'll have to act accordingly. And I think the NBA made the right decision."
Interviewer,"Mark, this evening on ESPN you mentioned something about your concern for some of the employees, the part time people that work here. Could you reiterate that?"
Cuban,"They get paid by the hour and this was their source of income. And so we'll do some things there, we may ask them to go do some volunteer work in exchange. We've already started the process of having a program in place and I don't have any details to give, but it's certainly something that's important to me."
Interviewer,This is all transpired so rapidly. What are your feelings right now?
Cuban,"And so it's stunning, but we are where we are and we have to be smart in how we respond. We, again as I just said, this is people's lives at stake. This isn't about basketball, this isn't about the Mavericks, this isn't about, when do we start, or do we start, or how do we start? This is a pandemic, a global pandemic, where people's lives are at stake and I'm a lot more worried about my kids and my mom who's 82 years old, and talking to her and telling her to stay in the house, than I am about when we play our next game. Look, we have a lot of flexibility, I don't want to speak for Adam or the NBA, but in terms of the NBA basketball side of this, we have a lot of flexibility because there's nothing that happens after June 12th when we typically end our season."
Interviewer,Did you have any concerns about playing in a packed house tonight?
Cuban,"No, I didn't, I didn't really, I was actually shocked that we had so many people, to be honest. I was half expecting it to be half full. The good news is that you could tell by the screaming and yelling, it was a very young audience. And so that probably makes a lot of sense. But no, I didn't have any reason to believe that anybody put anybody else at risk. And we tried, last week we tried to be proactive. You saw we handed out all the Purells to everybody. That's not going to stop everything, but at least we can try to take a little bit of action to try to minimize where we could."
Interviewer,Coming out guys.
Cuban,"Well let me say one other thing, because I know it'll come up and JJ, you can feel free to, in terms of what we told the players, we told them to be very vigilant, that this is not a situation where the season's ended. Go do what you're going to do. We expect you to stay in Dallas, and the NBA told us that we'll continue to practice and do rehab and continue to do work. And I was very specific as was Coach, to say who you talked to is very important. If bringing people in from out of town because you have downtime. No, that's not going to work. That you have to be accountable to the people you're dealing with and who you know for your own personal safety and obviously for everybody else's. So this is not a vacation. This is effectively self quarantining everybody because we, again, it's our responsibility to be vigilant, and the players are in a unique position because wherever they are, people want to come up to them."
Interviewer,"Was selling Broadcast.com to Yahoo the smartest business move you've ever made? If not, what was the smartest thing you've ever done in business?"
Cuban,"From a financial standpoint, it obviously is. But I would put teaching myself networking and becoming one of the first local area network integrators and developers in the country up there as my best business decisions."
Interviewer,"While on the topic of Yahoo, give us your assessment of CEO Carol Bartz . Will she still be Yahoo's CEO this time next year?"
Cuban,"No idea. I like Carol. She has the balls to do what is necessary, once they figure out what that is. However, like every mature technology company, they are looking for the next big thing, and it's not easy to find or create."
Interviewer,"You described yourself at the UBS conference in December as an all-around troublemaker. Indeed, you seem to relish the role of antagonist to traditional media, to basketball referees. What is it that you find so gratifying about being a pain in the ass, for lack of a better term, to authority and/or the established way of thinking/doing business?"
Cuban,"I love to challenge conventional wisdom. I'm a big believer that in business and in politics, when everyone is doing the same thing, none are probably as effective or successful as they could be. Typically it's not prudent for people within those industries, parties, or organizations to stand up and challenge the incumbents. It is usually a formula for losing a job, customer, or endorsement. My businesses are usually built around challenging conventional wisdom, so I tend to gain by taking the other side. It's been very profitable and entertaining for me."
Interviewer,"Before your most recent blog posts, you had a quiet spell."
Cuban,"This is going to sound crazy, but I think they all are. I don't think there are media companies that are ignorant about technology any longer. It's not like everyone in media companies is 75 years old and out of touch. The Internet has been around a long time now. Those 50-somethings running media companies have been using the Internet and earlier technologies since they were 20-somethings. This shit ain't new no more. The challenge for media companies is to balance hitting earnings-per-share numbers for shareholders or debt holders and finding money to invest in new technologies and create new business opportunities. Sure, they have lost subscribers and advertisers and advertising dollars, but many have managed to hang on, and some have thrived."
Interviewer,You recently said that cord-cutting is a way for people to say they want more TV. Can you explain your reasoning?
Cuban,"I always have to crack up when I hear people bragging about how they cut the cord, then they go on to discuss what they watch...all shows that were paid for and branded by virtue of their appearance on a linear TV network. They don't realize that they aren't saying they can live without TV. What they are saying is that they are willing to save money by waiting to watch the same TV shows everyone else is watching. That isn't anything new. That is the whole reason windows for content licensing exist. You can get any content for less just by waiting."
Interviewer,"Continuing with that thought, what do you think Comcast ultimately does with Hulu, the popular video-sharing site?"
Cuban,I think it stays alive to serve the purpose it has been serving all along
Interviewer,"You own the Dallas Mavericks NBA franchise, and you've been involved in the bidding for the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and MLB's Chicago Cubs, as well an investor in the nascent UFL. Are you just the typical free-spending billionaire sports fanatic or do you see a value proposition in owning sports franchises?"
Cuban,Right now most sports franchises that try to win are vanity assets. They aren't great businesses. There are structural problems in every major sports league that have to change for them to become good businesses.
Interviewer,Will there be an NBA or NFL lockout next season? What do you think are the key similarities and differences between the NBA and NFL negotiations?
Cuban,Can't comment unless you want to pay the fine.
Interviewer,"Prior to LeBron James' announcement that he was going to the Miami Heat, you predicted on your blog that he would stay in Cleveland, writing, The sports world is full of uncertainties. When in doubt go for the love. Nearly halfway through the season, what are your thoughts on fan reaction to James' choice and how the decision has worked out for him?"
Cuban,"His choice is his choice. I don't think anyone outside the state of Ohio has a problem with the choice. It was how he handled it. It turned him into a villain. But given that the Heat are playing the best basketball in the NBA right now, it has worked out very well for him and I'm sure he would do it all again if he had the chance."
Interviewer,"On your blog, you've been outspoken about how a la carte media businesses will have a hard time surviving because they are easily disrupted by technological innovation. What are your thoughts on The New York Times' pay-wall plans and News Corp.'s iPad-only newspaper, The Daily?"
Cuban,"As long as everything behind the pay wall is free to paper subscribers, it absolutely will work. They are assigning a value to their Internet content and offering it for free to the people who pay them the most money, their subscribers. None of those subscribers are going to feel upset they are getting something others cannot get. The pay wall will make the subscription decision easier. Compare it to the bundled services that cable and telcos offer. A bundle of cable TV and telco services worked well. Add to it wireless cell service and it worked even better. Bundles of valued services work."
Interviewer,"Apple, Google, Netflix, and others are all moving aggressively into streaming movie and TV content and are in active licensing negotiations with providers of that content. Do you think that one of these companies will decide to just buy a movie studio or production company outright to both give them control over their own library of content as well as the capability to produce new content instead of just striking licensing deals, particularly if the terms offered by the incumbent content creators is undesirable?"
Cuban,"Buying a library of content will open the door and allow them to test some things, but they very quickly fall into the trap of every content originator, paying the money to produce new content. That's a new business that is very, very difficult and expensive. There is a ton of competition, and competition increases costs. YouTube is having a challenge making money, and everyone gives it content for free!"
Interviewer,What are your thoughts on what's in store for the economy and the stock market in 2011? Are we headed for a double-dip recession? Jobless recovery?
Cuban,"I have no idea. Neither does anyone else. So my advice is to be careful. Whoever tells you they know what is coming is lying to your face. Always remember that in the stock market, no matter what you are buying or selling, there is someone else on the other side of the trade. They aren't making the trade with you because they want to lose money or leave money on the table just for you. They think you are a moron for doing the trade."
Interviewer,"You've been in a battle with the SEC over allegations of insider trading in the sale of shares of Mamma.com. In 2009 a court dismissed all charges against you, but last year an appeals court reinstated the case. Where do things stand now?"
Cuban,I can't give any details but I'm told the Office of the Inspector General is coming out with a report. You might want to check with them. But I can't wait till it is over. It will be my longest blog post and I will lay out every detail of what it's like to be chased by a conscious-less bureaucratic machine.
Interviewer,"If you could be any fictional character, who would it be and why?"
Cuban,None. I like my life better.
Interviewer,I'll ask him about winning in sports.
Cuban,"I said, Would you sell the team? he said, Yeah. I said, What's your price? and I didn't negotiate."
Interviewer,Winning in business.
Cuban,It wasn't about how much money I had. It was about how hard can I work and what can I accomplish.
Interviewer,And what it takes to make it big on Shark Tank.
Cuban,"I want it to sink on you very, very hard. So it just reverberates through your whole body. What was my last question to you?"
Interviewer,"Would I take the 90,000 for 40 percent?"
Cuban,"You had a chance to close, didn't you?"
Interviewer,"Tonight, Mark Cuban for the hour and Mark Cuban was a man who wears many hats, the Dallas Mavericks owner, acts as TV chairman even Shark Tank investor. There's a lot to talk about tonight. And Mark joins me exclusively. Welcome to you."
Cuban,"Thanks, Piers."
Interviewer,"Let me start with you. Now, I watched you last night and there's this amazing moment, you know, there's your team beating the Knicks in the last second, it was a typical kind of Cubanesque movement. And I thought there this guy who - when you were at 19, 20, you didn't have a dime to rub between you, right? And there you are the billionaire owner of a basketball team beating the Knicks in their own backyard. What did that moment feel like for you?"
Cuban,"It's amazing. I mean, that's one of the beauties of owning a sports team when you get to run out the court, you know, and there's a buzzer beater jumping up and down with everybody else and the cops aren't chasing you. So, it's surreal. I mean, it's an amazing feeling."
Interviewer,Do you pinch yourself sometimes?
Cuban,"Everyday. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I'll just look around and my family and, you know, just everything that's going on and just it's crazy. It's amazing and I try to never take it for granted."
Interviewer,"Your story is extraordinary, Mark, because you go back, you were living in Pittsburgh, your first job was working in a bank, the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh ..."
Cuban,In Pittsburgh. Yeah.
Interviewer,"... and the real young you realize that this sort of bank structure, the hierarchy is limiting."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Tell me how you dealt with that.
Cuban,"I got a job working at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh and I would send notes to the CEO on the, right? I'm working on these systems conversions where they were converting from old traditional systems to new digital systems and I would read articles thinking, Oh the bank have benefit from this."
Interviewer,Because you were basically not observing the bank structure.
Cuban,"No, I was a wasn't going through my ..."
Interviewer,You and I know you're a tough a guy.
Cuban,"I just went right to the CEO. I mean it's like no big deal. I mean the whole point when you go to work for somebody I thought was you do all you can to make the company more profitable, no limits and I realize I wasn't going to be a very good employee then."
Interviewer,Was that the moment when you thought I'm going to leave this place?
Cuban,"That was one of many. They basically after I started just doing pretty much what I wanted to do, they kind of shuttled me off and said, OK. Spend sometime here ... and they kind of - and I just quit. I've only been there for nine months and then that's - I went back to Indiana for a little bit back to Bloomington for a little bit of time and then went down to Dallas and the rest is history."
Interviewer,And it is a remarkable history. And you got to Dallas and you got no money still ...
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"You get together with five mates. You're living in this small place, right?"
Cuban,"Well, I mean I had a car, a 1977 Fiat X1/9 with hole on the floorboard where I had to put oil and like every 60 miles and literally I had to be careful not get dizzy and fall asleep because I could see all of the light the road go by in the hole on the floorboard."
Interviewer,You had a rule when you out with the old gang. Nobody could spend more $20.
Cuban,$20. Yeah.
Interviewer,So you'd all go and buy horrible cheap $12 ...
Cuban,"It was great. stuff like that and we walk around like we are moguls, right? We'd walk around with this bottle champagnes, drinking out of champagnes, and P. Diddy thought it was cold drink and say drink it out of the bottle. We were away ahead of the curb because it was cheap and we thought we were cool."
Interviewer,"Having no money, what was that feeling like for you? What did it to you? What did it make you want to be?"
Cuban,"You know, it was no big deal that was - I mean, I had a blast when I was poor but because I always I was always motivated, I was always competitive and so it wasn't like I said, Well, you know, I'm sleeping at the floor ... so that's my motivation. My motivation was always I want to be rich and retire. I want to have all my time. I realized back then that time was my most valuable asset. And I think my dad really drilled into me that you have to appreciate everything in life."
Interviewer,"Your dad was obviously a pivotal figure in your life. When he gave you advice, did he give you advice or was it more the way he conducted at himself?"
Cuban,"A little bit of both. He never gave me business advice. My dad did upholstery on cars. If you had a rip in your car sear, you know, you'd bring it to my dad or he'd go to McDonald's and saw up rips in the upholstery there less denied an accident as he was putting staples into a car seat and he never really never understood business and so it wasn't like I can ask him for business, but he gave me great life advice."
Interviewer,"Going back to Dallas. There you are, you're all living this party life on mega resources and you start to do a few things entrepreneurly. I bet all your mates are doing crazy jobs ..."
Cuban,Right. Right.
Interviewer,... bartending or whatever. Your first dabble into real business is what?
Cuban,Starting a business or working?
Interviewer,You went to work with one where you've got this huge deal. I love this story.
Cuban,Right. Right. Right.
Interviewer,Where you managed to do with deals. You were working with a small business.
Cuban,"Right. So I'm working for this software company and one of my jobs was to come in and sweep the floor and open up the store and so I had closed this deal for $15,000 and with 10 percent commission so I was making $1,500 that was huge."
Interviewer,Huge for you. Life changing.
Cuban,"Enormous, right? And so I called my boss, Michael Humecki and I said, I'm not coming in. I've got Barbara all set to cover opening up the store and sweeping the floor and all that. and he said, No. I need you to come in. and I said, I got a close this deal. My customer is expecting me. and so I went and picked up the check thinking I hand this guy $15,000 check, he's going to love me for it and he fires me. Keep the check."
Interviewer,Why would he fire you?
Cuban,I have no idea. I have no idea.
Interviewer,Did he give any reason?
Cuban,"I don't remember. I don't remember. I, you know, he was a guy that was and I learned a lot from Michael. I learned to do the opposite, right? Because he was really into puppet circumstance, I'm the president, you're not. This is how a president operates. This is what the president wears. He would tell me, you know, You should buy us suit here. This is where it looks good. You should buy clothes there. That's where it looks good."
Interviewer,"And the big deal, the massive one that made you a billionaire. In the build up to that, tell me how you were feeling as a businessman?"
Cuban,"You know, it started when we went public. And so, you know, we started basically the whole streaming industry. We didn't start streaming software but we took it and turned it into a business where we had a million people a day coming in and listening to audio and watching video. We, you know, started doing, you know, the popup videos and the lead videos but, you know, the intro ask before video. We started ..."
Interviewer,"Was there a kind of eureka moment for you personally when you thought, OK. This is how I can become a billionaire.?"
Cuban,"Yeah. So OK, I can tell you a story. Our office was at 2929 Elm Street and we had 15 employees at AudioNet and I remember sitting and talking every we would have people come in around the world from around the work to AudioNet or the site then saying, This is changing my life, I feel like I'm back home. People who were in Korea, in Thailand, the Aleutian Islands would e-mail us or call us and say, Oh my God, this is amazing."
Interviewer,"Were you technically, yourself very, very savvy or ..."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,...or did you just have really smart guy ...
Cuban,"No. No. No, it wasn't me. I sat I've never sit in the second bedroom of my house. I bought ISDN line, a Packard Bell computer for $3,000, a router and I taught myself all the HTML stuff I needed to do to put together the website which wasn't hard to do."
Interviewer,You taught yourself this?
Cuban,"Yeah, but that's easy. That's not a big accomplishment but I ..."
Interviewer,You make it sound easy.
Cuban,"Well, it is. It is."
Interviewer,I couldn't do that.
Cuban,"Yeah, you could. I mean, that wasn't the hard part. The hard part was figuring out how to get streaming to work with an ever growing number of users in an internet infrastructure that didn't support it. And so putting in into servers, connecting the servers, knowing understanding the networking which is what MicroSolutions Company did. We were one of the first Local Area Networking companies in the world."
Interviewer,"Secure that moment, the moment you were naked in front of computer and you become a billionaire what do you do? I hope this is clean, this better be clean."
Cuban,"Again, because at that point in time the market was so crazy I didn't know if it would last."
Interviewer,"If I could say to you, OK, Mark Cuban, I can let you relive the best sex you've ever had in your life or that moment when you're naked in front of your computer watching yourself become a billionaire, which one would you take?"
Cuban,I'm taking the naked in front of the computer every time. Because with that billion dollars I could buy all the great sex I could ever want at the time.
Interviewer,Let's take a short break. Recover up our composure I think and come back and talk more about this. I want to know what happen after you become a billionaire. You started to lead I guess the dream of many billionaires. You go and buy sports teams.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Exactly. Buy fast cars, very hot women, not a lot ..."
Cuban,"Yeah, I loved it."
Interviewer,Do you think it was true to reality?
Cuban,"I think there was some embellishment and I know that because I've talked to some of the characters involved. But I think that at its heart it was very true that once you get going, you know, it's addictive. And it sells people self, and I, you know, it wouldn't surprise me that 90 percent was exactly how it went down."
Interviewer,I interviewed Jordan Belfort recently and he said a very interesting thing about how he's learned morality became chip to him. I want to play you that. Listen to this.
Cuban,"And that was easy, right? It's like when you're a kid someone says, Hey, you want to do a little bit pot? You can make some extra money. And either you say yes or no, right? Particularly when you have no money people are coming up to you and pitching you stuff like that. Just say no, right? Either you kept confidence in your self and you know you can do it the right way or you can't. And so that's never been like temptation for me but I can see it's like in sales we talk about incentives, right? And just managing people and I always talk about, what if you give somebody a Cadillac and say, If you don't hit your goal you lose the Cadillac."
Interviewer,That's a really interesting thing. I haven't heard that before.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is that something you've done with your own style with this?
Cuban,"Yes. Yes, because I want them to give them the incentives upfront because they don't want to lose it, you want to ..."
Interviewer,And do you take away the cars?
Cuban,You have to otherwise you have no credibility.
Interviewer,How do you feel when you do that?
Cuban,"It's like you had your chance, you know, what are we going to do fix it? I don't want to ... MORGAN"
Interviewer,That perhaps have an unobtainable trophy ...
Cuban,"Well it's a multi step process that says, one, I have confidence with you that you can reach these goals. Two, I'm going to put you in a position to succeed. Three, you agreed that I'd put you in a position to succeed. So we're agreeing that this is the reward. And if you don't reach your goals, I'm taking away the reward. Do we all agree on this yes or no? And if the answer is yes, let's do it. So there's not hidden agenda they know it up front."
Interviewer,"And Jordan Belfort when I interviewed him. At the end, he just sold me pen which is seen from the movie with DiCaprio and he sold me a pen. And it was fascinating how he did it. He said he didn't try and over sell me a pen if I didn't really want one. He said he had to identify a need in me, in other words have you thought recently in the last few months about having a pen? And if you get a yes, then he goes into full sales mode."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is that good sales tactic?
Cuban,You always want to put yourself in the shoes of the person you're selling to. That's always what made me successful.
Interviewer,Do you carry a wallet?
Cuban,"Yeah, I carry a wallet."
Interviewer,I asked Warren Buffet. You got any?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,What do you have in it?
Cuban,"It's a good question. I've got some credit cards, a debit card, driver's license, I've got some cards from some folks, I've got my doctor's, I've got my IU alum card, I've got my insurance card. MORGAN"
Interviewer,Not dissimilar to Warren actually. Do all of you billionaires basically have in fact the wallet looked the same. It is like a billionaire wallet club?
Cuban,"Yeah, actually there is, you get it after you learn the handshake. But you know what? I'm always upset because I've never been invited into the Trilateral Commission. You know, I thought I made all this money, I qualify right? I thought the government ..."
Interviewer,"When you see other billionaires, I'm always curious about this, is this like a little billionaire banter, you know, that you guys on?"
Cuban,"It just depends if they're friends or not. So I'll tell you, I've got a buddy and he which I basketball with and he just sold his company and he crossed the billionaire mark. And we just sat down there, had a big old smile I saw him two weeks ago and he was like, I think maybe I should buy a sports to him, all right."
Interviewer,"When people say that money, you know, money won't make you happy."
Cuban,True.
Interviewer,But isn't there an element to that money alleviate one of the life's stresses?
Cuban,It relieves a lot of stress. That's different to make you happy.
Interviewer,Because you've known having no money?
Cuban,"Oh yeah, look..."
Interviewer,"You could be better having it, right?"
Cuban,"Oh, it's always better having, yeah."
Interviewer,But it's not an equivalence for getting happiness?
Cuban,"No. If you are miserable, when you are poor, you're going to be miserable when you're rich because you still have the same issues and the same stresses. You don't like, I've come home, I can't tell you how many times. I've come home with a date and the lights were turned off."
Interviewer,What is the single best thing about being a billionaire?
Cuban,"Just more control your time, more control, you know."
Interviewer,"Well, being alterable or accountable to be?"
Cuban,"That's exactly right. I don't wear a watch. There has been damn good reason for me to wear suit, you know."
Interviewer,This wasn't good enough?
Cuban,"No. It was good, I mean, tennis shoes all the time, right. It's just I have controlled my life and I get, you know. It's so I guess I've been able to tell other people what they need to do and not having to worry about them telling you what to do."
Interviewer,"Let's take a break. Because of course one of the things you do as billionaire was you bought a basketball team, like you did. The Dallas Mavericks. Let's talk about sports when we get back."
Cuban,Sure.
Interviewer,I want to know why sport business is winning. Is it the same in both? I suspect it probably is.
Cuban,"I've been a basketball junk this long. As I can remember, five years old, and the very first season tickets I've ever owned for any team ever were the Dallas Mavericks. And I was a season ticket holder before I bought the team and they were horrible."
Interviewer,She said like Don't call the owner.
Cuban,"Yeah, basically."
Interviewer,How does someone like Mark Cuban make someone offer they can't refuse?
Cuban,"Basically, I said, Would you sell it to me? and he said, Yeah. I said, What's your price and I didn't negotiate. I just wrote in the check."
Interviewer,Right away?
Cuban,Pretty much.
Interviewer,"You just said, Here you are."
Cuban,"I said, Yeah, let's do it and then, you know, he was in the paper works. We had to do the paper work and..."
Interviewer,And no haggling moment?
Cuban,Not really. No.
Interviewer,You just said this is it.
Cuban,"It was the highest price paid for sports team. And he also have to realize that that point in time, I still the stock market was still crazy, right. This was January of 2000. So like like the day before, the stock my Yahoo stock went up enough but to pay for the whole team. And so, it was crazy. And so, I felt a little bit like funding money and I was just like, why not?"
Interviewer,"Has it been everything you hope it would be, owning the Mavericks?"
Cuban,"It's different. It's a lot different. And when I saw it, it would be because I don't really own the team financially own the team, but all of North Texas owns the Dallas Mavericks, you know."
Interviewer,"And lots of issues babbling around big professional sport in America right now, probably the leading one is this issue of gay players both in basketball and football and it will happen to every sport obviously. You know, Jason Collins, obviously a big ground breaking moment there. We've also got this young college player who's come out before he's even made the drop but yet. What is your view generally about this issue and sport in America given that so many people in the sports, themselves, feel so uncomfortable about it?"
Cuban,"If for non-event, no. It actually literally is a non-event. Ever since Jason came out and it was it Robbie who's the MLS player, Robbie Rogers I forget his nickname and were friends is terrible. It's changed with radically how many states now allow gay marriage, you know, and people has become so accepted that it's a non- event and I think it's just in a span of 6, 12, months, it's changed dramatically and so..."
Interviewer,"Even in Arizona, this week, we've seen effort by lawmakers to kind of make it illegal again to just be gay, you know."
Cuban,Right. I think that's crazy.
Interviewer,It was like you have to right to refuse to serve people if you do suspect them for being...
Cuban,"That's the craziness of politics. That's not the real feeling of the population. I mean, I don't you don't just just how we deal with people anymore just changed. I mean, people don't unless you're running for office and you really need to have a strong Republican constituency voting for you. Real people aren't that way. And so, I think we've really come to the point where in the real world and real life, we don't care and that's the beautiful thing to say, you know. And you don't you never run into people. It's not an issue. No one says to me no one has contacted me and say, If you get a gay..."
Interviewer,Is it generational?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,And in a sense anybody over 40 probably still has a slight hang up historically about this?
Cuban,I think it's older than that.
Interviewer,Maybe say 50?
Cuban,Yeah. Because...
Interviewer,"Yeah, and certainly my generation, I don't think why. It's probably 50, right?"
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,And anyone under 50 and certainly under 40...
Cuban,Doesn't care.
Interviewer,... just doesn't really care either ways. CUBAN
Cuban,"Nobody died, didn't, you know, no one got checked out in the shower and had problems, you know. And so, he actually was the perfect guy to change everything."
Interviewer,"What about guns in sport? A lot of NFL players in particular like to have the gun around them. And basketball turn off to a last night's game. The Knicks guard Raymond Felton was arrested on gun charges. And there's been a lot of these stories in the last couple of years. And obviously, I've had a the whole position about gun control probably because I'm not American and therefore don't quite see the culture in the same way, but what about that? What about the fact the sportsman believing they need a gun?"
Cuban,"I think that's anecdotal. I think Raymond, it's unfortunate what happened. I don't really know the guy, but he was stupid, right? You know with at the Mavs, we make a point to ask all of our guys, do you want a gun? Is it registered? What states it is registered? You're not allowed to travel with it no matter what. We prefer you don't carry it in your car no matter what..."
Interviewer,"So, you've implemented your own version of gun control?"
Cuban,"Well, it's not no, I don't want to make it seem like gun control already."
Interviewer,What would you call it? Gun safety regulations?
Cuban,"Gun safety. Yeah, just gun awareness."
Interviewer,Some safety rules.
Cuban,"That's right. We just want to make sure that whatever the rules are for the state we're in, we're following the rules and you're not traveling with it, whatsoever. Now, is it possible that one of my guys might do something that I'm not aware? For sure. You know, when you're dealing with 18 to 35-year olds, it is what it is, right? But as far as I'm concerned, as long as it's registered, as long as they're playing by the rules, as long as you don't travel with it, OK."
Interviewer,"If you took that attitude generally to America, if everyone had that in you, you must save a place."
Cuban,I think so.
Interviewer,And that there's a quite sensible proposals. It's part of the problem calling it gun control. Do a lot of Americans hate that word control?
Cuban,"Yeah, because I think a lot of Americans feel threatened that their rights are being taken away. And gun control of the Second Amendment has become something that we feel intrinsically you have to fight for and I don't think guns are really the issue. I think it's more an issue of where we threatened by government and where do we feel at risk from government. And if you're going to fight back, what better amendment that you get rally behind in the Second Amendment. And so, I don't even think it's about guns. I think it's more about standing out and saying, Look, you're going to have to pry it from my cold, dead hands because I'm protecting the constitution."
Interviewer,Let's take another break. Let's come back and talk about Shark Tank. It's a huge hit.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,You're a huge hit on it. You're terrifying in many ways on that show.
Cuban,"No, not really."
Interviewer,No sharks are going to be fetching to you. And we'll discuss it after.
Cuban,"In your particular case, the Shark Tank is about failing. It's about taking your business to the next level. You're about to talk all of America one of the biggest mistakes sales people make. When they have a deal in front of them, you should just shut up and take the deal."
Interviewer,Hallelujah.
Cuban,Instead of keep on selling and you kept on trying to sell.
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban on ABC's Shark Tank zeroing in on some prey. It looks like he's being totally surprised here. Well, very Mark Cuban. We're also surprised but you were surprised, I mean..."
Cuban,I was shocked.
Interviewer,You're a very confident guy. Everything you touch basically turns to go. CUBAN
Cuban,"But do not necessary that's why I disagree, right? If not, you can't ever think that the people are useless. The beauty of the show..."
Interviewer,As a business person.
Cuban,As a business person.
Interviewer,Can they not be useful?
Cuban,"No, no. Because when you quit your life on the line, if you have the balls to say, you know what, I'm going to start this company. Every single person in this world has that one idea that they think is going to be brilliant and they get call excited and then they do nothing. The fact that they were able to stand up and do something with the idea, so they get credit, right? Now, when they..."
Interviewer,"And you see, a lot of time, I do agree with you. And every time I agree with you, so I remember again, doing America's Got Talent, I can remember they keep, no, I don't really admire you just the stand and they're telling me..."
Cuban,"So, that would be different."
Interviewer,Auntie Nellie said you could sing because you can't...
Cuban,But that that's just putting a...
Interviewer,And my job is to stop this dream dead any...
Cuban,That's what you're thinking.
Interviewer,"... that's just never going to happen. I'm helping them by saying, you can't sing."
Cuban,I don't disagree there. That's the thing.
Interviewer,"So you must have some people with that you think you're no good? How do you link get out of business, don't be something else. CUBAN"
Cuban,"No, you have to do so much just to start that business because you're not getting on the show unless it's a real business. So, unless at least to have a chance. Now, will I crash people? Yes, but not people who are putting good honest effort out there. If they bias me, if they're arrogant, if they're into something that I think is abusive or taking advantage, then I will nail that hell out of them, right? No problem doing that."
Interviewer,What is the kind of idea that you really love?
Cuban,Something that's differentiated. Something that's unique. Something that can grow I think into something that's big. Those are my favorite.
Interviewer,What is the kind of idea that you really love?
Cuban,"Something that's differentiated, something that's unique, something that can grow, I think, into something that's big. Those are my favorites."
Interviewer,"What kind of thing over the years, if you feel yeah, that that talk the shows about?"
Cuban,SURFSET Fitness is a perfect example. So this company comes in and once the former and the other his girlfriend and he wanted away to workout and also learn how to surf out of New Hampshire. We're going to learn to surf in New Hampshire in the winter.
Interviewer,"Talking about left field, you're dancing?"
Cuban,That's far out of left field.
Interviewer,You know what?
Cuban,That's what they took to shut me down.
Interviewer,You know why I'd like watching you on that show because it made me feel better about my dance.
Cuban,"I can't believe. Hey, I just have my hip replaced."
Interviewer,You know? You want that.
Cuban,I had my hip replaced.
Interviewer,Jerry Springer was a lot worse than you.
Cuban,"Oh there's a lot, lot worse than me."
Interviewer,And I love Jerry but I have to discuss this with you.
Cuban,"So, right there is doing the waltz whenever it was. I just have my hip replaced and so I was like, Please stay on one piece, please stay on one piece. And then, I do this jump at the end and then I landed and I didn't fall apart. And I was fired up. So, it was a more of victory."
Interviewer,"Do you have even now, Mark, do you get, you know, those moments when you wake up in the morning, you know, late at night and some and an incredible idea comes to you?"
Cuban,Yeah. I hate it now. I hate it because I have so much going on that I don't have...
Interviewer,Giving the time.
Cuban,"Yeah. I don't have that piece of dinner. It really takes a special motivation just to say, I don't give a damn, I'm going for it right. And you can't see bearers. People always say, You're such a risk taker. I have to take a risk. You know, I do the preparation, I do the work, and then when you're prepared, you can bust through to any wall."
Interviewer,And you're a father?
Cuban,"Yeah, that's makes it all."
Interviewer,Let's take a break and talk about fatherhood.
Cuban,Sure.
Interviewer,I want to know what kind of dad you are. I suspect you're a smiling assassin.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Son, I fully support you, son, if you come first."
Cuban,Exactly.
Interviewer,I'll ask him about winning in sports.
Cuban,"I said, Would you sell the team? he said, Yeah. I said, What's your price? and I didn't negotiate."
Interviewer,Winning in business.
Cuban,It wasn't about how much money I had. It was about how hard can I work and what can I accomplish.
Interviewer,And what it takes to make it big on Shark Tank.
Cuban,"I want it to sink on you very, very hard. So it just reverberates through your whole body. What was my last question to you?"
Interviewer,"Would I take the 90,000 for 40 percent?"
Cuban,"You had a chance to close, didn't you?"
Interviewer,"Tonight, Mark Cuban for the hour and Mark Cuban was a man who wears many hats, the Dallas Mavericks owner, acts as TV chairman even Shark Tank investor. There's a lot to talk about tonight. And Mark joins me exclusively. Welcome to you."
Cuban,"Thanks, Piers."
Interviewer,"Let me start with you. Now, I watched you last night and there's this amazing moment, you know, there's your team beating the Knicks in the last second, it was a typical kind of Cubanesque movement. And I thought there this guy who - when you were at 19, 20, you didn't have a dime to rub between you, right? And there you are the billionaire owner of a basketball team beating the Knicks in their own backyard. What did that moment feel like for you?"
Cuban,"It's amazing. I mean, that's one of the beauties of owning a sports team when you get to run out the court, you know, and there's a buzzer beater jumping up and down with everybody else and the cops aren't chasing you. So, it's surreal. I mean, it's an amazing feeling."
Interviewer,Do you pinch yourself sometimes?
Cuban,"Everyday. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I'll just look around and my family and, you know, just everything that's going on and just it's crazy. It's amazing and I try to never take it for granted."
Interviewer,"Your story is extraordinary, Mark, because you go back, you were living in Pittsburgh, your first job was working in a bank, the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh ..."
Cuban,In Pittsburgh. Yeah.
Interviewer,"... and the real young you realize that this sort of bank structure, the hierarchy is limiting."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Tell me how you dealt with that.
Cuban,"I got a job working at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh and I would send notes to the CEO on the, right? I'm working on these systems conversions where they were converting from old traditional systems to new digital systems and I would read articles thinking, Oh the bank have benefit from this."
Interviewer,Because you were basically not observing the bank structure.
Cuban,"No, I was a wasn't going through my ..."
Interviewer,You and I know you're a tough a guy.
Cuban,"I just went right to the CEO. I mean it's like no big deal. I mean the whole point when you go to work for somebody I thought was you do all you can to make the company more profitable, no limits and I realize I wasn't going to be a very good employee then."
Interviewer,Was that the moment when you thought I'm going to leave this place?
Cuban,"That was one of many. They basically after I started just doing pretty much what I wanted to do, they kind of shuttled me off and said, OK. Spend sometime here ... and they kind of - and I just quit. I've only been there for nine months and then that's - I went back to Indiana for a little bit back to Bloomington for a little bit of time and then went down to Dallas and the rest is history."
Interviewer,And it is a remarkable history. And you got to Dallas and you got no money still ...
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"You get together with five mates. You're living in this small place, right?"
Cuban,"Well, I mean I had a car, a 1977 Fiat X1/9 with hole on the floorboard where I had to put oil and like every 60 miles and literally I had to be careful not get dizzy and fall asleep because I could see all of the light the road go by in the hole on the floorboard."
Interviewer,You had a rule when you out with the old gang. Nobody could spend more $20.
Cuban,$20. Yeah.
Interviewer,So you'd all go and buy horrible cheap $12 ...
Cuban,"It was great. stuff like that and we walk around like we are moguls, right? We'd walk around with this bottle champagnes, drinking out of champagnes, and P. Diddy thought it was cold drink and say drink it out of the bottle. We were away ahead of the curb because it was cheap and we thought we were cool."
Interviewer,"Having no money, what was that feeling like for you? What did it to you? What did it make you want to be?"
Cuban,"You know, it was no big deal that was - I mean, I had a blast when I was poor but because I always I was always motivated, I was always competitive and so it wasn't like I said, Well, you know, I'm sleeping at the floor ... so that's my motivation. My motivation was always I want to be rich and retire. I want to have all my time. I realized back then that time was my most valuable asset. And I think my dad really drilled into me that you have to appreciate everything in life."
Interviewer,"Your dad was obviously a pivotal figure in your life. When he gave you advice, did he give you advice or was it more the way he conducted at himself?"
Cuban,"A little bit of both. He never gave me business advice. My dad did upholstery on cars. If you had a rip in your car sear, you know, you'd bring it to my dad or he'd go to McDonald's and saw up rips in the upholstery there less denied an accident as he was putting staples into a car seat and he never really never understood business and so it wasn't like I can ask him for business, but he gave me great life advice."
Interviewer,"Going back to Dallas. There you are, you're all living this party life on mega resources and you start to do a few things entrepreneurly. I bet all your mates are doing crazy jobs ..."
Cuban,Right. Right.
Interviewer,... bartending or whatever. Your first dabble into real business is what?
Cuban,Starting a business or working?
Interviewer,You went to work with one where you've got this huge deal. I love this story.
Cuban,Right. Right. Right.
Interviewer,Where you managed to do with deals. You were working with a small business.
Cuban,"Right. So I'm working for this software company and one of my jobs was to come in and sweep the floor and open up the store and so I had closed this deal for $15,000 and with 10 percent commission so I was making $1,500 that was huge."
Interviewer,Huge for you. Life changing.
Cuban,"Enormous, right? And so I called my boss, Michael Humecki and I said, I'm not coming in. I've got Barbara all set to cover opening up the store and sweeping the floor and all that. and he said, No. I need you to come in. and I said, I got a close this deal. My customer is expecting me. and so I went and picked up the check thinking I hand this guy $15,000 check, he's going to love me for it and he fires me. Keep the check."
Interviewer,Why would he fire you?
Cuban,I have no idea. I have no idea.
Interviewer,Did he give any reason?
Cuban,"I don't remember. I don't remember. I, you know, he was a guy that was and I learned a lot from Michael. I learned to do the opposite, right? Because he was really into puppet circumstance, I'm the president, you're not. This is how a president operates. This is what the president wears. He would tell me, you know, You should buy us suit here. This is where it looks good. You should buy clothes there. That's where it looks good."
Interviewer,"And the big deal, the massive one that made you a billionaire. In the build up to that, tell me how you were feeling as a businessman?"
Cuban,"You know, it started when we went public. And so, you know, we started basically the whole streaming industry. We didn't start streaming software but we took it and turned it into a business where we had a million people a day coming in and listening to audio and watching video. We, you know, started doing, you know, the popup videos and the lead videos but, you know, the intro ask before video. We started ..."
Interviewer,"Was there a kind of eureka moment for you personally when you thought, OK. This is how I can become a billionaire.?"
Cuban,"Yeah. So OK, I can tell you a story. Our office was at 2929 Elm Street and we had 15 employees at AudioNet and I remember sitting and talking every we would have people come in around the world from around the work to AudioNet or the site then saying, This is changing my life, I feel like I'm back home. People who were in Korea, in Thailand, the Aleutian Islands would e-mail us or call us and say, Oh my God, this is amazing."
Interviewer,"Were you technically, yourself very, very savvy or ..."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,...or did you just have really smart guy ...
Cuban,"No. No. No, it wasn't me. I sat I've never sit in the second bedroom of my house. I bought ISDN line, a Packard Bell computer for $3,000, a router and I taught myself all the HTML stuff I needed to do to put together the website which wasn't hard to do."
Interviewer,You taught yourself this?
Cuban,"Yeah, but that's easy. That's not a big accomplishment but I ..."
Interviewer,You make it sound easy.
Cuban,"Well, it is. It is."
Interviewer,I couldn't do that.
Cuban,"Yeah, you could. I mean, that wasn't the hard part. The hard part was figuring out how to get streaming to work with an ever growing number of users in an internet infrastructure that didn't support it. And so putting in into servers, connecting the servers, knowing understanding the networking which is what MicroSolutions Company did. We were one of the first Local Area Networking companies in the world."
Interviewer,"Secure that moment, the moment you were naked in front of computer and you become a billionaire what do you do? I hope this is clean, this better be clean."
Cuban,"Again, because at that point in time the market was so crazy I didn't know if it would last."
Interviewer,"If I could say to you, OK, Mark Cuban, I can let you relive the best sex you've ever had in your life or that moment when you're naked in front of your computer watching yourself become a billionaire, which one would you take?"
Cuban,I'm taking the naked in front of the computer every time. Because with that billion dollars I could buy all the great sex I could ever want at the time.
Interviewer,Let's take a short break. Recover up our composure I think and come back and talk more about this. I want to know what happen after you become a billionaire. You started to lead I guess the dream of many billionaires. You go and buy sports teams.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Exactly. Buy fast cars, very hot women, not a lot ..."
Cuban,"Yeah, I loved it."
Interviewer,Do you think it was true to reality?
Cuban,"I think there was some embellishment and I know that because I've talked to some of the characters involved. But I think that at its heart it was very true that once you get going, you know, it's addictive. And it sells people self, and I, you know, it wouldn't surprise me that 90 percent was exactly how it went down."
Interviewer,"I interviewed Jordan Belfort recently and he said a very interesting thing about how he's learned morality became chip to him. I want to play you that. Listen to this. JORDAN BELFORT, THE REAL-LIFE WOLF OF WALL STREET"
Cuban,"And that was easy, right? It's like when you're a kid someone says, Hey, you want to do a little bit pot? You can make some extra money. And either you say yes or no, right? Particularly when you have no money people are coming up to you and pitching you stuff like that. Just say no, right? Either you kept confidence in your self and you know you can do it the right way or you can't. And so that's never been like temptation for me but I can see it's like in sales we talk about incentives, right? And just managing people and I always talk about, what if you give somebody a Cadillac and say, If you don't hit your goal you lose the Cadillac."
Interviewer,That's a really interesting thing. I haven't heard that before.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is that something you've done with your own style with this?
Cuban,"Yes. Yes, because I want them to give them the incentives upfront because they don't want to lose it, you want to ..."
Interviewer,And do you take away the cars?
Cuban,You have to otherwise you have no credibility.
Interviewer,How do you feel when you do that?
Cuban,"It's like you had your chance, you know, what are we going to do fix it? I don't want to ... MORGAN"
Interviewer,That perhaps have an unobtainable trophy ...
Cuban,"Well it's a multi step process that says, one, I have confidence with you that you can reach these goals. Two, I'm going to put you in a position to succeed. Three, you agreed that I'd put you in a position to succeed. So we're agreeing that this is the reward. And if you don't reach your goals, I'm taking away the reward. Do we all agree on this yes or no? And if the answer is yes, let's do it. So there's not hidden agenda they know it up front."
Interviewer,"And Jordan Belfort when I interviewed him. At the end, he just sold me pen which is seen from the movie with DiCaprio and he sold me a pen. And it was fascinating how he did it. He said he didn't try and over sell me a pen if I didn't really want one. He said he had to identify a need in me, in other words have you thought recently in the last few months about having a pen? And if you get a yes, then he goes into full sales mode."
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is that good sales tactic?
Cuban,You always want to put yourself in the shoes of the person you're selling to. That's always what made me successful.
Interviewer,Do you carry a wallet?
Cuban,"Yeah, I carry a wallet."
Interviewer,I asked Warren Buffet. You got any?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,What do you have in it?
Cuban,"It's a good question. I've got some credit cards, a debit card, driver's license, I've got some cards from some folks, I've got my doctor's, I've got my IU alum card, I've got my insurance card. MORGAN"
Interviewer,Not dissimilar to Warren actually. Do all of you billionaires basically have in fact the wallet looked the same. It is like a billionaire wallet club?
Cuban,"Yeah, actually there is, you get it after you learn the handshake. But you know what? I'm always upset because I've never been invited into the Trilateral Commission. You know, I thought I made all this money, I qualify right? I thought the government ..."
Interviewer,"When you see other billionaires, I'm always curious about this, is this like a little billionaire banter, you know, that you guys on?"
Cuban,"It just depends if they're friends or not. So I'll tell you, I've got a buddy and he which I basketball with and he just sold his company and he crossed the billionaire mark. And we just sat down there, had a big old smile I saw him two weeks ago and he was like, I think maybe I should buy a sports to him, all right."
Interviewer,"When people say that money, you know, money won't make you happy."
Cuban,True.
Interviewer,But isn't there an element to that money alleviate one of the life's stresses?
Cuban,It relieves a lot of stress. That's different to make you happy.
Interviewer,Because you've known having no money?
Cuban,"Oh yeah, look..."
Interviewer,"You could be better having it, right?"
Cuban,"Oh, it's always better having, yeah."
Interviewer,But it's not an equivalence for getting happiness?
Cuban,"No. If you are miserable, when you are poor, you're going to be miserable when you're rich because you still have the same issues and the same stresses. You don't like, I've come home, I can't tell you how many times. I've come home with a date and the lights were turned off."
Interviewer,What is the single best thing about being a billionaire?
Cuban,"Just more control your time, more control, you know."
Interviewer,"Well, being alterable or accountable to be?"
Cuban,"That's exactly right. I don't wear a watch. There has been damn good reason for me to wear suit, you know."
Interviewer,This wasn't good enough?
Cuban,"No. It was good, I mean, tennis shoes all the time, right. It's just I have controlled my life and I get, you know. It's so I guess I've been able to tell other people what they need to do and not having to worry about them telling you what to do."
Interviewer,"Let's take a break. Because of course one of the things you do as billionaire was you bought a basketball team, like you did. The Dallas Mavericks. Let's talk about sports when we get back."
Cuban,Sure.
Interviewer,I want to know why sport business is winning. Is it the same in both? I suspect it probably is.
Cuban,"I've been a basketball junk this long. As I can remember, five years old, and the very first season tickets I've ever owned for any team ever were the Dallas Mavericks. And I was a season ticket holder before I bought the team and they were horrible."
Interviewer,She said like Don't call the owner.
Cuban,"Yeah, basically."
Interviewer,How does someone like Mark Cuban make someone offer they can't refuse?
Cuban,"Basically, I said, Would you sell it to me? and he said, Yeah. I said, What's your price and I didn't negotiate. I just wrote in the check."
Interviewer,Right away?
Cuban,Pretty much.
Interviewer,"You just said, Here you are."
Cuban,"I said, Yeah, let's do it and then, you know, he was in the paper works. We had to do the paper work and..."
Interviewer,And no haggling moment?
Cuban,Not really. No.
Interviewer,You just said this is it.
Cuban,"It was the highest price paid for sports team. And he also have to realize that that point in time, I still the stock market was still crazy, right. This was January of 2000. So like like the day before, the stock my Yahoo stock went up enough but to pay for the whole team. And so, it was crazy. And so, I felt a little bit like funding money and I was just like, why not?"
Interviewer,"Has it been everything you hope it would be, owning the Mavericks?"
Cuban,"It's different. It's a lot different. And when I saw it, it would be because I don't really own the team financially own the team, but all of North Texas owns the Dallas Mavericks, you know."
Interviewer,"And lots of issues babbling around big professional sport in America right now, probably the leading one is this issue of gay players both in basketball and football and it will happen to every sport obviously. You know, Jason Collins, obviously a big ground breaking moment there. We've also got this young college player who's come out before he's even made the drop but yet. What is your view generally about this issue and sport in America given that so many people in the sports, themselves, feel so uncomfortable about it?"
Cuban,"If for non-event, no. It actually literally is a non-event. Ever since Jason came out and it was it Robbie who's the MLS player, Robbie Rogers I forget his nickname and were friends is terrible. It's changed with radically how many states now allow gay marriage, you know, and people has become so accepted that it's a non- event and I think it's just in a span of 6, 12, months, it's changed dramatically and so..."
Interviewer,"Even in Arizona, this week, we've seen effort by lawmakers to kind of make it illegal again to just be gay, you know."
Cuban,Right. I think that's crazy.
Interviewer,It was like you have to right to refuse to serve people if you do suspect them for being...
Cuban,"That's the craziness of politics. That's not the real feeling of the population. I mean, I don't you don't just just how we deal with people anymore just changed. I mean, people don't unless you're running for office and you really need to have a strong Republican constituency voting for you. Real people aren't that way. And so, I think we've really come to the point where in the real world and real life, we don't care and that's the beautiful thing to say, you know. And you don't you never run into people. It's not an issue. No one says to me no one has contacted me and say, If you get a gay..."
Interviewer,Is it generational?
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,And in a sense anybody over 40 probably still has a slight hang up historically about this?
Cuban,I think it's older than that.
Interviewer,Maybe say 50?
Cuban,Yeah. Because...
Interviewer,"Yeah, and certainly my generation, I don't think why. It's probably 50, right?"
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,And anyone under 50 and certainly under 40...
Cuban,Doesn't care.
Interviewer,... just doesn't really care either ways. CUBAN
Cuban,"Nobody died, didn't, you know, no one got checked out in the shower and had problems, you know. And so, he actually was the perfect guy to change everything."
Interviewer,"What about guns in sport? A lot of NFL players in particular like to have the gun around them. And basketball turn off to a last night's game. The Knicks guard Raymond Felton was arrested on gun charges. And there's been a lot of these stories in the last couple of years. And obviously, I've had a the whole position about gun control probably because I'm not American and therefore don't quite see the culture in the same way, but what about that? What about the fact the sportsman believing they need a gun?"
Cuban,"I think that's anecdotal. I think Raymond, it's unfortunate what happened. I don't really know the guy, but he was stupid, right? You know with at the Mavs, we make a point to ask all of our guys, do you want a gun? Is it registered? What states it is registered? You're not allowed to travel with it no matter what. We prefer you don't carry it in your car no matter what..."
Interviewer,"So, you've implemented your own version of gun control?"
Cuban,"Well, it's not no, I don't want to make it seem like gun control already."
Interviewer,What would you call it? Gun safety regulations?
Cuban,"Gun safety. Yeah, just gun awareness."
Interviewer,Some safety rules.
Cuban,"That's right. We just want to make sure that whatever the rules are for the state we're in, we're following the rules and you're not traveling with it, whatsoever. Now, is it possible that one of my guys might do something that I'm not aware? For sure. You know, when you're dealing with 18 to 35-year olds, it is what it is, right? But as far as I'm concerned, as long as it's registered, as long as they're playing by the rules, as long as you don't travel with it, OK."
Interviewer,"If you took that attitude generally to America, if everyone had that in you, you must save a place."
Cuban,I think so.
Interviewer,And that there's a quite sensible proposals. It's part of the problem calling it gun control. Do a lot of Americans hate that word control?
Cuban,"Yeah, because I think a lot of Americans feel threatened that their rights are being taken away. And gun control of the Second Amendment has become something that we feel intrinsically you have to fight for and I don't think guns are really the issue. I think it's more an issue of where we threatened by government and where do we feel at risk from government. And if you're going to fight back, what better amendment that you get rally behind in the Second Amendment. And so, I don't even think it's about guns. I think it's more about standing out and saying, Look, you're going to have to pry it from my cold, dead hands because I'm protecting the constitution."
Interviewer,Let's take another break. Let's come back and talk about Shark Tank. It's a huge hit.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,You're a huge hit on it. You're terrifying in many ways on that show.
Cuban,"No, not really."
Interviewer,No sharks are going to be fetching to you. And we'll discuss it after.
Cuban,"In your particular case, the Shark Tank is about failing. It's about taking your business to the next level. You're about to talk all of America one of the biggest mistakes sales people make. When they have a deal in front of them, you should just shut up and take the deal."
Interviewer,Hallelujah.
Cuban,Instead of keep on selling and you kept on trying to sell.
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban on ABC's Shark Tank zeroing in on some prey. It looks like he's being totally surprised here. Well, very Mark Cuban. We're also surprised but you were surprised, I mean..."
Cuban,I was shocked.
Interviewer,You're a very confident guy. Everything you touch basically turns to go. CUBAN
Cuban,"But do not necessary that's why I disagree, right? If not, you can't ever think that the people are useless. The beauty of the show..."
Interviewer,As a business person.
Cuban,As a business person.
Interviewer,Can they not be useful?
Cuban,"No, no. Because when you quit your life on the line, if you have the balls to say, you know what, I'm going to start this company. Every single person in this world has that one idea that they think is going to be brilliant and they get call excited and then they do nothing. The fact that they were able to stand up and do something with the idea, so they get credit, right? Now, when they..."
Interviewer,"And you see, a lot of time, I do agree with you. And every time I agree with you, so I remember again, doing America's Got Talent, I can remember they keep, no, I don't really admire you just the stand and they're telling me..."
Cuban,"So, that would be different."
Interviewer,Auntie Nellie said you could sing because you can't...
Cuban,But that that's just putting a...
Interviewer,And my job is to stop this dream dead any...
Cuban,That's what you're thinking.
Interviewer,"... that's just never going to happen. I'm helping them by saying, you can't sing."
Cuban,I don't disagree there. That's the thing.
Interviewer,"So you must have some people with that you think you're no good? How do you link get out of business, don't be something else. CUBAN"
Cuban,"No, you have to do so much just to start that business because you're not getting on the show unless it's a real business. So, unless at least to have a chance. Now, will I crash people? Yes, but not people who are putting good honest effort out there. If they bias me, if they're arrogant, if they're into something that I think is abusive or taking advantage, then I will nail that hell out of them, right? No problem doing that."
Interviewer,What is the kind of idea that you really love?
Cuban,Something that's differentiated. Something that's unique. Something that can grow I think into something that's big. Those are my favorite.
Interviewer,What is the kind of idea that you really love?
Cuban,"Something that's differentiated, something that's unique, something that can grow, I think, into something that's big. Those are my favorites."
Interviewer,"What kind of thing over the years, if you feel yeah, that that talk the shows about?"
Cuban,SURFSET Fitness is a perfect example. So this company comes in and once the former and the other his girlfriend and he wanted away to workout and also learn how to surf out of New Hampshire. We're going to learn to surf in New Hampshire in the winter.
Interviewer,"Talking about left field, you're dancing?"
Cuban,That's far out of left field.
Interviewer,You know what?
Cuban,That's what they took to shut me down.
Interviewer,You know why I'd like watching you on that show because it made me feel better about my dance.
Cuban,"I can't believe. Hey, I just have my hip replaced."
Interviewer,You know? You want that.
Cuban,I had my hip replaced.
Interviewer,Jerry Springer was a lot worse than you.
Cuban,"Oh there's a lot, lot worse than me."
Interviewer,And I love Jerry but I have to discuss this with you.
Cuban,"So, right there is doing the waltz whenever it was. I just have my hip replaced and so I was like, Please stay on one piece, please stay on one piece. And then, I do this jump at the end and then I landed and I didn't fall apart. And I was fired up. So, it was a more of victory."
Interviewer,"Do you have even now, Mark, do you get, you know, those moments when you wake up in the morning, you know, late at night and some and an incredible idea comes to you?"
Cuban,Yeah. I hate it now. I hate it because I have so much going on that I don't have...
Interviewer,Giving the time.
Cuban,"Yeah. I don't have that piece of dinner. It really takes a special motivation just to say, I don't give a damn, I'm going for it right. And you can't see bearers. People always say, You're such a risk taker. I have to take a risk. You know, I do the preparation, I do the work, and then when you're prepared, you can bust through to any wall."
Interviewer,And you're a father?
Cuban,"Yeah, that's makes it all."
Interviewer,Let's take a break and talk about fatherhood.
Cuban,Sure.
Interviewer,I want to know what kind of dad you are. I suspect you're a smiling assassin.
Cuban,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Son, I fully support you, son, if you come first."
Cuban,Exactly.
Interviewer,"The right of passage in the Cuban family, taking Jakers to his very first baseball game, right Jake? Yeah, that's good. Take off your tongue."
Cuban,"I do, too. I do, too."
Interviewer,Let's make some think about money and why it doesn't involve entitlement.
Cuban,"And that, you know, my daughter came home not long ago and she said, Dad, I'm mad because one of my friends came up with a business idea before I did. And so, you got to help me come up with a business idea now. And she was all excited then. You know, like any 10-year old, she got off and heard she was distracted, so get back on it."
Interviewer,"I've avoided politics too much because I think it's it can be quite tedious and then as good as somebody like you, but on a widen note, leadership seems to be in a vague form of paralysis in Washington generally in the moment. When you look at as an American, what is the answer to get through all this?"
Cuban,"I think we're in a transitional time. I mean, in an arrow where social media has changed, how media in general, right. It used to be there are three networks and there were seven networks, and then as long as you communicated through them, you can reach everybody. Now, people don't read the newspaper. They don't all watch the same news show. They, you know, there's the old saying that, If it's important to me, it will find me."
Interviewer,"It struck me that probably most people in Washington when they heard, what's that being sold in $19,000 billion. What is that?"
Cuban,Right.
Interviewer,"And be how can that be worth that money? I guess you or other people going, that probably quite shaky..."
Cuban,Yeah. I mean it makes...
Interviewer,...right?
Cuban,"... perfect sense, right."
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"So in one hand, you have a..."
Interviewer,Because you're familiar with that medium and how it will work.
Cuban,"And I use the app, right. I mean, look, if you're going to keep up with what's happening in the world today, if you're going to try to be a leader, if you're going to try have any impact on society, business, politics, wherever it may be, if you're not keeping up with what's going on from a technical perspective, you lost because, you know, the world isn't going to be run by people who control metal anymore."
Interviewer,"Why not put one in else's Snapchat, clearly because all my kids love it and like I'll tell all my friends."
Cuban,"It's interesting. So Snapchat is becoming a little social network. You know, I had all my problems wit the SCC and everything and so, I'm gearing people towards the zero footprint life, whether it's my kids, my business associates."
Interviewer,Right. Exactly right.
Cuban,"You know, after the conversation, it's gone. And I think the same things happen with text. That's why I wrote Cyber Dust. That's why I think everybody's mode of communication is going to change. And WhatsApp, one, they get app example, Cyber Chats and other so, I mean, Snapchat, Cyber Dust, it's only going to happen more and more."
Interviewer,"Well when we come back, I'll talk to you about the future. You only got it. You got the brain full of this, kind of thing."
Cuban,"I got two of them. I have my Samsung Note 3 which I like because it's big. I type, I get a thousand e-mails a day so let's me respond. And then I've got my back up phone, the iPhone, which I like because there's just certain apps that are only on the iPhone like Cyber Dust right now. Cycloramic everywhere. So there's all kinds of cool stuff. You got to keep up with everything."
Interviewer,You're a Mac guy or a PC?
Cuban,"All of the above. I mean I try to learn everything. I've got a Windows Surface Tablet. I've got a Mac. I've got a PC. You know, whatever it is. If I'm going to stay ahead, you know, there's always some 12-year old trying to kick my ass."
Interviewer,Go for it.
Cuban,And I've got to stay ahead.
Interviewer,I do have 15-year old kid. He was kicking my ass on the show. He was brilliant. Smart guy. CUBAN
Cuban,"Sensors and personalized medicine. It's not even close. Right now, we put everything into Google and expect to respond. Those days are disappearing. There's going to be sensors on our skin. I've got companies I'm investing in that literally put a little patch on and it tracks from the moisture, from the perspiration, and from the heat, just all these different things that proactively tell."
Interviewer,Amazing.
Cuban,Yeah. It will be totally different.
Interviewer,"What should I do brag, Mark Cuban?"
Cuban,Yeah. Whatever.
Interviewer,It's been great to talk to you.
Cuban,Always fun.
Interviewer,"Your book, How to Win at the Sport of Business"
Cuban,Really enjoyed it.
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban, remarkable man. That's all for us tonight."
Cuban,"I do, too. I do, too."

Cuban,Always fun.
Interviewer,"Your book, How to Win at the Sport of Business"
Cuban,Really enjoyed it.
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban, remarkable man. That's all for us tonight."
Cuban,There you go (laughs).
Interviewer,"That's well said, Skip. This is the shark tank and we want to start by finding out what is your, you may have more than one, but what's your biggest issue with Skip?"
Cuban,"It's not just Skip. Its sportswriters and sports media in general, where everything is generalities, right? ""Excruciating pressure"", what the hell is that, right? You know, ""need leader""."
Interviewer,It was excruciating pressure....
Cuban,Meaning what?
Interviewer,"Meaning that you personally watched up close and personally what Lebron went through against your Dallas Mavericks, and was it not the biggest collapse of a superstar we've ever witnessed on a finals or championship stage?"
Cuban,"No, I mean first of all its a team game. Right? You guys like to talk in complete generalities where no one can question you, right? You don't ever use facts, you don't ever use substance."
Interviewer,I don't ever use facts? That's all I use on this show.
Cuban,"""Excruciating pressure""? ""Undeniable"" this, it's just all generalities."
Interviewer,There's never been a star under more pressure going into a finals or championship series or game than Lebron James is under after nine years and three league MVPs.
Cuban,"First of all, you have a presumption that people care what you say. They don't. When guys."
Interviewer,That's fine. That's your opinion.
Cuban,"No, no, I'm talking about media in general. When guys get ready to play and they're in the locker room, they're not thinking ok well what's written, what's going to be written, what's being said, I mean, they're getting prepared. And if you've got a good coach and you've got a good culture, then guys are ready to play no matter what,like you guys were just talking about, you know, ""Miami just wanted more last night,"" that is just such horse-you-know-what, right. It's not that Okalhoma City didn't want it more, I think Miami was better prepared to play the game than Oklahoma City in terms of adjustments and changes, and now if you want to talk about double-teams and how they were used and whtether they should have played zone, um, what defensive structure was in place, that's a valid conversation. But just saying ""they wanted it more,"" that's ridiculous."
Interviewer,Ok.
Cuban,"When you're Kevin Durant, or yo'ure, uh, Derek Fisher, and you're Russell Westbrook, etc, and you're at that close out game, there's nobody who wants it more. It's just a question of who executes better and then you decide why."
Interviewer,"Who played harder? in the last games. Miami did, every game.. Lebron played harder than Kevin Durant did four straight games."
Cuban,"That is the most ridiculous thing any sportswriter has ever said. Now, if you think when Kevin Durant walked off the court he thought, yeah, I didn't play quite hard enough, right? Now you can say he wasn't put in a position to succeed, you can say they didn't run the right plays, they didn't get the ball to him on the block enough. And if you were smart you'd come out and you'd have substance. You'd say you know what, this is how many plays they ran to him on the block. Here's how Miami defended it. Now you can also argue the Pat Riley way is always the same way, all the time. Miami played it the same way all the time, and then we can have a discussion about adjustments. like last year, did we play harder than the Heat, is that what you think it was?"
Interviewer,"No, I don't. I think Lebron disappeared, and shrank in crunch time of the fourth quarter. I can just show you the numbers of what he didn't do in every fourth quarter."
Cuban,Wo we get no credit for not putting him in a position to succeed. RIght. We played the Heat.
Interviewer,"He put himself in, all he did was stand out on the perimeter."
Cuban,Now how do you think we defended that? WHy do you think he was standing out there?
Interviewer,"Uh, uh, you didn't have to defend him."
Cuban,"Oh right, so no matter what we did, he was just going to stand there and do nothing?"
Interviewer,That's all I saw. That was a lot of it.
Cuban,"That's exactly right, ""that's all you saw.""."
Interviewer,Hope that Dwyane Wade saves the day for him.
Cuban,"You're exactly right. That's all you saw. You didn't look. Right? I mean, that's a complete insult to us, to say you know what, the adjustments that we made-."
Interviewer,What did you do to force him out there?
Cuban,"We had different, we had like six, seven different types of matchups in our zone, and we played man-to-man, and we had a variety of different switches, right? So we knew that ninety percent of the shots were going to come from the left-hand side, right. We knew that if you gave him room from the left, he was going to drive. We didn't have the ahtletes that oklahoma city did, so we had to plan differently-."
Interviewer,Sure-.
Cuban,"So we need to make sure we pushed him out, away, and that we gave him different looks every time he had the ball, because just making, just forcing him to make a decision, to think about what he had to do, taking the time to read, are we in a zone, what type of zone we in, how are we matching up, what kind of rotations are we in, making him think forced him to pass around the perimeter, which gave us a chance to adjust. Now they're smarter, they're a better team this year, they deserved to win this year, but you know, that's the way we played it. So it wasn't just Lebron. Lebron actually played it right more often than not. He made the right pass to the right guy, who didn't make the right play. And that's exactly what we wanted"
Interviewer,They had several Steve Kerrs.
Cuban,"They had everybody stepping up and they deserved every bit. You know, so you talk in generalities."
Interviewer,No I'm not.
Cuban,"Yeah, you are."
Interviewer,"You spewed out some generality about players don't care. Let me tell you for a fact, and you can verify this, Stephen A, Lebron James listened to what I said for about, what, eight years? Because that's all I heard. He said I was his Howard Cosell. (Cuban smiles). And this year for the first time to his credit, he tuned out all the noise, that's all we saw was, he's reading The Hunger Games trilogy before the games. He's meditating on the bench before the games. He tuned us out."
Cuban,This is a Skip Bayless special. Lebron lost last year because he was paying attention to Skip Bayless. Lebron won this year because he wasn't paying-.
Interviewer,No.
Cuban,That's what you just said. Did he not just say that? (laughs).
Interviewer,"Here's what he didn't do against you guys. He let you off the hook, because he didn't do what we saw him do for four straight games. He didn't drive through your zone, and slash it up and dish. He didn't post up at all. This was a new deal, this was a new post-up game we saw this year from Lebron. He shredded the Oklahoma City defense because he drove and he dished."
Cuban,Ok. What kind of defense-.
Interviewer,He wanted to be a pretty jump shooter against you guys and it played right into your hands because he's a below-average jump shooter from the perimeter.
Cuban,"Ok, Skip, so when he was on the post, what were the different defensive schemes that Oklahoma City ran last night?"
Interviewer,"They had, they used Sefolosha on him, they used Durant on him-."
Cuban,When he was in the post what were the different defensive schemes they used?
Interviewer,Ibaka was supposed to come hard.
Cuban,Was supposed to come hard?
Interviewer,"And he did not come hard, he let Lebron get to the rim repeatedly, and Perkins was nowhere to be seen."
Cuban,I just asked a simple question.
Interviewer,And I just told you.
Cuban,"No, you said ""so and so was supposed to... ,"" no they, they doubled from down, right, and they doubled, and they passed and they hit their shots, when they kept on doubling, they changed, right, because they passed it out and Mike Miller hit the open shot. But that's just one example."
Interviewer,Did he get in the lane against you guys last year? Not at all in the fourth quarter.
Cuban,"Why do you play a zone, Skip?"
Interviewer,"Well, again, I've seen him slash up any kind of defense, when he feels like it. He's a freight train! You just said you don't have the athletes that they have."
Cuban,"Right. And that's why we played more zone than possibly Oklahoma City did. Because we had smarter players that are not necessarily as athletic. But the thing about the Miami Heat, they play the Pat Riley way. RIght? They play the exact same way, all the time. And I thought this series was going to be about adjustments. Oklahoma City felt like they had to do it a certain way, you know, it just didn't work, right? But it certainly wasn't the way we played them. So if you want to sit here and discuss ... let me put it another way. Every team tracks everything these days. So in game, we have five guys tracking what happens in a pick and roll situations, what happens in a post-up situation with Lebron, what happens with Lebron's posting and we run this type of zone, that type of zone. So you know in game exactly what the percentages are going. And if you are paying attention, you know those things as well. Oklahoma City didn't seem to make the number of adjustments they needed to make."
Interviewer,I agree.
Cuban,"And if you go through and look at the stats that I'm sure they have, that's what surprised me."
Interviewer,"Well you can throw all those stats out the window because, as Doc Rivers always says, it's a make or miss league."
Cuban,Yep.
Interviewer,"You won the championship last year because Dirk started making shots like he's never made 'em before. He played as tall as he is. Seven feet tall. And Lebron and Dwyane Wade started missing shots, or whoever else you want to throw in the equation."
Cuban,"No, actually, actually, we put Dirk in a position to succeed because we knew what Miami was going to do. They didn't make a lot of adjustments, they kept on playing the Pat Riley way. That increased our confidence as the game went by, as the games went by, right? So when we got to game four and everything was still the same, we knew we were going to win."
Interviewer,Are you criticizing the Pat Riley way?
Cuban,"Last year I was, this year it was perfect."
Interviewer,What was different?
Cuban,Last year versus this year?
Interviewer,Yeah.
Cuban,"They made their shots, and I don't think that they were, there wasn't as many adjustments against them."
Interviewer,Right. That's where I was going. Your club made the adjustments throughout the series. How surprised were you that Oklahoma City did not.
Cuban,"You know, I don't want to say anything about Oklahoma City because it's not like they had all season to work on these things."
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"RIght? We had the advantage of a full season where we played in, in, um, Chicago preseason last year, we played a whole game in nothing but zone. Nothing but zone. Because we knew we were going to have to go to the zone as our way to mix things up. And if you look at the..offensive results against our zone, you'd see, it was good. This year, because we had new guys, we didn't have as much time to practice, Okla-Indiana, same thing, why didn't they play zone? You don't have time to practice zone in a lockout shortened season when you don't practice. And I'm sure Oklahoma City faced the same thing. It's nice to say they could put in a zone, but if you don't have time to work on it, they can't. And I think that gave Miami a huge advantage."
Interviewer,So bottom line
Cuban,"I think we did a great job of taking him out of the game. Maybe he could have done more, but I think he played a Magic Johnson game last year against us and he needed other guys to step up and they didn't."
Interviewer,"Of all the things that have been said, I take issue with just one thing the great Mark Cuban had to say. I'll address that in a second though. I know we've got to go to break."
Cuban,"Yeah, I'm not going to play around with Lamar but let's put it this way. If a guy can't be part of our culture, you get rid of him."
Interviewer,"No, no, no, no. I'm not asking that question... I wasn't even asking, I respect the intricacies of that. What I am saying to you is that everybody and their grandmother could see that Lamar Odom didn't want it."
Cuban,"But we're not talking about a game in the middle of the season, right?"
Interviewer,"But I'm not talking about a game in the middle of the season, I'm talking about from the time that man got traded to Dallas he was miserable because he wanted to be in LA. What I'm saying is you can tell the difference. In other words-."
Cuban,I get your point. I get your point.
Interviewer,That's all I'm saying.
Cuban,"But you're in a close-out situation of the finals, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Cuban,"And by the time you get to that point..the guys you put in, it's not like they were running the same rotation, both teams shortened their rotation. So the guys who are in the game, are the guys who are committed to play. Now if there's a guy that you don't think is in to it, or you don't think deserves to play, you're not going to play him."
Interviewer,"But there are times, and I agree with your assessment, what I'm saying is within the context of highly competitive competition, in terms of effort I totally agree with you. But what I'm saying is when you look at Lebron and you take into account all the suffering he has endured over the last several years, because of the expectations that weren't lived up to, because of the way he'd been maligned and ridiculed or what have you, if you're Kevin Durant, sure you're going out there and you're giving the same level of effort, but because you're seen and perceived as a relatively quiet, humble dude that everybody-."
Cuban,"It's a team game, so that comes down to are you putting your players offensively and defensively in a position to succeed. It's not a question of effort."
Interviewer,"My only... the only thing I'm addressing is that when somebody makes a statement about somebody wanting it more, it doesn't speak to effort per se sometimes, sometimes it speaks to a level of desperation one has, as opposed to one lacks."
Cuban,"Again, it's a team game. The worst thing ... perfect, perfect analogy. Because on one hand, wanting it bad enough, make it happen, making the shots, being the shot maker. You know what they call that? They call that hero ball. And you know what the number one killer of a team that's trying to come back-hero ball."
Interviewer,Russell Westbrook.
Cuban,Anybody.
Interviewer,"I'm just saying it happens, that's all I'm saying."
Cuban,"Again, it comes down... Look, I think the most underrated element in the NBA is coaching. Coaching matters."
Interviewer,I agree with that.
Cuban,"The hardest position to hire in all of sports is the head coach. It's harder to find the right coach than it is to find the right players. And so, to say somebody just wants it more, was out there, you know, who wants it more than Perkins? Just look at his face!"
Interviewer,I guess what I'm trying to say is you're taking it as somebody being maligned. What I'm saying is that sometimes it speaks to the level of desperation one may have. That's all I'm saying. But that's neither here nor there.
Cuban,But I think desperation's not the way to play the game.
Interviewer,"Right or wrong, I'm saying it happens, and as a reporter you're not beyond the pale to point that out. That's all I'm saying. But the other point I want to get to is this. You sat there and said media members, we don't know anything. Let's address this."
Cuban,"No, I said when you're talking in generalities, when you're talking in generalities, right. When you talk in general, when you talk in specifics and you've done your homework, everybody's going to respect what you said. If you take the time to call the guys and find out their position, and you're reporting what they tell you, guys are going to respect what you said. When you start talking about ""excruciating pressure"", what the hell is that!"
Interviewer,He just explained what it was.
Cuban,Absolutely. (laughs).
Interviewer,"So what I'm saying to you is, that's right, so what I'm saying to you is, if we talk to a player, and he wants to talk off the record, but doesn't have the courage to talk on the record. If you want to talk to a coach who's giving you this tidbit of information, but you can't! Please don't use this! I'm saying it happens. What I'm saying is, there are too many reporters that are proven, that have proven their level of credibility, simply because of the information, not only the information that they've acquired, but also you know they're talking to folks, and sometimes they're protecting them."
Cuban,"Two different things. One is just reporting what guys will say. And if you get access, you get a report, more power to you, that's great, that's doing your job. And then there's effort. There's effort around all the other elements of the game. There's going in... this Disney, this is ESPN, you have more resources than any team ever had. Look, every team, or most teams, you can go in there, and we've got ten guys breaking down tape, breaking down elements so we know exactly what's going on, internationally."
Interviewer,"What you just broke down, listen, we've had analysts all over ESPN, nobody has said what you just broke down about what you did to the Miami Heat last year in the NBA finals."
Cuban,But all you had to do was look at the tape. That's the point! The tape is obvious.
Interviewer,"Time out, wait a minute, Mark. Well listen, did you know it before you became an owner and you were inside those locker rooms? You had access!"
Cuban,"What I am saying is you don't need access to go down and sit down and break down a tape, so everybody's talking about officiating, right? Right? And I'm not going to say one way or the other, but all you have to do is watch the tape and score it."
Interviewer,"Wait a minute. You have analysts all over various networks throughout this country that have watched it and break stuff down and they still don't know what you know because you own the team and the coach is literally showing you what he's doing. They might not show it to somebody else. So even though you might break down the tape and see certain things, some of the nuances."
Cuban,I don't agree with that statement.
Interviewer,"Come on, come on!"
Cuban,I can watch other teams play.
Interviewer,"I'm telling you what coaches been telling me, because I don't know. I'm telling you what coached told me, so if I'm wrong, I'm wrong because they gave it to me."
Cuban,"I can watch other teams's games, right, and breakdown what they're playing, how they're playing it, I can look at officiating and know if it has an impact or not. And all I have to do is take notes. All you have to do is watch the tape and take notes."
Interviewer,You still haven't answered my same question
Cuban,"My point is it has nothing to do with access and everything to do with effort. If it was important to me, and if it was part of my job, to understand the nuances of the NBA game, before I bought the team, I would have done it."
Interviewer,"I'm sorry, I got news for you, primarily, our primary responsibility is results. I will explain it to some degree, but I could really give two cents about why you went 15 and 67. If you're 15-67, you stink. Your record stinks!"
Cuban,So I stand by my point. My 2.5 year old will sit there and break down tape and he knows more than any of you guys about the NBA.
Interviewer,You might say that....
Cuban,Thank you (laughs).
Interviewer,"... but what I'm saying to you is this, if we're on the air and we've got forty-five seconds to two minutes to talk about a subject, what do you want us to do?"
Cuban,"Ok, you're making my point, Stephen A."
Interviewer,"No, I'm not."
Cuban,You're making my exact point.
Interviewer,I don't think so.
Cuban,"If you're saying you just don't have the time to do it, just say you don't have the time to do it."
Interviewer,"No. What I'm saying is as you break it down and explain it, it comes down to bottom-line results. I've seen many analysts broke it down before, but at the end of the day we're never going to understand what you understand, because you have that level of access."
Cuban,"Ok, so I don't disagree that access can add color to what you see ...."
Interviewer,Content. Substance.
Cuban,"Well, context, right? To what you see on the tape. No question about that. But my point is if you don't watch the tape, you don't know all the questions to ask. And if you surprise a coach, by saying why did you do this, why'd you do that, what was the circumstance that led you to make this choice, then I think you'd get better responses."
Interviewer,Are we out of time? Can Mark stay?
Cuban,I like to do what I like to do.
Interviewer,"Ok. But you didn't attack the referees publicly, and potentially turn them against your Dallas Mavericks. You didn't insult the rival Heat fans and maybe get them to scream a little bit louder at the Heat home games. I liked that Mark Cuban, and I thought that helped that you stayed out of the way of your coach and your players and you let them do what they did best. You were in the shadows a year ago."
Cuban,"I wasn't. Just because I didn't talk to you guys didn't mean I did anything differently. I got to tell you, there was only one reason I didn't and that's because I was superstitious. RIght? You know? The minute I didn't talk to the media one game, we won. And so there was no good reason...."
Interviewer,So it was all superstition?
Cuban,A hundred percent.
Interviewer,It worked. I thought it really....
Cuban,Never. Never. They know me better.
Interviewer,Ok.
Cuban,"In terms of my role, when things are going wrong somebody's got to be out there taking the bullets. When things are going right, you step back, right? To me it was important to let Donald Carter lift the trophy because he was in ill health."
Interviewer,I liked that.
Cuban,It wasn't me talking when Stuart Scott had the mic; I handed it right to coach Carlisle.
Interviewer,You avoided the spotlight.
Cuban,"I didn't avoid anything, right? To me I was just doing what I thought was right. And that's the way I was trying to do it. It's not that I love the spotlight. You guys know, I turn down a whole lot more interviews than I say yes to."
Interviewer,Yes you do.
Cuban,I rarely say yes.
Interviewer,Yes you do.
Cuban,"But there's things that I like to do, Shark Tank, ABC, Friday nights. Um (laughs)."
Interviewer,We like that. Nice plug.
Cuban,"So it's not about limelight, it's about doing the right thing."
Interviewer,Is that not out of character for Mark Cuban last year?
Cuban,"No, no, trust me, it's not out of character."
Interviewer,"Ok, if you're superstitious and it worked will we see more of that forward?"
Cuban,"Depends what works. If I talk and we win, I'll talk more."
Interviewer,In other words you're wearing the same shirt that worked in game four....
Cuban,You have no idea! (everyone laughs).
Interviewer,"Alright, fair enough."
Cuban,"No, that's you Skip."
Interviewer,No. No.
Cuban,"That's you. You're the contrarian, right?"
Interviewer,"Nope, I'm right."
Cuban,"That's your sphiel, right. If you say A, I'm gonna say B. If you say...."
Interviewer,"I say exactly what I believe, is that not correct?"
Cuban,"No, he believes it."
Interviewer,What I am saying is you will find what you feel differently about somebody.
Cuban,"But, but yeah...."
Interviewer,I don't know if I agree with that.
Cuban,"He's making my point for me. ""He says what he believes."" Which is a whole lot different than knowing the facts. I rest my case."
Interviewer,"Ok, was I ever inaccurate in my constructive criticism of Lebron James over the last seven years on this show?"
Cuban,I don't know.
Interviewer,"Ok. He agrees, you say I was accurate with it. You thought I over stated it."
Cuban,"Of course. But I think the difference between us is it doesn't matter what I believe. In my own mind. I don't care what I believe, right? If it's something I believe, then I still want to know what the facts are."
Interviewer,But you're an analytical guy.
Cuban,That's just the way I look at it. I'm not saying it's good TV.
Interviewer,"Skip is analytical... Skip looks at numbers, but I think oftentimes, and this is the beauty of Skip Bayless, the numbers may tell us something. What he loves to do is tell us, fill in the blacks, what the numbers don't tell us."
Cuban,"Let me give you a perfect example, right. (picks up a traditional NBA box score from in front of Skip). This is a traditional basketball box score, right?"
Interviewer,That's what it looks like.
Cuban,"You know, it's the most worthless piece of information in all the NBA."
Interviewer,You find no value in those numbers whatsoever?
Cuban,None. There's the obvious points scored....
Interviewer,triple-double means nothing?
Cuban,It depends on the rest of the game.
Interviewer,How often do you read those?
Cuban,Who's the guy who threw the ball off the backboard?....
Interviewer,"I agree with that point. I often say numbers lie. He throws at me he averaged 30 and 10 or whatever, all these Lebron numbers are. Yeah, but what happened in the fourth quarter? It doesn't show in here, unless you look at the fourth quarter box. You happened to open the third quarter box."
Cuban,"But here's why I find I have a problem. Right? Because the numbers are the numbers, these numbers really don't tell much, the traditional boxscore. Because it leaves out one hundred percent of the context. Right? If a guy has fifty points, you know, and a guy takes thirty shots and maybe even has a triple-double, it's the old line, give me the ball, I'm open. But you got to know, there's a reason why you're open, right? Because you can't shoot."
Interviewer,"Ok, I circled one number in this entire box. One number I circled. This is the third quarter. When Oklahoma City collapsed and allowed, what was it, a 19 to 1 run."
Cuban,Right?
Interviewer,"The point guard took nine shots in that quarter, so that'd be 36 for a game. He made two of them. He shot 4-20 for the game. That's a pretty significant number."
Cuban,What story does it tell? (turns to Skip).
Interviewer,"It says, he shoots too much. It says they're in need of a pure point guard. A floor leader. Somebody to settle them down and get them better shots. That he's more, if you look at it over time, he's far more cold than he's hot, because he scored 43 on 36 shots in the previous game, as you know, and everybody's like, oh wow, Russell Westbrook, it's Westbrook or bust."
Cuban,"What I'm telling you it's telling you nothing, right? Because you don't know what offense is being run, it doesn't really tell you who was on the court, or who was on the court against him, for much, I guess for this game you would because everybody played everything, right. You know, were they sagging back and daring him to shoot, right? Look, you talk about what the boxscores will or won't tell you. If he's shooting too much, and you said over the course of the series he hadn't shot very well, and in other series he hadn't shot very well, then you're saying Oklahoma City did the exact right thing because Mike Miller hadn't hit a shot the entire series, so they were right just to leave him open, right? You got to adjust. It doesn't give you the context for adjustments, is what I'm saying."
Interviewer,"I'll buy that. I like Mark Cuban, he's a contrarian."
Cuban,"No, not at all. And I've been pretty much apolitical my entire adult life. But this election is obviously quite different than previous presidential elections. So I just thought - I thought it was necessary to jump in and use my voice."
Interviewer,Why?
Cuban,"The prospects of Donald Trump being president just scare the hell out of me. And that's coming after having initially, you know, supported him and hoped that he would be 180 degrees different from what he turned out to be."
Interviewer,"I mean, am I wrong? I seem to remember there was a time when you offered to be the running mate for either of them."
Cuban,"Oh, sure. Yeah, a lot of that was a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I didn't really expect that to happen. But, you know, there was a time when Donald first got into the race where I would talk to him on the phone."
Interviewer,"I think a lot of people will notice we've gotten this far in the conversation, and I'm not sure you've actually mentioned Hillary Clinton."
Cuban,"Haha. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, talking about her - she's smart. She's pragmatic. She is a policy wonk. She's had a lifetime of dedication to service. Now, that doesn't mean I agree with all of her policies. But without question, I think she can be a good president."
Interviewer,Is she trustworthy?
Cuban,"Yes, absolutely - 100 percent without question. Now, relative to Donald Trump, it's even a bigger dichotomy. Donald Trump I wouldn't trust as far as I could throw him."
Interviewer,Is being successful in business good preparation for being president?
Cuban,"I don't think it's a requirement to have a life in public service to be the president. But at the same time, the skillset that at least I've gotten - and I'm only speaking from my personal experiences - I think, would be very valuable."
Interviewer,Is it true that you offered to play Donald Trump in Hillary Clinton's debate preparation?
Cuban,"No, I was never asked. But I did offer in a made-for-TV. No, just kidding hahaha."
Interviewer,"Even if you're not helping to prepare Hillary Clinton for the debate, would you give her any advice on how to - if I might put it this way - provoke Donald Trump?"
Cuban,"Oh yeah, that's easy. Yeah, I mean, look, Donald Trump has got unlimited number of insecurities. But the No. 1 one thing, I would say, is his insecurity with his intellect. There's a reason why he always refers to where he went to college and, you know, that I'm a smart person."
Interviewer,"Mark Cuban from Dallas, thanks so much for being with us."
Cuban,"Thanks. I enjoyed it. Thanks, Scott."
Interviewer,Some influencers don't say much quietly making deals behind the scenes Mark Cuban is the total opposite the owner of.
Cuban,The dallas mavericks is known for criticizing referees and presidents alike his business chops go back to the.
Interviewer,1990s when cuban co-founded an online streaming company that he sold to Yahoo for 5.7 billion dollars.
Cuban,He has since invested in dozens of startups and continues to do so as a host of the show shark tank Cuban is.
Interviewer,Here to talk about how to pick the right investments ignoring everybody else's noise and maybe generating some of your.
Cuban,Own .
Interviewer,Hello everyone i'm andy serwer welcome to influencers and welcome to our guests Mark Cuban mark great to see you.
Cuban,Thanks for having me mark of course entrepreneur star shark tank owner of the Dallas Mavericks and in fact he's.
Interviewer,Hosting us here today were dallas Mavericks headquarters here right across the street.
Cuban,Yep right across from the arena from the arena right so a whole bunch of stuff to talk to you about our way but let's talk.
Interviewer,About this president thing okay you know that's out there there are people who suggest that you should run for.
Cuban,President maybe you have aspirations i don't know but it's a discussion point so what would it take to have you run.
Interviewer,For president i'm excited about next year for the Mavs it's going to be I don't want to get into it I mean I did.
Cuban,One quick interview and then all of a sudden it blew up I don't want to feed the beast like I said if there's a.
Interviewer,Certain set of circumstances that would push me to do it but we're not there yet so if and when it happens you'll be the.
Cuban,First to know andy okay that's very cool what about the Democratic field are anyone there that you think can.
Interviewer,Challenge president trump well i mean there's now and then there's November of 2020 I mean if the election were held.
Cuban,Today i think trump would win but i don't think that there's there's somebody that has the momentum or just.
Interviewer,The value of the incumbency that that Trump has but at the same time between now and then I think Joe Biden's got a.
Cuban,Good chance and we'll see what happens with any of the other of the field of 97 to see if anybody emerges or if anybody.
Interviewer,New comes in i think i think biden is capable of beating him but we're not there yet you've been critical of.
Cuban,President trump before have you kind of made any peace with them I mean you know it's been a couple years yeah I get.
Interviewer,Along i mean you know we didn't have to make peace we I you know like any president I agree with some things and.
Cuban,Disagree with other things now it's not personal there's things I would do differently.
Interviewer,And you know but i was the same with Obama was the same with Bush it was the same with Clinton that's just a way.
Cuban,That's just the nature of the beast so you talked to him and given him any advice or what advice would you give.
Interviewer,Them i mean i'm not a fan of the tariffs um you know if I understand what he's trying to do in.
Cuban,Terms of battle in china i would approach it differently because I think tariffs are a tax on the American people.
Interviewer,But at the same time i think we have a variety of other leverage points I'll give you the perfect example Chinese.
Cuban,Companies on american chinese companies listed on American exchanges have a market cap of more than 1.4 trillion.
Interviewer,Dollars that's a lot of leverage right there they're raising money via IPO it's something we can't do in China I'd shut.
Cuban,Down all chinese ipos that first step and given his propensity for using Twitter and just as a kind of throwing.
Interviewer,Warning shots you know i would i would throw out there that we might put a halt on the trading of Chinese listed stocks.
Cuban,In the united states now there are American shareholders but the reality is that long term the value of the.
Interviewer,Companies the value of the company but a trading halt would certainly create a lot of disruption for those Chinese.
Cuban,Companies and i don't think it's untoward at all to reconsider you know treating Chinese companies like they do.
Interviewer,Ours right you know we can't list on their exchanges I don't know what the SEC is thinking because given that every.
Cuban,Chinese company has a connection somewhere or another to the Chinese government how does the SEC enforce any.
Interviewer,Type of trading lots can you imagine if you're a big Chinese listed company and the government someone high up the.
Cuban,Government says i need to make some extra money tell me how business is and what you're going to report what's the.
Interviewer,Sec going to do to them right and so there's all kinds of enforcement issues that I think come up and I'm not.
Cuban,Suggesting that that's what happens now but we have no idea of knowing that it doesn't have you ever run that by.
Interviewer,President trump no no not or anyone else in Washington I mean I've talked to a lot of people in.
Cuban,Washington about a lot of things but it's I'm sure it's not something I think has reached his level right I want to.
Interviewer,Get into the sec and others as well but let's talk a little bit about growing up I grew up in Pittsburgh your father ran.
Cuban,An auto upholstery didn't run any whatever he worked there okay so what was that like Mark and and how did that.
Interviewer,Inspire you i mean my dad busted his ass I mean he worked six six days a week little.
Cuban,Left at 7:00 at 7:00 7:30 in the morning got back at 6 or 7 o'clock lost his eye in an accident doing upholstery.
Interviewer,He had a staple break when he was putting some covering on a car seat you know it was it was a middle-class.
Cuban,Upbringing my mom did odd jobs you know they just wanted something better I mean my grandparents came over from Russia.
Interviewer,You know my dad was the first generation my uncles were the first generation of Americans like my mom too and you know.
Cuban,Like every child of immigrants they want it better for their kids you know it's funny I mean a lot of people grew up.
Interviewer,That way all right but now many people end up like you so what do you think that's the result of I think you know.
Cuban,Everybody's got something that they're good at and the hard part is finding it and I found out early that I was a good.
Interviewer,Salesperson that i really like business you know like I like sports I mean I read everything I possibly could played.
Cuban,Sports as much as i could just wasn't as good as I wanted to be and and business was the same way I mean as long as I.
Interviewer,Could remember i was buying and selling baseball cards garbage bags whatever I could find stamps to collectors but I.
Cuban,Was also reading everything i possibly could about business and you know I was that unusual kid that I'd rather read.
Interviewer,About ted turner then go to the movies and and so I think that created a foundation of my parents you know my dad.
Cuban,Used to always say i don't understand what you're doing but I'm glad you're doing it and and so I have my ups and.
Interviewer,Downs along the way of course but i just think that I just I just put in the time and was fortunate enough to really get.
Cuban,Excited about business and that paid off benefits over the long haul I mean you almost have to have that drop like in.
Interviewer,Other words you can't fake it you can't like pretend that you want to read about Ted Turner and okay I'll skip one movie.
Cuban,Yes i mean your your soul yeah i mean you can fake it to make it in a lot of areas particular if you're working for.
Interviewer,Somebody else but at the end of the day if you're going to be great at something you've got to make the effort to be.
Cuban,Great at something whether it's sports whether it's physics math science business whatever it may be.
Interviewer,You know it's not just a natural ski you've got you've got to to learn and particularly if you're in the technology.
Cuban,Industry because the changes every day you know when I got started and in you know after I got I got it was a.
Interviewer,Bartender when i first came to dallas got into the PC industry got fired started my own company but there I.
Cuban,Learned early on that there was always something new and most people didn't put in the time to learn it it's like now.
Interviewer,With artificial intelligence lots of people talk about artificial intelligence lots of people talk about.
Cuban,Machine learning and neural networks not a lot of people are putting in the time to take classes or do the tutorials or.
Interviewer,To learn how to apply it to business and that's what it takes and and you know that's just something I've always.
Cuban,Enjoyed so i i've been fortunate at no wait a minute are you doing that with AI really what are you doing I mean I've.
Interviewer,Been on amazon doing the machine learning tutorials right now I'm going through I've taken Python online classes.
Cuban,I really yeah absolutely if you go in my bathroom there's a machine learning for dummies book I just started JavaScript.
Interviewer,Neural networks there's a little tutorial where they've got most of the library brain Das and all the libraries.
Cuban,And it's not if you have a background in programming it's not hard but I'm not trying to be great at that but I want to.
Interviewer,Understand it so i understand all the you know so I the nuance elements of it and how it works so that I have an.
Cuban,Advantage but where would that take you like with your businesses here or the Mavericks or you know everyone text me.
Interviewer,Everywhere right i mean there's nothing that AI won't impact as big as the M so having been around a while I saw the.
Cuban,Impact of pcs then i saw the impact of local area networks then I saw the impact of wide area networks then I saw.
Interviewer,The impact of the internet then I saw the impact of mobile then I saw the impact of Wireless you know now.
Cuban,I'm seeing the impact of artificial intelligence and a Dwarfs any of those things and if I don't understand how to.
Interviewer,Apply it to my businesses i mean i remember selling pcs and software and walking insane you don't need to use.
Cuban,That pen and paper on a you know on a notepad or a ledger pad now we're gonna give you a spreadsheet and by the way.
Interviewer,Here's a here's a spreadsheet that cost four hundred ninety five dollars and I had to pay to go get trained on how to.
Cuban,Sell it which is crazy now when you think of but then we said okay now you can play.
Interviewer,What if then we said you can connect these pcs unless I understood the technology how is that going to explain.
Cuban,It how was i going to understand it unless I understand it now how am I going to invest in it you know then I.
Interviewer,Got to go trust somebody who says oh yeah I know AI and maybe they do maybe they don't and it's really easy just.
Cuban,Ahead just that okay say you figure it out that's just not my style so you're building a base of knowledge.
Interviewer,And then you think that at some point it's gonna pay dividends and Tory has right I mean if you truly believe a AI.
Cuban,Is going to change everything how are you going to understand what people are doing to change everything unless you at.
Interviewer,Least have a foundational understanding of it now I'm not going to build a million layer neural network and try to.
Cuban,Change the world and i'm not going to show you I'm not gonna write a research paper and saying here's how why the.
Interviewer,Lottery ticket approach works and you can build smaller neural networks with less data and be more you know resource.
Cuban,Efficient but i can read that stuff and understand that when somebody says okay we're building this project and we need.
Interviewer,This sized data set or this size data set we need this amount of resources I can ask questions and understand the.
Cuban,Answers so he grew up in pittsburgh went to University of Indiana for a while then you said you came here how have you.
Interviewer,Adopted this city why did this become your home talas well I mean when I went to IU I had a bunch of friends that.
Cuban,Graduated it came down here and they're like you got to get your ass down here the weather's great the women are.
Interviewer,Beautiful the economy is good i said wait back up and then I came down lived six guys in a three-bedroom apartment.
Cuban,Until i found my way and i've had a blast and loved it ever since so how do you describe yourself mark I mean I said.
Interviewer,Entrepreneur is that how you would describe yourself what do you do for a living.
Cuban,I drive describe myself as a grinder you know I just like we talked about learning.
Interviewer,That's a grind but i love it you know and I just I think I've just learned what I'm good at and learned to focus on.
Cuban,Those things and and try to you know utilize those skills to now you know not just be an entrepreneur but probably.
Interviewer,More often now invest in and help other entrepreneurs okay so take us through your business.
Cuban,Interest right now you have the basketball team you write stuff for sure meaning you have stuff here you can go.
Interviewer,To mark cuban comm i list them all right right and so really I mean I've got Shark Tank.
Cuban,And i've invested in 100-plus companies there we sold a bunch so I think I've got 70 that are active now and you know.
Interviewer,It follows a normal distribution probably 10 or struggling 50 are doing great and Tanner are doing it incredibly.
Cuban,But i think now i've really evolved some of my focus to trying to help disadvantaged entrepreneurs people who.
Interviewer,Have less opportunity i just invested with a woman Arlen Hamilton who we together created a little million dollar.
Cuban,Fund where she's going out and finding ten businesses run by people of color or disadvantaged LGBTQ type communities and.
Interviewer,Just opening doors because i think my experience applies to anybody right any entrepreneur no matter what you're.
Cuban,Trying to sell and i also think that it's a great business opportunity simply because the markets that they wanted to.
Interviewer,Sell to are underserved there just aren't as many entrepreneurs so there's more opportunity and so I think it makes.
Cuban,Great business sense as well let's go through some of these other things are starting with Shark Tank uh-huh what's.
Interviewer,Shark tank like is it really a kick the way it looks like yes I mean it's great we start shooting here probably a couple.
Cuban,Of weeks june 12th or 13th i think it is and the way it works literally is we show up on set and Sony Studios and I.
Interviewer,Get there about 8:30 and put on they put it on a little bit of makeup I throw on my suit like Kevin mr. wonderful son.
Cuban,Launder laurie they have to get there two hours earlier because they need they need more work they did oh and we've got.
Interviewer,A lot more late listening to that Kevin's got a lot more landmass to cover Laurie's Laurie but in any event we.
Cuban,Start shooting at about 9:00 and they just bring in deal after deal after deal we know nothing about them they'll say.
Interviewer,You know this is you know joe and sally and this is the name of the business and they'll walk in and give our pitch now.
Cuban,On television it might take ten to fourteen minutes in real life if it's a stupid deal it might take 20 minutes and.
Interviewer,Then be for we were all out and then if it's an intense deal.
Cuban,It could go 90 minutes two hours and then they have to edit it down but it's our money it's all real we know nothing.
Interviewer,About them if we decide to do a deal then we have the opportunity to do due diligence after the fact because.
Cuban,Sometimes they'll embellish it's a polite way to put it you know my widget cost a dollar to make and we sold a.
Interviewer,Million of them when in reality the widget costs $10 and they've sold six then heaven sometimes yeah that does.
Cuban,Happen more often than you think the producers of spokes supposed to UM ferret that stuff out but yeah not a lot.
Interviewer,Doesn't happen as much as we'd like so yeah we'll do due diligence and about 60% of my deals close um the other.
Cuban,Little thing is of the deals that present to us and we'll see in any given season 250 to 300 that are presented.
Interviewer,Probably 25% of people who pitch us they come in are taped and pitched to us don't even make it on air mm for a.
Cuban,Variety of reasons yeah and let me ask you about your entertainment business the movies and 29:29 Magnolias what's.
Interviewer,That all about well back in 2000 and mm I guess it was after I sold Yahoo right after I bought.
Cuban,The mavs i started the world's first all high-definition TV network when everybody was saying high-definition.
Interviewer,Televisions not going to happen I created a network called HD net and HD net movies and there was very little.
Cuban,"Content for it i mean literally this is when high-def televisions cost $15,000 and everybody said who the hell is gonna."
Interviewer,"Pay $15,000 for a tv and i would i went around telling everybody no you just wait those televisions are gonna drop."
Cuban,Like a rock in terms of price and everybody's gonna want one that goes on their wall instead of this big ugly.
Interviewer,Hunks of analog tv so i had that but we didn't have content and so we wanted to go out there and create content and we.
Cuban,Also bart landmark theatres which we have since sold but we wanted that vertical environment where we can show.
Interviewer,It on television put it online offer DVDs put put it video on demand and also offer in theaters and so we created we.
Cuban,Created 29 29 productions first where we produce movies what meanwhile 29:29 was because the address.
Interviewer,For audio net the streaming company we thought it was 29 29 Elm Street okay so that's where that came from.
Cuban,And then so we had movie production 29 29 we had Landmark Theatres we also bought ricer entertainment which we've.
Interviewer,Since sold that oh no get hogan's heroes and some others so that we could put it on HDNet HDNet films and then landmark.
Cuban,And so the idea was have article ii integrating so we were the first company to to put create to produce a movie put.
Interviewer,It online download we did i basically offer a day and day release of it called bubble and we we've been doing Magnolia.
Cuban,And 29:29 productions ever since the others yeah I'm ignoring 29 $20 we've sold one of all these businesses tell.
Interviewer,You about the economy right now what do you think the outlook that's a good question so some of my smaller Shark.
Cuban,Tank companies that are that resell products are getting crushed by the tariffs I mean I've got one that's may.
Interviewer,Go out of business simply because tariffs at 10% were one thing tariffs are 25% they just can't compete there's.
Cuban,Other companies that have bigger and better supply chains where they were more creative and were within 5% of.
Interviewer,Their prices but now with the tariffs it's it's almost impossible in the uncertainty it's made it very very.
Cuban,Difficult but beyond that i mean business is going well in urban markets and it's a little bit tougher in smaller.
Interviewer,Markets so i mean it pretty much mirrors what you see in the general economy right are you surprised at how long the.
Cuban,Stock market rally has lasted no i mean if you go back to 2008 it's pretty much on a straight line.
Interviewer,You know when president trump got elected it was a little blip with some of the things he's done is taking it.
Cuban,Back to the straight line so it's it's pretty much you know where you expect it to be there hasn't been I mean like any.
Interviewer,Market there's going to be ups and downs but there hasn't been anything dramatic to change it are you concerned about a.
Cuban,Recession or the market faltering i mean I'm concerned about Black Swan events the nominal ease that.
Interviewer,Hurt us i think in general you know the markets tend to just go up you know on their own by their own weight and so.
Cuban,There's no reason for that to change now maybe if the trade war extends or something happens with Iran or you know.
Interviewer,Again there's something aberrational that puts us in a difficult situation then it could change but otherwise I.
Cuban,Mean there's no reason to think that other than stocks individual stocks you know doing what they do that the market.
Interviewer,Will continue to go up on the same line that it has since 2008 you mentioned the SCC earlier and.
Cuban,Obviously you've had some issues with them what do you think about the sec just generally speaking i think they're.
Interviewer,Kind of useless you know i think if the SEC really wanted to make the market safer they would publish bright-line.
Cuban,Guidelines so for instance there's no law specific law and insider trading there are only precedents legal.
Interviewer,Precedents that have been set as a result of various cases that the SEC has brought well if you run a public company.
Cuban,That's okay because you probably have a general counsel who's training you and doing it on what you should and.
Interviewer,Shouldn't do if you're just an investor you have no idea you're not a lawyer and you shouldn't be responsible for you.
Cuban,Know talking to a lawyer before you design decide to talk to somebody at a company or where make or sell or buy or.
Interviewer,Sell a stock and i'll give you the perfect example of some of the stupidity there was a case and I forget the name.
Cuban,Of it where a guy was going to work it was a railroad company and Illinois I think and every day he'd go to work one.
Interviewer,Day in the parking lot that everybody shared there was a bunch limos and then another day there was a bunch of limos.
Cuban,Then another day the guy guest literally guessed that the company was being sold and he bought stock the SEC sued him.
Interviewer,Right now the sec lost but that's just some of the ridiculous stuff that they do I'll give you another one I we had a.
Cuban,Company share sleuth that did research on some companies and they found a company that was putting out press.
Interviewer,Release after press release about how great their business was with this new energy solution I think it was.
Cuban,And we sent somebody out there to just look at the factory were just called didn't even send it we just called.
Interviewer,Factory nobody answered then we called somebody local I think it was the Power Company and said you have power turned.
Cuban,On for this location no called up somebody local go look at this building nobody was there right company we short.
Interviewer,A stock company died the sec did nothing right yeah so what's the difference right let me ask you what do you think.
Cuban,About elon musk's war with the sec what do you think about Elon Musk general I mean I don't know him very well I mean.
Interviewer,I've talked to him a couple of times i like him because he's competitive he's obviously got you know a genius spirit.
Cuban,And in mind for innovation which i love but he's also very competitive and when you've got a bunch of bureaucrats trying.
Interviewer,To come at you in a world where there aren't bright-line guidelines that's tough I mean it's like when I was.
Cuban,Battling the sec it took everything i had not to just say eff you every minute of every day because it was ridiculous I.
Interviewer,Mean if you know in some of the due diligence and that we were able to do the things that they said about me that.
Cuban,You know the ridiculous approach they took you know and so when you have that coming at you it's hard now I wasn't.
Interviewer,Running a public company at the time he is and so you know he he's under a different microscope but like I told him.
Cuban,It was like you got to just try to bite your tongue no matter how hard it is because they don't care they don't care.
Interviewer,They're only in it for skin on the wall because they're like in my matter there were there were people who left the SEC.
Cuban,Before the conclusion when i kicked their ass and and during in the trial I had and they would put on their resume.
Interviewer,Worked on the mark cuban matter right and that's what I told you on this is a resume builder for them they don't give.
Cuban,A they don't care about you right they care about their resumes and that that's tough to fight and I also told.
Interviewer,Him i said look here's how stupid the SEC is name the last five people that you know that you can remember that.
Cuban,We're sanctioned by the sec for violating se violating insider trading loss you name.
Interviewer,Namie and he tell me i net can't name anyone that's death and so when the SEC does these enforcement's thinking that.
Cuban,They're gonna impact people trading it's ridiculous because in this day and age there's you can't communicate that to.
Interviewer,People it's it you know it doesn't people don't think wow this guy got busted this guy got busted this guy got.
Cuban,Busted a woman got busted so i better not do this stuff or I better learn because he did this or she did this and.
Interviewer,So that's an indication that that's the wrong thing to do no it doesn't work there's there's there's there's no.
Cuban,Educational value if you will and there's no disincentive based off of the findings from the SEC or the rulings.
Interviewer,That they have or the court rulings they have it goes into the ether nobody remembers it unless you're in the.
Cuban,Securities industry right and so it's kind of useless their approach is kind of useless I'll give you another example.
Interviewer,You can go on youtube and look this up so I I try not to talk to CEOs of public companies whose stock I'm considering.
Cuban,Buying because i don't trust the sec so there was an instance where I was thinking well maybe I want to talk to.
Interviewer,The ceo and this was a couple years ago so I put took my camera and I started videotaping myself calling the SEC and.
Cuban,Identified myself i wasn't trying to be underhanded and I said look I'm thinking about talking to this company I don't.
Interviewer,Know if this would violate any sec rules is there anybody I can talk to that can give me guidance and so they sent me to.
Cuban,Another person and recorded that sent me to another person recorded that finally they sent me to a webpage and that.
Interviewer,Webpage was a picture of a letter from 1980 no lie saying I needed to fax eight copies of a request to this number.
Cuban,That's our sec you know they're not they're not helping at all and you talk about and I can go on for days and I.
Interviewer,Won't talk here but one other piece if you look at all the ETF's of foreign country right right.
Cuban,If those foreign countries stock markets that those etf sold in america represent right they don't have all kinds of.
Interviewer,Enforcement yeah requirements right right so it's oh yeah and so it's not like we're.
Cuban,Letting people invest in these markets where there's not enforcement because it really doesn't net out to be anything.
Interviewer,Right of any value speaking of Silicon Valley a little bit what do you think about Facebook and.
Cuban,Google and those big companies should they be broken up are they too big or ninety any more enforcement so there's.
Interviewer,Two pieces there one just looking at the State of the Union if you will I mentioned earlier that AI is you know.
Cuban,The biggest thing that's happened a long time well if you talk to Vladimir Putin he says whoever dominates a a AI is.
Interviewer,Going to win you know it's gonna be a dominant nation you talked to China and they talk about their twenty twenty five.
Cuban,Or twenty thirty five whatever they called it plan Dell was built around AI in the United States we don't have those.
Interviewer,Plans yet but what we do have is five to ten really really big tech companies who dominate the research and development in.
Cuban,The ai space if you were to break up any of those companies Facebook Google as examples Amazon well we're gonna lose.
Interviewer,Our greatest competitive advantage that we have versus the Chinese and the Russians in a space that we need to.
Cuban,Dominate so that's part one now maybe that gets resolved over time if we invest as a country more but that that.
Interviewer,Is a big issue part 2 in terms of breaking them up you don't have to use Facebook you know you don't have to use.
Cuban,Amazon it's not like there aren't alternatives you don't have to buy from Netflix you know so I don't I don't see.
Interviewer,Them as utility is like the phone where the only way you could use a phone was to go through AT&T back in the 80s and.
Cuban,Even then all they did was give access now I do think there are privacy issues but those aren't break up issues right I.
Interviewer,Think the law like if you look to say to Facebook don't ever sell your data to anybody else.
Cuban,Think about what's happened now facebook has control of all that data right you talk about the law of unintended.
Interviewer,Consequences you've made facebook stronger not weaker now if anything there should be a built-in delay and.
Cuban,They should have to publish that data anonymize and make it available to everybody mmm.
Interviewer,That's how you solve the problem and then you want to also have the other issues of.
Cuban,You know the content that they present being harmful or misguided brutal some cases yeah and I think they're high I.
Interviewer,Think for them and for google and others that's where you changed the copyright laws right right back in the day do it.
Cuban,There wasn't really the consideration that there would be forward facing videos and other content that would be.
Interviewer,Protected by the nut to hold on what is it for the copyrights safe harbor right yeah right so now to safe harbors and.
Cuban,Then the copyright owner has to send a takedown notice right right we should go back a television station is for example.
Interviewer,You guys you guys can't just pull off something offline online and just present it here right and broadcast it.
Cuban,Right yeah you've got to get permission right right you got to sign a licensing agreement that's the way it used to be.
Interviewer,For digital copyrights and we should go back to the frame so that Facebook just can't say well it's none of our business.
Cuban,Right and if somebody has a problem with that issue a takedown notice and will try to use AI to proactively recognize.
Interviewer,That there's a shooting environment you know something horrible is going on right if you flipped it so that the DMCA.
Cuban,Safe harbors only protected you for inward-facing as opposed to outward facing videos then just like Yahoo.
Interviewer,Finance just like every tv network you have to go out and get a license yeah then it all changes and you're not gonna.
Cuban,See that horrific content you're not gonna see because those people aren't going to sign a license right.
Interviewer,Interesting let me shift gears a little bit more can I ask you about economic inequality and alexandria oak SEO cortez.
Cuban,And her agenda what do you think of that and why do you think people find it so lovely I love ALC right I don't always.
Interviewer,Agree with her but i think she's learned the lesson of social media where you get long and you get loud and you get.
Cuban,People's attention and then you deal with substance after that but what do you think when she says that the idea.
Interviewer,That we have billionaires in our society is immoral I mean it's a it makes for great.
Cuban,Headline porn i mean she started a business Bernie Sanders has a book business you know Elizabeth Warren buys.
Interviewer,And sells houses are dead right if they would have had the level of success that I and others have had I.
Cuban,Don't think they'd be complaining as much but that doesn't mean that there's not an incoming inequality problem there.
Interviewer,Is and it's something we have to deal with I tell you know other businesspeople that you know the.
Cuban,Greatest cost to business is social disruption if people are rebelling and burning things and aren't you know.
Interviewer,Aren't satisfied with their lives and their incentive to do horrific things or you know that's the greatest cost of.
Cuban,Business and that that cost us more now the question becomes how do you address it right so I'm not a fan of.
Interviewer,Trickle-down economics right where the i don't think that works I don't think it has work you know the richer people get.
Cuban,The more they they make available to others hasn't worked I'm also not a fan of trickle-down taxation right the.
Interviewer,Concept that just taxed you know those who have a whole lot more then all of a sudden it'll find its way to those who.
Cuban,Need it doesn't work hasn't worked won't work it's not that taking more money I'm okay with paying more taxes I don't have.
Interviewer,A problem of that where the issue is how do you make it work yeah right how do you get it now.
Cuban,The reality is anybody who's working and getting paid by the hour is going to have a challenge when something goes.
Interviewer,Wrong right do you lose a job does the dishwasher break does somebody get sick is it more than your the doctor or you.
Cuban,Know or if you haven't covered your deductible yet can you cover your deductible if you're getting paid by the.
Interviewer,Hour it's hard to save money I don't care if it's five ten dollars an hour fifteen or.
Cuban,Fifty dollars an hour it's a difficult position the only way that people really acute improve their wealth is by buying.
Interviewer,A house condo whatever maybe owning shares of stock and so I think that's where you start to change the rules I.
Cuban,Think when you have a company like uber change but who is it to just visit Pinterest where there's multiple shared.
Interviewer,Like snap has got multiple snare classes of stuff I think you tax them differently mmm if every chair of stock.
Cuban,In a company in the public market is not treated the same then it should be as it shouldn't be.
Interviewer,Well i'm trying thinking right away without stepping on too many toes if you have an advantage class of stock it.
Cuban,Should be treated as normal income when you sell that stock right right if you have if everybody's got the same share.
Interviewer,Of class of stock then you treat it as capital gains right right right if you've held it for more than a year I.
Cuban,Think you also advantage people if you have a company where all employees are offers stock you give them other tax.
Interviewer,Advantages because then to a o'seas point you're lifting from the bottom up triple down is not going to work but if.
Cuban,You create opportunities where people all have to share in stock then the disparity is going to decline because.
Interviewer,Everybody's going to go up when things happen like when we sold broadcast comm we created three hundred millionaires.
Cuban,Because 300 out of 330 people invested their stock right right so you when you work from the bottom up like that people.
Interviewer,Have a chance to increase the value of their wealth when you if somebody's below a certain level of income and.
Cuban,They're able to buy a home and you give them more tax advantage you don't take away their their their deductions.
Interviewer,Because they're in california or new York you know when they have a lower income now they did some things to.
Cuban,Offset but still you want people to be able to accumulate assets that enhance that grow in value that appreciate.
Interviewer,That's how you get people so that they their visit their their life becomes better okay let me ask you about America.
Cuban,I mean people are bitching about america is there something wrong with this country is it's just the usual stuff I.
Interviewer,Mean what is your usual stuff yeah right I mean now everybody's got a platform so it's a lot easier to its it you.
Cuban,Know i call it headline porn you're only going to get attention the more dramatic you are the better chance you have of.
Interviewer,Getting attention and that's just the nature of the beast I mean there used to be gatekeepers to media now there's not.
Cuban,And if you're loud enough and either crass enough or maybe you're it's a great idea and people get behind it.
Interviewer,Enough um then you're going to be heard it doesn't make us bad it's just the game has changed I mean there are.
Cuban,Problems like our health care system and the mass shootings they're shooting tzer's well I think first.
Interviewer,You know there's there was a book i read in high school that I ended up buying a copy I was called wai-man Ravel and.
Cuban,Basically what he said was when your expectations for your life going forward are increasing but the reality is.
Interviewer,Diverging from that and so what you thought would happen with your life and where you are gets further and further.
Cuban,Apart then people do things that they otherwise wouldn't do whether it's a mass shooting whether it's you know who.
Interviewer,Knows what cheating whatever it may be and so I mean I think taking care of income inequality and lifting people up.
Cuban,From the bottom and creating more opportunities and giving them tax advantages.
Interviewer,Maybe it's an income and earned income Credit whatever it may be then I think you'll see fewer those events you know.
Cuban,Other people will say it's a mental health issue I don't think we've we've had all those same type of issues you.
Interviewer,Know for hundreds of years in this country I think it's more about when people really get disappointed they have.
Cuban,Nothing to lose don't do things that people with nothing to lose will do it's a guns a problem as well yeah I would do.
Interviewer,Guns completely differently you were listening to some of my last interviews aren't you I would do guns completely.
Cuban,Differently um i would i would go to change the Second Amendment in ways that people probably wouldn't expect you know.
Interviewer,It's not easy to change an amendment but what what I would do is change the Second Amendment so it said one every.
Cuban,American citizen has the right to own a gun period end of story written in the amendment to the federal government will.
Interviewer,Never be allowed to ever confiscate that gun from an individual period end of story three states have the right to.
Cuban,Manage the ownership the purchase and ownership and management of guns owned and held within their borders so that if.
Interviewer,You live in a state like texas if the law in Texas is open carry so be it if you live in Pennsylvania where they're.
Cuban,More stringent and they don't want you to be able to have a gun other than in your own premise or you know under lock.
Interviewer,And key or you know have to do a background check then that's up to them to decide and so if you know we're we're.
Cuban,Trying to take a second amendment that has been analyzed up and down and backwards and forwards and it's created.
Interviewer,Its own set of problems you know let's update it right we got to switch over to basketball sure and talked about that so.
Cuban,One i asked you a bunch of questions so first of all state of the maps right now I think we're in good shape I mean we.
Interviewer,Have luka daanish we're bringing back kristaps porzingis we have cap room so hopefully we'll be much better than we.
Cuban,Have been the last three years right you had some issues here with the culture of the team with Jordanna essary and I know.
Interviewer,You apologized for that you address that how did that culture happen and do you feel like I barely knew what would've.
Cuban,Happened right and yeah i think we brought it sent Marshall and I think she's done a phenomenal job.
Interviewer,She's been here over a year and i think it's a whole new culture a whole new mavs and you know like I alluded to.
Cuban,Earlier we've learned that diversity creates opportunity and now we're able to sell into markets we never were able.
Interviewer,To sell them before so i think it's made it a better place to work a better organization and a better foundation for.
Cuban,The future what about the nba overall but what's the state of the NBA I think it's great I mean I think out of silver.
Interviewer,The job is yeah i love adam i love the job he's doing right I think we're we appeal to you know a variety of.
Cuban,Demographics i think our audience is growing here in the United States and globally there was just a survey saying.
Interviewer,We're the number one sport in china so you know we are truly a global sport and so I think our future is very bright.
Cuban,Golden state warriors the most annoying team ever in the history of the NBA I'm not gonna go there I'm trying to.
Interviewer,Lead you on to that one yeah what about the Lakers what's going on their magic was just sounding ah you know many many.
Cuban,Times i hope they suck and i hope they suck forever now that one you wanted to talk about yeah but I've said that.
Interviewer,Before and i said it about every team right I want them all to be awful just one team I want to be good right and.
Cuban,What about your you know history with with refs have you mellowed or you I mean there's no conspiracy against Mark.
Interviewer,Cuban or or is there conspiracy i mean there there were moments where the reps are human too and they have biases like.
Cuban,Everybody else but you know my challenge is with officiating has always been about management more than the officials.
Interviewer,And so i've paid my fines and some things have changed for the better some things still need.
Cuban,Changing and so i'll keep on working on it if it means taking a fine I'll take a fine.
Interviewer,Generally speaking marcus we've kind of wanted things up here you have lived your life as aniconic last and in a way.
Cuban,That's a template for other people but in a way it isn't so in other words how much you've got an ordinary person.
Interviewer,Ordinary man or woman how much of aniconic class could you or should you be like Mark Cuban I don't care just you.
Cuban,Should just be yourself right i mean i take pride in the fact that I didn't give a what anybody thought or said.
Interviewer,I was just gonna be myself and you know my dad son and my mom's son I'm my brother's brother you know I'm Alexis.
Cuban,Alyssa and jake's father tiffany's husband this you know I just tried to do the best like everybody else I mean I've.
Interviewer,Been blessed you know like i say all the time I'm the luckiest guy in the world and I just try not to take it for.
Cuban,Granted i try to enjoy every minute and I think now as I've got a little bit older I try to give a little bit more.
Interviewer,Back than i have before and and try to help more people and I you know in terms of whatever if anybody else finds.
Cuban,Himself in my position just enjoy the moment enjoy every minute of it I mean I guess my question is are you a role.
Interviewer,Model for people in society i don't know I mean I never thought of it I mean it's not something I try to be I just try to.
Cuban,Be myself you know i just try to to to help where I can do what I can be a good dad and you know I know I'm not trying.
Interviewer,To be something for somebody else just myself and finally do you have any notions of where you want to be.
Cuban,Professionally or personally 10 years from now you know I think you have plans like that.
Interviewer,I don't not specific plans i mean i try to put myself in a position now where I can have an impact you know you talked.
Cuban,About running you know there's there's a variety of ways to have an impact fortunately people open their doors for.
Interviewer,Me and so whether it's working on healthcare whether it's working on crazy ideas like changing the Second Amendment.
Cuban,Whether it's supporting you know talking to the Senator Schumer he's got a program that creates more doctors which.
Interviewer,If you're gonna reduce the cost of healthcare you're gonna need more doctors because.
Cuban,Find a man if we ever want to get to universal health care the United States has got 2.3 doctors per thousand.
Interviewer,Scandinavian doctors have countries have 50% more you know but those are types of things where I can start having an.
Cuban,Impact i can start you know spending some money on things that lead to change helping entrepreneurs whatever it may be.
Interviewer,So i don't have a specific plan i don't have a specific bucket list but I hope that all these things I'm learning can.
Cuban,Lead to some level of change so we'll see all right Mark Cuban thank you very much for having us here today.
Interviewer,Thanks you've been watching influencers I'm Andy serwer we'll see you next time you .
Cuban,Again today i'm excited to have my good friend and fellow shark billionaire Mark Cuban gotta say that I love the word.
Interviewer,Billionaire what does that do oh that's mean I hate you already but he's here with me at a barber and if you're alive.
Cuban,You know mark if you just started breathing you know mark and so he doesn't need an introduction as they say.
Interviewer,But today we're talking not just to mark Cuban the guy we all know we're talking to Mark Cuban the man behind the money.
Cuban,That's how we want to get to the other day and how Mark spends his fortune what he's like as a dad and a husband.
Interviewer,Although i've had a peak at that myself and of course we'll end by getting out of him who his favorite shark is and.
Cuban,Might better be the right answer course okay I've already told Kevin not Kevin no way okay so I'm gonna set you up on.
Interviewer,This stuff okay okay you started your first business micro solutions after getting fired from a sales job right at.
Cuban,The computer store and i know the story there if you want to care to repeat it I think it's famous now but why didn't you.
Interviewer,Just go out and look for another job certainly you're capable of getting a good interview another job I just got.
Cuban,Fired too many times left too many jobs and realized I was allows the employee and recognizing that knowing I wanted to.
Interviewer,Start a business on my own at some point you know I had nothing to lose I just lost my job I was living six guys in a.
Cuban,Three-bedroom apartment sleeping on the floor my car was a piece of junk that literally I've never told you the story.
Interviewer,How i got my car so i had one car that was falling apart and we were driving down the road and you there was a car.
Cuban,That you could tell would have been abandoned and so I was a Trans Am like where this is going yeah I was like.
Interviewer,Okay and i forget exactly how it led to it but um we stopped open the door and I was like.
Cuban,This car is abandoned you could just and so I found some paperwork like you know an envelope that was like a note from.
Interviewer,The bank you're overdue and all that kind of stuff so I called the bank and said look I can't get credit all my.
Cuban,Credit cards have been cut up and everything but I found this car there's no way but somebody had been making this.
Interviewer, would you let me take over the payments yeah kidding and then let me take over the payments just like that.
Cuban,Just like that because otherwise they were you know they were lost the money on it oh my god I can't even think to do.
Interviewer,That yeah well when you're when you're struggling and you're broken you don't have a car that's gonna last more than.
Cuban,Another 10 miles i mean you know one of those beaters that you had to have oil in it the car I drove to Dallas in had a.
Interviewer,Hole in the floorboard so literally i'd see like the white lines going underneath my feet and I had to stop for.
Cuban,Oil you know every 60 miles it was awful not good for dating here's what I find fault in your story which I don't quite.
Interviewer,Get you said you had nothing to lose so you lose a job you get fired you've been fired a few times before I get that but.
Cuban,I would think with the situation where you were living with you roommates behind in your bills needing a car I.
Interviewer,Would think it would be quite the contrary I would think the first thing I would think of is let me get a decent.
Cuban,Job where i get some bucks under my belt until I could regroup and then maybe go out so here's my business because here's.
Interviewer,What leads my firing um you know i just closed a deal that was gonna lead to a fifteen hundred dollar commission and I.
Cuban,What i i was supposed to clunk come in and open up the store and I said I'm making that executive decision to go out.
Interviewer,There and collect the check thinking the guys get my boss is going to love me when I bring back the check you forgot.
Cuban,You were an executive yeah exactly right and so he fired me but I knew I can sell and I developed relationships with some.
Interviewer,People so i went to a company called architectural lighting and they wanted this time and billing saw forth and I.
Cuban,Said look i got no money but if you fought me the $500 and this which is what I would sell it to you for in the.
Interviewer,Car and me the car the software cost me $250 to buy you know I'll make it work and if it doesn't work then I'll find.
Cuban,Some way to get your money back i'll wash your car sweep before whatever and they said yes and so that kind of led to.
Interviewer,Me going that's right so i'm picturing this is a guy that walks into the store that you met in the store and the guy.
Cuban,Looked at he a smart savvy guy and probably figured there's kids on the ball skids is that.
Interviewer,That's who you approach you met him at the store and found that is your first customers.
Cuban,Well that was an opportunity most people would incite you grabbed it rid of the flagpole turned out okay very okay I.
Interviewer,Would say way way way beyond okay so what's it with you and these surprises you like to buy yourself okay I think.
Cuban,It's a little strange right but obviously you're rich enough to talk about justify it okay but you had for.
Interviewer,Your very first business that you sold micro solutions you went out and you bought yourself and you only sold I.
Cuban,Should say only i guess it's all relative you're sold and I should say for six million dollars yeah the first.
Interviewer,"Thing you do is you run right out and you buy $250,000 ticket so you can fly around the world first-class okay wasn't."
Cuban,The ticket it was a lifetime pass also anyway you walk up to the rest of my site yeah for the rest of my life Wow.
Interviewer,Yeah so we went out and got just torched me my friends um count like you folks do and anyway you're not torched come on.
Cuban,They're all working high they all work hard and so we went to these bunnies old school steak houses that had you know.
Interviewer,How they have the phones you know where you just plug them in yeah and so I mean I could barely talk and they're like.
Cuban,What are you going to get on my mind in two cars I have a place to live you know and I'd fly a lot and I flew so much I.
Interviewer,Remembered the american airlines number it was one eight hundred four three three six four six four right yeah and.
Cuban,So i'm like i call him pick it up and like and I'm like you guys that I'm stumbling do you guys sell lifetime.
Interviewer,Passes what you mean you never heard of a lifetime passenger so I want to set myself up for life yeah yeah and I.
Cuban,Called him and they were like yeah let us but let us put you to the life to the air pass Department and so I bought one.
Interviewer,And it was me and anybody wanted to take to go anywhere in the world on an American Airlines flight for the rest of.
Cuban,My life for two people yes do you mind if I ask you where that pass is now use Jason as it Jason so you have to give it.
Interviewer,To someone else to use oh i you can give it to one person but I'd give it to my dad but my dad passed then we were like.
Cuban,Okay you know i'll give it to jason because he works for me in fly's life yeah you have to picture Jason if you.
Interviewer,Would jason could probably do anything his life he cares to do I would say would be a fair description Jason but.
Cuban,Instead of doing everything in life that he might do he around the doors Mark Cuban you got a.
Interviewer,Seat this young jason and the way he looks at mark is a love affair of a lifetime it is yeah well he got paid off.
Cuban,He got this ticket yep and i want to ask you do you think he would take me with him wherever he's going to go every day.
Interviewer,One row not cooking well you know what i think I'll hold out I think what I'm gonna hold out is for what you did with.
Cuban,Your money when you went on to sell your new business or your second business and what did you buy with that you didn't.
Interviewer,Just settle for a lifetime pass was that my fourth business but yeah it was um about the Mavericks with me the plane.
Cuban,The plane the jet yeah the jet yeah online so that was like you know to me you know one of the things my dad taught.
Interviewer,Me the one most valuable asset you don't own is your time right and so you know I always wanted my motivation a lot of.
Cuban,Respects was to just retire so my first company always wanted to retire by the time I was 35 I did it when I was 29 and.
Interviewer,Then when i started back up again um and really went back at it with Todd at broadcast comm then we sold that and it.
Cuban,Was like okay i can afford a plane what's cooler than that and so I said you know you know I'm an internet guy so.
Interviewer,I got to practice what i preach and so i bought it online 40 million dollars it's not the first plane that was actually.
Cuban,Bought online yeah first and only if the biggest purchase ever made online ever to this.
Interviewer,Day and why the plane and why such a big-ass plane it wasn't like you got yourself a little tiny there was a very.
Cuban,Specific reason because i could that's really though just because you put it so you get enough seats to bring anybody.
Interviewer,You happy because okay so i'll give you another story when I was 16 my dad would get me these beater cars right just the.
Cuban,Nastiest ugliest 50 dollar cars he could find and back then like a sporty car would be like a Mazda rx-7 um and he.
Interviewer,Found that just old nasty one but he also found a station wagon and I wanted the station wagon because I could take.

Interviewer,Said i love mark i love everything about him he hasn't changed a bit and that's the messaging I heard from every single.
Cuban,One of your childhood high school college friends from that party to your great credit I never thought I would I.
Interviewer,Would meet a billionaire when everybody said he hasn't changed one bit I was an idiot then and that's what they said.

Interviewer,Hold it for a long time become a businessman who knows basketball he's on a this will fill in the blank between.
Cuban,Our know i thought i'd hold it for a long time yeah you know way more than a love affair how about your wife Tiffany.
Interviewer,I met her at the party i met her only one time before at the shark tank said a number of years ago she strikes me and.
Cuban,Personalities opposite to you yeah yeah she's laid-back she's releasing notoriety.
Interviewer,We kind of just stick to where we go all the time you know we stick to our friends and you know we know if I go.
Cuban,Someplace like an award show what's going to happen if I go someplace different what's going to happen well it.
Interviewer,Goes with you for those things obsession she's not yes she's not big into that stuff.
Cuban,Really big into kids oh yeah yeah now that my kids are older is it's a lot more fun to take them everywhere too so.
Interviewer,I could take jake who's 10 or alyssa will go with me still she's 13 my 16 year old doesn't know I exist anymore.
Cuban,The minute she turned 16 i got really stupid but yeah but it's still the best thing that ever happened to me.
Interviewer,Yeah why'd you wait so long to get married I know you're a player you played the field you had the most.
Cuban,Gorgeous woman on your arms your whole entire look not really yes that's true I've seen photos now because I was so.
Interviewer,Into business you know i i dated some women for an extended period of time and it multiple times it came down to you.
Cuban,Know me or your business and i gave him the standard answer what was your name you know looks like that yeah just like.
Interviewer,That because you know if you knew me if you dated me you knew me and you knew where my my motivation my focus was and.
Cuban,Why was tiffany able to settle in on that say that's okay because we didn't get married till after I sold all the.
Interviewer,Companies and everything and so she had to believe you're gonna jump out and do something what you know what stay busy.
Cuban,Right night then i do things but yeah i mean it was just she was the right complement to me at the right time at.
Interviewer,The right time at hey all right let's talk money and I'm not talking about money and I hope you don't mind me.
Cuban,Asking but when i sold my business for 66 million dollars to everyone I knew from my birth to that moment in time.
Interviewer,Everyone thought i was on easy street and I must be in a different universe and like I had not a care in the world.
Cuban,Like amazing what does that feel like everybody said what does it feel like what does it feel like and for me it was.
Interviewer,So frightening i just locked up my money for two years I didn't spend a dime I don't go out and buy a plane or a ticket.
Cuban,Or and i should have in hindsight but what does it feel like not to be a million millionaires have problems they.
Interviewer,Buy too big a house they have a bad downturn in the market they still have worries but what does it feel like to be.
Cuban,A billionaire i don't even know how what's that a million million or a thousand million I'm really a thousand.
Interviewer,Million that wasn't million what does it just feel like you wake up in the morning do you think I can't believe it.
Cuban,I think that all the time you wake up and you think that yeah all the time not just wake up but you just look around.
Interviewer,And just go how did this happen um like you can't believe it like it was popped like oh the Ranger often partial luck.
Cuban,Shushing yeah all the above right no one gets to be this rich without a lot of luck you know it wasn't my plan that the.
Interviewer,Internet stock market took off when it did you know Shaq gave me one time about oh you're lucky you're lucky I.
Cuban,Like shaq did you plan to grow to be seven foot two you know he'll say yeah you know you you've got to recognize.
Interviewer,When you're lucky and i was lucky now you know they say luck is when preparation opportunity meets.
Cuban,Preparation and so no question i busted my ass and had I not worked as hard it would not have happened and you also.
Interviewer,Have to be smart too because you know when we sold broadcast Todd nine we sorted for stock and when we sold it the.
Cuban,Stock was way up there and it went up even higher and I was like how much money do I need I mean I just don't need.
Interviewer,Any more money so i did something called a collar where I sold calls and bought puts which protected me in case there.
Cuban,Was a downturn because i'd seen this this game before we're kinda like creating your insurance policy are you.
Interviewer,Sure you got you state wealthy exactly right and so I've seen it before with with companies when I traded a lot of.
Cuban,Stocks um and so you know i hedged my i hedged all of it and when the internet stocks crashed I still had all my money.
Interviewer,And i even made a little bit and that protected me and they called it one the top ten trades in the history of Wall.
Cuban,Street but that wasn't luck that was no that was yeah that was planning yeah that was planning and not being greedy.
Interviewer,But you know back to your question if it was crazy I mean it's still inconceivable and it's just you know I.
Cuban,Just money money buys you comfort money buys you sanity in some respects money takes away a lot of the stress of paying.
Interviewer,The bills then i that we've all been through it at certain points but but it doesn't make you happy if you know it's.
Cuban,Like why not you remove all that from the plate why wouldn't you be happy what's left to be unhappy about well.
Interviewer,Yeah i mean look i was happy when i was broke you know and it's like I tell you know people whenever there's a big.
Cuban,Lottery jackpot of a billion dollars people always call me so I would you know what do you like if you if you were.
Interviewer,Miserable when you were broke money's not gonna change that you know if you were happy living your life when when.
Cuban,You know you were living paycheck to paycheck and all of a sudden you make it big you know it's you're smart you're.
Interviewer,Gonna love your life even more and i think that's what happened to me I just try not to take it for granted I try to.
Cuban,Enjoy it no I really the biggest benefit of it other than this the lack of stress in.
Interviewer,Terms of paying bills is i can do things that buy me time you know I for example yeah I like the plane or you know people.
Cuban,Will i think i can make things happen more quickly by paying a little bit more and that's important because times the.
Interviewer,One asset you can't own buy or get back i remind me when you say buy time you put some time for one of the friends I.
Cuban,Don't know from which chapter of your life but from one of the younger chapters I met also at your party I.
Interviewer,Could write a book on my huge just based on the conversations and I'm hoping they're all true but this is a story.
Cuban,This guy said he said he was sick in a hospital outside of Dallas some of the city a long distance away he was very.
Interviewer,Sick and had some weird-ass disease that they couldn't put their finger on your own age your own peer and he said you.
Cuban,Heard about him he never reached out to you but you heard about him through someone and you sent your jet to pick.
Interviewer,Him up out of that hospital you didn't know what was happening fly over to Dallas and put him in the.
Cuban,Best hospital with the best care and he was cured same true story I don't know no you gotta back me up say of course I.
Interviewer,Know you don't remember a day like that yeah the guy credited you right there on the floor of your party was there at the.
Cuban,Bar if he was there at the party then it's probably true but yeah I don't remember it unbelievable yeah well that.
Interviewer,Day before i remember but if there was one thing you wake up in the morning and you pinch yourself and you say hey you.
Cuban,Know i can't billionaire what's the thought that you associate with that thought right after a billionaire and.
Interviewer,And and what how am i gonna enjoy it you know and how does it impact my family and how can i impact the world.
Cuban,You know um those are three vastly different things yeah one's protective one's giving one's just about yourself.
Interviewer,And what about your family how do you protect them how do you protect them from the notoriety I think it's a bigger.
Cuban,Issue than anything else yeah i mean it's not even so much the notoriety because you know when people stop and.
Interviewer,Ask for things whatever they kind of know just to wait a second and I'll deal with it and I just kind of explain to.
Cuban,Them it's i'm just gonna be nice and if I'm nice it goes by very quickly and everybody's happy your kids don't mind.
Interviewer,Standing by the sidelines and you're you're being gracious to this know that yeah and I try to use it as a point look.
Cuban,If i can be nice to strangers you could be nice to anybody you know anybody that you deal.
Interviewer,With and you know i had this thing with my daughter not long ago where she made a comment I didn't appreciate to.
Cuban,Somebody else that i didn't think was right and I had to go through the whole talk of look we're very fortunate but.
Interviewer,You have to treat people with respect period end of story sorry you know my biggest fear for them.
Cuban,Is that they're gonna end up being entitled jerks and you know this is an example of potentially being an entitled.
Interviewer,Jerk is that how you want to be in that how you want to be perceived you know in high school in college and you know is.
Cuban,That who do you want to be and she got all upset I go upset but you know that that's my biggest fear after their.
Interviewer,Health but you stopped it right then and there when you saw it yeah tolerate it know you know and how did they deal with.
Cuban,Being mark cuban's daughter mark cuban's son they must have that in their face all the time yeah and they really don't.
Interviewer,Talk to me about it now i really don't ask him about it I'm a whole lot because you know and they have it in common with.
Cuban,Each other yeah and it's not like i want to say hey I'm famous what do you think house affecting you and you know then it.
Interviewer,Comes up from various points on but i think my wife really has dealt with that better you know in terms of dealing with.
Cuban,The kids because she has to deal with it the same way well so I think the long ways and so much more on the kids no.
Interviewer,Matter what the dad does yeah i mean i think particularly with my daughter's not maybe not as much of my son even.
Cuban,Though he's a mama's boy a certain level but yeah I mean we I could spend time with all of them and but there are I.
Interviewer,Think there's certain things they give like I have to deal with the tough subjects you know talking to my daughter.
Cuban,About you know drinking and you know boys and my wife's like you deal with that and I think my wife deals with the.
Interviewer,School in the day to day stuff so that good partnership isn't a pair of minimum right okay so you invest in a lot of.
Cuban,Businesses i see or in shark tank anything I say you want Shark Tank to ICU and yes amazing all that work yeah.
Interviewer,But the businesses you invest in our across the board I can't honestly say well what is Mark like best I could do.
Cuban,That with all the other sharks i cannot say that I would have to probably if I was guessing I would say I think he.
Interviewer,Likes the people best that's about it and I'm not sure I'm right on that and I've sat across to you for what nine.
Cuban,Years yeah you think i have the mo down but what what is it so sometimes you so first you have to ask why do i do Shark.
Interviewer,Tank you know and i do sorry tank to send a message that the American Dream is alive and well.
Cuban,That you can be anywhere in the country and start a company and make it to the carpet in front of us and potentially.
Interviewer,Get a deal or not even need to come and see us and and so that's why I do the show and that kind of drives what I.
Cuban,Invest in and so we're you know you guys might only do a deal because of the economic benefit I might do a deal.
Interviewer,Because of the social benefit as well or because I like the entrepreneur and you know I want to help that person so it's.
Cuban,Not charity but because i think i can make I'm arrogant enough to think I can make all those businesses work yes yes.
Interviewer,But i hear you don't what no no the course they don't I tell everybody all mine agree yeah of course yeah then I.
Cuban,Hear you talk about well this one but ya know you're the first one to say this one was yeah you know and some of the.
Interviewer,Entrepreneurs are just idiots and and you try your best and sometimes they listen sometimes they don't cuz you're a.
Cuban,Telltale sign when you get involved in the deal for those of people who don't know you know we make the deal on shark.
Interviewer,Tank it's a handshake deal that we do the due diligence right let's say you go down and do diligence to the first week.
Cuban,Or two they're telltale sign that you know a you're either gonna be used by the entrepreneur or B these people are.
Interviewer,Never going to make you money and then what's your out of that like what do you say hey forget it let's close this deal.
Cuban,Down well if they're lying about the numbers obviously a lot right away my mom's mistake a lot of the guys I work.
Interviewer,With make honest mistake yeah i mean there's one as well you know we didn't ask about the credit card debt you know.
Cuban,"You know it's a deal for $100,000 for 10% million dollar valuation and you know you look at it and then they have."
Interviewer,"50,000 and sales okay i expected that that's what you said but there's a hundred thousand dollars in credit card."
Cuban,Debt pretty scary yeah and it did it didn't come up at all and it wasn't their fault that we didn't ask that.
Interviewer,Question it just didn't come up it's like the sin of omission yeah so you're out right away you won't reconsider.
Cuban,Though i'll still consider it but then i just really business you know I really try to stick to the terms that you know.
Interviewer,You and eyes have done deals together so we we both try to stick to the terms that we agree to but you know what but.
Cuban,What really for me or turn-offs when immediately they try to raise their salaries you know if they're trying to.
Interviewer,Use that money immediately to put it in their sign your contract I've always meant to ask you can't forget you school.
Cuban,Your other contract no none of the money is used for salaries yeah we try to say that right but someone will still come.
Interviewer,Back yeah and there's things they'll come back so we try to be protective in the.
Cuban,Trek so that you can't just immediately raise money two days later you you know you can't immediately delude us in other.
Interviewer,Ways and just you know and sometimes now you know because now that the people that come on Shark Tank they all talk to.
Cuban,Each other you know so they know all the deals that have been done and all the legal issues and everything and so if if.
Interviewer,All of a sudden they have a lawyer that's done 30 shark tank deals Avery you really run into that yeah Wow and so.
Cuban,Then i know they don't really want to deal you know because they got a lawyer who typically didn't even deal.
Interviewer,What about the guy that you feel like is using you since it on the show or you don't and then you're getting involved.
Cuban,In the deal and you realize they're just using you they don't want to close so that kind of you oh yeah yeah yeah any.
Interviewer,Times a year would you say we'll do chores like if I you know if I do 1516 deals in a year you know probably five.
Cuban,Or six yeah well i do a lot less deals and humans I have a hell of a lot less money but I can tell you I get one a.
Interviewer,Year first it's a game here we bet on them I wonder which one ya know it for sure because you know you you you get.
Cuban,The people that are there just for the commercial and they don't really want the deal or they want to be able to say.
Interviewer,Like i had to at least to this year where the deal didn't close and for little things that they introduced and.
Cuban,They were out there doing all the media oh yeah Marc's a great investor and this than that I don't like I don't even talk.
Interviewer,To your ass right yeah so yeah you don't like yeah for sure okay so I've known you for a long time and I would have to.
Cuban,Say when people say what's more cuban like are the only people that people ask me about I have to say what's Kevin like.
Interviewer,Because before you notice everybody thinks he's a bastard right here that too.
Cuban,The next question is what's more cuban like and I just have the same ol ants I go he has an entire zest for living and.
Interviewer,What you see is what you get i want to come up with something more exciting but that's what comes not boring at all but.

Cuban,Yeah maybe i'll wear the the i don't know we'll see maybe I just won't wear shirt at all I get a good enough shape.
Interviewer,That's what let me tell you what these sharks say behind your back that fascinates us what was none of us are.
Cuban,Able to pull it out which is your ability to answer a text the minute you get it emails emails emails text phone.
Interviewer,Calls how is it that we don't hear from your assistant who's an assistant to an assistant and that you are on your game.
Cuban,And write on everything it sounds it just strikes us like this is the weirdest thing you put three days behind.

Cuban,The quantity you get everybody wants to catch you like going back in my business career it's always been easier for me.
Interviewer,Just to do it then to explain to somebody what I want and then for them to go look at it then then bring it to.
Cuban,Me and says you know do you want to take a look at this because you might be interested in this you know it's just.
Interviewer,Easier for me because i've always done email I mean I have emails going back 25 years you know and it's just like delete.
Cuban,Delete delete delete you know i can just read the first paragraph and know as opposed to somebody not knowing sitting.
Interviewer,Down reviewing everything explaining it to them you know trying to adjust and figure out what to do next it's just.
Cuban,Easier for me to do it faster you can kind of get in a business deal because it's more effective it's faster and you.
Interviewer,Know your best judgment is your own judgment but I don't get it with all this stuff you do I don't get why you.
Cuban,Don't have a barrier between you and the world why would I because it saves time now I.
Interviewer,Know it's the exact opposite no i think it does save time the number of hours in the day so far as people getting at you.
Cuban,Don't you want a barrier between you and all the people who want to get out should they're not a little business to.
Interviewer,You no no no that's the fun part of life unbelievable I think I'll be frightened to death I do that for a day know the.
Cuban,Cooks i get at you that way makes it even more fun oh my god what we're finding out today is Mark Cuban is not.
Interviewer,Who i always thought he was he is a nut job I do yeah yeah for sure these are not.
Cuban,The right answers so have another plug mark you're online texting you're on the email you're constantly on on on on on.
Interviewer,Have you pull out the plug or is it not necessary is out of fallacy yeah I don't need to unplug for the most part I mean.
Cuban,I'll play with my kids you know you know chase around my daughter take him to school pick him up go play basketball.
Interviewer,Work out just the normal stuff you know constant flow so there's not a category for your family a category for your work.
Cuban,Anything like no it's just you know just trying to do the right thing try to connect with my family and be available.
Interviewer,To them do fun stuff with them and i mean look you know with the kids the kids I'm my kids ages it's more about.
Cuban,Them than their parents right and so it's more I have to work harder to interject myself where I can and you.
Interviewer,Know try to get their time and you know kidnap them to go to lunch or my son's attend is still fun like you know we.
Cuban,Will go get a hotel room he ice cream and tell fart jokes all night you know for him to stay up until 2:00 in the.
Interviewer,Morning right you know and do stupid stuff and so yeah but yeah with my 13 and 16 year old it's like everything's a.
Cuban,One-word answer so alyssa howard tryouts cuz she has basketball size oh okay what'd you do play basketball keep.
Interviewer,Making his shots it's basketball she missed any shots we played basketball dad what do you think get off.

Interviewer,So but she's like i'm study dad leave me alone leave me alone and so what you wake me up dang it you know or she.
Cuban,Thinks she's cool right so she'll say freakin all the time right or instead of giving me the finger she'll give me a.
Interviewer,Pinky right you know she's got her own little ways around it then so and I just laugh at it but yeah they're good kids.
Cuban,And so it's fun to spend as much time as I can one thing I didn't see in the children that I met the night of your.
Interviewer,Party is no arrogance i didn't see an ounce of arrogance and you can usually see that from across oh yeah yeah and I.
Cuban,Mean then the reason to be arrogant i mean they're good kids they really really are and I'm proud of them.
Interviewer,You think they're gonna talk about you the way you talk about your father I hope so yeah I hope so really they're.
Cuban,Gonna have that similar relationship i think you know they're gonna call me stupid and silly and goofy and they're.
Interviewer,Right you know but that's hopefully what makes it fun okay so let me ask you it's just one last question maybe - no - more.
Cuban,Or less I'm here for you barb whatever you need okay what are you working on now that no.
Interviewer,One knows about why don't give me a secret so I can say I know something about mark that no one else knows what.
Cuban,He's working on right now so i'm working on a lot of health care stuff and balance you think that's a growing.
Interviewer,Industry no don't even a lucky break or what happens no more because I think what's happening with health care in.
Cuban,This country is back-ass half words that nothing we're doing really works as well as it should and it started when the.
Interviewer,Republicans we're looking to do a repeal and replace and get rid of Obamacare what.
Cuban,Has its own problems but i just started saying okay if I was going to solve this as a business person how would I.
Interviewer,Approach it so i just started you know working with some economist and working with a lot of healthcare people both.
Cuban,From the publicans and democrats side and so we're making some progress there's a lot of good thing you're doing.
Interviewer,Is pro bono work it's not with an i Twitter no no I don't care if I make any money at all look I don't I stopped.
Cuban,Trying to just make as much money as i could a long time ago I've got enough money right it's more I value my time a.
Interviewer,Lot more than i do my next dollar i don't have to worry about money but you know I just want to you know try to look.
Cuban,Back at some point and say okay i didn't  it up what do you think is wrong with the health care system nobody seem.
Interviewer,To have solved that at all really yeah he's critical the fundamental problem is not everybody can get the care they need.
Cuban,It the cost they can afford i think people understand that concept though nobody seems to agree on how to skin.
Interviewer,That cat yeah and there's a lot of ideologies and I'm trying to you know balance the two together and bringing.
Cuban,Them together but fundamentally we have to make people healthier and to do you know if people are healthier they.
Interviewer,Consume less health care until they're older right and for long-term care um and there's ways to approach that.
Cuban,There's ways to the the drug system is such a mess right now and so I started a company there because there's so many in.
Interviewer,Efficiencies people will start companies in the pharmacy industry and then the big guys will just buy em out and those.
Cuban,Just starts companies know when they're going to get bought out as opposed to trying to change the game so we're.
Interviewer,Starting companies that aren't looking to get bought even though we've already had offers to sell the company and then.
Cuban,Do it right you're gonna get blood yes i won't do it right yeah I won't I won't sell it I'd rather turn them upside down.
Interviewer,And disrupt the industry and then in terms of healthcare programs I think there's a you know I'm modeling I'm.
Cuban,"Working with the rand corporation to model a hybrid of single-payer so if your makeup - let's just say $40,000."
Interviewer,Your healthcare should be free if you make between 40 to a million dollars a year then you should pay some percentage.
Cuban,Of your income in total yeah yeah and that's the whole point right so you know nobody.
Interviewer,The average person is gonna pay 8% of their health care 8% of their income for health care total all in no exceptions.
Cuban,But how are you going to let's assume you come up with a premise that you really believe you can pull out.
Interviewer,That won't really work without being a politician without having that power behind you what are you gonna do is it.
Cuban,So i've been i've been everywhere with it I've been in front of Republican and Democratic senators candidates you name.
Interviewer,It i've sat in front of them and to make a suggestion no just a second on their own well no because they everybody knows.
Cuban,It's a problem yes the good news is i don't give money to any political candidates so I can be independent and.
Interviewer,So they know that there needs to be a solution and you know they're listening to me so where I'm at right now is you.
Cuban,Know i've learned from everybody i've taken input over the last two and a half years from everybody with a different.
Interviewer,Opinion and put it together into a plan and now it's getting modeled by a bunch of economists at the RAND Corporation is.
Cuban,Like the biggest thank you yeah exactly and so you know that the numbers come out the way I think they will then I'll.
Interviewer,Have a i'll have something to say look here's what you think here's what the numbers say here's what how you would.
Cuban,Approach it here's how i to provide it's still an option you got to get them to listen to you unless you run that's my.
Interviewer,Job yeah that's my job then for anything no I mean the family I ordered the town really yeah you know when I met Tiffany.
Cuban,At your home the first thing i said is mark gonna run what you say you know and after that everybody said is Mark gonna.
Interviewer,Run i said no no i believe tiffany yeah because yeah we have family vote and they said no well you're dodged a bullet.
Cuban,Is you like your enemy on the shark tanks it's always dodged a bullet when I get past ok back to shark tank good.
Interviewer,What's what's your complaint with robert ICU it's a truth you're in your seat when Robert does something it's oh it's.
Cuban,Robert he's the nicest guy in the world he's a nice guy I like rocks you what yes you know it's me uh Robert give me.
Interviewer,The list it must be more than one no it's just you know everybody's got the type of.
Cuban,Person really you know that annoys them and just Robert screaming at the top of his lungs all the time Robert screaming.
Interviewer,At the top ok wait i'll do my robert surely you want to get down sorry do my Robert recitation you do I you know it's.
Cuban,Funny i never thought of a picture of Robert screaming at the time that's true yes oh you're gonna do it I don't have.
Interviewer,To do it you're gonna do it oh okay well that's cute what's wrong with that it was cute the first 327 times God you.
Cuban,Just can't tolerate it okay what's wrong with Lori Eileen the Lord doesn't look that Norma except when she's going to.
Interviewer,Look we all know you're mumbling my yeah and so we're all long-winded at some level when we go on right because that's.
Cuban,The hardest part of the show is going out and not sounding stupid it's only that two people is saying why is.
Interviewer,Figuring out why are you gonna go out when you know why you want to go out why is that the hardest part of show.
Cuban,Business on shark tank because you want to sound smart and you want to contribute something to the entrepreneur.
Interviewer,You want them to know you want to leave them with something of value that makes them a little bit smarter about their.
Cuban,Business and you want to do it in a way that sounds like you care and sometimes you do and sometimes you don't and you.
Interviewer,Know you want to get you want to get it over with and that literally if somebody walks on.
Cuban,I'm guessing you do the same thing that I know there's just no chance that I'm gonna do it absolutely no when you're.
Interviewer,Out right away yeah and i'm already thinking okay what am I going to say yeah we take endless notes that all outs.
Cuban,No one can use that when that's been used not bad but it's so hard to come up with an out that hasn't been done five.
Interviewer,Hundred sizable so there's an old old episode where the guy called me cubes right and I said yeah juice is for.
Cuban,Calling me cubes i'm out yeah and wasn't cause he called me cubes it was just an opportunity to go out what she bother.
Interviewer,Back you know i don't care everybody calls me cubes I don't care but I needed a way to go out and that's so funny oh.
Cuban,My god who's your favorite shark yeah i know it no now what'd I tell you but I tell you all the time why do I tell you.
Interviewer,You're my favorite shark oh i don't like to what do I tell you that you're really really good at better than all the other.
Cuban,Sharks i know exactly what it is but i want everybody here what is it no fool barbers get the best.
Interviewer,People skills yeah yeah she's her ability to recognize begin bad in somebody and what they'll be like as an.
Cuban,Entrepreneur what would be like as a person are they kind compassionate willing to work I have they had their.
Interviewer,Backs up against the wall Barbara picks up on that stuff in a minute it's funny enough mark you but I.
Cuban,Think you pick up on that better than i do no there's no way I mean because I look.
Interviewer,At the numbers i look at the business and I try to drill down to see okay good and then the arrogant part of me says.
Cuban,Well i can fix that you know where is that where you in your case you look that's a character flaw you see it all.
Interviewer,The time you know this this this but your character flaw is this and I just don't trust that so I can't do business.
Cuban,With you why didn't i see that yeah and so what do you think on the opposite side of the equation when.
Interviewer,You're excited about an entrepreneur or a business partner or a life partner what do you think is the one thing that.
Cuban,You think makes a person a winner and i hate these questions one thing I know but I'll rephrase it what do you think.
Interviewer,Is one of the most important things that you use as your measuring stick to say that person where that person is.
Cuban,Worthwhile having them as a purpose of my life whatever P says are they learners are they workers will they.
Interviewer,Admit they're wrong and adjust you know you've got to be very agile in business you've got to be very adaptive in.
Cuban,Business it's not just all one way to the highway and I think if somebody is willing to adjust willing to work hard.
Interviewer,And is always learning and always selling then good things will happen if I find on the flip side if someone's.
Cuban,Always looking for an ounce you know if only I raise more money if only we marketed more if only you know our.
Interviewer,Advertising was better if only i had the right person if only this if only that and everything's an excuse then it never.
Cuban,Works and you consider that a character flaw yeah it repeats itself yeah be good because.
Interviewer,I'm sure you see a - it was the best idea was the best this but we just didn't raise enough money if only we had.
Cuban,More money why didn't you know you knew that going in you know if only i iron lots of times someone will try to come.
Interviewer,Up in and say well this isn't working we need to hire the right person and then they'll say well I think I've.
Cuban,Got the best marketing person in the world like that person was so great as a marketing person they weren't leaving.
Interviewer,Where they were before because they want to let them go or they'd be doing their own thing but they'll try to hire that.
Cuban,One person that saves the company and when you do that that typically means it's over and you.
Interviewer,Know when i hear any of that I don't really internalize the stories a lot about it yeah go ahead oh yeah.
Cuban,Tranquil ready yeah leave a little bit for me okay I want to say I got I got to drink out of the same bottle as you it's.
Interviewer,My diseases yeah yeah but um my reaction to that is always like a southern feeling of hopelessness I just I don't.
Cuban,Know where that comes from i feel hopeless about the business I can't even quantify yeah when somebody just has an.
Interviewer,Excuse for everything you feel like you're gonna hear the next one the next one okay so what about the character.
Cuban,Flaw in a friendship or what turns you on about a friend why do you choose other than the old friends who with you.
Interviewer,I don't really care i haven't i haven't gone looking for new friends but people find you and you make friendships easily.
Cuban,Yeah so what is it that attracts you to something yeah I'll let them be my friend or forget it I mean there's.
Interviewer,Running buddies and there's friends friend you know becoming a friend happens over years you know it's not.
Cuban,Something that oh we're besties right you're my new BFF you know it takes time it wears running buddies oh yeah let's.
Interviewer,Go to the game let's let's go hang out and get a drink or let's all go out to dinner you know that those people come.
Cuban,And go and it's it's no big deal how many close friends would you consider you have um I mean I have a lot.
Interviewer,Of close friends but yeah you know from when I first moved to Dallas they're still the same friends.
Cuban,People have worked with people i grew up with people I went to college with I don't know there's you know probably 15.
Interviewer,20 but you know i think the greatness of my friends is we don't have to talk every day and if we don't see each other.
Cuban,For a year or two like we just did a boy's trip that was we hadn't done in 10 years and we all got together and did.
Interviewer,Stupid stuff in vegas um a little bit not as stupid as we used to do but I'm sure but yeah but it was like we'd been.
Cuban,Doing it every year you know and so like it got together some last year exactly and so they're all they'll.
Interviewer,Always be my friends and will always be close but you know you know what like you know when you have a family you have.
Cuban,Kids that's your friendship those your friends right and so you don't have as.
Interviewer,Much time like when i was single and it was like what are we doing tonight you have a hard time trusting all those.
Cuban,People you cited it was all prior to college or during college old friends before you were a billionaire do you.
Interviewer,Have a hard time trusting people's motivations no because I don't need anything from them.
Cuban,Well said wow you know it's not like okay you know a lot of times with friendships particular when you're.
Interviewer,Younger it's like alright i need that emotional support I want somebody in my life that's gonna be there for me I.
Cuban,Don't need that from anybody so it's like if you're my friend you're my friend and if not okay whatever yeah.
Interviewer,Kuban as usual 150% of r-cubed thanks bud thank you so much no fun really thank you so much.
Cuban,I love you up there but you'd have to replace them with somebody else which would be hard cuz you're so goddamn.
Interviewer,Loyal yeah he's good guy good guy oh you got a great Krueger yeah everybody's good come on.
Cuban,I don't hire any luck good people i mean I've got a workout buddy I've got me everything yeah I kind of borrow all.
Interviewer,Your people here you know when i come to New York yeah that's shopping there you're.
Cuban,Working out with her dad's body what's even more shocking is I never found out about it until I heard from somebody.
Interviewer,From your own family why you didn't tell me you did too bad you're in the back row that's never a good sign no cuz I.
Cuban,They knew the routine like i got there they've been doing the routine for months.
Interviewer,Yeah and i said okay and then i want to get another time you know yeah like I saw what she said okay okay she said you.
Cuban,- out right before the ending which i thought that's no I didn't don't know but that that the budget but stuff.
Interviewer,Destroyed me destroyed me like one cheek was like ruined for her a month but it's so joyful is it no.
Cuban,Yeah the dance party fun but yeah the police don't have any mention there's like a bar workout part was easy I mean.
Interviewer,That was fine but the the the bar part work on your cheeks and me yeah I just don't have that flexibility right you're.
Cuban,Like it's like a dog beam and you know you're like yeah yeah give me the hip flexibility right yeah let me show you my wall Shamy.
Interviewer,"So Mark, there's been a lot of interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing over the past several years. We all saw how IBM's Watson Supercomputer dominated on Jeopardy. And now we're seeing a new technology take hold, something called #RPA that is gaining momentum. What do you think about the future of Artificial Intelligence, and where the industry is headed?"
Cuban,"You know, I've said it before and I'll say it again. In 10 years a liberal arts degree in philosophy will be worth more than a traditional programming degree. What is happening now with artificial intelligence is we'll start automating automation. Artificial intelligence won't need you or I to do it, it will be able to figure out itself how to automate  over the next 10 to 15 years. Now the hard part isn't whether or not it will change the nature of the work force, it will. But, the question is, over the period of time that it happens, who will be displaced? Marc Andreessen used to say that software is eating the world. Now, I believe, automation is going to eat the world."
Interviewer,"Wow, finally some good news for those liberal arts and philosophy majors! So, if that's going to happen, what are people who lack tangible skills, such as the philosophy majors you mention what are they going to do in this new era of automation?"
Cuban,"Well, I wouldn't say they don't have tangible skills. Knowing how to critically think and assess from a global perspective, I think, is going to be more valuable than what we see as exciting careers today which might be programming or accounting or those types of things. And frankly, the speed at which we're seeing automation permeate the workplace, scares the s- out of me. However much change you saw over the last 10 years with the iPhone, over the last 20 years with the Internet, over the last 30 years with PCs, etc., that is nothing. Nothing! We'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than in the last 30."
Interviewer,"So forget those typical 'safe' majors and study something you really enjoy, something you can be passionate about. Because many of those safe career paths are going to be automated. Is that what you're saying?"
Cuban,"I would tell people to follow their passion, even if it's in something that doesn't have an obvious job prospect but teaches you how to think. Look, I was passionate about baseball until I realized all I had was a 70 MPH fastball. I'm a realist so I gave that up and started focusing on things I could be really good (and competitive) at. And the more I worked at it, the better I got. I realized, nobody quits anything they are good at because it's fun to be good at something. But a lot of jobs are going to go away a lot faster than anyone imagined, even if you are good at it. Being able to learn and think...that's the future."
Interviewer,"Okay, so you believe automation is coming at an even faster rate than we've seen before. But didn't you revoke the credentials of two ESPN writers (Mark Stein and Tim MacMahon) who cover the Mavericks in 2016, because of your concern that they were relying on automated game reports that could (and would) eventually replace human-generated content? What's the story?"
Cuban,"While it may seem counter-intuitive to ban someone from covering us as a way of stopping automation, it really was my only option. I was worried about a lack of high quality in-depth coverage of every game, combined with an increased reliance on wire services. Instead of having a dedicated reporter, we saw data fed into algorithms and game summaries spit out and I think that is a long term problem for all sports. If I did nothing and the trend towards more and more games being covered by wire reporters continues, then it could get to the point where it was too late. So, I felt like if I didn't do it then, I wouldn't have a chance to stop or slow what I felt was a negative trend for the Mavs and the NBA. When a fan goes to a Mavs page and the only coverage is a wire service or eventually an automated summary, one highlight and a tweet, that hurts all stakeholders."
Interviewer,"For more information on the AP partnership with Automated Insights (that Mark is referring to above), see https://automatedinsights.com/customer-stories/associated-press/."
Cuban,"Automation is coming at us faster than ever before, and there are trillions of dollars to be made in artificial intelligence. I believe the first Trillionaire will be someone who masters AI. If you are not getting up to speed on Deep Learning, Neural Networks, etc. you will lose."
Interviewer,"Okay, so let's talk about your investment philosophy and the kinds of companies you like to invest in. Any thoughts you'd like to share."
Cuban,"Sure. You know, when I'm making an investment, whether on Shark Tank or elsewhere, I look for businesses that are unique and make me wonder 'why didn't I think of that'? I've invested in several startups...one is Genetesis, a medical device company in Ohio that uses noninvasive biomagnetic imaging to diagnose chest pain. I'm also backing a 3D printing firm called Fabric8 Labs that uses a Stereo-Electrochemical Deposition (SED) process that can produce objects in solid metal. I'm invested in companies related to sensors, (Motionloft), medical startups Biomeme (personalized medicine), Unikrn (online esports betting site) and others."
Interviewer,"Great, thanks. Any final thoughts on how the Dallas Mavericks can leverage automation technology even crypto?"
Cuban,"Well, we're accepting Bitcoin and Ether cryptocurriences to pay for tickets this season. As far as tokens, we will be taking tokens originated by companies (with whom) we have business relationships. We want to make our products and services how and where our customer want to buy it. As long as we can hedge or exchange the payment method and it works with our payment gateway, we will accept it as payment. I believe that blockchain technology will be at the core of most transactions in the future."
Interviewer,"You guys already have a special symbiotic relationship with all the 3D stuff, what can we expect going forward?"
Cuban,"The interesting part is that this is the natural evolution of the digital revolution. For the past I-don't-know-how-many years, it's been a move from large to small, smaller HD, smaller internet, smaller portable devices but the reality is, you can go bigger too. Not only do you go bigger, you go with dual-channel, tri-channel, as many channels as you want. And a natural extension now that you're getting digital projection into the theaters is 3D, bigger screens, and more unique experiences. And Bud at Cinedigm, who's the leader in 3D technology and distribution, and HDNet, Landmark Theaters, and some of the other companies we have, we're really trying to work hard together."
Interviewer,"Mark, you own Landmark Theaters and you just bought a stake in Carmike Theaters. Will you be converting those theaters over to 3D technology? How intricate of a process is it?"
Cuban,"Eventually all the theaters will be able to support everything digital. The reality is, bits are bits. You can transform any type of content into digital and Cinedigm's already got the network operation center to be able to distribute those bits. So now the question is trying to figure out the best content to get people out of their homes and into theaters to experience something completely new."
Interviewer,Has there been a little decline in traditional theater-going experiences?
Cuban,"Actually not. You know, people talk about social networking. We congregate around various topics on the net we're all on Facebook or MySpace or whatever it may be but one of the ultimate social entertainment experiences is going to see movies."
Interviewer,"From a technical standpoint, what goes on from the production end during a live event?"
Cuban,"It's not like, ""Well are we going to the game or should we watch it in 3D?"" This is just completely different. It's a completely different experience. From a technical perspective, trying to get all the synchronization done and understanding the differences in direction it's a whole new medium. When you're watching a game, it's not like, ""Well, I'll watch it on the big screen at home or I'll go see it in 3D."" It's like, ""Oh we're gonna trip out and go see a movie or whatever in 3D."" It's a whole different experience."
Interviewer,On whether he takes his success for granted.
Cuban,"Every day, I look in the mirror and I just make sure I don't pinch myself so I don't wake up."
Interviewer,On his success after selling tech company MicroSolutions.
Cuban,"I literally retired at 29 with a lifetime pass on American Airlines, and my goal was to party with as many people as possible."
Interviewer,On becoming an entrepreneur after getting fired from two jobs.
Cuban,"Those back-to-back experiences confirmed what I already knew, that I was a (bad) employee."
Interviewer,On the fact that his purchase of a G5 airplane was the largest known online purchase.
Cuban,"It was $41 million for an airplane. I can tell you without hesitation, it is really good to be able to do that."
Interviewer,On owning the Mavericks.
Cuban,Everybody thinks that we are in the basketball business. It's an NBA game; we're not in the basketball business. We're in the business of creating unique experiences.
Interviewer,On his relationship with former NBA Commissioner David Stern.
Cuban,"We get along great. And the few things we didn't agree on, he had the authority to fine me on."
Interviewer,On whether or not he will vote to oust Clippers owner Donald Sterling.
Cuban,"You'll find out. I know how I'm going to vote, but I'm not ready to comment on it."
Interviewer,On how to keep bigotry out of the NBA.
Cuban,You don't. There's no law against stupid.
Interviewer,On stupidity in general.
Cuban,"I'm the one guy who says don't force the stupid people to be quiet, I want to know who the morons are."
Interviewer,On bigotry in general.
Cuban,"I know I'm prejudiced and I know I'm bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I'll move to the other side of the street. If I see a white guy with a shaved head and tattoos, I'll move back to the other side of the street. None of us have pure thoughts; we all live in glass houses."
Interviewer,On how to fix the national economy.
Cuban,"Until you fix the student loan bubble, we don't have a chance. Everything else is shifting lawn chairs on the deck of the Titanic."
Interviewer,On the TV show Shark Tank.
Cuban,Shark Tank sends a message to everybody that the American dream is alive.
Interviewer,On the companies he's funded on Shark Tank.
Cuban,They're all my babies.
Interviewer,On why he still works.
Cuban,I love to compete. Somebody out there is competing with me and I want to kick your.
Interviewer,What are your latest projects?
Cuban,"Besides the Mavs, there is HDNet and HDNet Movies (http://www.hd.net/)Magpictures.com, HDNetfilms.com, 2929ent.com, LandmarkTheaters.com, for theentertainment biz. Then in the internet space, Goowy.com, Box.net, redswoosh.net, icerocket.com with more to come."
Interviewer,"In the 1990's there was a tech stock boom, then bust. Now, with the IPO of Google and other major developments, are we in the midst of a second tech boom?"
Cuban,"No question about it, but its completely different than the '90s. Today, anyone with 500 dollars can buy an incredibly powerful PC and get a fast net connection and startup an Internet business. Back in the '90s, startups worried about raising money first, then having a workable idea second. Today, most startups don't want or need money. They can hit the groundrunning and have an impact. Once they can determine the scale of the opportunity, they look to raise funds."
Interviewer,What do you foresee as a big tech innovation ten years from now?
Cuban,"I have no idea, and I don't even pretend to know."
Interviewer,"With your ownership of the Mavericks, do you consider owning a sports team a good investment, or something you do for love of the sport?"
Cuban,It could be a good investment if I didn't care about winning. But winning a title is more important than making some more money.
Interviewer,"A while back, your gift to your then fiancée was highly publicized. What is your philosophy as to gifts? Are you under any special pressures?"
Cuban,I don't have a policy. I just do what I think is the right thing to do.
Interviewer,"With your private business, you have to pay employees the fair market value. With the NBA, there are salary caps. Do you find that frustrating?"
Cuban,"No. Not at all. The NBA has to take into consideration the health of the league as a whole. So the caps work. In all other businesses, your competition is trying to put you out of business. Things wouldn't work too well in pro sports if I were trying to put the Spurs or Lakers out of business. Instead, I just want to kick their ass on the scoreboard."
Interviewer,What do you consider a splurge?
Cuban,Eating a quart of ice cream in one sitting.
Interviewer,What do you consider a complete waste of money?
Cuban,Trying to be fancy. I don't get into the place settings or chandeliers or paintings for the sake of having things because I can. I just like the things I like and go from there.
Interviewer,Are you involved with any charities?
Cuban,"Yes, but the only one I disclose is the Fallen Patriot Fund (www.fallenpatriotfund.org). I try to do things because I think it's the right thing for me to do, not because I get recognition."
Interviewer,"Do you feel you enjoy your money more than such people as Warren Buffet, who refuses to drive new cars or to throw out used soap?"
Cuban,No. I'm sure he has his splurges and things he loves to do. Renting out a baseball field and putting together a game isn't something you can do with money you save from soap conservation.
Interviewer,"Other than your tech business and the Mavericks, do you have other investments?"
Cuban,"I love the Internet and how it impacts the delivery of content and information. What people are calling, Web 2.0, AJAX interfaces, software written using practical approaches like Ruby on Rails. Anything that can be run with fewer than 5 people and can be nimble, aggressive and impactful are the types of technology businesses I love. The kind I hate are the ""I'm the smartest guy on the planet"" type applications. DRM, video compression and the like . There is always someone smarter and I'm not good enough to know which person I'm talking to. The also ran, or the best ."
Interviewer,"You are very ""hands-on"". How do you know when it's time to delegate?"
Cuban,"When I trust someone and feel that I can learn something from them.With your tech business, you are the boss. With the NBA, you have to work within a consortium."
Interviewer,"What advice do you have for people who have to ""work with the system""?"
Cuban,"Don't do what I do. I'm a terrible employee. I don't do well ""in a system"". I guess my real advice is to do your homework and understand what your goals are. It's easy to speak up, it's hard to figure out how to pay for the kids' stuff when you are fired."
Interviewer,"You have taken a very visible role in the media, as evidenced by your sitting in the stands and not in a box. How do you achieve the privacy you need in your life?"
Cuban,"I know where and when I will have private time, either alone or with family. I have places I can go where people have known me and are used to seeing me. Then there is everywhere else, where I have to realize that there is a very good chance that someone is going to take a picture. I just look at it as a good problem to have. I would rather be in this position, than where I have been in the past, wondering how I'm going to pay the bills."
