you know I came out here earlier and

they didn't clap as loud so it's pretty

obvious why they were clapping loud this

time that was for you um all right I

don't have any songs for you I just came

in a few minutes ago and Jack was here

playing a song look what's going on in

here

and some he can pull that off I can't

maybe next year

um so I wanted I know it's probably hard

to remember what it was like way way

back in the beginnings of Facebook um

but that's where these guys are in the

beginnings so I'm gonna ask you

questions about the early years right um

which also have the advantage that you

don't have to worry about saying bad

things it's a public company because

we're just talking about ancient history

right um so I wonder if you remember

when you sat down to write Facebook

during that reading period what was the

first thing you wrote like when you when

you had enough code to test something to

see if it worked

what was it what did you test I don't

remember then what that would the first

thing was that I wrote but it actually

the first code for Facebook started way

before then right so it I like probably

a lot of you guys I just built a lot of

stuff for myself all throughout my

childhood I built games that I wanted to

play I built a music player that I

wanted I tried to build stuff that that

I really wanted for myself right now as

I was young I wasn't building very high

quality stuff it was just stuff that

that I wanted not not for anyone else

and then when I got to college I started

wanting to build products that would let

me get insight into the community around

me and let me connect with the people

around me and that had the property that

you can't actually just build something

that only you use if you want to be able

to connect with people around you you

have to start building software that

other people are going to use as well so

I actually mean like Facemash oh well

before that you know it's actually one

of the UM it's that stupid movie makes

everyone think that Facemash was like

was this critical thing but

but actually a lot earlier than that in

my sophomore year one of the first

things that I built that was kind of

like this was actually called

coursematch I don't think we've talked

about this that much and you know

startup schools it was um I was trying

to figure out what classes I wanted to

take my sophomore fall and I wanted to

see what other people who had taken the

CS classes that I'd taken wanted to take

and what my friends were planning on

taking and what they'd taken in the past

but there was no database like that that

was out there so I thought all right

well how can I do this so I went and I

wrote this little script that scraped

the course catalog and let people put in

what classes they wanted and I called it

the course graph and um and that was

actually the first time yeah I mean it

was it was actually I made the mistake

of running it running the website from a

laptop in my dorm room and the my desk

was right next to the bathroom when

there was like constantly steam pouring

out of that from people showering so the

laptop actually fried and I lost that

one after like a few weeks of it running

but that was the first time that I had

ever really set up a production you know

Apache server my sequel server or a lot

of that stuff and then you know a lot of

those those things you know then when I

went on to build later stuff I had those

lessons and I knew that I could set

those things up quickly so those were

just building blocks on top of which to

build future things did people put their

classes in it did you use it oh yeah but

ya know it was like a thousand or 2,000

people out of the reasons like 6,000

people at Harvard yeah yeah so I mean it

worked fine

amid it it was actually really

interesting people spent so much time

just clicking through the links of

people to see what classes they were in

and then in the classes they clicked on

people who the roster the the people

whose just it was I thought it was going

to be interesting and I wanted to solve

this problem but it was actually just

way more compelling and you know part of

my theory at the time was you know I

looked at all the other types of content

that we're out there on the internet

right it's like you could search for any

music or news or content or reference

material that you wanted but part of my

theory at the time was that people were

really missing from the internet right

and there were no services like that and

you know that's why I built some of

these services that that went in that

direction but I still think people are

largely missing from a lot of the

software that we build which is why I

focused on

building this development platform today

as part of Facebook's that way the next

generation of software that the industry

builds can just be more human so every

app that people build has this sort of

additional dimension now where you can

sort of see what other people are doing

- we're trying to go in that direction

so you knew by the time you started

Facebook that if you made some website

you could get thousands of people to

show up to it well I it was I didn't

have a choice I knew that if I wanted to

do this that I had to build something

that I could that would get people to

use it I didn't know if I could actually

do that so but it must have been a

little bit surprising that thousands of

people that are very sources on writer

people would shut up for something that

wasn't even intended to get raw

thousands in originally I probably do it

again right well yeah and then I did a

few more and I was really focused on

this idea of channeling a community's

energy to build some kind of shared

asset whether it's you know the course

graph or you know ultimately Facebook

was a good example of this I mean one of

my favorite stories from from college

that I actually I think I've told it

startup school before is I built the

first version of Facebook during reading

period which is basically this two or

three week period that Harvard I don't

know if they still give this but they

don't yeah I think I stopped by talking

well you know both Microsoft and

Facebook started during reading PSO

never likes canceling things that work

so the

um but so basically it's this period

during January before your finals where

you can ostensibly study for classes for

your finals and and I took that period

to write the first version of Facebook I

don't think I've written any code for

that project directly until really

January and then by the end of January

is basically done with it but then one

day I woke up a couple of days before

this um final for this class that was

taking called a room of Augustus it was

this lit in arts class and the class was

all about learning the historical

significance of a bunch of pieces of art

that were there and for the final they

were just going to show some pieces of

art from the class and you have to write

an essay on the significance of them and

I hadn't really gone to class all term I

just like programmed and then during

reading period when I should have been

learning this I programmed and so I was

pretty screwed right there's no way that

I was going to cover all this material

so I just went to the course website

downloaded all the the images and I made

a little website that basically would

randomly shown in the images and would

let you contribute your notes of what

you thought was reasonable of what was

important about that photo your notes

see everyone else's taken by going to

class what's up yeah but other people

could learn through hard work and um and

then I sent this out to the course email

list as like hey guys I built a study

tool and within an hour the whole thing

was just populated with all the

information that we needed to take the

class to take the final so I think I did

pretty well in the final I don't

remember the exact grade but tell us

about some real-world system you have

hacked to your advantage

what's up that's an answer that's a

question on the YC application form we

actually asked for people having done a

trick like that um that would get our

attention

incidentally if you ever want to do oh I

see

uh-huh well it's funny you know the

first couple times I met mark after all

this time evaluating startup founders I

can't turn it off so I'm like the first

couple times I met mark there would be

this like prophesied process running in

my head saying accept him accepting him

say and I would have to say stop it it's

too late well no we get to work together

on other things hmm um all right no I

love it I love it um so one of the

things I we talked about last year was

how when you first launched Facebook the

first other colleges you expanded to

were ones that had competing services so

I didn't ask you at the time but I

wonder now why did you win what was it

that Facebook had that the competing

services didn't I think it was just this

focus on real identity and the

connections between people but it goes

back to this theme where before Facebook

on the internet there were you could

find a lot of information about a lot of

different types of content but the thing

that we as people care the most about

which is other people write it around us

and our brains are just wired that way

it wasn't there and if you think about

it the reason is that you know that that

information about people isn't just out

there on the internet to be indexed by

some search engine right you can't just

send a web crawler around and learn

what's going on with people you have to

build tools that give people the the

power to share that that content

themselves and that stuff didn't exist

and if you go back you know most of the

way that people interact online was

anonymous right and the idea at the time

was that it was pretty scary to put your

name and real identity online without

the right privacy controls and without

kind of the right community

infrastructure so I think that that's a

lot of what we built was a framework

where people would be comfortable

sharing in that way and

we're people able to share less on these

competing services there were three

universities you mentioned yeah I mean

Stanford Yale and Columbia

yeah they each had different things I

think some of them were just they gave

people less ways to express content

about themselves none of them I think

had a concept of connections right so

one of the things that if you think

about you

friend people yeah and if you think

about friending today and one of the

reasons why it's important is because

you get the person's content in your

newsfeed right and there was no newsfeed

back then right so a lot of the reason

that that friending was was good was

just because you could put someone on

your profile and say that you were

connected to them so just like people

were more fascinated than intuitively it

seemed like they should have been about

looking and clicking through the classes

that people were taking a lot of people

also just wanted to see who other people

knew there was nothing like that that

existed so you had friending from the

beginning oh yeah that was a really

critical piece so the missing religion

teen connections they had the nodes of

the social graph but not the arcs um

well there's that and I think there's

less emphasis on real identity in the

community so some of these communities

you know just like you you made it so

that people could sign up with a

pseudonym which is is fine I mean I

think there are lots of services that

are good with pseudonyms but if you're

talking about real a real community then

then you want that why do you have its

drawbacks have you ever seen the

comments on a Kearney's I think if

people were talking under their own

names they might be a bit more civilized

well I mean sometimes it's actually it

goes both ways though right I mean a lot

of the advantage of that is that people

can be very critical right it's if

you're always talking into your real

name it there's often a social penalty

for being critical so it is more

civilized I think but that may not

always be the most productive thing mmm

so you want to balance of these things

at the moment I envy you um so well we

can talk after this without getting

called my god her to do I know what

you're about to say yes

the devil you know or the devil you

don't

okay the keys don't only use Facebook

connected right it's some people make

that can use Facebook and Twitter well

yeah or Facebook and email or whatever

whatever else do

Twitter's fine too how minutes what you

want to use to you want to all right now

this is a hypothetical question um so if

you hadn't started Facebook like for

example if if Harvard had already

cancelled reading period um and you were

actually kicked me out right or they

kicked you out for facematch a smash

you know you asked this question before

about what I've started facebook without

Facemash about the only thing that I got

from Facemash was I met my wife because

of it because my Harvard said that they

were gonna kick me out and my friends

really thought that they were gonna kick

me out so they planned this going-away

party for me and actually met my wife at

that party so they didn't even wait for

the ad board to decide before they had

the going-away party they were so sure

yeah my friends were just like

completely positive that I was gonna get

kicked out of school actually you know

not only that but my family was pretty

confident that I was gonna either get

kicked out or drop out of school too

before I started college my little

sister bet me that she would finish

college before me and my mom later told

me that she always knew I was gonna

leave college oh it was like oh thanks

mom so here's my hypothetical question

if you hadn't started Facebook um there

would probably be something like

Facebook now yeah

would it have would it have to have been

something that started out as a network

for college students was that thermal so

powerful the winner would have had to be

one of these College things were could

MySpace have sort of morphed and grown

and you know become it yeah I don't

think it had to be a college thing you

know one of my earliest memories from

Facebook was I I used to get pizza

almost every night with one of my

friends I did my computer science

problem sets with and we used to talk

about technology and where we saw the

world going and I remember one of our

conversations right after I'd launched

Facebook was about how I was really

excited to offer the

service for our community but that one

day clearly someone was going to build

this for the world right and it hadn't

even crossed my mind that maybe we would

be the ones to do it because from my

perspective it's like alright we're just

college students what do we know about

building software that hundreds of

millions of people will use you know

clearly this is going to be something

that you know Microsoft or Google or

Yahoo or someone like that who builds

these services that that tons of people

use is going to do it and it when was

the time when you realized you were

gonna do it like how many how many

schools do you have before you realized

this was horribly it probably later on

when we went outside of college but even

live it up to the point where you had

hundreds of colleges you still thought

some big company was gonna come along

and do this better well not necessarily

the college part but I didn't know that

we were going to be the people building

the the community to kind of connect

everyone right so it's um in retrospect

though it was pretty obvious no no not

at all you know I actually I spent a

bunch of time analyzing and in

reflecting on why it was that we were

even able to do it because oh like all

reasons suggest that we shouldn't have

been able to do it right because all

these other companies had way more

engineering power and and and servers

and time and money and all this stuff

and I actually think that this is a

pretty instructive thing for anything

that you want to go do because this is

the same property is gonna be true for

anything that you guys start is that

someone else is going to have more

resources and be able to do it the

reason why I think we actually ended up

being the ones doing it is because we

just cared way more about it than

everyone else right so there were always

projects at some of these other

companies that were these hobbies but we

always thought that it was this really

important thing and really just like

felt in our gut in our heart that we

wanted to do it and you know early on

there were always these skeptics saying

that oh this can't be a business Whedon

actually care that much about it being a

business early on but a lot of the

reason why bigger companies didn't

invest in it was because it wasn't clear

that there was a model that would work

for it it seemed like a bad idea yeah

and I actually think that's true for a

lot of the best ideas where it is that

it's not that someone else can't do it

they actually can and the odds are

stacked against you but I think often

that belief and the fact that you just

care so much about what

you're doing is the only thing that kind

of drives you to do it and you know to

be honest that kind of drives me to this

day I mean one of the big emphasis

points for the company right now is

internet org and you know for why we had

this rallying cry of can we connect a

billion people and you know when we

start talking about that we thought that

was crazy you right it was way bigger

than any service in the world that had

been built and you know it was ten

digits long right it's like a you know

it just it felt crazy we'd never get to

that but then the thing is as we've

started to actually get closer to that

we took a step back and like alright

well our mission isn't actually to get

one in seven people in the world to be

connected it's we want to connect

everyone so it's um it's a big issue

that only around a third of the people

in the world have access to the Internet

and that's something that we think that

we can do something about and similar to

early Facebook we don't there's no

business model around this I mean all

the people who have all the money in the

world I mean it's not necessarily a fair

thing are already the people who are on

Facebook right it's in the first you

know seventh of the world but we just

believe really strongly it's like this

is what we were here to do this is what

our company cares about I care about it

the team cares about it our culture

cares about it so we're just going to

keep pushing on it and I actually think

a lot of the reason why great stuff gets

built is because it's kind of irrational

at the time but so it kind of selects

for the people who care the most about

it doing it do you think there's there's

anything about you like if a personal

quality of yours besides sort of basic

smartness and determination that made

you well-suited to work on this this

project I realized this requires some

introspection yeah I actually think

determination is probably the biggest

piece you know it's um so many things go

wrong when you're starting a company and

often I think people ask you know what

mistakes should you avoid making and you

know my answer that question is don't

even bother trying to avoid mistakes

because you're going to make tons of

mistakes right and the the important

thing is actually learning quickly from

whatever mistakes you make and not

giving up right and I mean there are

things every single year of Facebook's

existence that could have killed us or

made it so that it just seemed like

moving forward and making a lot of

progress just seemed intractable but you

just kind of bounce back and you learn

and nothing is impossible you just have

to kind of keep running through the

walls

so the biggest mistake is the sort of

meta mistake of letting a mistake

Lorelei's you hmm

um do you think Facebook know I don't

know one who knows a better do you think

Facebook had a rougher time like do you

think it ran into more obstacles early

on than typical startups because now

you've known oh you know a lot of other

people who started startups and you've

heard all a ghastly stories about what

goes on behind the scenes do you think

it was more of a show or less we're

about normal probably more yeah and I

mean Bry well part of the reason was

because I knew nothing when I got

started I mean you have to him I was 19

years old when I started Facebook right

so I mean probably like that the same

age or younger than most of you guys I

think you would be young for this

actually and um I knew nothing nothing

about business at all right not even

think that I was starting a company I

actually remember when I first came out

here for the summer with Dustin because

we want to learn from Silicon Valley

companies I remember driving up the 101

and seeing all these great companies and

thinking to myself oh wow these are such

amazing companies maybe one day I'll

start a company and I'd already started

Facebook right and and it like hadn't

occurred to me that that was actually

you know so um how did you learn how did

you learn well just advanced people

around me but there's so many mistakes

that just come from not I mean like I

really knew so little at the time I mean

like when Peter Thiel came in to invest

one thing that he demanded was that all

of the founders beyond vesting schedules

and um I didn't even know what a vesting

schedule was I'd never heard of that

right so I mean part of the the early

conflict that I had with um with Eduardo

who's one of our founders who then left

was he was at Harvard with us we kind of

decided okay if we started a company

would divide the equity up this way we

hadn't heard of vesting schedules and

then he just balanced he never moved out

to California with us so so Peter was

like oh all you guys have to be on

vesting schedules like oh now what

do we do right so in but it's fine I

mean it's like that mistake probably

cost me billions of dollars but it's

fine you just

you you move forward and and you can't

hit it doesn't matter right I mean you

just kind of keep pushing forward and um

and that's how it goes yeah um how did

you learn though like you you start out

that's good

you can do it Robert um uh um

so you start out as a 19 year old right

and you have this website that's just

like going through the roof Ron was

talking earlier about her very early on

that the graphs just were going up very

steeply um you had to learn how to

create this organization you know you

had to learn how to be a manager that's

the next phase after you raise money and

you have something that's growing how

did you learn how to how to manage

people well through a lot of mistakes

um I don't think anyone is like

naturally good at hiring out of the box

so right it's a key you have to learn in

each role we probably went through

multiple iterations before landing on a

balance of a person that made sense and

and the problems made even harder by the

fact that you don't need the same thing

at each stage right so it's a moving

target as well but that's just tiring

though you have to somehow lead a group

of people and get them all to work

together that's very hard yeah that's

what you do now right you don't program

much probably right you spend all the

way from managing yeah well mostly poor

fun now you're a mando an expert no

absolutely not

you must be right it's yeah try telling

that to my team no um but how did you

learn it was there anyone who taught you

just were any bullet you just have to

throw yourself in right so you I was

really just trying here six so I have um

you know I've developed a few heuristics

over time that I think are simple enough

that the organization can internalize so

in terms of hiring you know everyone

says hire good people right no one wants

to hire like a reasonable person um you

know you want to hire like a really good

person but then the question is how do

you like what's the right heuristic for

determining if someone's really good so

over time what I figured out was that

the only actual way to let someone

lies whether someone was really good was

if they would work for that person so I

don't think that needs to recurse too

many levels down in the organization but

I basically think that that's like

that's a really good heuristic right and

and I I believe that I mean for if you

look at my management team today I mean

if we were in an alternate universe and

I hadn't started the company it would be

an honor to work for any of these people

and I think if you if you build a

company that has kind of those values

rather than just saying oh I want to

hire you know the best person I can find

or whatever if you hold yourself to that

standard then you'll then I think you'll

build a pretty strong company there are

other things around management that you

just kind of have to throw yourself into

in different ways as well I used to be

really terrified of public speaking up

to the point where when I did All Hands

which at the time we're like 10 or 15

people had to sit down because I was so

afraid and at the time a lot of people

which is ironic because I'm still

sipping but um but not not because I'm

afraid just because it's more

comfortable and so what I did was I

basically I threw myself into some of

this stuff and you know a bunch of

schools invited me to come speak and

what I did was I accepted some of those

invitations even though I had no real

goal of doing that except for

desensitizing myself and I went up to

give a speech without having prepared

anything and if you do that a few times

you stop being afraid really quickly and

because I mean what's the worst thing

that can happen you know I think a

survey says that more Americans are

afraid of public speaking than deaf and

it's so you know just throw yourself in

you get over this stuff I remember the

first talk you haver gave it gave it

startup school and I think it was one of

these the way you describe that you went

with no preparation right and you know

actually I can tell you know what but

thank you what's the worst thing that

can happen you can say something off the

cuff that gets like taken by the press

like a football and thrown around and

gets you that's fine I actually I

actually did prepare for that one I

don't have that excuse but the fact that

um it was really this did all that this

practice did was desensitize me it

didn't actually make me good at public

speaking as this is this is proof of do

you like managing people um you know if

you work with people that you like then

it's wonderful right now because I'd one

definition that I have for a good team

is a group of people that makes better

decisions as a whole than would

individually make is a sum of the parts

and when you're I think most smart

people like learning right and I mean

that's like one of the thrills of

starting a company right is you're just

that the learning curve can be so steep

and if you can set up a team dynamic

where you're constantly learning from

the people around you then I mean what's

better right these are the people I wake

up every morning and I want to I want to

go learn from and was from is that one

of your heuristics for hiring people to

to like hire people that you learn from

yeah uh and when building a team you

wanted to you want to think about the

dynamic so that way you can maintain

this property that the team makes better

decisions as a group than any individual

would hmm how when you first started

like back in that house in Palo Alto you

were a start-up founder right so how I

didn't know yet

well what was your mental model of a

start-up founder how where did it come

from

did it was it Bill Gates you know or

Steve Jobs did it come from reading

books or Peter teal or Sean John Parker

I mean where did it come from one of the

things that was kind of interesting was

there's this culture in Silicon Valley

that kind of makes startups seem

glamorous and I never really believed

that right I never had a goal of

starting a start-up and my goal when I

realized that I had a company was to get

it to be a good company as quickly as

possible where I didn't kind of get out

of what you'd call they're like risky

startup phase where you are just like

constantly about to die and where you

could get to a point where you can

actually do some interesting things and

make make a lot more interesting bets

and um so I don't know I I never read a

lot of the literature on this and I mean

maybe if I had then I wouldn't made so

many mistakes but I don't know if like

if learning for me is the right way to

go on this but I mean but it did your

model must have come from somewhere

though even if it was even if you it was

unintentional right like were you

influenced by Peter Thiel

where Sean well yes I wasn't even all

these people once I met them I actually

I hadn't really heard of Peter Thiel

before I'm talking about like me Yeah

right

yeah but he was massive

influential on my thinking right I mean

I like a lot of the the early lessons

that I took on how to think about

strategy came from Peter and Shawn and I

did pay a lot of attention when I was

growing up to Microsoft I thought I mean

I grew up you know using you know

Windows 3.1 and then Windows 95 and I

just thought that those were like the

most unbelievable things and sense they

are yeah they really were awesome right

um well I don't know if youyou meant

that positive positively but I did and

and I thought you know building this

ecosystem was really neat and that kind

of inspired me right in the way that

they built a platform I kind of thought

okay well maybe one day you know that

the tools that I'm building can be part

of a broader ecosystem as well and I

think that we've kind of gotten lost

from the valley ha by the time that I

got around to setting up Facebook as a

company I mean Google and Apple to that

point I hadn't really created platforms

they went then went on to create much

better platforms than anything that was

created on a desktop with their mobile

operating systems but that was pretty

influential for so was that idea of one

day making Facebook into a platform sort

of implicit all along was it always

something you were mulling over or was

it something that occurred to you after

you had all these people you know

talking to one another

well turning Facebook into a platform

was after that but the idea that there

should be some social platform was

pretty early on right so between you

know coursematch and the room of

Augustus thing and face smash and like

all these things when I was at Harvard

it kind of became clear to me that a lot

of the software that we use should have

people at the center of it right and

people want to learn about people that's

like a really core thing in our

psychology so I thought that you know

whether there was a central central

social network kind of at the core of

that or just like some kind of social

libraries or API or something that there

needed to be something that made it so

that was like a common framework that

that everyone could use to develop you

mentioned earlier that Peter teal and

Sean Parker both influenced your ideas

about strategy can you remember a

particular strategic insight that you

had early on and it's probably you know

the statute of limitations is for

competition is probably passed now

there's probably stuff

you can say about some insight that you

had early on and you thought to yourself

ha ha ha nobody else knows this except

us but we have this we have this great

this great trick do you remember any of

them

well Peter teal was really focused on

network effects and he had this model

that I think is right

for making decisions that as the

complexity of the company grows every

day you're going to be faced with a

hundred things that you could

potentially go do and your job is to

pick the one thing that actually matters

because out of those hundred things it's

really only actually going to be one or

two things that actually matter and that

was pretty informative to me at the time

because I had intuitively like I had a

lot of self direction intuitively but as

soon as I started getting all these

people around me who all had reasonable

perspectives on things was very hard for

me to balance that and Peter was always

very useful for that we wouldn't focus

he was good at seeing here's the one

thing that matters like I'll go kiss on

the one thing that matters well

partially that and partially just the

meta lesson of figure out the one thing

that matters and do that but he also

what the one thing that mattered like if

someone who actors weren't as quickly as

possible because I mean network effects

were massively important part of us one

of the the story windows in connecting

everyone as quickly as possible you

don't mean specifically getting more

signups

you mean getting people to friend one

another faster yeah well why would you

do that

um well we built a lot of tools to

enable people to do what they already

wanted to where you can't like push

uphill on this stuff right it's it's um

we were solving a problem that people

had and we just needed to remove as much

friction as possible but there was a

pretty early you know funny sequence

where there was actually this company in

2005 that got started that was called

college Facebook it was like an exact

clone of us and it even had the same

name right and um and their strategy

because we started at Harvard and then

tried to branch out to schools that we

thought would have dense social

connections with Harvard so we can build

this network their goal was they wanted

to start in places that we weren't right

so they started on the west coast and in

the South when we started on the

Northeast and they tried to build up

this network of different schools and

just as race for a while and I'm

eventually their older Seattle

yeah and it's Ivan and we just took this

stuff really seriously and I remember

Dustin just took it so personally right

it's like any time they launch at some

school that we weren't at we had this

concept that we actually still have it

the company today called lock down which

is whenever any other company gets ahead

of us on something that we think is

strategic to us back then lock down

meant we literally did not leave the

house until we had addressed the problem

now it's a little looser and

interpretation inside the company we

don't literally lock everyone inside the

office but about as close to that as we

can legally get so and you know now the

funny thing is inside Facebook you know

because we have a lot of different

initiatives teams kind of do this

themselves right in and just decided to

alright there's like some competitor

that has something that we feel like we

really need like we're going into

lockdown to get this thing because we're

not gonna you know let college Facebook

get ahead of us so in retrospect could

you have completely ignored college

Facebook and it wouldn't have made any

difference I don't know it's a good

question um

don't you think like you would have just

eventually spread to those schools and

killed them I mean in theory I think

they didn't do a perfect job copying us

you know one of the things that's

interesting is that there are some

countries where folks have made such

good clones of Facebook that it has been

very hard for us to grow and Russia is

the biggest example right so V

Kentucky's guys are just like the

International Olympiad computing I'm

computing Olympiad champions and it's

the small team and they like just did

like an awesome job cloning Facebook and

there are fewer content laws so they

also have like illegal file downloads

and all the stuff and like we just have

not been able to beat them and and it's

um maybe it's because of the illegal

file downloads and it's work so you

should add file down well it's we try

not to break the law but it's um the

we're growing fine right it's like

linear growth and we're we're I think

slowly making a lot of progress and I'm

pretty sure we'll pass them eventually

but it's been literally like almost ten

years so right since we got started with

Facebook and we still have

not beaten them in Russia so it is

possible that if the college Facebook

folks had done better and had gone

faster then maybe maybe maybe

no no but like they went the speed they

did that wasn't affected by your

lockdowns I'm just wondering like maybe

those lock downs were unnecessary

because we always advise people

basically just ignore competitors right

I do think that it's definitely possible

to over rotate on competitors but one

one caveat that I would say I think

people tend to worry too much about

strategic competitors who are doing

something that's related but clones I

think actually end up being a pretty big

nuisance right so they're like they're

these whole companies now in Europe that

like all they do is just clone companies

that have been founded in the US and

other places and try to bring them to

Europe and have Network effects and it's

like a pain in the ass right and I got

it

so so I actually think you do want to

internationalize and pay attention to

that stuff fairly early because those

things are really annoying once they get

lodged in okay I think we have one

minute left so I'm going to ask you one

more question um it seems like the most

successful founders are sort of obsessed

like they're a little bit they care a

little bit too much about certain things

right like Steve Jobs cared a little bit

too much about how perfect the edges of

some polygons were right um what is it

that you care too much about connecting

everyone no seriously if you think about

I mean it's like this aesthetic sense of

the world that I have is that you can

communities if people can channel their

energy to do great things and having

connections between people is the

infrastructure for the world to do that

and you know and that's why it each step

along the way when there was always all

this uncertainty about you know whether

it would be profitable or whether it

would make sense or be good or whatever

to do these thing this we always were

doing it because we just cared more and

I mean to this day I mean you could you

could say that that was a startup thing

but it isn't because I mean now we're

we're here and we connect more than a

billion people but I mean I we're

pouring tons of money and resources into

connecting people who can't even afford

internet access right so I mean that's

like there's no way that that's going to

be profitable in the near-term

medium term but we're doing it because

we think it's the right thing to do and

over the long term I do think that

there's something there and it's going

to be fundamentally important for the

world and maybe we'll get rewarded maybe

not but we just really care so it's a

movement in facebook the company is sort

of a subset of it hmm well all right you

guys I think we're done are we done

we done all right thank you very much

right Mark Zuckerberg
