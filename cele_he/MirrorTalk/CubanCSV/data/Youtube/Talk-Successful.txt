some influencers don't say much quietly

making deals behind the scenes Mark

Cuban is the total opposite the owner of

the Dallas Mavericks is known for

criticizing referees and presidents

alike his business chops go back to the

1990s when Cuban co-founded an online

streaming company that he sold to Yahoo

for 5.7 billion dollars

he has since invested in dozens of

startups and continues to do so as a

host of the show shark tank Cuban is

here to talk about how to pick the right

investments ignoring everybody else's

noise and maybe generating some of your

own

[Music]

[Music]

hello everyone I'm Andy serwer welcome

to influencers and welcome to our guests

Mark Cuban mark great to see you

thanks for having me mark of course

entrepreneur star shark tank owner of

the Dallas Mavericks and in fact he's

hosting us here today were Dallas

Mavericks headquarters here right across

the street

yep right across from the arena from the

arena right so a whole bunch of stuff to

talk to you about our way but let's talk

about this president thing okay you know

that's out there there are people who

suggest that you should run for

president maybe you have aspirations I

don't know but it's a discussion point

so what would it take to have you run

for president I'm excited about next

year for the Mavs it's going to be I

don't want to get into it I mean I did

one quick interview and then all of a

sudden it blew up I don't want to feed

the beast like I said if there's a

certain set of circumstances that would

push me to do it but we're not there yet

so if and when it happens you'll be the

first to know Andy okay that's very cool

what about the Democratic field are

anyone there that you think can

challenge President Trump well I mean

there's now and then there's November of

2020 I mean if the election were held

today I think Trump would win but I

don't think that there's there's

somebody that has the momentum or just

the value of the incumbency that that

Trump has but at the same time between

now and then I think Joe Biden's got a

good chance and we'll see what happens

with any of the other of the field of 97

to see if anybody emerges or if anybody

new comes in I think I think Biden is

capable of beating him but we're not

there yet you've been critical of

President Trump before have you kind of

made any peace with them I mean you know

it's been a couple years yeah I get

along I mean you know we didn't have to

make peace we I you know like any

president I agree with some things and

disagree with other things now it's not

personal

there's things I would do differently

and you know but I was the same with

Obama was the same with Bush it was the

same with Clinton that's just a way

that's just the nature of the beast so

you talked to him and given him any

advice or what advice would you give

them I mean I'm not a fan of the tariffs

um you know if I understand what he's

trying to do in

terms of battle in China I would

approach it differently because I think

tariffs are a tax on the American people

but at the same time I think we have a

variety of other leverage points I'll

give you the perfect example Chinese

companies on American Chinese companies

listed on American exchanges have a

market cap of more than 1.4 trillion

dollars that's a lot of leverage right

there they're raising money via IPO it's

something we can't do in China I'd shut

down all Chinese IPOs that first step

and given his propensity for using

Twitter and just as a kind of throwing

warning shots you know I would I would

throw out there that we might put a halt

on the trading of Chinese listed stocks

in the United States now there are

American shareholders but the reality is

that long term the value of the

companies the value of the company but a

trading halt would certainly create a

lot of disruption for those Chinese

companies and I don't think it's

untoward at all to reconsider you know

treating Chinese companies like they do

ours right you know we can't list on

their exchanges I don't know what the

SEC is thinking because given that every

Chinese company has a connection

somewhere or another to the Chinese

government how does the SEC enforce any

type of trading lots can you imagine if

you're a big Chinese listed company and

the government someone high up the

government says I need to make some

extra money tell me how business is and

what you're going to report what's the

SEC going to do to them right and so

there's all kinds of enforcement issues

that I think come up and I'm not

suggesting that that's what happens now

but we have no idea of knowing that it

doesn't have you ever run that by

President Trump

no no not or anyone else in Washington I

mean I've talked to a lot of people in

Washington about a lot of things but

it's I'm sure it's not something I think

has reached his level right I want to

get into the SEC and others as well but

let's talk a little bit about growing up

I grew up in Pittsburgh your father ran

an auto upholstery didn't run any

whatever he worked there okay so what

was that like Mark and and how did that

inspire you I mean my dad busted his ass

I mean he worked six six days a week

little

left at 7:00 at 7:00 7:30 in the morning

got back at 6 or 7 o'clock lost his eye

in an accident doing upholstery

he had a staple break when he was

putting some covering on a car seat you

know it was it was a middle-class

upbringing my mom did odd jobs you know

they just wanted something better I mean

my grandparents came over from Russia

you know my dad was the first generation

my uncles were the first generation of

Americans like my mom too and you know

like every child of immigrants they want

it better for their kids you know it's

funny I mean a lot of people grew up

that way all right but now many people

end up like you so what do you think

that's the result of I think you know

everybody's got something that they're

good at and the hard part is finding it

and I found out early that I was a good

salesperson that I really like business

you know like I like sports I mean I

read everything I possibly could played

sports as much as I could just wasn't as

good as I wanted to be and and business

was the same way I mean as long as I

could remember I was buying and selling

baseball cards garbage bags whatever I

could find stamps to collectors but I

was also reading everything I possibly

could about business and you know I was

that unusual kid that I'd rather read

about Ted Turner then go to the movies

and and so I think that created a

foundation of my parents you know my dad

used to always say I don't understand

what you're doing but I'm glad you're

doing it and and so I have my ups and

downs along the way of course but I just

think that I just I just put in the time

and was fortunate enough to really get

excited about business and that paid off

benefits over the long haul I mean you

almost have to have that drop like in

other words you can't fake it you can't

like pretend that you want to read about

Ted Turner and okay I'll skip one movie

yes I mean your your soul yeah I mean

you can fake it to make it in a lot of

areas particular if you're working for

somebody else but at the end of the day

if you're going to be great at something

you've got to make the effort to be

great at something whether it's sports

whether it's physics math science

business whatever it may be

you know it's not just a natural ski

you've got you've got to to learn and

particularly if you're in the technology

industry because the changes every day

you know when I got started and in you

know after I got I got it was a

bartender when I first came to Dallas

got into the PC industry got fired

started my own company but there I

learned early on that there was always

something new and most people didn't put

in the time to learn it it's like now

with artificial intelligence lots of

people talk about artificial

intelligence lots of people talk about

machine learning and neural networks not

a lot of people are putting in the time

to take classes or do the tutorials or

to learn how to apply it to business and

that's what it takes and and you know

that's just something I've always

enjoyed so I I've been fortunate at no

wait a minute are you doing that with AI

really what are you doing I mean I've

been on Amazon doing the machine

learning tutorials right now I'm going

through I've taken Python online classes

I really yeah absolutely if you go in my

bathroom there's a machine learning for

dummies book I just started JavaScript

neural networks there's a little

tutorial where they've got most of the

library brain Das and all the libraries

and it's not if you have a background in

programming it's not hard but I'm not

trying to be great at that but I want to

understand it so I understand all the

you know so I the nuance elements of it

and how it works so that I have an

advantage but where would that take you

like with your businesses here or the

Mavericks or you know everyone text me

everywhere right I mean there's nothing

that AI won't impact as big as the M so

having been around a while I saw the

impact of PCs then I saw the impact of

local area networks then I saw the

impact of wide area networks then I saw

the impact of the Internet

then I saw the impact of mobile then I

saw the impact of Wireless you know now

I'm seeing the impact of artificial

intelligence and a Dwarfs any of those

things and if I don't understand how to

apply it to my businesses I mean I

remember selling pcs and software and

walking insane you don't need to use

that pen and paper on a you know on a

notepad or a ledger pad now we're gonna

give you a spreadsheet and by the way

here's a here's a spreadsheet that cost

four hundred ninety five dollars and I

had to pay to go get trained on how to

sell it which is crazy now when you

think of

but then we said okay now you can play

what if then we said you can connect

these pcs unless I understood the

technology how is that going to explain

it how was I going to understand it

unless I understand it now how am I

going to invest in it you know then I

got to go trust somebody who says oh

yeah I know AI and maybe they do maybe

they don't and it's really easy just

ahead just that okay say you figure it

out that's just not my style

so you're building a base of knowledge

and then you think that at some point

it's gonna pay dividends and Tory has

right I mean if you truly believe a AI

is going to change everything how are

you going to understand what people are

doing to change everything unless you at

least have a foundational understanding

of it now I'm not going to build a

million layer neural network and try to

change the world and I'm not going to

show you I'm not gonna write a research

paper and saying here's how why the

lottery ticket approach works and you

can build smaller neural networks with

less data and be more you know resource

efficient but I can read that stuff and

understand that when somebody says okay

we're building this project and we need

this sized data set or this size data

set we need this amount of resources I

can ask questions and understand the

answers so he grew up in Pittsburgh went

to University of Indiana for a while

then you said you came here how have you

adopted this city why did this become

your home talas well I mean when I went

to IU I had a bunch of friends that

graduated it came down here and they're

like you got to get your ass down here

the weather's great the women are

beautiful the economy is good I said

wait back up and then I came down lived

six guys in a three-bedroom apartment

until I found my way and I've had a

blast and loved it ever since so how do

you describe yourself mark I mean I said

entrepreneur is that how you would

describe yourself what do you do for a

living

I Drive describe myself as a grinder you

know I just like we talked about

learning

that's a grind but I love it you know

and I just I think I've just learned

what I'm good at and learned to focus on

those things and and try to you know

utilize those skills to now you know not

just be an entrepreneur but probably

more often now invest in and help other

entrepreneurs

okay so take us through your business

interest right now you have the

basketball team you write stuff for sure

meaning you have stuff here you can go

to Mark Cuban comm I list them all right

right

and so really I mean I've got Shark Tank

and I've invested in 100-plus companies

there we sold a bunch so I think I've

got 70 that are active now and you know

it follows a normal distribution

probably 10 or struggling 50 are doing

great and Tanner are doing it incredibly

but I think now I've really evolved some

of my focus to trying to help

disadvantaged entrepreneurs people who

have less opportunity I just invested

with a woman Arlen Hamilton who we

together created a little million dollar

fund where she's going out and finding

ten businesses run by people of color or

disadvantaged LGBTQ type communities and

just opening doors because I think my

experience applies to anybody right any

entrepreneur no matter what you're

trying to sell and I also think that

it's a great business opportunity simply

because the markets that they wanted to

sell to are underserved there just

aren't as many entrepreneurs so there's

more opportunity and so I think it makes

great business sense as well let's go

through some of these other things are

starting with Shark Tank uh-huh what's

Shark Tank like is it really a kick the

way it looks like yes I mean it's great

we start shooting here probably a couple

of weeks June 12th or 13th I think it is

and the way it works literally is we

show up on set and Sony Studios and I

get there about 8:30 and put on they put

it on a little bit of makeup I throw on

my suit like Kevin mr. wonderful son

launder Laurie they have to get there

two hours earlier because they need they

need more work they did oh and we've got

a lot more late listening to that

Kevin's got a lot more landmass to cover

Laurie's Laurie but in any event we

start shooting at about 9:00 and they

just bring in deal after deal after deal

we know nothing about them they'll say

you know this is you know Joe and Sally

and this is the name of the business and

they'll walk in and give our pitch now

on television it might take ten to

fourteen minutes in real life if it's a

stupid deal it might take 20 minutes and

then be

for we were all out and then if it's an

intense deal

it could go 90 minutes two hours and

then they have to edit it down but it's

our money it's all real we know nothing

about them if we decide to do a deal

then we have the opportunity to do due

diligence after the fact because

sometimes they'll embellish it's a

polite way to put it you know my widget

cost a dollar to make and we sold a

million of them when in reality the

widget costs $10 and they've sold six

then heaven sometimes yeah that does

happen more often than you think the

producers of spokes supposed to UM

ferret that stuff out but yeah not a lot

doesn't happen as much as we'd like so

yeah we'll do due diligence and about

60% of my deals close um the other

little thing is of the deals that

present to us and we'll see in any given

season 250 to 300 that are presented

probably 25% of people who pitch us they

come in are taped and pitched to us

don't even make it on air mm for a

variety of reasons yeah and let me ask

you about your entertainment business

the movies and 29:29 Magnolias what's

that all about

well back in 2000 and mm I guess it was

after I sold Yahoo right after I bought

the Mavs I started the world's first all

high-definition TV network when

everybody was saying high-definition

televisions not going to happen

I created a network called HD net and HD

net movies and there was very little

content for it I mean literally this is

when high-def televisions cost $15,000

and everybody said who the hell is gonna

pay $15,000 for a TV and I would I went

around telling everybody no you just

wait those televisions are gonna drop

like a rock in terms of price and

everybody's gonna want one that goes on

their wall instead of this big ugly

hunks of analog TV so I had that but we

didn't have content and so we wanted to

go out there and create content and we

also Bart Landmark Theatres which we

have since sold but we wanted that

vertical environment where we can show

it on television put it online offer

DVDs put put it video on demand and also

offer in theaters and so we created we

created 29 29 productions first where we

produce movies what

meanwhile 29:29 was because the address

for audio net the streaming company we

thought it was 29 29 Elm Street okay so

that's where that came from

and then so we had movie production 29

29 we had Landmark Theatres we also

bought ricer entertainment which we've

since sold that oh no get Hogan's Heroes

and some others so that we could put it

on HDNet HDNet films and then landmark

and so the idea was have article ii

integrating so we were the first company

to to put create to produce a movie put

it online download we did I basically

offer a day and day release of it called

bubble and we we've been doing Magnolia

and 29:29 productions ever since the

others yeah I'm ignoring 29 $20 we've

sold one of all these businesses tell

you about the economy right now what do

you think the outlook that's a good

question so some of my smaller Shark

Tank companies that are that resell

products are getting crushed by the

tariffs I mean I've got one that's may

go out of business simply because

tariffs at 10% were one thing tariffs

are 25% they just can't compete there's

other companies that have bigger and

better supply chains where they were

more creative and were within 5% of

their prices but now with the tariffs

it's it's almost impossible in the

uncertainty it's made it very very

difficult but beyond that I mean

business is going well in urban markets

and it's a little bit tougher in smaller

markets so I mean it pretty much mirrors

what you see in the general economy

right are you surprised at how long the

stock market rally has lasted no I mean

if you go back to 2008 it's pretty much

on a straight line

you know when President Trump got

elected it was a little blip with some

of the things he's done is taking it

back to the straight line so it's it's

pretty much you know where you expect it

to be there hasn't been I mean like any

market there's going to be ups and downs

but there hasn't been anything dramatic

to change it are you concerned about a

recession or the market faltering I mean

I'm concerned about Black Swan events

the nominal ease that

hurt us I think in general you know the

markets tend to just go up you know on

their own by their own weight and so

there's no reason for that to change now

maybe if the trade war extends or

something happens with Iran or you know

again there's something aberrational

that puts us in a difficult situation

then it could change but otherwise I

mean there's no reason to think that

other than stocks individual stocks you

know doing what they do that the market

will continue to go up on the same line

that it has since 2008

you mentioned the SCC earlier and

obviously you've had some issues with

them what do you think about the sec

just generally speaking i think they're

kind of useless you know I think if the

SEC really wanted to make the market

safer they would publish bright-line

guidelines so for instance there's no

law specific law and insider trading

there are only precedents legal

precedents that have been set as a

result of various cases that the SEC has

brought well if you run a public company

that's okay because you probably have a

general counsel who's training you and

doing it on what you should and

shouldn't do if you're just an investor

you have no idea you're not a lawyer and

you shouldn't be responsible for you

know talking to a lawyer before you

design decide to talk to somebody at a

company or where make or sell or buy or

sell a stock and I'll give you the

perfect example of some of the stupidity

there was a case and I forget the name

of it where a guy was going to work it

was a railroad company and Illinois I

think and every day he'd go to work one

day in the parking lot that everybody

shared there was a bunch limos and then

another day there was a bunch of limos

then another day the guy guest literally

guessed that the company was being sold

and he bought stock the SEC sued him

right now the SEC lost but that's just

some of the ridiculous stuff that they

do I'll give you another one I we had a

company share sleuth that did research

on some companies and they found a

company that was putting out press

release after press release

about how great their business was with

this new energy solution I think it was

and we sent somebody out there to just

look at the factory were just called

didn't even send it we just called

factory nobody answered then we called

somebody local I think it was the Power

Company and said you have power turned

on for this location no called up

somebody local go look at this building

nobody was there right company we short

a stock company died the SEC did nothing

right yeah so what's the difference

right let me ask you what do you think

about Elon Musk's war with the SEC what

do you think about Elon Musk general I

mean I don't know him very well I mean

I've talked to him a couple of times I

like him because he's competitive he's

obviously got you know a genius spirit

and in mind for innovation which I love

but he's also very competitive and when

you've got a bunch of bureaucrats trying

to come at you in a world where there

aren't bright-line guidelines that's

tough I mean it's like when I was

battling the SEC it took everything I

had not to just say eff you every minute

of every day because it was ridiculous I

mean if you know in some of the due

diligence and that we were able to do

the things that they said about me that

you know the ridiculous approach they

took you know and so when you have that

coming at you it's hard now I wasn't

running a public company at the time he

is and so you know he he's under a

different microscope but like I told him

it was like you got to just try to bite

your tongue no matter how hard it is

because they don't care they don't care

they're only in it for skin on the wall

because they're like in my matter there

were there were people who left the SEC

before the conclusion when I kicked

their ass and and during in the trial I

had and they would put on their resume

worked on the Mark Cuban matter right

and that's what I told you on this is a

resume builder for them they don't give

a they don't care about you right

they care about their resumes and that

that's tough to fight and I also told

him I said look here's how stupid the

SEC is name the last five people that

you know that you can remember that

we're sanctioned by the SEC for

violating se

violating insider trading loss you name

Namie and he tell me I net can't name

anyone that's death and so when the SEC

does these enforcement's thinking that

they're gonna impact people trading it's

ridiculous because in this day and age

there's you can't communicate that to

people it's it you know it doesn't

people don't think wow this guy got

busted this guy got busted this guy got

busted a woman got busted so I better

not do this stuff or I better learn

because he did this or she did this and

so that's an indication that that's the

wrong thing to do no it doesn't work

there's there's there's there's no

educational value if you will and

there's no disincentive based off of the

findings from the SEC or the rulings

that they have or the court rulings they

have it goes into the ether nobody

remembers it unless you're in the

securities industry right and so it's

kind of useless their approach is kind

of useless I'll give you another example

you can go on YouTube and look this up

so I I try not to talk to CEOs of public

companies whose stock I'm considering

buying because I don't trust the SEC so

there was an instance where I was

thinking well maybe I want to talk to

the CEO and this was a couple years ago

so I put took my camera and I started

videotaping myself calling the SEC and

identified myself I wasn't trying to be

underhanded and I said look I'm thinking

about talking to this company I don't

know if this would violate any SEC rules

is there anybody I can talk to that can

give me guidance and so they sent me to

another person and recorded that sent me

to another person recorded that finally

they sent me to a webpage and that

webpage was a picture of a letter from

1980 no lie saying I needed to fax eight

copies of a request to this number

that's our SEC you know they're not

they're not helping at all and you talk

about and I can go on for days and I

won't talk here but one other piece if

you look at all the ETF's of foreign

country right right

if those foreign countries stock markets

that those etf sold in america represent

right they don't have all kinds of

enforcement yeah requirements right

right so it's

oh yeah and so it's not like we're

letting people invest in these markets

where there's not enforcement because it

really doesn't net out to be anything

right of any value

speaking of Silicon Valley a little bit

what do you think about Facebook and

Google and those big companies should

they be broken up are they too big or

ninety any more enforcement so there's

two pieces there one just looking at the

State of the Union if you will I

mentioned earlier that AI is you know

the biggest thing that's happened a long

time well if you talk to Vladimir Putin

he says whoever dominates a a AI is

going to win you know it's gonna be a

dominant nation you talked to China and

they talk about their twenty twenty five

or twenty thirty five whatever they

called it plan Dell was built around AI

in the United States we don't have those

plans yet but what we do have is five to

ten really really big tech companies who

dominate the research and development in

the AI space if you were to break up any

of those companies Facebook Google as

examples Amazon well we're gonna lose

our greatest competitive advantage that

we have versus the Chinese and the

Russians in a space that we need to

dominate so that's part one now maybe

that gets resolved over time if we

invest as a country more but that that

is a big issue part 2 in terms of

breaking them up you don't have to use

Facebook you know you don't have to use

Amazon it's not like there aren't

alternatives you don't have to buy from

Netflix you know so I don't I don't see

them as utility is like the phone where

the only way you could use a phone was

to go through AT&T back in the 80s and

even then all they did was give access

now I do think there are privacy issues

but those aren't break up issues right I

think the law like if you look to say to

Facebook don't ever sell your data to

anybody else

think about what's happened now Facebook

has control of all that data right you

talk about the law of unintended

consequences you've made Facebook

stronger not weaker now if anything

there should be a built-in delay and

they should have to publish that data

anonymize and make it available to

everybody mmm

that's how you solve the problem and

then you want to also have the other

issues of

you know the content that they present

being harmful or misguided brutal some

cases yeah and I think they're high I

think for them and for Google and others

that's where you changed the copyright

laws right right back in the day do it

there wasn't really the consideration

that there would be forward facing

videos and other content that would be

protected by the nut to hold on what is

it for the copyrights safe harbor right

yeah right so now to safe harbors and

then the copyright owner has to send a

takedown notice right right we should go

back a television station is for example

you guys you guys can't just pull off

something offline online and just

present it here right and broadcast it

right yeah you've got to get permission

right right you got to sign a licensing

agreement that's the way it used to be

for digital copyrights and we should go

back to the frame so that Facebook just

can't say well it's none of our business

right and if somebody has a problem with

that issue a takedown notice and will

try to use AI to proactively recognize

that there's a shooting environment you

know something horrible is going on

right if you flipped it so that the DMCA

safe harbors only protected you for

inward-facing as opposed to outward

facing videos then just like Yahoo

Finance just like every TV network you

have to go out and get a license yeah

then it all changes and you're not gonna

see that horrific content you're not

gonna see because those people aren't

going to sign a license right

interesting let me shift gears a little

bit more can I ask you about economic

inequality and alexandria oak SEO cortez

and her agenda what do you think of that

and why do you think people find it so

lovely I love ALC right I don't always

agree with her but I think she's learned

the lesson of social media where you get

long and you get loud and you get

people's attention and then you deal

with substance after that but what do

you think when she says that the idea

that we have billionaires in our society

is immoral

I mean it's a it makes for great

headline porn I mean she started a

business Bernie Sanders has a book

business you know Elizabeth Warren buys

and sells houses are dead

right if they would have had the level

of success that I and others have had I

don't think they'd be complaining as

much but that doesn't mean that there's

not an incoming inequality problem there

is and it's something we have to deal

with I tell you know other

businesspeople that you know the

greatest cost to business is social

disruption if people are rebelling and

burning things and aren't you know

aren't satisfied with their lives and

their incentive to do horrific things or

you know that's the greatest cost of

business and that that cost us more now

the question becomes how do you address

it right so I'm not a fan of

trickle-down economics right where the I

don't think that works I don't think it

has work you know the richer people get

the more they they make available to

others hasn't worked I'm also not a fan

of trickle-down taxation right the

concept that just taxed you know those

who have a whole lot more then all of a

sudden it'll find its way to those who

need it doesn't work hasn't worked won't

work it's not that taking more money I'm

okay with paying more taxes I don't have

a problem of that where the issue is how

do you make it work yeah right how do

you get it now

the reality is anybody who's working and

getting paid by the hour is going to

have a challenge when something goes

wrong right do you lose a job does the

dishwasher break does somebody get sick

is it more than your the doctor or you

know or if you haven't covered your

deductible yet can you cover your

deductible if you're getting paid by the

hour

it's hard to save money I don't care if

it's five ten dollars an hour fifteen or

fifty dollars an hour it's a difficult

position the only way that people really

acute improve their wealth is by buying

a house condo whatever maybe owning

shares of stock and so I think that's

where you start to change the rules I

think when you have a company like uber

change but who is it to just visit

Pinterest where there's multiple shared

like snap has got multiple snare classes

of stuff I think you tax them

differently mmm if every chair of stock

in a company in the public market is not

treated the same then it should be as it

shouldn't be

well I'm trying thinking right away

without stepping on too many toes if you

have an advantage class of stock it

should be treated as normal income when

you sell that stock right right if you

have if everybody's got the same share

of class of stock then you treat it as

capital gains right right right

if you've held it for more than a year I

think you also advantage people if you

have a company where all employees are

offers stock you give them other tax

advantages because then to a o'seas

point you're lifting from the bottom up

triple down is not going to work but if

you create opportunities where people

all have to share in stock then the

disparity is going to decline because

everybody's going to go up when things

happen like when we sold broadcast comm

we created three hundred millionaires

because 300 out of 330 people invested

their stock right right so you when you

work from the bottom up like that people

have a chance to increase the value of

their wealth when you if somebody's

below a certain level of income and

they're able to buy a home and you give

them more tax advantage you don't take

away their their their deductions

because they're in California or New

York you know when they have a lower

income now they did some things to

offset but still you want people to be

able to accumulate assets that enhance

that grow in value that appreciate

that's how you get people so that they

their visit their their life becomes

better okay let me ask you about America

I mean people are bitching about America

is there something wrong with this

country is it's just the usual stuff I

mean what is your usual stuff yeah right

I mean now everybody's got a platform so

it's a lot easier to its it you

know I call it headline porn you're only

going to get attention the more dramatic

you are the better chance you have of

getting attention and that's just the

nature of the beast I mean there used to

be gatekeepers to media now there's not

and if you're loud enough and either

crass enough or maybe you're it's a

great idea and people get behind it

enough um then you're going to be heard

it doesn't make us bad it's just the

game has changed I mean there are

problems like our health care system and

the mass shootings they're shooting

tzer's well I think first

you know there's there was a book I read

in high school that I ended up buying a

copy I was called wai-man Ravel and

basically what he said was when your

expectations for your life going forward

are increasing but the reality is

diverging from that and so what you

thought would happen with your life and

where you are gets further and further

apart then people do things that they

otherwise wouldn't do whether it's a

mass shooting whether it's you know who

knows what cheating whatever it may be

and so I mean I think taking care of

income inequality and lifting people up

from the bottom and creating more

opportunities and giving them tax

advantages

maybe it's an income and Earned Income

Credit whatever it may be then I think

you'll see fewer those events you know

other people will say it's a mental

health issue I don't think we've we've

had all those same type of issues you

know for hundreds of years in this

country I think it's more about when

people really get disappointed they have

nothing to lose don't do things that

people with nothing to lose will do it's

a guns a problem as well yeah I would do

guns completely differently you were

listening to some of my last interviews

aren't you I would do guns completely

differently um I would I would go to

change the Second Amendment in ways that

people probably wouldn't expect you know

it's not easy to change an amendment but

what what I would do is change the

Second Amendment so it said one every

American citizen has the right to own a

gun period end of story written in the

amendment to the federal government will

never be allowed to ever confiscate that

gun from an individual period end of

story three states have the right to

manage the ownership the purchase and

ownership and management of guns owned

and held within their borders so that if

you live in a state like Texas if the

law in Texas is open carry so be it if

you live in Pennsylvania where they're

more stringent and they don't want you

to be able to have a gun other than in

your own premise or you know under lock

and key or you know have to do a

background check then that's up to them

to decide and so if you know we're we're

trying to take a second Amendment that

has been analyzed up and down and

backwards and forwards and it's created

its own set of problems you know let's

update it right we got to switch over to

basketball sure and talked about that so

one I asked you a bunch of questions so

first of all state of the maps right now

I think we're in good shape I mean we

have luka Daanish we're bringing back

kristaps porzingis we have cap room so

hopefully we'll be much better than we

have been the last three years right you

had some issues here with the culture of

the team with Jordanna essary and I know

you apologized for that you address that

how did that culture happen and do you

feel like I barely knew what would've

happened right and yeah I think we

brought it sent Marshall and I think

she's done a phenomenal job

she's been here over a year and I think

it's a whole new culture a whole new

mavs and you know like I alluded to

earlier we've learned that diversity

creates opportunity and now we're able

to sell into markets we never were able

to sell them before so I think it's made

it a better place to work a better

organization and a better foundation for

the future what about the NBA overall

but what's the state of the NBA I think

it's great I mean I think out of silver

the job is yeah I love Adam I love the

job he's doing right I think we're we

appeal to you know a variety of

demographics I think our audience is

growing here in the United States and

globally there was just a survey saying

we're the number one sport in China so

you know we are truly a global sport and

so I think our future is very bright

Golden State Warriors the most annoying

team ever in the history of the NBA

I'm not gonna go there I'm trying to

lead you on to that one yeah what about

the Lakers what's going on their magic

was just sounding ah you know many many

times I hope they suck and I hope they

suck forever now that one you wanted to

talk about yeah but I've said that

before and I said it about every team

right I want them all to be awful just

one team I want to be good right and

what about your you know history with

with refs have you mellowed or you I

mean there's no conspiracy against Mark

Cuban or or is there conspiracy I mean

there there were moments where the reps

are human too and they have biases like

everybody else but you know my challenge

is with officiating has always been

about management more than the officials

and so I've paid my

fines and some things have changed for

the better some things still need

changing and so I'll keep on working on

it if it means taking a fine I'll take a

fine

generally speaking Marcus we've kind of

wanted things up here you have lived

your life as aniconic last and in a way

that's a template for other people but

in a way it isn't so in other words how

much you've got an ordinary person

ordinary man or woman how much of

aniconic class could you or should you

be like Mark Cuban I don't care just you

should just be yourself right I mean I

take pride in the fact that I didn't

give a what anybody thought or said

I was just gonna be myself and you know

my dad son and my mom's son I'm my

brother's brother you know I'm Alexis

Alyssa and Jake's father Tiffany's

husband this you know I just tried to do

the best like everybody else I mean I've

been blessed you know like I say all the

time I'm the luckiest guy in the world

and I just try not to take it for

granted I try to enjoy every minute and

I think now as I've got a little bit

older I try to give a little bit more

back than I have before and and try to

help more people and I you know in terms

of whatever if anybody else finds

himself in my position just enjoy the

moment enjoy every minute of it I mean I

guess my question is are you a role

model for people in society I don't know

I mean I never thought of it I mean it's

not something I try to be I just try to

be myself you know I just try to to to

help where I can do what I can be a good

dad and you know I know I'm not trying

to be something for somebody else just

myself and finally do you have any

notions of where you want to be

professionally or personally 10 years

from now you know I think you have plans

like that

I don't not specific plans I mean I try

to put myself in a position now where I

can have an impact you know you talked

about running you know there's there's a

variety of ways to have an impact

fortunately people open their doors for

me and so whether it's working on

healthcare whether it's working on crazy

ideas like changing the Second Amendment

whether it's supporting you know talking

to the Senator Schumer he's got a

program that creates more doctors which

if you're gonna reduce the cost of

healthcare you're gonna need more

doctors because

find a man if we ever want to get to

universal health care the United States

has got 2.3 doctors per thousand

Scandinavian doctors have countries have

50% more you know but those are types of

things where I can start having an

impact I can start you know spending

some money on things that lead to change

helping entrepreneurs whatever it may be

so I don't have a specific plan I don't

have a specific bucket list but I hope

that all these things I'm learning can

lead to some level of change so we'll

see all right Mark Cuban thank you very

much for having us here today

Thanks you've been watching influencers

I'm Andy serwer we'll see you next time you
