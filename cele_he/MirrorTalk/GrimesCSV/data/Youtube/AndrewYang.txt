i guess i really got in my own world i

didn't think his name would be that big

of a meme

so like when it became like a giant meme

i was like oh

like i already my kid i think it

behooves most any adult

who wants to understand what's going on

with the younger generation to try and

spend a few hours on tick tock

there isn't like a tech safety community

that's super large like it's quite small

you're supposed to be a tortured artist

or whatever but it's like it's actually

kind of um

edgy to be wholesome at this point

artists have the same impact on a

community's economic development as

entrepreneurs the situation in music

worries me like i know artists that are

pretty successful that are like

broke i'm like super into brutalist

architecture at the moment and i

thought like brutalist baby like you

know like just like

a square cement crib would be kind of


cool


welcome back to yang speaks it is

election day it's election day 11 or

whatever it is now i'm kidding

election day 11 election week two

yes that's sad so i

i'm getting a lot of questions zach

about hey like are these trump legal

actions going to actually

uh succeed should we be concerned

i understand why people would be

concerned because you you'd put nothing

past

this administration but it's a wrap you

know

like that's what i wanted to do i wanted

to like let's i want to debunk

i want to get to like facts of the

recount

nonsense voter fraud nonsense going on

because it's mostly nonsense but

if you're a game i'd love your thoughts

on what's real and what's truth right

now because the source of truth

to me is a moving target right now well

the the truth is that

joe has a margin of victory

in pennsylvania georgia

arizona nevada um that that's high

enough

uh that it's going to make a recount

like impossible to succeed wisconsin

uh where i think it was scott walker the

republican governor of wisconsin who

said

look we can make a mistake of 100

200 300 maybe 400 votes

we're not going to make a mistake of 20

000 votes

like you know it's like we know how to

count um and this is a republican

governor uh and you know so who's been

pro-trump in some ways you know

or yeah if you will like a lot of these

states have republican secretaries of

state

georgia republican secretary of state

pennsylvania republican secretary of

state like they're the folks

so uh so what's happening is you have

very

hyper partisan impulses being like it's

a fraud you screwed up

uh and then when the show would be like

okay like what evidence are you claiming

they'll like just snatch some

strange like you know account or video

that um most often gets explained away

um or

accounts for you know like maybe like

one to ten votes where you could be like

okay maybe like that that but like

there's no uh claim of like and then

they dumped

25 000 fake votes in there but it was

like you know like

there's nothing uh that would influence

the outcome of the election so here's

what's really going on

um the republicans know they've lost but

they need donald trump's voters through

january 5th the georgia special

elections which we'll talk about and uh

you and i are heading to georgia

um yes sir shortly so that's that's

exciting not

to vote ourselves to help other people

vote i'm gonna say that yeah yeah just

to draw attention and raise money and

rally but

uh you know that's not going to yeah no

it really is it's like

like that there's like uh it is not

andrew yang's fault

or my fault that george's laws on voting

residency are ridiculous apparently you

can move there and

just register to vote that's ridiculous

not our fault not our plan keep going

yeah no

exactly take it up with the georgia

state legislature so

uh so the republicans have

reasoned that they need trump's voters

january 5th

and so they're going to play along with

the entire trump

uh fraud game um because they

just want to maintain energy levels

because they think if trump's just out

of the picture and he concedes then all

of his supporters will stay home january

5th

and the democrats have a better chance

of winning these special elections

um but i think you said zach that what's

telling is that

trump and pence are essentially on

vacation now you know they're like

chilling like

everyone in their administration uh is

looking around being like

uh okay i guess i need a new job and

then

um their leadership is like you have to

pretend that everything is still normal

that will be here

and if you don't then we'll fire you

before even like

like uh um you can leave so so that that

so that's the situation it's cynical

it's political

like a lot of things in american life um

and

uh it's trying to maintain

hold of the senate january 5th

so here's my thought on this stuff is

would that make sense to me um

and then for those of you like because i

think disinformation becomes a problem

when rational republicans

who are not the die-hard base but like

rational moderate republicans

or moderate libs on the on the other

side start to

parrot what the far right or far left is

saying

and i think that's what's happening here

it's really frustrating because i have

you know irrational either rational

pundits or rational friends of mine

they're like well there seemed to be

some shenanigans going on

which is frustrating because here here's

what's up that

i like recounts so if like the

republicans want to just say hey we want

to recount the votes

fine totally fine we should do that in

democracy so i'm 100 on board we did it

we've done it before we'll do it again

but here's the

the counts are biden's ahead by 20 000

votes in wisconsin 145 000 in michigan

13 000 arizona 14 000 in georgia

almost 50 000 in pennsylvania so some of

these are close

but not a couple signatures and note

even if there was a freakish thing where

one of them gets overturned joe still

wins like you you need to overturn

several of them yes so bo and jose

essentially needs three

maybe two depending on how you which

ones you pick here i think pennsylvania

and georgia i believe it's over right by

the math

so um the other thing is there has been

this is the other fact of the case

because republican lawyers and judges

generally speaking 99.9 of them believe

in the rule of law

and they're looking at this not a single

judge a j

all judges have thrown out the cases

presented to them

that have been at the scale that could

flip the election

right because there's no evidence of it

being accepted right it's clearly just

accepted over the small ones

yeah so that's there's no real evidence

at all

of voter fraud and that is frustrating

this election is big guys it happened

joe biden got more votes both nationwide

and the states he needed

he's the president-elect donald trump's

on the way out

and the republicans would be

acknowledging this to a much higher

degree if not for the special elections

in georgia in my opinion

so uh no you're probably right so so

just keep in mind that

like they they see the there's an

incentive balance of power in the senate

as potentially at stake and then that's

made them much more willing to

play along right and that makes their

life hell

comparatively speaking right like they

have a lot of incentive

to want power in their power in the

senate because then congress actually

can do stuff

um well democrats need you know it's

like yeah republicans

both of them right the leadership yeah i

mean they both need it

yeah um let me ask you this i think this

is a fun trevor noah had this point

which i don't

always love trevor noah but sometimes

he's funny he said uh so on one hand

this um claims of voter fraud

are hurting democracy in our trust in

elections and something you talk about a

lot

on the other hand on a more fun hand

there is a chance we see donald trump

dragged out of the white house which i

think would be

funny from a comedy standpoint

in an entertainment standpoint which i

think is trump's lame like i think he's

entertainer to me

thoughts on that which you'd rather see

i imagine i know where you land um

but have you thought he's not gonna let

us get dragged out he's gonna walk out

of there

like the the day before and do a photo

op and like hop in a helicopter a plane

give us the bird and flip us the burden

and have a headache yeah yeah

you're probably right and then millions

of americans will continue to support

him and then you know we'll see what his

future holds

um yeah the the problem really is like

the muddiness between now and then

because still

he's the president between now and then

so he's firing people he's making

decisions

uh fired his secretary he's fired

secretary defense right who said yeah

uh then i quote uh if it's a yes man god

help us all

yeah the uh

the transition's getting gummed up

because ordinarily um

the biden team would have some resources

to work with and be talking to current

officials and a bunch of other things

uh and that that has not happened so

that's

uh that that's negative substantively

for

an effective trade-off of or hand-off of

power

um and that sucks you know that i mean

this there's no bones about it like that

this

like we just hung on through this and

like it's still happening

where you have like you said i guess

formerly reasonable republicans being

like oh like about let's play the sound

like

it's bad for the country that the

incoming team cannot talk to the current

team

uh it's bad for the country that

millions of americans are being called

to like question

uh the objective fact of who got more

votes

like this stuff's really destructive and

it's speeding up

you know it's like the norms just held

together

uh for this one uh you know next time if

the next person

says this stuff is rigged like you know

you you might see

uh unrest and um

like worse judging or you know whatever

the heck uh

you know it is so like this is not going

well

uh for american democracy uh you know

like i'm thrilled that joe and kamala

won but

uh and i i wish that you know

republicans didn't have these political

incentives to cast this like alternate

version of reality

uh where clearly and like all these

republicans are being like oh they're

like issues shenanigans they

do a recount if trump had won they would

be crowing immediately being like

you know it's in the bag stop it like we

don't need to count more like the

rest of it i mean you saw it so clearly

where like the chant was different

depending upon what state and what the

needs were it was like stop the count or

count every vote or whatever it was you

know

you know they'll like flip on the dawn

it's a tough argument because there's so

many states yeah

so they're i mean the the the core of it

is just that they want their team to win

and um and that's

in some ways understandable because we

all want our teams to win um

but you know at this level like that

there has to

be some degree of um country over

party you know it's like this stuff is

really bad for the

country it's bad for the country that an

incoming government like can't talk to

the current government it's bad for the

country that

like you have this floundering executive

branch for

you know two solid months like you know

that like that they're just real real

negatives to this

um and like i i don't i think this hand

holding

of republicans who want to play along is

uh is is corrosive you know like i wish

they

didn't feel but you know i guess it's

like the epitaph to the trump era it's

like well we kind of wish republicans

had

separated from him this entire time and

been like yo this guy's

you know not the guy and they never did

and so they're still playing it out

they're still writing his

trump coattails to what they hope is

political victory in georgia

uh country be damned you know it it um

like uh it's a sad day or a sad week or

two weeks or three weeks or whatever it

is you know you've talked a lot

i'm gonna find this quote this quote and

tweet it before this podcast where you

found

you said we're entering an era i think

you said this at cnn town hall

your first one where you said we're

entering era of um

the lack of institutional trust where we

don't trust our schools we don't trust

our

our military we don't trust our

education system and

um we don't trust government and now

it's looking at we don't trust our

elections

we don't trust the media straw we don't

just yeah there's a whole bunch in this

list yeah

yeah actually zack military is the most

trusted of those institutions you just

named

like uh so of course i butchered your

quote that's actually a good example

no no it's i mean like the military's

like the last bastion that gets like

majority trust uh we don't trust

hospitals we don't trust doctors

you know it's like the the the trust is

low um

the trust is declining further still

this election unfortunately

has not been good for trust

you've talked about this before but um

we never really debated it so

there's there's liberal chatter um

and not like far left stuff like

politico wrote about this where um

there's rumors that trump will have um

some civil suits and possibly face jail

time

from um certain courts when he leaves

the white house

um and you've been on record saying you

hate that because that turned us into

venezuela and i agree with that no i i'm

saying i hate going i hate criminal

prosecution

um the civil suits have added you know

he owes you money go for it

[Laughter]

um like i do think it's bad practice for

a new government to like throw the

previous president

in jail uh you know because that's a

pattern that

goes on in uh developing countries where

like the new president's always trying

to like chase down the

former president who's still a potential

threat

uh yeah and i know there there are going

to be many people who disagree with

this because they want to see trump in

jail really really badly

uh like i i think it would be um i would

think it would do more harm than good

to try to imprison trump and and i also

think that

again just like the odds of seeing him

dragging out the white house the odds of

him actually going to jail would be so

low you know he would just

decamp to another country where he would

uh um

live it up nope

but i do think like if he owes money

like particularly the new york

um


you know here at yang speaks we are all

about protecting

our data i am so thrilled that prop 24

passed in california california's are

enjoying

higher data protection rights they're

going to create a new data protection

agency just for california

and if that sounds cool to you and

you're not in california then go to your

state legislators and say hey

how come californians have better data

protections than we do here in wisconsin

in michigan in ohio wherever let's have

the sweep the country

in the meantime if you want to protect

your personal data every time you use

the internet

so so let's get to let's get to georgia

why is everybody

going to georgia over the next two

months

you had not one but two senate races

in georgia which is highly unusual and

neither of the quote-unquote

winners or front-runners got 50 percent

so in georgia there's a rule where if

you don't get 50

you go to a runoff so race number one is

john ossoff

against uh david perdue and

uh that was close as a two-point race or

so um

john ossoff's very young very logical

uh really impressive candidate to have

um

uh accomplished so much uh i talked to

him the other day and he was joking

about how

when he ran for congress it ended up

being like the most important

congressional race of

um the year because it was the first one

post-trump uh and then now his senate

race is becoming the most important so

he's like joking he's like lightning

striking twice

uh and then the other race um

is reverend rafael warnock against kelly

lefler

and both purdue and lefleur were accused

of

insider trading on coronavirus

information when they first found out

how bad the chronovirus was going to be

they

did what any american would do and

adjust their stock portfolio

they were just like oh this is going to

be bad for cruise lines

you know it's like that's leadership

that's leadership uh

that's so illegal by the way it's so

having worked on wall street that is

like textbook insider trading there's

not like that's not even a gray area

yeah

the entire um legislative access to

tradable information i mean come on like

we haven't figured this one out

like if you're gonna show up in congress

just like put your money in a trust

they like throw it in a bunch of things

you can't touch it and then you come out

of public service you get it back

instead we're creating all of these gray

areas where legislators are freaking

profiting

it is not a good look that folks enter

congress

non-millionaires and leave millionaires

on the regular you know like

like that that's and it happens all the

time

all the time and it makes sense because

there's

it's not illegal to do this you go in

and sit there in a meeting like wow

it looks like this massive xyz problem

is causing oil prices to skyrocket in

the middle east like oh better like

get out of my oil companies and you go

in there and you make your trade and

then let it go and then yeah you don't

lose all that money and like there's a

moral like taking care of your family

thing but that's highly illegal it's not

cool

um well yeah i mean congress hasn't

hasn't

like slammed the door on this stuff to

the degree that it could

right it needs to for sure i mean it'd

be illegal in

some of these other contexts you're

talking about um so yeah like all the

demands but there needs to be rules and

like inside trading's hard

to track in general but this one's easy

this one's easy

well zach i'll tell you the enrichment

of congressional

members is not strictly that they just

have better intel they're like you know

like adjusting their

um e-trade portfolio or something like

that like

most of most of it is that you get in

there and then all of a sudden like

people just want to include you in

everything including

things that um that can make you some

money and

they're technically legitimate uh but

just people will be like hey

you know like we've got some real estate

deal like you wanna

come like uh partake and like there's

not no rule against it you're like you

know a citizen you can

invest and so people just be like trying

to carve out awesome opportunities for

you

then before you know it like you know

you're trouncing the market many many

times over

if you're a member too you're like

hanging out with rich people all the

time

and then the rich people kind of put

their hand on your shoulder and they're

like

they're there like we like you you

should be rich like us

and then and then the members like are

like yes i should

and then before you know it they are

anyway this is actually a long

digression from the fact that that's

very real man

and i'll say this quickly because i saw

this like if you have people always like

the rich get richer

like poor poor like when you have money

the investment opportunities get a lot

better and a lot less risky

in the sense that in 2000 i'll never

forget this we sold an apollo european

credit fund

awesome idea and basically in the 2009

financial crisis all like the smaller

banks mid-level banks in europe went

under

so private citizens if you're like the

cisco which is like the food delivery

service

super blue chip company you couldn't get

a loan in europe

so private citizens just pulled a bunch

of money together and we're loaning like

blue chip companies

at like 11 interest 15 interest it was

the closest thing to surefire bet

ever and all you had to do was have

enough money to lock it up so

it's stuff like that that they're

getting access to where

you and i like you you're poor you don't

you're not in the game you have to

invest in just

an apple stock or whatever s p 500 and

like go with those waves these guys get

sure things that the lead access that

kind of stuff so

long way to getting there but that's

just one that i remember very yeah i

mean

wow yeah you lived it brainerd if i had

money you know yeah then they'll call

you up and be like hey

i got a thing for you so tell me your

left foot yeah

and then you're like sure you feel smart

and it's corruptive over time

anyway kelly lefler uh is the richest

member of the senate which is saying

something because there are a lot of

freaking rich senators

but kelly left her lovely is worth 520

million she's already put 23 million

into a race

uh reverend raphael warnock uh you know

is a

black reverend uh very inspiring like

he's getting a lot of support um i and

this i'll just

say just because i think it's fun is

that kelly leflar also owns a wnba team

uh that like in all the players wanted

her to sell it because

she she was against the black lives

matter messaging look at the court like

yeah

it's like you probably should do

everyone a favor and sell that team if

like your players don't want to play for

you that way so uh so that's

that that's the other race these are

fascinating races

and uh we have to be realistic that for

democrats

it will be an uphill climb and you think

well why because didn't joe just win

this state like isn't georgia at purple

the problem is that uh republicans in

georgia have a much

tighter read on voting and the need to

vote

than democrats who many of them are new

to the process

and this was true a number of years ago

even there was a special election that

was very close to get to a special

election

it was maybe a three-point gap and then

the republican won it by double digits

maybe 12 points so that was a number of

years ago

so it's probably not going to be that

gruesome this time

but you have to expect that

democrats will come out at lower levels

and the trump not being on the ballot

thing cuts both ways is that they're

like you know

republicans are concerned that their

voters will stay home you know who'll

stay home a lot of anti-trump democratic

voters in georgia

uh so it's a it's an uphill climb uh

but we have to to make this happen

because the

alternative is mitch mcconnell saying no

to everything

for four years while the country sinks

into the mud

uh that's why i'm heading there and

you're heading there is that uh we have

such massive problems in this country

and we know washington will take any

excuse not to work

you know if the party can just look and

blame the other side me like well

nothing happened no stimulus bill

uh it's their fault vote them out of

office and then go eat a steak

um while while the you know the country

is

burning they'll do that you know i mean

that like that

like i mean we're seeing it we're

feeling it um

yeah for seven months so if you want uh

to

get things done out of washington that

might help people

a unified government would be enormously

superior to mitch mcconnell saying no no

no and mitch mcconnell all of a sudden

you know he's going to be like oh

the deficit like when like no one cared

when trump was like let's do a like

trillion dollar tax got to be like yeah

let's you know all the republicans have

voted because

of the fiscal situation the united

states to decrease the deficit

it went up exponentially essentially

donald trump had the biggest increase of

deficit in a long time

i'm going to see if i pull those numbers

up but go ahead so it's both it's a

argument

like and if there's any time you're

gonna deficit spend

it's when you have a pandemic and a

pandemic induced recession

and a jobs recession and like you know

like people

are getting kicked out of homes and

in food bank lines like if there is any

time you're going to deficit spend it

would be now

and one of the things that frustrates

the heck out of me is the confusion

around where the money is going karzak

2.2 trillion dollars

uh if you do the math 1200 for let's

call it 100 million americans

uh is something like six percent of

2.2 trillion dollars so it's like oh all

the money went to

people no you know like a like a tiny

sliver

went like you could give everyone twelve

hundred dollars

a month for a year with like that two

trillion dollars if you so chose

which by the way would have been vastly

superior

to what they did because let's say you

have an airline

i feel i feel very deeply and

desperately for all the families

you know the furloughed employees and

the rest of it but let's say

that all those employees were getting

like thousand dollars a month two

thousand dollars a month

and then the airline itself was getting

recapped like then how would you feel

we only care about the airline because

we care about the workers

we care about like the pilots the

airline attendants like

the rest of it's like i don't want those

people to suffer yeah no like i don't i

don't want those people to to suffer

you know the other thing is like we have

a sophisticated enough corporate

um infrastructure where like a banked or

bailout let's keep on flying anyway you

know

like they go to the creditors and be

like well i can't make any money if

we're not doing flights and i'm like

yeah yeah you go do that like

it's not like bankrupt firms just stop

operating

you know like the the the creditors can

just keep on you know like doing the

thing so

so there are many many better ways to go

so even if you are concerned about the

deficit

you should be clamoring for cash relief

because it is the most effective bang

for your buck

it would actually go right back in the

economy it would rejuvenate small

businesses keep some of these

restaurants open and all the rest of it

um and so having mitch mcconnell talk

about the deficit is something i will

desperately i will fight tooth and nail

to shut him up just be like look just

you know like just step aside

you've done enough wrecking of the

country for uh for a while

uh you know like let's try and rebuild

it

yang versus mitch i'm excited for this

for those just to make sure i get the

numbers right

um this is according to a site called

the balance which is like a

pretty i've read this before but a

pretty good uh

us debt uh blog website um but we've

increased the debt by

donald trump under donald trump's been

36 percent or so

almost 36 in the past four years now you

can give a chunk of that

kind of not all that is covered right

now a lot of that is the tax

cuts and there's this logic on the right

that say hey if we cut taxes people will

make more money

without the taxes and then they'll still

make it back and the reality is really

rich people don't

pay taxes so this is a ridiculous model

um

so that's our world right now and then

to be clear on this

if the democrats win these two senate

races we have a 50 50 tie in the senate

which means the tiebreaker goes to the

sitting vice president which means

which is going to be kamala harris so so

5150 advantage so would that not be

glorious that's what's on the line in

georgia that's why we're heading there

uh we've just kicked off

winboatseats.org

which donates to 16 community

organizations that activate

voters in georgia and in different

places in different

communities so we've identified this as

the most effective

use of resources uh it's a two month

sprint

and so you need people that can actually

talk to people

and um and these orgs do just that

they're actually very close to the

ground

um so uh you know we're gonna go there

too knock on doors like uh do some

things i'm gonna

try and activate some people while i'm

there it's been fun where a lot of

people have reached out to me being like

yeah you're gonna be in georgia like you

know like

i tweeted you this is hilarious um yeah

martin luther king the third

um like uh said yeah let's get lunch i

mean like you know that

it's it's like oh there's like a

beautiful yeah there's a beautiful

welcome wagon

um um in georgia which is a great place

dominique

like freaking love dominique oh yeah

dominique we'll see him in atlanta

dominique wilkins

um so a couple things um

i'll say this again i keep saying it but

i do think it's important because a lot

of the right

is is

like screaming this narrative if you

will where georgia has some weird

residency laws

and we said this before if you move

there you can pretty much vote pretty

immediately um which is

uh not great when um

you know protect potentially for

election fraud but the think of how that

would actually work where people

actually move

get a place and then move out for an

election it's not going to happen at

scale

but that's not the point we are going

there to help the campaigns

to help the democratic party to get out

the vote and register

new people to vote um so that's what

we're doing

more to come i mean guys we've now

turned these campaigns which are

probably what

30 i don't know the numbers of time we

have 30 to 50 million

operations each now it's going to be

combined hundreds of million dollar

operation

where the whole nation is now focused on

the state whether they like it or not so

a lot

is up in the air um we're figuring out

what we're going to do all we know now

that we're moving there and we found

some great orgs to work with instead of

tbd

um it's also covid which we'll talk

about a little bit on this podcast so

the in-person campaigning

not as fun as it was back in iowa in

january um

but let me ask you this andrea i think

it's really important um

because a lot of people see you i like

to call your lane the rational

progressive right where you're not

far left but you have really big ideas

um and you're not afraid to talk

um to criticize both parties you clearly

are democrat

you lean left on a whole bunch of things

almost everything but you also

are very rational and thoughtful um not

left or right forward is kind of what

you know

that's been our slogan

70 million americans voted for donald

trump there is a

to me it's also a healthy sign that um

we're not all like the country's very

divided so what are you

you're right now very supportive of

giving joe and kamala

full reign of the house and senate why

we're going to georgia you might explain

like why

a little more you touched on a little

bit but why are you even though there

were so many trump supporters

here that we saw it wasn't a mandate why

you're so passionate about the

the full control for joe

i i understand that there are some

people that are like ooh you know both

parties

um checks and balances compromise yeah

be nice to have the boundaries

you don't want to give everything yeah

like i understand that perspective

um i think we're in a very specific

situation right now

where we have a pandemic that is getting

worse not better

we have a three to four trillion dollar

hole in our economy

uh something like 40 million plus

americans have filed for unemployment

over the last period of time

and so the government needs to be taking

fairly dramatic measures

in order to stop the bleeding

uh and fill that hole and provide a path

for

tens of millions of americans

now if you look up at washington's

recent history

uh it's not great in terms of taking the

actions i'm describing

um but the track record plummets

when you have mitch mcconnell um playing

goalie or obstructionist

so if we lived in a world where the

republicans and democrats have been

working together harmoniously and like

hammering out legislation

and and then uh you were in this crisis

and you had confidence that they would

come together uh then maybe

you know it's like okay like that that

like that that might make sense but

that's not the world we live in like we

live in a world where

uh we haven't gotten another relief act

in seven months and counting and it's

probably going to be you know

unfortunately like significantly longer

because they're not going to pass the

law in the lame duck session

and in this circumstance you need

an invigorated government actually doing

things

i know it's painful for some people to

hear but that's where we are

half of independent restaurants are

going to close without some kind of

relief

like think about what that means for

communities around the country for

those jobs those people those families

that freaking spent a lifetime building

that restaurant put their heart and soul

into it and and now

are going to be forced to shut it

forever i mean like that's what we're

facing

unless our government actually uh

like passes the relief act for

restaurants small businesses

puts money into people's hands like the

the deprivation and desperation are

rising

uh and this is not the time to be like

uh like the

the bipartisanship you're talking about

is an abstraction like

uh like the reality has been sorely

disappointing

for years and years uh and so

if we're gonna get some kind of real

action out of congress we have a much

better chance at it

uh if mitch mcconnell uh is not

the final say i

think that was extremely well put i

think

the other to me what i look at is you

start to give joe options because joe

can go to mitch say hey i'm willing to

negotiate with you so you can get your

moderate republicans on board with a

bill that all americans get behind but

if not i'm gonna force something through

like that to me is what um a reasonable

president can do and i think joe will be

so that is why we're going to georgia

that's why this matters

um once we have details and you can or

you um

get off your butt and get down there but

if not also like we can phone bank you

can text bank you can fundraise

there's a whole bunch of virtual things

you can do as well so this is where the

focus is

with that we have a um really special

guest man this is like we've been

excited about this for

yeah like uh i'm such a huge grimes fan

on a personal level and a creative

level it's just a powerhouse we met on

the trail

um stayed in touch uh and

she became a mom and you know i dare say

you know like uh

um that um she's been

fairly low profile sense so like this

was like a special treat

uh on several levels but i just like i

just love

uh talking to her and she has so much to

offer

a lot of insight i think the world right

now

needs more art and uplift and that

stuff's underestimated

really like you know you talk about

politicians

um trying to be a source of that but i

think artists are a more consistent

source of that

in the vast majority of people's lives

you know what i mean it's like

if you want to feel good like what do

you do you probably turn on your

favorite

artist you turn on your favorite music

like you probably don't turn on like old

obama speeches or something um

you know maybe you do some people don't

turn down

yeah so so just learn a ton but more

importantly just

like um felt a real sense of joy

getting to catch up with grimes i hope

other people enjoy this conversation too

so thank you grimes hope everyone enjoys

it

uh is a treat for me yeah

and look she doesn't do a lot of these

it's a rare moment and

um i learned a lot and i think um you

guys

enjoyed so tune in grimes joins yang

award-winning musician visual artist

creative extraordinary crimes welcome oh

my gosh guys it's so great to see you

thanks for having me how's it going it's

going

it's going 2020 good is what i say you

know it's like i

i can't complain but the world is

terrible

you know the world is a little bit less

terrible now that joe has

defeated trump and is heading toward the

white house but

that election i know you and i uh texted

about this like

it didn't leave you with a positive

feeling

no it was i mean it was definitely a

high stress situation i think

um yeah um

yeah but i don't know i feel like there

are lessons to be learned from this

well for you you grew up in canada does

american politics

uh horrify you fascinate you like uh

from someone who grew up in our northern

neighbor

which seems like a more rational

place in many ways um yeah like

like how do you experience american

politics that way

well first of all i feel canada isn't

actually as rational

as everyone thinks um you know we are

the home of the crack mayor

rob ford um so oh yeah that guy

yeah um who like got caught smoking

crack and then got caught smoking on

video and then

got caught smoking crack like again and

then possibly the third time so

you know it's like we really we're not

that much better

and actually canadian politics are i

think a bit more crazy than people think

just because we have a kind of like a

three-party system

so a lot of the times the more kind of i

don't know woke vote or whatever

actually gets kind of split between the

liberals and ndp

um so canada actually has its own

problems but

um uh you know which often leads to a

conservative

uh government we we still have like

healthcare

and uh like our college is massively

subsidized which is

like it just actually does make a huge

difference in quality of life

you're you're you're a product of that

right um because canada's

universities including the top public

universities like mcgill

are essentially cost free and i think

like you

attended i wasn't mcgill or like uh like

one of the canada's big schools

yeah no i attended mcgill which is

literally like

a fantastic school like almost for free

like a couple thousand dollars a year or

whatever um and

i'm deeply grateful for that even just

because you can kind of

not know your major going in and stuff

like i feel like in america if you make

the wrong

choice with your major or career like

it's it can be like a

hundreds of thousands of dollars mistake

thousands of dollars in debt yeah it's

true yes so it's like

i mean that's just i i i don't know i

kind of didn't fully comprehend the

situation till i came to america and

met people and it was like damn like i

got to like try out a few different

things before i

you know chose my major so i think this

is

one of the main reasons we think canada

is more rational is that

your education is paid for and you're

not taking 18 19 year olds

and loading them up with debt and then

stressing them out about making

light life decisions where they should

be exploring

yeah i mean i like did not know what i

wanted to do at 18 or 19 like absolutely

not

um you know so uh well actually i did

want to be a musician but

um i didn't think that was a reasonable

career path to pursue

um so it ended up working out but yeah i

know it's like it just seems

crazy that you should be saddled with an

insane amount of debt for decisions

you're making

before you even really know who you are

before your brain is fully wired

seriously

it's highly nonsensical uh and people

are paying for it here

so you knew you wanted to be a musician

did you have a sense of the medium

like did you think i i'm i know it's

going to be

electronic or like you know you'd be the

vocalist or did you dabble with

instruments or what was the story there

um i actually never made music because i

didn't think i

could or should um and then

but i was just like an obsessive music

fan like super super super obsessive

um and then actually in my neuroscience

course or i was in a

uh i was sort of studying music in the

brain

and we actually had a class where we had

to learn logic and like make a song

overnight and bring a song to class the

next day to prove we'd like learned the

um audio recording software

um and that's when i kind of started

making music because i

i like the class provided free audio

software and then i just sort of like

went down the rabbit hole

whoa that is wild uh so

what what year uh in college is that how

old are you

that would have probably been 2009 or

2010 um and then i basically

the first music i made kind of went

viral uh

which was both both a blessing and a

curse because like there's a lot of

footage of me like literally learning

how to make music i've been making music

for less than a year and i'm like on

stage and stuff

there's some yeah um pretty awkward

awkward video of me like being like ah i

accidentally turned

the uh sp 404 off sorry guys and people

but um yeah so

well well certainly at that point your

career starts taking off and you're and

uh you end up making a a career move

which anyone would have been

in your uh position i think the most

fascinating thing about your music is

that

it really feels like you're transported

to another world like i actually

have you actually listened to my music i

have actually listened to your music but

i will confess to you guys

that like if i just listen to your music

um i feel like i'm not getting the right

experience like i feel like i have to be

watching the video in order to

be like i'm not sure how many of your

fans feel the same way but i mean i kind

of feel that way

so i don't know i'm glad you feel that

way i

think yeah yeah because you're such a

visual uh artist and

that there are such striking visuals

again you feel transported to another

world for like a lot of your

um your videos and songs and so i feel

like they all go together in a way that

makes them more complete

like if i'm just listening to the music

in a car or whatnot

like i you know i just feel like

although let me wait until

you know i can be someplace and you know

like watch the video on my phone

i mean i don't know if that that's uh

everyone's attitude but for whatever

reason that's the way

uh i've experienced your music i mean

i'm usually thinking of

um videos like almost all my best songs

i like i was like ooh

imagine if i'm like imagine the scene or

something um

because i direct a lot of the videos

myself or co-direct them with my brother

um and then kind of make the song around

that so um

it is i think core to the music

and speaking of the canadian government

um part of the reason

i was able to even do that in the first

place like being super small and on an

indie label was

the canadian grant system which america

is maybe too big to have

art grants i don't know but that's

another thing that i

super appreciate about being born what

what i mean i didn't know this but what

an incredible story you're like the

product of the public education system

and then you had some kind of

art grants to make some of your first

videos that helped

launch you um so there are programs like

that in the united states but not in the

way you're describing i don't believe

like anyone who's an artist listening

this is like i haven't seen an art grant

in my life in the united states

the people who are saying that are

generally correct

um there there is a national endowment

for the arts but it would not go to an

independent musician that's trying to

make a video

like it it might go to a museum or an

art display

um not there's anything wrong with those

things um but that that's an incredible

story

of the government coming through i know

that that's why

i'm like i mean if you look at the amer

american music in general like so many

of the artists are

canadian or swedish or whatever you know

like

i do think there is you can like see a

direct correlation between the grant

system

and public funding for the arts and you

know um

like i don't know whatever the weekend

bieber

it's drake you know

yeah i i was just at a saturday night

live

um and i was hanging out with jim carrey

and it just struck me that he's another

uh super super canadian who like came

down and took over

you know showbiz so it's true like

canadian influence is very strong

everywhere

one of the things that i found out when

i was running this entrepreneurship

organization

venture for america was that artists

have the same impact on a community's

economic development

as entrepreneurs like if a bunch of

artists move to a community

and then you wait x years that community

will end up

having economic growth

new businesses revitalization in the

same way as if a group of entrepreneurs

went

and this is a major problem for the

united states because in the united

states

uh arts are treated not as an economic

driver but as something of a

luxury or frivolity uh in part because

of what you're describing where you show

up to college and then

anyone who says they're going to study

art or music would be like are you out

of your minds and

uh you know people get funneled towards

quote unquote these more practical

things

um when in truth and you and i talk

about this

like in the future we have to be

investing much more energy in arts and

creativity

uh because ai and technology are going

to do a lot of like the bookkeeping and

accounting and like the practical stuff

that that that people feel like is a

safer career i mean

a lot of this stuff is going to change

pretty quickly

yeah although i do actually think

like at least music is democratizing

really fast um

in part due to the tech companies like

um

you know garageband being free on an

apple computer or whatever

um you know i i actually like i think

you can actually record like

i think like billy eilish said she

recorded her album

in her house or whatever like it is the

technology is kind of getting to a place

where

i think in uh it's just getting a lot

more democratic like you don't

it used to be that you need to be just

really rich or on like a label

that's gonna spend

you know hundreds of thousands of

dollars to make an album and

um i think it's interesting because

you're just seeing the amount of artists

making music ballooning

right now um which is cool but then it's

its own

drama because i was actually just

talking to daniel ecke

who runs spotify and they're like you

know there's seven million artists on

spotify or whatever

um and like they feel like they can like

maybe make it so that like a million

artists can make a living off music

um which is still about seven million

yeah yeah seven million

probably it's gonna like double like

it's probably gonna be more than seven

million

um but i don't know like i wonder i mean

i know you're really into like ubi and

stuff like i wonder if there's ways

to like if everything is automated like

if there's

sort of ai and machines kind of like

doing almost

every sort of menial job or whatever

like is there

a world in which if companies aren't

paying employees they can like tax

they can be taxed more like because of

all the extra in theory all the extra

revenue they'd be making it while not

having to pay um

yeah yeah and like you know could that

be

like i don't know i'm actually curious

about like ubi like i haven't read that

much about it like i'm not like like i

don't know what the specifics would be

like how it would be

um accomplished or whatever uh i'm

really

passionate about a lot of elements of

this where

right now so and you know this much

better than i do and you're

like an ultra successful popular artist

but a lot of artists

are dependent upon actually performing

live and touring in order to make money

make a living

you know what i mean yeah um yeah

yeah for you too i mean like you you

understand uh this better than i would

but

uh the digital royalties from like a

spotify

are really really pretty minimal even

for folks who are getting tons and tons

of

downloads and views like i forget what

the math is but it's something like uh

i don't know like a tenth of a penny or

something ridiculous

yeah like maybe you get a few cents

and so there are artists who might get

millions of downloads

uh who are struggling to get by you know

it's

like it's actually yeah it's it's pretty

insane i mean i wouldn't say it's um

just an issue with the streaming

services i think of late

the labels are a huge part of this too

um

i mean in music there's just a lot of

middlemen like you know what once you

have like

you know business management lawyer

manager

booking agent label personally i think

labels pay too much but at the same time

um you know a label is also

can also throw a lot of money down on an

artist and it can fail so it's like

i'm not really sure what the solution is

but i

i do the situation in music worries me

like i know artists that are pretty

successful

that are like broke um and that's not

right

you know like that these are folks who

are uh

millions of plays like they're like

popular artists like

so it's it's yeah um

i feel like we need to sort of like

do something about the middleman

situation but then i like i don't

yeah there is a cost structure where you

have

uh an industry that came of age in a

time when there was a lot more money

flowing through because i'm old enough

to remember going to tower records and

like the cd stories and whatnot

you know that they were like buying this

a lot of times you were buying an album

for like one or two good songs too it

was like you know like that

that was like the way it's um so you do

have some legacy costs

um another big problem though is that

we've conditioned consumers to pay

one uh streaming fee and that's it you

know what i mean it's like if i paid for

spotify then i want all my music for

free um and then

and then the only way you can get more

money out of them is to show up in their

town and perform

which is okay i mean now it's not okay

because no one can perform

um but i think that they're there so one

of the solutions i had

um and you can imagine this as like

universal basic income so universal

basic incomes government

giving everyone money and if we did that

then musicians would make more music and

they wouldn't be starving to death and

people would have more money to

patronize them

and and support them but i think the

move we have to make

is something where we empower consumers

to pay artists directly just by

uh virtue of listening to them or having

their attention like

every american has like a hundred

music books or media books that they

have in any given month

and and by virtue of them listening to

you you actually get

maybe whatever the streaming like you

know pennies are but you get like a

micro fraction of that person's

music box for that month times all of

the folks that listen to it and then all

of a sudden the

money that goes to these seven million

artists in spotify like goes up

significantly

this is like a revved up version of

these public grants you're talking about

where instead of giving

it to the artist we give it to the

consumer so that when the consumer

uh listens to a musician or supports a

musician then the musician gets rewarded

like you would need some kind of

system like that which is actually very

doable like you know it's much more

doable now than it would have been in

another time

yeah or even you know i was listening to

a podcast do you know the revolutions

podcast

mike duncan um i don't listen to it but

i i've heard it

it's an incredible podcast um but you

know it's like he he seems to like

stress it's always just and like harry's

razors and all this and i'm like why

can't there just be a donate a dollar

like why can't i just buy yes

just donate the dollar and like watching

artists scramble for this stuff too and

be like hey support me on patreon

support me on this and

it's like you know it's like if i enjoy

your stuff you should just be getting

value from me

i just feel like every streaming like

every single streaming

service like even like youtube or

whatever spotify there should just be a

little thing at the side of like the

song

cast or the video and it's like i just

want to donate a dollar to this because

another thing i was thinking about a lot

is

music videos for example and i know you

wanted to talk about kpop

which i think is sort of anyway so like

the music video master class

at the moment but um they've taken it to

a whole other level it actually reminds

me of your stuff where it's very

transporting but go on

um but you know it's like so music

videos there isn't a direct

um uh you don't directly profit from a

music video you like pay for a music

video and you just like hope to god

like it makes the song take off or

whatever and that you can like earn the

money back on the video

and like i think this is it's kind of

sad because it's like i think the art of

music videos would be respected more

um if like you could pay for them in an

easier way like when i see a [ __ ]

fantastic music video i'm like damn like

why can't i just give them

two bucks or five bucks like you know um

there are so many problems that are tied

into this but one problem is that our

attention is being monetized in various

ways we're conditioned not to pay

but then we pay this hidden price

because you're selling ads and you're

selling my data and you're doing all

this stuff like particularly social

media world i mean a lot of this music

we're talking about it's on youtube

like freaking you know youtube tries to

monetize us through ads and

they've got very effective algorithms

and rabbit holes uh

and and some of that stuff's not great

you know like there's a joke that

you're always three clicks away from a

conspiracy theory on your

youtube like you'll start watching a

video that you'll wind up

you know watching some crazy video about

pizzerias or whatever

i don't know if this is like a proposed

idea but i've been thinking about this a

lot lately

like you know i feel like under

capitalism like we value things that we

pay for

more than things that we don't pay for

um yeah and

you know like

do you ever get into like that um am i

the page on reddit it's like a

page where people like they

they come and they like say they're like

okay am i the and they like say

their situation

and like there's so many of them with

like you know like a stay-at-home mom

like you know where the husband or

whatever is just like

like you're the stay-at-home mom it's an

easy life like blah blah blah like

everything is paid for um like chill

like you're not allowed to complain and

you know i really started thinking about

the fact that motherhood isn't

compensated

um and it's this weird oh my gosh yes

like motherhood is the hardest thing in

the world

like like like it's so cool

it's way harder than a regular job like

as a person like i thought i was like a

hard ass

like touring and you know just like

like it when you're just like alone with

a baby for

24 hours like you can barely go to the

bathroom like it's crazy like there

aren't other jobs where it's just like

going to the bathroom could just be like

a huge problem and like

you know i'm just holding a baby in your

arms crying and you're like i just need

to pee

like ah you know it's like a really

intensive job and i feel like people

our society super undervalues it and um

you know it's actually one of the most

important jobs like it's like raising

the next generation

what does canada do for new moms because

canada has paid uh

leave and whatnot uh the us is the most

pathologically anti-woman and

anti-family

and when evelyn had our first son

christopher

it was so difficult uh for both of us

but primarily for her

because when you're the dad the baby

doesn't

care about you like the baby's

homed in on mom and food

uh and like the dad like you know i was

um in the way a lot of the time

um but seeing what evelyn went through

and then trying to help

and being you know like uh um

not you know like as much help as i want

it to be um

uh it's so educational like because i

saw what everyone was going through

where like the

the baby um needed her 24 7.

the baby did not sleep more than you

know what i forget what the rhythm was

but

yeah like stop now or then and half the

time even when i was sleeping i was

sleeping on top of her

and so you know she was like kind of

half asleep

[Laughter]

the baby so she was just getting um yeah

it was so punishing

um and imagining a single mom going

through that

uh really broke my heart it's actually

why i ran for president because

i was cocky going into it i was like

there are two of us and where you know

like we have resources in the rest of it

and like it should be fine

and then it was like a bomb went off in

our house uh and

like we both were losing our minds for

months uh

and i just couldn't imagine someone

going through it alone

you know that's the main thing like two

or three days in i suddenly have this

insane empathy and like deep concern for

single mothers like i was just like oh

holy [ __ ]

this would be like like really really

bad if you were

doing this on your own um and like i

think you actually might be

you know people say single mom and this

and that but it like that's like a

really up thing i i think and i

don't think it's a society like we're

considering that

nearly not at all at all because it's

like

yeah the level brutality there is like

crazy

if you yeah going through it alone as a

single mom and right now 40

of american children are born to

unmarried moms uh you know and then some

really

yeah so so some of them like some of

them it looks like they're you know

their two parents in the homes they

happen not to be married but uh in in

many of them

uh it's just a mom like it it's

the new normal really in the u.s

uh and it breaks my heart because like

now i regard every

single mom as a super woman superhuman

uh about 90 of single parents are single

moms too so when you think single parent

you're like there are single dads out

there but they're outnumbered by single

moms like nine to one

yeah well i mean anything but single dad

too i mean if you're you know you're in

the same boat

really so um but i just like i don't

even know how you would have a job and

have a baby if

and like not have another person like i

literally can't like what would you do

like what would you do yeah i totally

agree like it's

unpredictable it's yeah

so we're talking about it now but how is

um like how how is

is it x-812 like how did i pronounce

that

right or i say xai archangel

because but uh there's great dispute um

i think around the world and in my house

because

i don't know his name is malleable um i

don't want to talk about him too much

because i'm like really in the like

wanting to de-celebritize him i i did

i guess i really got in my own world i

didn't think his name would be that big

of a meme

so like when it became like a giant meme

i was like oh

like i already my kid and it's

like no don't worry about it he's got

plenty of time to become

um uh aware trust me you know i've got

two boys and they don't know what the

heck is going on even now and they're

like you know five years older than him

so you're fine don't worry about it i

feel like it's like a consent thing like

a baby can't consent to being like

famous or whatever so i'm like

very cognizant of yeah trying to

keep his life normal and not have him be

like a celebrity baby or whatever

um does he have a does he have the

beginnings of a personality like

is he doing his thing oh yeah yeah yeah

definitely

i mean i think that's what's crazy like

personality seems almost there from day

one

more like day 20 but you know

well one of the things that happens when

you're a parent you'll probably agree

with this

i think uh is that before you you have

children

and you get this like nature versus

nurture debate um

you think like oh it's like they're both

really important it's like 50 50. and

then after you have kids you're like

nature totally

totally like like actually like you know

yeah like he was smiling

and um like reacting to the

helicopters and stuff like weeks before

he was responding to people and i was

like

okay obsessed with aircraft this seems

uh

um so yeah no but it's

i mean because he just his personality

is fully fully like he just

he has his vibe it's just there like i

don't think we could change it like he

enjoys what he enjoys he literally has

taste there's music he hates

like there's music he loves like it's

just like fully set

you know i'm sure i'm sure you could

like i don't know yeah

well i have the same experience where

you know like our boys are

very very specific and has nothing to do

with anything we did

you know like um so parents think it's

more nature than nurture and

apparently science agrees apparently

science says there's a lot of doesn't

mean yeah science does agree it's a bit

more nature than nurture

um so it's not our imagination


andrew i want to talk to you about

something called noom

which is basically a psychology focused

way

to lose weight get healthier get your

mind right getting in shape quote

unquote is something that

we all say but it doesn't actually have

to be about losing a specific amount of

weight or a magic number on the scale is

about these healthy habits of feeling

better about yourself which is why the

psychology is really important so

if fitting into your favorite pair of

jeans is great but there are many

reasons you might want to practice

self-care and every person is different

so for me

i find that at least on the trail too

when you're eating like crap or you're

traveling a lot you're working a lot

like the energy starts dropping your

sleep gets a little inconsistent

uh the desire to have an alcoholic

beverage too often

uh creeps up so this app

and website and program noom is pretty

powerful and what you do is you take

this quiz

and we've actually done a fair amount of

these types of quizzes but i really like

this one because it's not just like hey

what's your weight loss number it's like

what's important to you what are you

struggling with what are you uh

passionate about how busy are you what

is bothering you it's just stress level

is it eating it's nutrition it's

digestion whatever it is

um so you create this quiz and it takes

like three minutes or so

if you take it a little more serious put

more thought into probably five to six

minutes

and when you're done you get this plan

and

it's 10 minutes a day of either focusing

on your diet or physical activity or

meditation or whatever you think is or

whatever they determine is

helpful for your efforts

and for your plan and so for me i am on

a

getting shape plan by middle of january

which concludes a little bit of working

out and a little bit about diet

adjustments and i'm just getting started

but i've loved it so far

because it's simple and it's not trying

to hit a home run on your first

at bat like a lot of times when i get

back into working out

i think things like newmar the future

noom represents

the best application of technology to

actually make

us healthier happier sign up for your

so you just had an album come out um the

the creative process

i can't imagine what that's like for you

you know like i have

a couple of things that i work on but

like for you i feel like you have to be

absorbing

uh images and

music and just consuming culture in a

particular way because then at some

point you're going to produce

a video an album and there was a quote

from you that i loved it was something

like i don't want to just be the face of

this thing i produce i want to build it

like it sounds like you really have your

uh your el your elbows deep into

everything that you're doing

um so i feel like to do that you have to

be this kind of sponge where you're

synthesizing

um art and music um

you know maybe not all the time because

everyone needs a break but like i feel

like that must be

uh an important part of your work yeah

no

i think it's yeah i mean i'm just like

constantly obsessively consuming

new music and um you know books or

movies or whatever um it's really

important to me

it's it's actually like one of the

reasons i did the i don't know if you

saw like the i recently released an app

that's like a ai

um yes i wanted to talk about this it

was like um

the digital avatar that people could use

uh

it's it's a different it's like it

creates ai it's like an ai music

generative thing

that makes um audio for babies

um but part of the reason i did it is

like all the baby is so

i um uh i just feel like it's not good

art

like i find it like distressingly

obnoxious um

and like it was stressing me out because

i was like man i can't keep like

engaging with all this bad art

in order to raise my kid because it's

gonna make me a worse artist and also i

feel like it'll make him

[Laughter]

worse taste as well um

but that is so on point because you just

end up exposing yourself and your kid to

this

kind of crap for kids dumb kids stuff is

great

some kid stuff is great like i we were

watching fantasia the other night and i

was like

wow fantasia is a masterpiece like an

otter masterpiece

have you seen that movie that this old

disney movie oh yeah the old disney

mickey mouse the brooms the whole thing

yeah

and did you know what fantasia was made

in 1944 and if you

watch it from the lens of the war it

like completely changes the whole thing

it's like

yeah um great film but um

so i mean there's some i mean some kids

content is in my opinion some of the

best content there's also just a lot of

more like the baby stuff like getting

babies to like

open their eyes and you know you know

like all the little cards where you show

them the black and white thing to try to

get them to learn how to focus like i

feel like that stuff is

just feels weirdly mass produced and not

very artistic

um and i'm like man this stuff could be

it just could it could be prettier and

brought more crimes

if you wanted to uplift that you would

be doing the world

such a massive service uh because

every parent goes through this where you

look up and you're like okay

like how old is my kid what am i

supposed to be doing and then like you

you know like

go online and like buy some products and

you you bring them in

um and a lot of it is not as

uh human as it could be or should be

like that like there there is not a lot

of heart and soul in a lot of it

uh that yeah yeah so if and i know this

in part because evelyn went through some

similar processes

and so what she did is she had like a

scratch pad of

product ideas um and the the funny thing

is that

um by the time you turn to the product

idea as a mom like your kid has aged

into a need for

another product so you forget about that

one

i mean i my brother and i had this

really funny one that like no one would

ever want um

but do you know like brutalist

architecture

yeah yeah like so it was called

brutalist baby

and like everything would just be like

cement like hyper minimalist

um i don't know apparently that for sure

i feel like yeah now they'd be like oh

this is gonna make my kid more rugged

maybe it's like bad for the kid though

to be

maybe it's sort of like pr prison-esque

i don't know but

yeah i'm like super into brutal

brutalist architecture at the moment and

i

thought like brutalist baby like you

know like just like

a square cement crib would be kind of

cool

oh well one of the things you and i you

and i were bonding over which i

i think we need in the world is that we

need more public art like and

one of the fun things about you is like

you're continuously like posting kind of

visions and images

of various uh structures and sculptures

that

that should or could exist in the world

have you been to burning man

i have not i have many friends you've

been i take it you ben

yes and like the thing that

struck me the most about about it is

it's just like art

everywhere and it's just like it just

feels amazing to just be walking through

and there's no there's also no um

obviously sound restrictions so it's

just like every

half a block there's just like a whole

new audio experience and there's just

like

beautiful art everywhere and i'm just

like man

like imagine if our cities had this much

like if you were just to go

make something and just put it there

without all the bureaucracy and

paperwork

and like you know like even i wanted to

like mural my house or like paint it

black or something and like i had to go

through the city council and it was like

a whole thing i was like okay fine i'll

just

have a normal house like you know

because if it's gonna be such a problem

you're gonna devalue the neighborhood

and whatever then fine i i won't like

have a cool house but like

like that's you can't even like mural

your house

we should be able to mural our houses uh

in all seriousness i think public art at

a

bigger scale would be really

transformative because right now one of

the problems with america is that

we're uh cynical about our ability to

change and evolve

uh you know and and that's something

around like a level of

optimism and um

appetite for change in a positive way

and i genuinely think that art can

produce that in people

like if you were walking around a

neighborhood and then that like i guess

in your case like there's like a house

with a giant black mural and you're like

what the heck is that and then it makes

you

like think for a second you just done

like i i was in berlin recently to work

on the app actually and um

like there's just there is there's just

a lot more public art in berlin and i

was just like man this just feels cool

like it just

yes it just makes my day a bit better

like it's just a bit

it's uplifting like you're just more

likely to be positive you're more likely

to be

kind or generous or give someone the

benefit of the doubt when they cut you

off or whatever the heck it is like you

know you're just like

um more more positive to the extent

aside from burning man which

i understand like you know i mean that

that would be uh

like a singular experience are there

american cities that actually are

like not terrible at this where you go

and you're like okay like this place

kind of reminds me of

[Laughter]

berlin in that way or something like

that i'm trying to think

um i mean there's cities like

detroit or baltimore or montreal where

there's just a lot of abandoned

stuff and so there's a lot of like cool

sort of illegal spaces where artists are

residing

um uh like i'm less familiar with this

now but more like when i was in my like

super uh whatever underground touring

days

um and it's not like public but i i it

is

like sick like detroit there are murals

everywhere

because there are like uh there are

buildings that have fallen into

uh blight and disrepair and no one cares

what the heck you do so there are people

going

miami drink our basil which i think they

paint over the murals during the year

i'm not sure

but like it's sick to just like block

some blocks of murals

just it's just i'm like this is nice you

know it's just cool

and then they were kind of having mural

painting parties too where people were

painting murals and there'd just be a

bunch of people sitting around like

drinking and like chilling like well the

artists were painting the murals and i

was like

i don't know it's just nice like if i

had a sunday afternoon off and i was

walking around and i saw someone

painting a mural like i'd probably sit

there and

watch and hang out like nice it's like a

community a community building

vibe exercise yeah in your case you'd

probably sit there and be like you know

what you should probably go in this

direction over there they'd be like oh

yeah you're right

no no i don't want a backseat drive

that's the worst when someone's

like if i'm djing and people come up

with requests i'm like

you know don't want to backstage drive

to other people's art

just enjoy my vision

so i have only recently discovered k-pop

because you know i'm like

like an adult dude or whatever but

um but now that i've discovered it oh my

gosh like i'm convinced that

they've done they've like discovered

parts of our brains

that like activated something really uh

primal and and fundamental in us where

you can just watch that stuff and and

just like like almost fall into

like uh trance like i feel like

i was saying all this the other day i

was talking to my friends the other day

and about i like

my friend like was doing some art and

she was like oh but it's so wholesome

and there's no dark and it was just this

really like

everything was like pink and stuff and i

was like i don't know dude like i feel

like this is like

radically wholesome and it's like being

wholesome is actually sort of

like especially in art it's sort of

looked down upon and like you're

supposed to be a tortured artist or

whatever but it's like it's actually

kind of um

uh edgy to be wholesome at this point

and i sort of feel like with kpop

sometimes it's just it's like radically

wholesome like it's just like

nothing about it is abrasive and like

i think that's actually like kind of a

good thing like i feel like we almost

like don't have enough of that like it's

it's like nice to just like know i'm

gonna like vibe in and engage with

something that's just gonna like

sound great it's gonna look great it's

gonna be positive it's like about

love like there's like dancing like it's

just and it's just

gonna be executed at a flawless level

it's like i feel like it's sort of a

well i was gonna say underrated but

clearly not

anymore um well it's like the artists

are kind of frozen

in time at a particular age and stage

let you know if you had to trace the age

you'd say something like 16 to 26 i mean

i

don't know if that's actually how old

they all are um and

and then the the music's aimed at a

particular demo that's

you know kind of similar but it's also

kind of frozen in time like it reminds

me of

michael jackson and then bruno mars on

top of michael jackson or at least that

bts song that now is on the radio

everywhere

um where um where there

to me and this betrays you know i grew

up in the 80s or whatever but it gives

me like this wholesome 80s vibe

and i happened to have been in my teens

during the 80s so

so it's like it's like transported back

to

um to that point i think elon and i are

like not you know

like around the same age i guess you

might have a year or two on me

um so uh

so i i feel like they've really figured

they've like decoded something

they you know and i mean they've now

formed this billion dollar

creative industry like powerhouse

industry um

uh out of korea um did you see the black

pink documentary that's on netflix it's

like about the kind of training

information oh

there's a black thing talking about

netflix yeah

you really watch that yeah like but so

that they're like it's

it's great and mostly wholesome and the

rest of it but it also

shows the way these girls and they were

girls at the time

i got identified and recruited and

trained at essentially this boot camp

that goes 12 hours

a day like 13 out of 14 days

where they get taught how to sing

dance speak korean uh like generally

traffic in this way and like

and it also talks about how girls get

weeded out

on the regular like they're they're

there and then um you know the person

that they were brought in with

disappears and and like they

they come up and they're training for

this debut

um and their training of this debut like

five years later or whatnot like they

have the this archival footage

of them showing up as uh 16 year olds or

whatever it is and then they're like

debuting at

uh 21. um it's a you're gonna love it

like because you know you're gonna know

okay you know

that is like you know yeah that's the

directly exactly what i'm looking for at

this moment in time

holy cow can they dance like they can

dance like freaking

um they're almost like ai the entire

thing actually k-pop kind of reminds me

of ai

i mean i think they're just they're just

really well trained um you know it's

kind of it's kind of like the

the beyonce thing or whatever they're

just trained from young age so they're

just like actually

super pro like a lot of musicians like

me or a lot of people i know like like

i was 24 when grimes kind of

took off you know and i had put like

very little effort into training as

a artist or you know i'd never even

taken a single look at this crimes one

is daddy's friend

one thing that i know you were inspired

by from one of your early albums which i

was a fan of too was dune

for you was dune the book the early

movie

like wha what was it because you're one

of your early albums you were pretending

to essentially craft a soundtrack for

dune you were like oh if this was

if this was my soundtrack to it well the

tragedy of my life so like my dream as a

child

like i was like i want to be the i want

to direct the dune movie and like even

as a child i always had

i actually like i respect a lot of

things about the david lynch movie but

it's not

this prop maybe this is sort of like

not supposed to say this i don't love

the david lynch movie

um uh i super loved the book like my

i read the book when i was really young

like my dad started reading it to me

when i was like five or six

and then i just like got obsessed with

it and just like finished it like when i

was like

six or something so it's this very

formative experience to me

um uh but

yeah i think dune is like phenomenal

phenomenal i know it's like

i guess sort of problematic in some ways

or

you know um but uh

i'm actually really excited about the

new movie at first i was like

extremely bitter and i was like [ __ ]

danny villeneuve and blah blah blah

blah or whatever but honestly the cast

you probably wrapped around a lot of

these circles have you met um denny

villeneuve or any of these guys

no i've never met him i may be saying

his name wrong but

i recently i just copied my uh

[Laughter]

um but like weirdly timothy chalamet is

actually like a great actor

um and like zendaya like i don't know

honestly the casting in dune is like

almost perfect like it's

probably what i would have done so but

i'm so sad that it's been postponed

it was like i would literally i was like

i was like this is like the light at the

end of the tunnel like of the pandemic

was

going to dune like and i was you know

going to rent out a feeder for all my

friends and

everyone cosplay as a character from

dune

um and i was going to be like a sand

worm or an artistic interpretation of a

sand worm

um but yeah huge tragedy that that film

release has been delayed what um what a

glorious vision

of this uh film premiere or the private

film premiere like i hope this comes to

pass

just delayed you know a bit because like

the

the you and the um sand worm in a

costume would be funny

there'd be a lot of funny things to be

had um

um i'm a dune fan from the book uh the

the movie didn't do much for me

which is kind of funny um but

i loved the world building of the book

and i think that it was almost it was

very very hard to make a good movie

about that book

given filmmaking capabilities

of like the 80s and whatnot yeah yeah

yeah um i mean i

i one of the things that i love about

doing that i think is so interesting is

it's

it's like so far in the future but it's

sort of post technological

you know like ai is banned thinking

machines are banned and so like

people are just crazy mind enhancement

and stuff to like make up for

um you know the technology bands which

is really

really interesting to me um especially

because like i do worry

we might get into a situation where like

governments might start banning

technology um like i think a lot of like

the tech boom has been amazing but also

it

has been quite irresponsible from a

safety perspective and it like

you know i'm worried if the degree to

which like if the irresponsibility

continues we might get into a place

where like

we're shutting down technology like

because we just no no it's a real

i mean right now that's like the

the overreaction that everyone can see

coming uh because right now there

are so many people that do not feel like

they're getting included

by technologies uh forward advancement

uh and that there is something happening

where

uh where technology is consuming more

and more of our time

more and more of our kids time um are

you on tick tock

um on and off i do find the algorithm

to be unsafely addictive so

i'm bingo that's where i was going with

it yeah wait was i talking

about the main technology center for

humane yeah we were talking about

tristana

yeah yeah totally yeah and you know i

think for example like

i was listening to a podcast with

tristan harris and i think it's tristane

whatever i'm saying his name wrong

that's right and um

you know the guy who invented the

endless scroll you know and it's just

like

like a lot of this stuff is like really

addictive and also

like um prioritizes hysteria

and rage um and also just

uh misinformation um and you know i

think it's

like leading to not only like a

political crisis but a mental health

crisis

um yes you know i was also i was reading

this thing about how like you go on

twitter

or whatever and you your brain is kind

of getting the

social chemicals and you're like feel

like you're getting the social time but

you know you're not like there's

different hormonal releases when you're

actually in a room with real people

you know and it's like you're actually

you feel like you're getting social

a social experience but you're really

not and and so it's like people are

kind of having the byproducts of being

quite isolated

um not to mention the lack of sleep like

you know like these things like you're

on your phone late at night like it's

gonna be harder to sleep like i think

sleeping pill usage is going way up yeah

which is leads to less rem sleep blah

blah blah and all this like feeds into

like mental health crisis on top of

you know all the political political

stuff and everything um

but yeah i i it's quite concerning and

you know i was thinking the other day i

was talking some people the other day

um about how it you know it's like we

have global warming and then we have all

these global warming scientists or

whatever

or like we have pandemic and then we

have all these pandemic scientists but

then we have tech

and then there isn't like a tech safety

community that's super large like it's

quite small

it's quite unforgotten the extent that

it exists it's tiny like it's just

the people that he has on the podcast

and that that's like

i think there's like oxford there's like

some stuff at oxford like

there but it's still it's like it's just

not

it you know it's interesting that

when people consider career in tech it's

it's all sort of like making the tech

and none of it is the sort of like the

stuff

about the guard rails yeah yeah and it's

like especially like when we're getting

close to ai

and talking about ai you know it's like

it's going to be super important to have

like

as many people working on ai safety as

the

as much as actually just building

ai this is one of the things i said on

on the trail grimes is that i said look

some of the most powerful technologists

in the world have said to me that they

want guardrails on ai

because all the incentives right now are

to go as fast as possible because we're

competing against each other and the

chinese

and one of us is going to do something

very regrettable

and and so i would say to folks it's

like look if

elon is saying this or sam altman is

saying this then we really need to

listen because these are not people that

frankly generally request guardrails you

know

like that that's not really yeah yeah

yeah yeah no exactly like late

you know they yeah um uh

i mean one of the things that really

concerns me about the state of the

government right now

um you know at the risk of sounding

aegis

is we just have a lot of people in the

government who are like very old they

didn't grow up with the internet they're

not

super tuned into technology like you

know there's people who are like getting

their

they're not even checking their email

like in congress and stuff

they might never check their email in

their entire life yeah like their emails

get printed out and they read the paper

and then like say

you know it's just like this is like

really concerning like i don't think

the government across the board has any

understanding of

technology and that's part of the reason

the facebook situation is so out of

control

we can all see it's happening and you

don't want to be a jerk to be like oh

you know the olds don't get this stuff

but the fact is the average age of a u.s

senator is 62.

so like how many 62 year olds you know

that like understand

like the mechanics of the social media

companies um very few

and there has not been independent

guidance on technology related issues in

the us congress since 1995

you know 25 years so so they're

completely

out to lunch on this set of issues uh

it's corrosive for democracy it's close

environmental health

and i've experienced these social media

apps in a particular way

where i ran for president and tried to

use these apps to the best of my ability

to make my case

and compete and generate a following uh

and so

i've benefited from them tremendously um

yes yep but same i rely on them

completely

to run my business yeah um but i can

very very clearly see the downsides

for users uh where

i think that i'm unusually good on them

and even for me sometimes like i sense

myself

lapsing into like a twitter vortex or

like uh you know like an hour two will

pass

um and yeah and then i'll look up and be

like oh wait like i was supposed to do

this other thing

you know it it feels like you're being

productive in a particular way and

social in a particular way

well you huge reward you know the way

it's been set up like as

tristan harris or whatever says like

it's it's just

rewards we're like ooh like you hit the

heart and go blue like it you know like

the squirrel like this

it's so set up visually to just like

make your brain just like

like tuned in and you know it does it

does feel

semi-productive or you know you're like

oh i'm learning things i'm learning

things but it's like a very shallow

um comprehension you know if you're

getting a one sentence on a thing it's

like ooh like a fact like are you even

gonna remember that and

there's no deep knowledge there um which

and i'm not saying this like

i don't wanna say social media is all

bad social media obviously is great and

you know there's been a lot of like

political organizing and stuff on it so

yeah you know it's it's definitely like

i'm not just saying like

you know social media but but but

there are there are excesses and the

excesses are hitting teenage girls

particularly hard

yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean the

beauty stuff i

i think is like concerning

um and i believe that that tick tock is

the most powerful of these in its own

way

like i just got on tick tock maybe um

two weeks ago three weeks ago

and holy cow is that stuff powerful

like you you get in there and uh it's

it's hypnotic uh you know you just end

up seeing these videos of human beings

like like dancing humans are trained to

want to look at human faces

you know it's like like consider the

amount of portraits versus landscapes

you know in the lineage of painting um

like we want to look at humans like

we're you know

i i think yeah i think it behooves most

any adult

who wants to understand what's going on

with the younger generation to try and

spend a few hours on tick tock

just to see what the heck the kids are

doing um

because it's like another language it's

like another visual and digital language

it's got a different energy and

vocabulary different people

uh you know it's like it's fascinating

because like you know i've been on

twitter now for a little bit

and all the media and the journalists

are on twitter and then you go on tick

tock and it's like

just actual like kids having fun

[Laughter]

i think it's great for music for you for

music it would be

i'm sure like a really useful fire hose

you could just like turn it on and like

um get stimulation in a particular way

well it's sort of i think a more natural

i mean maybe there are

you know the dark forces of major labels

pushing certain

songs or whatever but like as far as i'm

aware like i feel like it's just people

like dig a song a song

has a cool vibe with a certain movement

and then like that song can kind of take

off in a

natural organic way and i think that's

pretty cool

um because music is super over gate kept

and i

like i think tick tock doesn't have that

i don't know i might be wrong but

there's a music discovery element and

there are

like undiscovered artists who are just

making their stuff there uh and

yeah yeah and getting found are you

gonna run again

do you think uh i'm almost certainly

gonna run for something at some point

and i i've been

pretty public about that um and i dare

say it would be more fun the second time

than the first time because

we'd start at a higher base

the but the problems are just getting

bigger and hairier and nastier and i

just want to try and solve them for

your son for my sons for everyone's kids

um because you and i are in a position

where we're actually more able to make a

difference in the world and

frankly you know like the vast vast

majority of folks and so

uh like i take that responsibility to

heart so yeah you're going to see andre

yang on some ballot somewhere in some

campaign

i've got a couple of uh visions uh but

first things first

you know we we have um right now this

this might be too um uh too nitty-gritty

for you but we're

heading to georgia for the senate races

uh trying to win the senate

oh yeah for the dems and then

uh you know and then i may end up in the

administration trying to tackle some of

the social media problems you're talking

about

um that would be cool yeah if you if you

if that does end up happening and you

end up like

i don't know like working with the

center for humane tech people or

anything like that like

and you need any help definitely hit me

up

i will hit you up that would be so fun

grimes what we do is we'd have this

get out um and then you could help

incredible creative for it um we'll hit

you up on that for
