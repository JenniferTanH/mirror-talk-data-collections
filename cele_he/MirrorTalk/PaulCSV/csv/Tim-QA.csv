Interviewer,You are the owner of speed-development.co.uk. Could you tell us about your company and your clientelle. It would also be good to hear about your background and what led you to create Speed Development.
Paul,"I've been racing in athletics since the age of 9. I started out racing cross country and 800-5k on the track. When i went to university in 2005 i gained a wider perspective of a wide range of team and individual sports and it was very easy to distinguish the top guys & girls from the ""chasers"". Speed, strength and skill appeared to be the difference so i began researching top coaches, trainers and athletes in sport. To name a few latif Thomas, mike boyle, bret Contreras and pat beith have been very influential and i agree with most of what they preach. After graduating from the University of Bedfordshire in 2009 in Applied sport science, I wrote myself a program designed to improve speed in all sprint events from 100-400m. I improved by 0.89 seconds in the 100 from 12.49 down to 11.60. At this point i realised how much i could help many other athletes improve their game. I believe every sprinter will improve by using my training methods. Including Usain! For now tho, i coach a small number of male & female athletes from ages of 10-44 in the east of England. Ben Snaith & Eugene Mandaza have both made the English schools final and Luke Oswick is now playing international football competitions. www.speed-development.co.uk is primarily a resource for the athletes i coach as i will post workouts & sprint videos for them to use as i provide an online coaching service for those who don't live locally."
Interviewer,Okay lets get into the training questions now. I'd like to start with strength training. Could you talk us through your exercise selection process when designing strength training programmes? How do you decide which exercises are the most approopriate for your athletes?
Paul,"This is a fantatastic question, as so many coaches and fitness experts get this wrong. First of all, let me start by saying the 2 biggest ways to improve most sports are strength and efficiency (skill, technique e.t.c.) I select an athletes' strength program based on the sport they play. There are 4 movements we need to train in the weight room. These are 1) axial loaded exercises (bottom to top) e.g squat, deadlift and lunge variations as well as sled pulls, box jumps, and depth jumps, which recruit the quadriceps. These may help you jump high in basketball, volleyball, football and about 40% of sprinting acceleration. 2) mediolateral loaded (side to side) e.g side raise, standing/lying/seated resistance band abduction which predominantly recruit the upper glutes, and inner thigh muscles. These help agility and cutting speed. 3) torsional loaded (rotational) e.g external band rotation and bicycles which help with rotational sports such as discus, hammer, javelin and field/court sports. 4) anteroposterior loaded (back to front) e.g hip thrusts aka glute bridge, quadruped hip extension, reverse hypers, back extensions, glute ham raise. This list is long because they are the most important to sprinting fowards. These exercises have been scientifically proven to recruit the largest percentage of muscle fibres when performed with appropriate weight. For example, many pilates and yoga classes incorporate anteroposterior exercises but using just bodyweight, so coaches working with ""powerhouse"" athletes like dwain chambers feel the need to put loads of weight on the bar which is great because it trains the CNS very well but doesn't recruit the glutes and hamstrings as well as many exercises used in pilates and yoga classes with middle aged women, respectfully. In fact the ACE study proved that a bodyweight quadruped hip extension recruited more gluteous maximus muscle than a 1RM conventional squat."
Paul,Charlie Francis once stated:.
Paul,"""elite sprinters have a hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio of 60:40. In other words their hamstrings are stronger than their quads. An average male has a 40:60 strength ratio""."
Paul,"So clearly, performing only axial loaded exercises in your programs are not the going to get optimum results for sprinters. You need an appropriate balance between axial and anteroposterior exercises to fulfil ones athletic potential. Also note that coaches who don't get exercise selection right but do get intensity, reps, sets, and rest between sets or workouts can see improvements simply by increasing the neural drive, CNS stimulation and fast twitch muscle fibre percentage if coincided with great track workouts also. I cant remember where i read this, it was more likely to be in ""Advanced techniques in glutei maximi strengthening"" by Bret Contreras which states:."
Paul,"""Elite sprinters contain up to 79% fast twitch muscle, whereas marathon runners possess up to 95% slow twitch fibres. However, some muscles are naturally faster or slower twitch than other. For example; the average glutes are over 70% slow twitch whereas the smaller muscles in the hand and face have much higher fast twitch characteristics""."
Paul,"Bret refers to the glutes as sleeping giants because they don't contract unless they are needed. E.g walking recruits 24% of the gluteous maximus, jogging recruits 48% of the glutes, so imagine how much recruitment they get when sprinting! Note that 100% glute activation is achieved by maximally squeezing your glutes and recording the EMG (electromyography) activity to scientifically measure the force generated by that particular muscle."
Paul,"A bit off topic from your question so i'll conclude by saying that without a doubt, relative strength gains in the upper glutes and hamstrings will produce faster top speed sprint times, less injuries and more world records in many sports."
Interviewer,"In terms of periodisation of the strength training programme coaches often fall into two broad camps. In the first camp the coaches will stick with the same key exercises throughout the programme. These coaches prefer to achieve variation through the adjustment parameters such as loads, sets, repetitions, tempo and recovery periods. In the second camp the coaches prefer to achieve variation by alternating exercises."
Interviewer,Do you fall into either of these camps? If so which one and why?
Paul,"Yes, i use both to some degree. Throughout the year we apply the progressive overload method which works extremely well with beginners and intermediate level athletes. Or put another way, athletes with a training age of less than 1 year. I have athletes of very different ages, training ages, strength levels, skill levels and spring levels. There is a strength-spring continuum whereby a ridiculously strong guy may be out sprinted by someone with pretty good strength and spring (plyometric) levels. Depending on where one is on the spring continuum will dictate how much emphasis is placed on strength, plyometrics, conditioning/endurance, hip mobility, agility/coordination, flexibility and speed. Novice athletes will generally improve with any of the above methods being trained but as the years pass and they begin to peak in their performance capacities, we must work on their weaknesses and maintain their strengths. For example, Some may think that Dwain Chambers has ""peaked"" in his speed and acceleration and therefore must place more emphasis on training speed endurance qualities whilst maintaining others. Either way, remember to take something out of a program if you are putting something else into it, otherwise you'll eventually keep adding more speed or strength or other components of fitness and it'll turn into a bad case of over training. This happens way too often in track, field, court and gym sports. They try to take the philosophy of one successful coach and add it to a program they got off the internet and then try to add their own recipe. As mike boyle once wrote, a cook tries to do the job a an experienced, knowledgeable chef and ends up with shit soup! What he should have done was stuck exactly to the original recipe, from the ingredients (exercises) to the time in the oven (reps, sets, distance run e.t.c)."
Paul,"So how do i adjust the parameters? In athletics we have 4 training phases with separate, but integrated goals in each of them."
Paul,"Firstly the general preparation period (GPP). Here we spend about 6 weeks starting from late September and spend time on bodyweight circuits, medicine ball routines, hip mobility work, low rep plyometrics maybe for stabilisation, tempo runs at 70-80% speed, and starting technique. This prepares them for the more specific work later on in the year/training phase. We use standing starts, 3/4pt starts and blocks here. We bridge the gap between the weight room and the track by pulling sleds (10% bodyweight), hills, and plyometrics in possibly all 4 load vectors (axial, anteroposterior, mediolateral and torsional)."
Paul,"We then move to more hypertrophy work for about 4-6 weeks if they are old enough and strong enough, if not they'll stick to more fun conditioning work, and here they'll get bigger and stronger in the glutes, hamstrings, vastus lateralis, adductor magni & core muscles, as well as various upper body muscles."
Paul,"Next is the max strength phase and this usually begins in the specific preparation phase (SPP) which begins around January with reps of about 8-12. Over the weeks the training volume & density gradually decreases as reps become more intense in the 2-5 range. It's important to lift the weight through a full range of motion and try to lift the weight as quick as possible bearing in mind some may deadlift over 200kgs. Sets is more complicated due to deload weeks, but they vary between 1-5 depending on the training phase. More details of this are on my website under the training programs section. One set of 8 different exercises may seem like a ridiculous workout to some, but it's what some advanced athletes may need in order to peak at the end of the season. Every fourth week in hypertrophy, max strength and power training will be a deload week whereby the reps may double in number and sets half in number, hence the intensity drops. We also combine training methods. For example we do bodyweight circuits, core and conditioning workouts in all 4 phases (general prep, specific prep, pre-comp & main comp phases). Max strength workouts may be combined with power or hypertrophy workouts either within a workout or in separate workouts within the week."
Paul,"As we approach the end of the season around july/august I do 1-2 power workouts and 1 max strength session per week. I believe in pushing max strength as far into the season as you can justify. I think it was Eric Cressey who found that a complete lay off in maximal strength training for 1 month led to an 8% decrease in your 1RM after 24 weeks of training. After a 6 month lay off, 1RM decreased by 88%, and after 12 months maximal strength levels returned to pre-training levels. I believe a 10 day tapering period before the major race of the season can be very productive. Some studies have shown increases by up to 24% in maximal strength after a good 10 day taper. However, there are many factors to consider when tapering which could yield very different results, with overtraining being the most common here."
Paul,"As well as varying the workouts, we also vary the exercises, and difficulty of exercises as the season progresses. For example, many of the bodyweight exercises we may start adding ankle weights, resistance bands, leverage angles, and bilateral unilateral variations (single or double limb movements). This is simply to adjust. Whenever an athlete complains that an exercise is too easy, or you feel the athlete is finding it too easy simply find a way to make it more demanding without changing the muscles recruited in the same movement pattern (extension, flexion e.t.c). The best example i can think of is the hip thrust. Most people can do a full range glute bridge with 2 legs in contact with the ground through a 10 degree hip hyper-extension range. They may even be-able to add weight to this by putting a 100kg bar on their hips for 10 reps, which will probably recruit the glutes 3 times more than a 1RM squat or twice as much as a 1RM deadlift (according to Bret Contreras). However, that same athlete may struggle to do 1 single leg bodyweight hip thrust through a full range of motion. Of course, unilateral exercises are more functional for most sports because they add a balancing factor which recruits the stabilising muscles around the hip, knee and ankle. Mike Boyle also believes that unilateral certain unilateral exercises take away the limiting factor in maximal lifting, whichis usually the lower back. Therefore, a guy with a 1RM squat of 100kg could potentially lift about 60-70kgs on a Bulgarian split squat (rear leg elevated single leg squat). On the conventional squat he's only lifting 50kg with each leg because the lower back gives way before the legs do. Some bodybuilders argue that people must strengthen their lower back with exercises like good mornings or back extensions, but I believe that could lead to imbalances in the posterior chain and further injuries in dynamic sports."
Paul,"Bilateral exercises are good for teaching lifting technique especially if they are not flexible through that range of motion, but unilateral exercises are ultimately what every athlete, coach, bodybuilder and regular gym goer should aim to achieve to get optimum results for their respectable efforts in the gym."
Interviewer,A current hot topic in sprint training relates to vertical Vs horizontal force production. Traditionally it had been assumed that maximum speed sprinting performance was dependant on the ability to produce high levels of force horizontally. Research from Weyand et al. then indicated that vertical force production was the limiting factor to maximum speed sprinting performance. Recently more research has been conducted by Brughelli et al. suggesting that increasing maximal sprint velocity may be more dependant on horizontal force production as opposed to vertical force production.
Interviewer,Where do you stand on this debate?
Paul,"As the race begins, the movement vector is changing all the time. During acceleration (from starting blocks) the movement is half axial loaded (vertical) and half anteroposterior loaded (horizontal). The sprinter should aim to come out at a 45 degree angle from the head to toe when joints are fully extended. When the sprinter is at top speed they'll be upright and so the movement is predominantly anteroposteror (horizontal). This is supported by studies which have observed elite sprinters displaying a 5-10cm vertical movement at top speed on each stride cycle compared to a 2.45-2.75m horizontal movement on each stride."
Interviewer,"The time taken from toe off as the foot leaves the ground behind you, to the time the foot moves foward and up underneath the hips. The speed and efficiency of the swing phase. As the knee drives up, the foot must be dorsi-flexed (toes lifted) in order to keep the leverages small to save time and energy of the swing phase. If you don't believe me, try lifting your foot up and out in front of you keeping your knee lock straight as you bring it up and down for 100 repetitions. Then, on the other leg try the same but with a bent knee. Both speed and efficiency are compromised. The rate of deceleration of the knee drive as the swing phase comes to an end before driving the foot back down to the ground. It is also important to get a high knee lift as your flexibility will allow whilst moving at high speed. Most top sprinters will bring their knee up at least 90 degrees at the hip joint which allows them to produce more force to the ground and hence cover more ground per stride. The time taken to extend the knee joint and bring the foot BACK and DOWN to the ground. Foot strike should be directly beneath the hip to avoid breaking forces. Slow runners and distance runners will land too far out in front as if overreaching which increases ground contact times, strain on hamstrings and posture break downs. Successful sprinting is about putting yourself in the best anatomical position to create the most amount of force to take advantage of all the strength training. Weak core and upper body strength are usually the source of posture breakdowns. The time taken to pull the centre of mass from behind to a neutral position. Like I said previously, the further out the foot strike takes place, the longer it'll take to be in the most powerful sprinting position to propel your body mass foward. It is also important that the knee be a straight as possible upon ground contact to maximise leg stiffness and translate that into a positive ground reaction force. Number six is hip hyper-extension."
Interviewer,"Okay onto sprint training itself. In a similar way to the contrasting thoughts on horizontal Vs vertical force production during maximum speed sprinting, it would seem that sprint coaches are generally divided between using a long to short training programme or a short to long programme."
Interviewer,How do you progress your sprint training workouts over the year?
Paul,The short to long approach is the best way to improve an athletes speed. I would blend the two methods if an athletes' speed has started to plateau or the athlete was training for the 400m and beyond.
Interviewer,What are some of the key technique drills that you use with your sprinters?
Paul,"In the warm up we do the A-skip, C-skip, A-run, Fast leg and alternating fast leg to teach correct foot placement, posture and path of the foot. I don't use the B-skip because I think it teaches sprinters to over stride. We use sled pulls and hills to get the athlete used to what negative shin angles should feel like. If a sprinter allows their knee angle to open up too much during the swing phase, they will over stride and/or produce too much vertical force, which slows down rate of acceleration and limits top end speed."
Paul,"Either in the warm up or in between reps, I may want athletes to do the wall march where they lean at a 45 degree angle to any fixated structure and practice 3, 5, 7 or 10 steps of driving the knee up to the chest and pushing the foot down and back to the ground so that foot strike takes place slightly behind the hips. If the hips are extended, this drill will teach the athlete neural patterns of the acceleration phase. Another drill i have athletes doing, particularly when running at top speed and speed endurance is the arm drill to teach the correct path the arms must travel. Too many sprinters will allow the angle of the elbow to open up which encourages the angle of the knee to open up which may lead to over striding, especially under a state of fatigue. I usually see more than one technical error at the same time within an athlete, so I have to decide whether to focus on several of their errors or focus on one at a time. The majority of the time their technical error comes down to inadequate strength levels, inadequate flexibility or a lack of concentration."
Interviewer,What are some of the biggest mistakes you see athletes and coaches making in their training?
Paul,"I know guys who go down to the track without a plan. They decide what to do once they're warmed up and sessions are done at random with no direction or specific goal. Get a plan. Write up a program for every day, week and month of the year. Maybe even a 4 year plan. If you're running the same workouts week in week out, you will not improve. If you're running a speed session and you're having less than 1 minute rest per 10m run, you're not running at 100% speed. If you're not video recording or giving technical feedback, how will the athlete know what he's doing wrong?"
Interviewer,Thank you very much for the interview Paul! Where can the readers find out more about you?
Paul,Cheers Tim. My website is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn more about speed training and staying in touch with the latest news in track & field.
