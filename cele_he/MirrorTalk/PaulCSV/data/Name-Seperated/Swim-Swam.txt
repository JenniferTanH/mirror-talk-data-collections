Q: Who do you expect to be your leaders for both the men and the women?

PG: Every athlete on our team has an important role to play! In regards to the leaders on the ladies side, it’s evident all the upperclassmen are eager to help in different ways. During competitions, we will look to Samantha Sposet, Jodi Turk and Madisen Tretter to lead the charge. On the men’s team, this senior class was part of a Horizon League championship team in 2013. Danny Roberts and Adam Ingledew were important pieces of that victorious team and continue to bring leadership every day. Based on his successes last season, we look to Philipp Sikatzki to lead the charge in the pool at each meet.

Q: Who do you expect could have a breakout season?

PG: Jonathon LaValle and Anna Evans each had solid a summer of training. Both are well ahead of where they were at this time last season. They are both in a good place at this moment.

Q: What are your expectations for both the men’s team and women’s team?

PG: Our expectation as a staff and team is to control the controllable. We want to make sure that each and every day we give all that we have to make the team better. If we strive daily towards this ideal, the results will happen.

Q: What most excites you about this group?

PG: The energy that a large new group brings to the team! Everyone is excited to learn and get better. The returning athletes are also willing to share and help the team.
