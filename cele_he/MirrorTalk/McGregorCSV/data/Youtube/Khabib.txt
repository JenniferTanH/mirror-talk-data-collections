Connor it's great to see you again good

to see you are you how are you pretty

good yeah it's been a while since I've

seen you in person so it's nice to be

back here it's a little nostalgic seeing

the team and whatnot and it's

interesting because I've been talking to

a lot of members of your team and I keep

hearing the same thing we haven't seen

him this happy and so long it's a

different Connor he's he's so engaged

he's so motivated do you agree with all

these statements and if so why is that

I'm feeling really good I'm enjoying my

trainer

I took am I just took my you know I

listen to myself what I needed to deal

with in my in my training set up and an

outside of the jamming and I and I

executed him I followed followed what I

what I said to myself that I needed

needed to deal when it's it's giving me

energy it's giving me focus and I'm

happy now you know I'm enjoying my

training so why are you happy now I mean

I'm just focused I'm just committed you

know when you say to yourself right you

know what you've got a deal right we all

know what we've got a deal we say to

ourselves I've got to do I should do it

this way I should do this and and if you

and when you don't do that and then you

carry on II you feel you know like IOC

Delta's removed by action so if you're

not if you're not working and that's

where the devil seeps in so I knew

things I should have been doing I things

I shouldn't have been doing

and I still did them and didn't do them

if you get me and but now I'm I'm

listening to myself and I followed my my

internal instruction and it's just given

me more passion and more focus I'm more

Drive and I'm doing what I feel I need

to do when it's and it feels good so

that's it what got you back on track

like is there a moment in your life that

got me back on track you were a call

when you when you started to tell

yourself I need to go back to how I once

was I don't know about a specific moment

just it's life as a crazy roller coaster

especially this life you know so we vote

we bounce but and I find I'm at my best

when I set out when I say a nice when I

must do something I know I'm was still

it and I do it I execute it and that's

what I'm doing right now that's what I

have done the trainer has been

phenomenal my coaches my team everyone's

been in sync together and we've had a

great camp and we're very very happy

here and obviously it's good to be back

in Las Vegas I haven't been in Vegas in

a while

very excited very happy you know it's

somewhat of a cliche in the fight game

best camp of my life I've never felt

better all this stuff and I think in

your particular case because there's so

much scrutiny on everything that you do

people roll their eyes when they say up

as camp we've heard this before why

should they believe you do you want them

to believe you you know I can't I can't

focus too much on the external okay it's

great it's all positive right now right

it's like everything's going great

everyone's saying it's this and it's

that but I just must focus on my

internal and my internal is amazing.i my

thoughts are strong my belief is is high

my confidence is high and that's it I

feel like I am NOT I want to say back to

who I was but I'm even better than who I

was you know everyone says we missed the

L the L Connor at the 2016 Connor at the

2015 Connor or whatever it was but I

feel I'm better than that now I feel um

I'm mature I've can I've come full

circle I've have experienced everything

in this business right I mean I'm just

an experienced individual I know what I

need to do when I'm doing it and I have

a solid team of masters tactician

behind me that are that I discussed my

feelings and my thoughts with them and

we brainstorm and communication is

another thing I wasn't communicating

with with my team of my people and I was

almost assuming that it should be

understood you know know you know and

now we're just in sync like every just

conversations constant conversations

about techniques about skills but

practices and we're all just rising and

feeling the energy and it's a beautiful

time was there ever a point where you

thought you wouldn't be back to this

spot maybe not even fight again was ever

a doubt in your mind no no he didn't you

know III was there and my training was

flawless I like I said when we had that

discussion a while back right I hired I

was in phenomenal condition I had a few

little slip-ups and they caused me I

ended up in a timeshare I thought in

army and I just slipped off slipped away

from me but I was in from a phenomenal

place then also so and I knew I know I

get back I knew I knew it

sometimes you need sometimes sometimes

certain things need to happen for you to

kind of to get things right right so

that's what happened to me and and Here

I am you know when we spoke in in August

it was a bit of a diff

Connor you were very contrite you were

apologetic you you've never been known

to be an apologetic guy in my care what

the Portier say Portier said am i went

from apologizing to absolutely nobody

apologizing to absolutely everybody and

it was different and I think the fact

I'm sure what to make of it right and

they weren't sure if you were being

sincere or not why we've never seen

Connor in this look I'm as real as

against like the slogan of the UFC okay

you get what you see with me I'm in the

wrong I'm in the wrong and and I'm

really that's who I am so that wasn't

that long ago that was just five or so

months ago meet you your demeanor is

different you seem different you seem

happier of course you're about to fight

what's the difference between this guy

and that guy in August were you nervous

about your career we're just you know I

let it let people down and that's it and

just I'm in a position where I must you

know you must take take control of

things and and not shy away from things

and that's that's I've never done that

in my career and I never will do it I'm

back here now how am i how many months

five months ago that was solid five

months work so I'm very very happy with

it

one thing that I remember you saying in

that and that interview was you felt

like it was a knife in the heart when

you when he started to hear the Irish

fans in particular lose faith in you

lose lose that trust in you because they

they propped you up right you meant so

much to them you feel like the support

of the people means a lot to me you know

I I do this to entertain the people you

know this this is for my for my fans and

my people who believe in me and not not

so much the anything that's gonna just

my lack of commitment I think the people

who believed in me and support me they

deserve better and I wish to give them

that night and I will and I am I know

like you said people can see that and

I'm putting in the walk and I'm saying

I'm putting in the focused walking

that's why we're all we're all in good

spirits do you feel like they are back

on your bandwagon or do you think you

have to do something I'm generally pay

you know that's why I'm like a man after

if there's even a thought it out and

they're not really with me anyway right

so look I've got my team my people I

know who's with me and I know

that's you know I'll say a prayer for

those who who cost me and try and bring

harm to me and and move on and stay

focused on the positive aspects of my

life and there are many many great

things in my life and that's it and you

know we can reach this bliss they say

right so that's that's that's helped me

a lot and I'm like I've got blinkers on

right I'm just focused nothing can

infiltrate my entire thoughts you know

no external it's like a lot of the

narratives Ariel that people say and

it's a crazy game right you know it just

used to irritate me to wait the way

certain the way certain narratives are

spread and the rewards are twisted and

these type of things and I just I had to

just disengage from it I eat but when I

came into the game it would happen and I

kind of laugh it off and plate and play

up to it and do my thing and then I just

kept on on and on and on and I just

cared a little a little a little more

and then I area I reacted I reacted to

disrespect but no more I am just focused

on myself my inner thoughts my team's

thoughts and and that's where we're at

the legendary boxer Marvelous Marvin

Marvin Hagler

he once said many moons ago that it's

it's it's hard to wake up at 5:00 a.m.

to go run outside when you're waking up

in silk pajamas you've experienced that

now right I'm caught in a show tracks

yeah I mean this is you know sorry about

Conor McGregor line damn is that a real

thing yeah it's it's not I don't think

it's for me it's not about money you're

right I'm in a position where it's not

it's forever money now this is not for

money for me and I'm a man so no one

that the money will stop my hunger for

this and my hunger to to compete and

entertain and and just and live my life

the way I want to live it and the way I

enjoy to live it and it certainly it's

too much money and without an awareness

of it of it in the past can be dangerous

you know he can there's no limits

there's no boundaries you can do

anything you can go anywhere you can

what I am I know what I want to do and

what I enjoy doing and this is what I

enjoy doing so I'm gonna keep doing it

and now I'm doing it full steam ahead

and

I'm in the best shape of my life in

mental and physical but it's not like

you're throwing a basketball into a hoop

right you're getting punched in the face

and you have to get punched in the face

leading up to the fight a minimum

fighter so no one's punching me in the

face how do you know I mean I do sharp

may trust me on that but I'm just saying

where do you find that motivation now if

you have forever money why do you keep

doing this cuz I love it it's far the

low Vario I absolutely love the game you

know I mean the last time I smoked I

love this business it's a royal game I'm

you know just I'm involved in so many

businesses right thriving businesses but

there's no business like the fight

business right was there any possibility

in the making of this folks I remember

you telling me you wanted to fight in

December and it didn't work out and

there was the Edgar togs but then of

course we settled on this one a woman -

Donald in a second but was there ever

any issues because of what happened last

year with all the stuff of making this

fight of getting a gun of being able to

come to America and make this fight

happen were there roadblocks what a

company is the Ultimate Fighting

Championship right such a such an

amazing company that's helped me and and

the people in the background and we've

always done great business and it's all

people know my character you know people

that know me know my character so

everything went smooth and the people

that helped me in the background they

understand that and they helped me and

I'm very thankful for that so ya know

there was no problem making everything

went smooth I know you were in court in

November you paid the fine pled guilty

for the the incident with the bar we

spoke about what happened in Miami is

there anything else that's pending in

your life now or we have a clean slate

in 2020 clean snake clean sweat I

remember you telling me not that long

ago you felt like your your your

character was being assassinated

constantly in the press do you feel like

that is still the case yeah but I just

don't know just like I said blink or saw

like good look that I will say a prayer

for that you know I mean I just it is

what it is it's part of life right it's

just like I said it just some time ago

be on top of me and then I was like

reacted but no more now I am I had to I

had to go go to that point how do you do

that - because I do become always wanted

to react and then to say like that I'm

done with this because

me man look at where it led me reacting

to disrespect and these happenings and I

just I've learned that some valuable

lessons in this that I'm very very

thankful for and I will use them going

forward you talk to anyone that helped

you you see this light to help you you

know understand that you have to stop

reacting just anyone in particular I've

got some great people in my life I've

got some great great people in my life

my coaches my management and everyone

like my family of course in Rhiannon

I've had some good conversations with

people and then you know the most

important you've got to have those

internal conversations because if you

can't tell yourself then then no one no

one can tell you so I am I'm grateful

for for the path that I've been on truly

it's been a phenomenal path and I'm very

very thankful I'm very very excited to

be back how would you describe 2019 for

you mm-hmm a learning year a year of

figuring out myself on my situation 2020

the year of perfect vision right I've

actually got better vision than 2020 I

was in on the exam that I said of 2015

really 20

well you know the last one was here you

see a 2010 but then the lady was like

2015 and today at this time and 2010 is

like a bionic eye so I think I've got

good I said let's uh say that and now

you have two children right - children a

boy Connor junior your daughter which is

always a great influence on a young man

right how has that changed yeah my

daughter crea Mairead McGregor I'm my

heart is full are dealing with my kids

they are here with me now in Las Vegas

we have a Vegas residence and it's great

to be back in the Vegas home with the

family is here my sister's here helping

out and absolutely amazing I'm very very

blessed and what a time for it to happen

for me you know I mean it was right on

the money for me you know I mean I

needed my kids to help me and they have

helped me and I'm very very happy and

very very proud I remember there was a

time when you were talking I remember

leading up to the Aldo fight oh he has a

family he's not

I know but you know I see walking around

bought this so did it turn out better

than yeah yeah in a way it was a

positive yeah of course now I'm very

very grateful a very very blessed that I

can bring my family with me Jose was on

his own over here when when we were due

on the tour then all over all over the

United States from Mary all over the

world but on that tour actually London

Ireland Brasilia everywhere but he

hadn't got his family with me I'm very

grateful that I can bring the family

with me and the kids and well have a

life life is a life is crazy right now

if his life is beautiful would you want

to bring your kids to the fight you know

I don't know my daughter's a liliane I

think I'll I think I'll have my family's

coming out like they always come out I

think maybe my motor mates might stay in

the house and I'll see I'll see how it

is it's it I'm at work you know I mean

this is work at the end of the day it's

a world game so I might bring junior

he's been at some intense Bayern

sessions he loves to fight he looks

fighting himself but I'll figure it out

I don't think I'll bring I won't but I

won't bring my daughter I know I'll

leave my daughter with my mother and

I'll figure out maybe junior does he

sits down who you are and what you do or

not quite yet Shane he understands

fighting and I don't know Henry

understands who we are I would say that

champ champ junior you know I look

forward to the day when I show him tapes

and show him footage and doesn't quite

understand yet although he's a very

intelligent young boy for like two and a

half two and a half years of age he is

and very very proud of my family in a in

a weird way is it almost possible to say

that they helped save your career and

I'm saying wonderful right at the time

that I needed it needed it the most so

I'm very very happy I'm very very

blessed obviously you know we've covered

back in August we covered a lot of the

stuff that happened over the past year

for you but serious things have been

written about you and I've been alleged

towards you is there anything that you

want to say about these allegations that

have been written about you that have

been said about you I am look just know

I can't say anything about this it just

has to take place right does it bother

you that these things rather that people

call you you know more two-putt are you

yes they you know what

so once upon a time time patience

patience is a skill we must master

patience is one of the most valuable

skills a human being must master and I'm

working hard to master it and I feel I'm

getting there so time time work time

well time will show all that's it right

now I have focused on on the belt

focused positivity good thoughts and I

would say a prayer for those who try of

course me I try and bring harm to me

with with these type of things and

that's it and as a family man as a

father

and we even things like you know the

story that came out someone said that

you were the father of their their child

then it comes out that you're not the

father that sticks to you right after

two and a half years that that situation

was going on for us so that was that was

a tough one for a while yeah but it is

what it is it's just there you go it's

not mine last question on this can you

say as your manager said in your your

your legal team has said you deny any of

these allegations that I've been yes of

course of course

100% yes daddy oh come on you're

seriously time time please just time

that's our time we'll review a lot of

time with hell honor and then I just see

how did we end up with Donald Cerrone as

your opponent you seem to have many

options why him um well I said I'd fight

him right I mean me and Donald had a

history a long history I'm not a long

history but we've had a histories and

it's an exciting belt it's a fan

friendly belt it's a fight that excites

me and it's a fight that I said I'd

partake and I appreciate it I appreciate

Donald had to say Allah you know he's

fought a lot of times and since the last

time I saw on my Sauron like the

aldo press conference many many years

ago he's gone on it and fought so many

times he's also a family man and with

his grandmother and these things I

appreciate that and I respect that Mel

to respect the method the method he went

about with the proper whiskey and you

know so much so much of what goes into

these things and have a bit to see it a

bit of respect they appreciate that and

I look forward to having a good belt I

know you're not interested in that he's

that wasn't the wrong the wrong wafer

but for me in this part of my land this

time of my life that is the right way to

go about it you know and especially now

I'm happy to come back and have my

comeback fight in the beginning of of my

season against Donald and I look forward

to it's gonna be a good night

and I'm gonna shine here on January 18th

I'm gonna create magic inside the

Octagon like I have done many times

before but this is gonna be something

special

so the the opponent and the weight was

your decision ultimately right you could

have made this at 155 like I'm under

weight right now so how much do you

weigh on this Friday before the fight

I'm underweight I'd say 160 160 and a

bit so why not make him I know I could

how I just don't think he looks well at

155 right he does not look well I won't

he's a 170 fighters so don't you want it

to suffer on the way too worried but I

want them or some of this I don't care

no I I could be a movie for I would

bring him any blade no I

I'd be him at any weight I be and when

he blade you know I mean I beat him if I

had to flail or so like I don't hair I

don't need you know I don't need that I

just want to focus on my training and

keep me sharp and you know I don't get a

cut men build and include it's not you

know it's I'm happy where I'm at and

also 170 is it an excitement for me I

like 170 I like what's going on at the

170 division at the minute you got Jorge

with that belt you got the other guys

would fighting for the belt and and I

like all what's going on at 117 I feel

good at 170 I feel energetic it's what I

weigh it's what I weigh and and that's

it so it opens up so many more options

right you don't want to die no 140 no

I'm not doing I 155 no okay I could make

good I can make 155 this this this fight

no problem but I am I just want to go in

freshen as it is let the let the fly

play as it is and then open up all my

options historically the knock on Donald

has been he can't win the big one never

won the belt in WC never won the belt

you have see you know when it seems like

he has a big fight when the spotlight is

on him he falters there's no bigger

spotlight than a fight against you so

are you counting on that are you

counting on him to not show up so to

speak and all that all that mean means

nothing it's it's me I'm gonna in their

fresh sharp fast like dangerous powerful

and full of energy

it can be if you want to put it on the

first flight of the mate of the of the

card in the first prelim fight or

something I think that's that that's

gonna make Donald be comfortable then do

that let's see what happens to stay it's

still gonna be it's not gonna be what's

gonna happen so yeah that's it I know

you're very in tune with the fence and

when this fight was first announced it

was like he's ducking gay Chi he's dead

that was the fight to make a chi just

beat Donald how could you fight Donald

yeah this is the fight to make what's

your response to the people who say that

you were ducking gaeshi and you picked

the easier fight

well well well first of all I put it

into the UFC's hands right I was like

they wanted to make the belt I wanted to

make the baton Justin's in listen to

heavy door he was going on with certain

things or said a lot of people are

saying certain things or following these

these narratives these vicious

narratives that are going around about

me and and I'm like just I'm just

putting that on off on the backburner

for a minute and but I'll get to him

he's gonna get the end he was made not

that we party aids not that boy Oliver

is that's a handy one that is a true

handy fight for me so and whatever he

has made a very personal with you right

look at you're not gonna be able to get

make it personal with me certainly not

now I've gone to the brink of personal

attacks here none of me I know I'm

bulletproof I am you're not gonna you're

not gonna do that man that's that's not

that's nothing but I am I'll fight him

at some stage I think I'll fight him at

some stage yet this year possibly this

year yeah I'm gonna be active I'm gonna

be active right this is a spar to me I'm

gonna go in here and there was AI plays

in here and put on a show for the fans

and and get a beautiful win and and we

don't do the divisions look at me and

let me actually tree weight divisions

you know I mean no one's doing this so

I'm very very excited and very happy and

long made the opponent's continue to

take home and I'll continue to knock

them down so you're viewing this as a

season as you said hoping for three

fights right probably not more possibly

more yes did you lay it out perfectly

for us that's whatever wants to know

we're all speculate are did it all right

you know just just know that there's

activity there's activity I don't even

know when the next well if I go in here

and put on the way or go two seconds

which is

could happen I I could late-night to

probably near the next event

that's the Trevor - Emma I just wanna

like I'm gonna for me right after the

fight now it's gonna be the next like

I'm not like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

like sink in with this this boys you

know and then just cuz he can get caught

up in it right yeah you get the win and

you're a great dam and all this all this

type stuff and I'm gonna I'm gonna go

out in the night I've got an after party

set I'm gonna go have a few sips of my

proper ways here I've abstained from

that I made a promise to myself I made a

promise to my team I made a promise to

my friends that I would stay wound

represent fully focused or up staying

from that and I miss it you know I do

love my liquid I'll have a few little

sips of my after-party I'll take the

following day to rest and then the day

after that I will engage in a red zone

McGregor fast training session like I

don't post the as - after the ds2 fight

I went that I had my afterparty I took a

day rest after the fight and I went in

and I don't read on sprints on the ski

area the skier it's a stationary machine

we pull the strings down because the leg

was jammed up from kicking Diaz's me and

his legs and so I couldn't I was hot I

was on crutches and I got that walk in

and just least set my mind I just reset

my mind put me back in that training

mind it's so easy for you to finish a

fight have a little celebration and then

it's stretched into the next day and

then you read a bit of bad food and then

the next day and then it's kind of hard

to pull yourself back in so I have my

plan that I'm gonna set out and that's

what it is I'm gonna have my little

celebration rest the next day and then

back into training and then and then

what's next Wow okay so this is I mean

we haven't seen you active like this in

a very long time so if I asked you do

you even have the opponents in mind it

does not matter you don't there's so

many times in Justin's there jeho Hayes

there my Camaros there don't have a

preference I don't know I don't yeah it

just wouldn't be fair to say you want to

end with Labib in Moscow cuz that's what

you know that one I'd love that one but

that's got to happen it's got to happen

here not a man he can it must happen so

I went on Moscow and I wasn't so was

that like our amazing Moscow is a great

place Roose is a great place I got to

say I'm very impressed with him you

didn't feel unsafe at any point no not a

Russian people did you see the fans and

the soap you know they're good people

have something at you

I sort of reflected I could have caught

it as well I loved it I love I love the

game you know yeah I look forward to

that to that competition it's fully

focused you can see it come on you can

see the shape of me yeah everyone knows

everyone knows and no matter what they

can map that mine can run but he cannot

hide from it so in the build-up to that

fight a lot was said right it's very

personal between you and a lot was said

that I think it wasn't just shared was

actions that led to what was said it

wasn't just they didn't just get to

words it was you know there was actions

that led to those words so like what

like just things that true about the

course of the build-up like with the

Artem situation you know and thinks that

maybe maybe slipped under the radar like

it was meeteth kind of began or listened

and whatever it did get it did get very

very personal but I'm I'm taking a back

step from that and focusing on the

skills it's a very skillful belt and he

poses a specific air a specific style

set and I posed a specific style set

it's an interesting clash with two fully

focused fighters and that's what will

happen in the next belt and I look

forward to it and settling it but I'm

just curious because it got so personal

things about in his family and he was

talking about things were that they were

being alleged about you and do you

regret any of that do you do wish in

hindsight it didn't get that personal

about his family the religion all that

the dad yes so some of the things maybe

I may be too far but hey it's it is what

it is it's the fight business at the end

of the day it went the way it went

that's it but you think that fight will

happen again when you hear him say he's

gotta win 10 fights and all this stuff

oh yeah what is your reaction to that

fear fear you know doesn't want it so

this is what it is you mentioned

something very quickly there that I just

want to ask you about so I think a lot

of people be surprised you said no

liquid in this camp when's the last time

you had a drink a couple of good couple

months ago tree for all months ago maybe

here is that a first for you or at least

first in a while what was Rincon oblate

in 40 week you asked me am I think I was

on the Conan O'Brien show yes Abra

I mean part of the Habib fight yeah hmm

you were drinking in the build-up mm

yeah mm-hmm was that common for you and

your career not read not not to that

extent no not that extent why'd you do

that I don't know I just I just venom in

me or something don't know boy I had

people holed up in a in a hotel from

that part that a world and and I would I

would ring and her and and arrange a

fight

so they come from the hotel down to the

gym and have a full block a full blown

flight no head guard close that

certainly good and a fight I'd win you

know I'd have a war and I'd win I'd

knock the guy out and then I go off and

celebrate and then I'd come back in

three days three days what were you

doing you know just don't know not

nothing what I should have been there

celebrating partying just I don't know

just not living the life that I should

be living and that's it so I'm not going

back there you know I mean I'm in a

graceful nail that's he and I put I've

made mistakes and you know I've been man

enough to admit them and correct them

and that's what I don't and you know I

mean I'm Way know I might not be perfect

area right but where would I what a good

sleep and a full belly on damn close

what time are you going to sleep these

days well right now we're on the course

getting onto the clock of a fight time

right that's hey I'll be walking into

the Octagon 10:00 p.m. of aigis time but

back home in Ireland I was sleeping

early I was waking up early we had a set

time I think was like it was 11 a.m. and

7:00 p.m. on my training sessions slots

and then so that was it I stayed

structure to of that now that we're here

or in the gym now every time on fight

night all right at the time of the fight

and carrying on I feel I've got a custom

for the time already to the times aren't

so perfect absolutely flawless

and I've heard you call that previous

camp of disaster right I'm not trying to

get you know it's not a disaster you

learned something from everything right

but I heard a lot about myself shoe and

and home came here on the walk was great

like but it's not like I was coming into

gym being lazy and half-ass that goes

almost what the park I said here I was

almost too too intense and to series and

to working too hard in the gym and

they're not working hard enough outside

because that's a that's a big part of it

as well you know I mean you've got to be

focused outside cuz then the next day

rolls around interview I'm focused when

you left the gym and then it's time to

go back you're not a sharp you're not as

fresh you're not as eager to be there

and that's what kept happening to me and

I just avenged didn't want to be there

never get there and then I have this the

scrap and then I'd offer go again and it

is what it is everything's a lesson and

some parts of it were enjoyable though

you knows I do love a good scrap just I

just gotta stay focused outside is um

let's see how are things with your head

coach John Cavanaugh amazing absolutely

amazing very very very in in contact you

know we discuss a lot or we we discussed

training methods and practices

everything you know that's communication

has been excellent this camp and I made

sure you know just it wasn't the last

camp not nothing not even with John but

it would everyone involves you know so

I've been a lot more in communication

with my team and relay and how I feel

and and you know what some hyuna

together we are truly some unit I

brought back my boxing coaches as well

went back to my old boxing gym feel sort

of and then at crowman Boxing Club it's

where I learned have the pawn shop

that's been good for the soul and that

and uh you know I said in my head that

after to me after I went back then I was

like because I don't know boxing about

in in there good Friday show and I had

feel in the corner and that I was like

damn I should I should have had the guys

in there for their Mayweather build-up

and you know I was part of the team and

but look that's the box and Avenue still

there also I'm it's good to have big the

guys back and there's a great energy in

the counter walks been phenomenal

everyone's in sync and that's it I had a

true team of tactician

behind me and

I'm excited to go in and represent our

walk and this is something that I don't

think that guys have caught on

just yet you and Phil Sutcliff I've seen

you working with him kind of like the

classic old boxing guy if you will the

decision to bring them back I think is

really interesting and I think symbolic

of the fact that you were trying to go

back to when it was simpler and to your

roots so to speak is this the first time

in your MMA career that you have had

them a part of of your camp in your

corner part of the corner yes and not

part of the can but since UFC days my

early MMA career I was still in the box

and in the boxing gym I would go to the

box in Germany and it's faster and it

mixed martial arts jamming we were kind

of at loggerheads a while back at the

very beginning because it was they could

not understood what the mixed martial

arts was and then that's kind of what

led me the interest to kind of stay

focused on the only MMA what boxing such

a beautiful beautiful discipline and

these guys are the best

you know me and so I'm very very and

this is what I learned how to fight and

then hit the box so I'm pretty happy

them feel yeah when were you at Kremlin

I will do a table 12

Wow 12 so do you see the symbolism in

that to have profits where my 12 keeps

bouncing up everywhere it's magic for

sex right - 46 is UFC two four six yeah

adds up to 12 to the 12th UFC fight it's

my 12th UFC fight something else there

was another one I think the date counted

up to 12 or something a 1 numerology is

but there's some great symbolism in that

right now bring back the old coach so to

speak of course you have to push anyone

out but you're adding him yes no no no

we're together we are all better we're

better together

most certainly everyone everyone on my

team has amazing skills and amazing

knowledge of the fight game in specific

areas generally and so and like I said

we're all in sync we're all in

discussion and we're in a great spot did

you sign a new deal signed a new deal

yes I'm on the fight and it's just that

usually just work for you here I've got

a piece here don't fire than you

renegotiate it's that blasted I believe

that's buzz what will happen after this

one I know

that's a no point of doing the eight

fight deals anymore if you're just gonna

renegotiate every single time yeah I

know you yeah yeah I'm confident it's

gonna be a good a nice paycheck most

ever probably in in my mixed martial

arts career yeah really hmm give us the

range we knew how much you made for

Mayweather yeah I'd say about it could

be I'm estimating a good 80 million 80

mmm come on

yeah because I have all like I said we

got the Australia and Canada and England

and England and Ireland then should be a

good one

Wow what did you make for Habib fifty

fifteen of it Wow eighty no one's ever

made anything most of many fighters

combined haven't made that think I'm

toast out here but I'm still the bread

you know this is the first time since

the Seaver fight that you're not a

champion or there's no stakes there's no

belt on the line or anything like that

even with Nate not a title fight we're

still a champion and whatnot does it

feel a little different now

no no I am the champ champ forever and

always

it's in stone were you annoyed at the

BMF title stuff mom I thought it was

great yeah that was great

I guess straightaway I was like who will

show me that belt I wanted this I saw

the belt before Dana said that over to

me and then I was missing say no design

because I seen the drawer unloved at the

outline of it but I didn't see the color

of it I was estimating was gonna be the

BMF with the gold right and then when I

saw the silver and black and I don't

know about it sorry well scoop it up

though well I'm attitude to the thing

yeah definitely so do you almost feel

like those two should finish up their

business and maybe the winter fights you

cuz I was with our name cuz it ended

yeah yeah you don't know what wait wait

is now you're not I mean it's where did

where do you want to do it again I don't

think we were robbed at all right I mean

you could see Jorge dippin oh he was

dipping there enough at the end that I

toured around and that's where Nate's

only kicking in yeah

it would've been great to see the four

on five we didn't see it look whatever

see what happens you really feel that

the hub you Tony if I won't happen just

maybe you know possibly has nothing put

that supposed to happen four times I

mean they're known for pullin out ray

Kirk I be able supposed to vote Donald

about three or four times also an

alternate all that with a knee injury a

back injury of lading something happened

with his liver and I'm just saying that

he's pull their put they're known for

pulling out of belts Tony bleeding

tripping where no blame box you do pair

of black sunglasses own or violence and

I'm bleeding chair stacked on top of you

today you know what Tony's they him so

see what happens

did you see this month's reply to your

comments what was again essentially you

know if you want to if you want to have

your career over my leg holding

my leg come on these does not help the

fight all show yourself too funny you

know I mean that people know what's a

scrappin what's not a scrap and that

that method a fine it's not you know

although that last was a good for they

both stood near me they would had a

moment sir but hey you know what way you

trying to find me so but isn't it a

little disingenuous like everyone like

yeah but only it's tainted baloney right

you laugh at it mm-hmm exactly

recently did you have someone come visit

the gaff as you would call it the

apartment as a bit of a motivational

telling your Robbins yeah Robbins has

been hit with my

happen you know because they went

because when I was in Miami right I went

that Tony Robbins asked me to come to

his house induce and speak to his people

like his platinum there's people of the

platinum liens they're called home he's

a great man went into the real music

started playing and I was just really I

think I got a great boss but they had a

great conversation but I'm Tom I believe

it's on line yes it went with everywhere

in that name and I'm just kept in

contact with honies very very helpful

ease of just top man Tony years like

it's not just it's not just Wars you

know I mean this does action in there in

the structure and what he say you know

and he came to the house and went out

over some things and again I had my

coach my coaches there a couple and I

cover him John and my

conditioning coaches and and I'm

speaking to Tony and we were you know

close the eyes results um so good good

good thing I wanted everyone I wanted my

I want the John there and and and the

doc and my fast coaches that he can

understand where my thinking was and you

know so could be a bit more and sink and

it's very happy when I felt felt really

uplift it coming out of and took some

things and very thankful for that and

I'm gonna continue that I think he's

gonna come out to me on the day before

the fight may be also yeah so so it's

almost like a motivational yeah yeah

shaping into me it's actually not even a

motivational thing does not it's well it

is that as well but it's I'm not sure

what the title would be ill about it's

very she's probably shaping up to be a

life coach of mine and so I'm very happy

with thanks Wow and he doesn't live here

right comes he came in just for that you

showed me a lot as well you know and and

came to my house and is there a lesson

or two that he that he taught you this

yeah a couple of just we went over some

things and I'll just keep it at that

okay hmm

do you ever go back and look at your

early fights even pre UFC or early

interview course yeah yes say that some

that's one thing that I've known right

because recently yeah definitely yeah I

went back and listened to my old self

you know no matter what way I was

thinking when I was when I was you know

everything was innocently everything was

just you know I mean not what it is now

are and that helped me a lot I was able

to go back and see what way my way of

thinking was they into it the way it is

now and you know just add what is useful

discard what is not you know Bruce Lee

quote that's what I don't and it gives

you motivation

yeah of course gives me a motivator

remember what that was like being on

welfare you know I saw I was actually

watching the documentary last night

the notorious documentary and und your

your lifelong partner are in like a tiny

tiny room in your parents upstairs and

you're both eating up there it's it's

saying to see that and not to see you

know what you become do you even

remember what that's like yeah of course

I stay I stay close to my roots always I

stay close to how I came up always in my

way of thinking of course God you've got

to you yeah because there's a part of

you that could forget ever you have all

this money you don't know what

do it in your buying things whenever you

want fancy clothes all that stuff

there's a part of you that could forget

that that's understandable

yeah but you haven't no no I made sure

to stay close to my roots stay close to

who I am and who I was and and that's it

you still won't never forget its

spending and thing you still do a lot

less though not less why is that I don't

know just I have a lot of teens right I

don't

like I said I actually said this to Tony

Robbins right cuz I read something about

LeBron James a while back about maybe a

year ago that he was steady spent 1.5

million annual on his health write

himself this is everything his

nutritionist training is everything and

I spent nothing

and I was like only in camp I bring a

team together of people and I was like

that's not the way to do all this so you

know me right but I drop I dropped money

on a blade in car or a blade all right

watch I'm gonna like put spend on myself

you know on my health and my fitness and

and that's helped me and then and then I

then you acquire more you're gonna

acquire it even more than when you're

shark and that's what I am now so unless

some possessions and things I suppose I

know but you've gotta go true right you

doughnut dough you're gonna always go

true that when you get our windfall you

know you're gonna sack any things do

just get a little bit it doesn't make

sight me as much as it would have you

know what I mean what excites me now is

creating you know I like I'd like to

create the things that I don't like the

clothing and I'm very much involved in

the designs and building building things

we're really working with my company

August McGregor and of course the

whiskey and the these ventures and and

that's what I enjoy doing so you're 31

now do you think you'll still be

fighting at 40 yeah yeah I don't know I

don't know it's probably but you're not

like a cap no no I'm gonna have a solid

couple years though I know I'll be

rocking I'll be rocking tell on to a

good 25 I'm gonna hit the Billy bottom

but if I'm 25 years of age the Billy

I'll be a billionaire but a hell on 25

that's that's so three and a half years

yeah really

mmm you're getting there yeah dude look

at those lists and compare yourself you

know when they put the highest and

earning absolute list one list now

well it alternates by year I think I was

not sure where I was this year not not

bad I think it was jeez I forgot now to

be honest but I was up there I was up

there I saw the decade when Floyd was

top of the decades yes

fair play Tom yeah and she's not so good

at the management of a great man how

close are you to the Billy I'm still a

good way away look what I mean I get

that I'll get there god I've got the

methods and it's something that excites

me and you just keep fighting in order

to get that right like you can't just

leave part of the success I'm not

waiting for word I know in Florida you

know I mean that's fine definitely helps

everything I finds opens up look at the

month let the bread I'm making sure the

fight game and I'm not even scratching

the surface on what I really probably

should be paid right I mean like the

backend money is where it's coming true

but it's it should be it should be

guaranteed right but I mean whenever it

is what it is so the fighting the fight

is definitely an animal to get there

like like the Mike Harrison Ford stunts

you want to have another boxing match

you feel like that's most certainly yeah

well I'd like to rematch Florida I think

we should rematch Floyd I mean he's

flirting with it and then when all this

and he can go and pick someone else it's

not gonna be the same it's not I don't

phenomenal I don't feel homeland that

belt and the only reason I lost that

belt was cause I prepared I prepared for

a back footed Philly shell style of

opponent and when the fight was like

that I was picking him apart then he

came forward and start pressing and I

wasn't sinking into my shots like I am

there one like my box and coaches under

my belt that I that are drilling

specific boxing things to enter me again

and I know I beat Floyd I know I beat

Floyd if we be matched and when we

rematch she's not gonna be one that

makes much noise but like he said it was

supposed to be it was supposed to be me

box and then we'll do one mixed martial

arts belt that was what was said and I

can tell his melt as well and was not

very not written but it was a variable

agreement ray and obviously that's not

gonna happen and I'm like me I don't

even I'm not gonna push him on that

either but I would like to box him I

think I think and that would be that

would be a good it would very much have

you even broach the subject yet

Stephenie we've definitely been talked

it's always kind of doctor no not to him

but

it's his people yeah just all this time

because he's coming back and all this

yeah he sat with Dana wait at the

basketball game right they had a

handshake deal yeah it was a good

capital it was a good yeah yeah good

noisemaker this happen this year is

something good people to do business

with the Showtime people and Floyd did

you never know but it's not something

you're actively pursuing is just

something you want activity is what I'm

pursuing right so I'm just keeping

myself in shape

fresh focused and everything will happen

true that off of that so like that even

even even the mayor to build up over ten

weeks but ten weeks to prepare for that

and before that I wasn't in the rest I

wasn't you know I mean I was out messing

around the games and I mean I wasn't

good solid ten weeks now

now I'm fully focused so we'll see what

happens do you do look at that fight as

a man I could have been the one had I

not been doing that had I not been part

I could have been the one to beat him

the one guy I squandered that don't

squander it was a great it was a great

conversation you have a good internal

convert a good inner conversation you

have what a man when you've a fight with

him so it's great to fight flow at a

great day great to be in there with a

man Army's got he's a crafty veteran

he's truly craft you don't get the

profile or know 50 pro wins and an

extensive amateur career and you know I

mean so it was a great great experience

and I'm you know doing it again if not

in if it but I will happen that's gonna

happen again sings oh yeah we a mystic

man yeah it's happening again but also I

would be open to order box and belts you

know I know the money has been what

actually closed does a city close to

sign of money and what do you mean oh

yeah yeah what's that

now me and man look there's been talks

about the money for use well it's like

you versus Manny that's Bennett that's

there was enough for there was enough

are made on that year and what happened

just not yet not yet so but it's a

possibility

very much so great in the poly Freud

like the Box Pauly is oh boy not that's

a bit about that's a bit of buzz as well

Pauly a box and bell and I want to

boxing it I will box again I'd love a

pocket I will get a boxing world title a

boxing world how is

and you'll probably have the box of

multiple times to get that yeah but I

would box multiple times I love boxing

I truly little box and so yeah I'm damn

good

when you say sign pot what do you mean

excuse me sign Manny what do you mean

how does this negotiations going on you

know yourself right yeah okay

let's tell on this guy taken up a lot of

your time you know I I remember when you

beat Aldo you told me that I went from

nothing to something to everything right

yeah what a line that was yeah yeah yeah

I've had some good ones have a nice yes

and some good quotes yeah they put it on

clothes and sell them out quick that's

right but you know and Joe Rogan said

then we have to be out of fight you've

done it all sir

that's what he said you've done it all

sir so you know how wrong he was

everything I've done so much more it is

right yeah yeah what we gonna say anyway

so you have everything and then there

was a chance maybe people thought you

might lose everything right and that

here you are and even sitting in front

of you and I know people aren't gonna

believe this you're a different guy

you're different than the one that I

spoke to an artist even different than

the one prior to the Habib fight you

were a little bit you know all over the

place I don't remember the interview

that you did with the Mack life standing

right over there you were looking all

over the place you're so thin right now

I don't even know what to make of this

yeah howdy

what do we what do we make of this is

this the new chapter is this a new

Connor is this back to the old Connor I

would say it's a new Connor I just feel

reinvigorated you know excited let's

let's see yeah the illusion of all the

other stuff is is amazing for excitement

the excitement is building right it's a

the fans are very excited that people

already excited to see this bounce see

me competing I'm very excited to be back

and to be to be gift gifting this to the

people and I'd be remiss if I don't ask

for a prediction cuz that's what you

were known for for all those years

hmm how do you beat Donald I stopped him

when I knock him out early possibly yes

you've never been a possibly yes I mean

yeah you know yourself I'm gonna be I'm

gonna be I'm it's I'm ready for it all

so you see what happens John estimates a

little bit later I think it could be

very early I could he's getting knocked

out welcome back
