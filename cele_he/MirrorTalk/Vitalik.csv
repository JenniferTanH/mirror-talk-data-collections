Interviewer,"Hello, you found the portal. I'm your host, Eric Weinstein, and I'm sitting here today with vitalik butyrin, the leader and founder of the Ethereum world of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Welcome to the portal."
Vitalik,"Thank you. It's good to be here, Eric."
Interviewer,"it's terrific to have you. Now in general, when I see you interviewed, immediately, everybody goes straight to cryptocurrencies and Nerium. But one of the things that I found fascinating about your story is, is that in order to be a good steward of this new emerging economics, you've actually applied yourself a great deal to standard and regular economic theory. And I was curious, if I understand correctly, you dropped out of college after a year you're self taught in economics, but you've taken a real interest in understanding How markets and economic theory work. Is that a fair description?"
Vitalik,"Yeah, I think so. And economics has been of interest for me. Definitely for a long time. I mean, when I discovered Bitcoin back in 2011, and I was still in high school, it was this kind of interesting confluence of ideas that I was already pretty attracted to. So of open source culture, that was something that a good friend from high school Christopher ole had already and indoctrinated me with really well, the, the math mathematical and cryptographic aspects. Also, libertarianism and Austrian economics was kind of the Zeitgeist of the Bitcoin space at the day and those were of ideas that I definitely found philosophically quite attractive at that time. And, you know, I was definitely curious and yeah, read a bunch of books. So yeah. And read the Austrian economics Kanaan because that's what the Bitcoin people were talking about all day. Yeah, read some kind of behavioral economics literature really kinda men and chi Dini and all of those people that just because I knew that I had to read other stuff for balance. And, and also economics itself is a kind in pretty mathematical and if subject Well, kind of right it's it's on the borderline because it's kind of both mathematical and you got your curves and your derivatives and your intersections but also humanities, right, it's really at this intersection of like both figuring out how to apply these models to a specific cases and also trying to figure out well, which models are really correct in the first place. And like the first question you can't answer with math, but the second question, you really can't and you need other kinds of thinking as well."
Interviewer,"Well, this is An area of my own interest because the way I see it, economics is odd in a way that very few people, I think have appreciated in that. If we take what could be argued to be our two greatest ideas in scientific, scientific man, let's say, one would be sort of the geometric dynamics of physics and economics has been constructed to be an as if physics, if you will, and on the other hand, and inherits from the theory of selection, you could say that markets are the continuation of systems of selective pressures by other means. And so what happens when our two greatest ideas touch each other, and they do it in a place which has very bizarre properties, by my way of thinking that is that economists are on the one hand, very rigorous thinkers and are also very susceptible to what we might call political economy, and distorted thinking. Does that ring true to you?"
Vitalik,"Yeah. Definitely, and there's definitely this combination of the four. On the one hand, you have these mathematical formulas. And on the other hand, these assumptions, and often the assumptions can be pretty, pretty well hidden, and they're kind of difficult to see at first glance, right. And it really can be subtle, right? So like one of the arguments that economists tend to put forward is basically like mutually beneficial transactions are a bet are beneficial. And so like, we should not interfere with them, right? Like if I have a client bottle and I want to sell you the client bottle, you're willing to pay $5 then I clearly value it at less than $5 evaluated more than $5 therefore the transactions on net good and like I, therefore I should give you the bottle and you should give me the money and that's what we would do, but At the, the reasons why that 10 sometimes breaks down like are, in many ways more subtle, right? Like, first you have monopoly issues like, if I'm the only person selling Klein bottles, then I might want to sell them at a higher priced and you'd be willing to accept because I want to extract more value. And sometimes the things that matter most to society aren't things that we can transfer between people from one person to another, like Klein bottles, but like public goods, and like the biggest public good of all, is that is the idea, right? And an idea? Well, if I have an idea, and I give you the idea, I still have the idea. So it's something that once you release it, it's out there and there isn't this kind of property that Oh, no. Should we."
Interviewer,"pause just briefly to talk about what a public good is? Yeah. So public good is technically defined within economics. Many people have an intuitive idea. Something which is you're stating has this property of inexhaustible. Yeah. And then the other attribute would be excludability, which is."
Vitalik,"non excludability for sorry, not."
Interviewer,"non excludability, sorry, the attribute of excludability and is used to define a public good. So, if something is inexhaustible and excludable, then it has this weird property that even hardline economists would agree that the market may fail to price, in fact, will fail to price the value to society of that object. So there is an admission within economics that there are zones of failure."
Vitalik,"Right? Well, I guess the kind of the big kind of rethinking that needs to happen is that like there is a long been this kind of site guys to that private goods like things that I have, and if I give it to you, I don't have it. And you have it on than normal and public goods are a rare exception. But like really public goods are pretty darn important. Right? Like if we didn't have public goods, then we'd be trading sticks and be and bare pellets and we'd basically still be caveman. Like they're basically the army would be."
Interviewer,public.
Vitalik,"Yeah. Yeah. In army well, armies are interesting because they're kind of to us, like in a medium scale context or a public good and in the large scale context or a public bad because if everyone's armies were forced to be cut down by a factor of 10, like we'd all be better off. So economics is like really subtle that way, especially once you have kind of two layers of scale at play."
Interviewer,"Sure. Now, one thing that I worry a lot about that almost nobody seems to join me in, is that in our mutual world, I don't know what to call it. of people who are experimenting with what I would say the mainstream would consider far out ideas like radical life extension credit currencies is a, you know, potentially being rival risks with sovereign currencies. But in our world, we talk a lot about the abundance economy in a world of abundance. And I'm terrified of a world of abundance because one of the properties that software has had is that it has replaced physical goods and services, which have these attributes. They're not public with small files, and when a small file is not encrypted, it has the attributes of a public good and therefore value and price can can chasm. That's terrifying, because then this weird thing of markets which allows us respite from dictatorship and somebody's directing our activities, and allows us to self direct goes away, because things can't be priced accurately. Are you Do you have any does that have any purchase on your Thinking."
Vitalik,"Yeah, so and I think give definitely you kind of strike at a very important points, though, I think, and if my own framing of the points is slightly different. So I think like, first of all, start off by thing by realizing that kind of private property and things is not something that fell out of the sky. It's a social technology, right? It's that we have the of norms that basically say, Oh, you can't, we will create this kind of mapping from objects to people. And if an object has maps to you, then you're allowed to do basically whatever the hell you want with it, and other people cannot do anything with it without your permission. And if that concept did not exist, then physical objects would be public goods, right? Because like, if there's a Klein bottle over here, the Klein bottle would be there, but like, really, anyone could take it. And if you produce Klein bottles, then like you're not producing something for yourself. You're producing Something for pretty much the first person who comes along and grabs it. So property rights, right are this kind of social technology that helps make private good economies tractable. And we could consider making social technologies to make public good economies tractable, right, like the existence of public goods by itself is it's not good or bad. Like, arguably, it's even good because it means that people can cooperate with each other on such large scales. The bad thing is that we don't really have good tools for handling it. And specifically, we don't have good tools for handling yet that manage to simultaneous we avoid both not giving good results and like basically being centralized index editorial. And so this is where my interest in radical exchange comes in. So this was this movement that was started by Glenn while a couple of years ago when he wrote this a radical markets book And he advanced some of his proposals like Harberger taxes and quadratic voting were the ones that are kind of the most popular. And the, the core of idea behind the idea is basically as like, let's create structures of norms and incentives that try to have the best properties that we can get out of markets, but do do so without like, basically economically breaking in the way that we know existing property rights systems do a once you enter a world where 100 of everything that you build just inherently affects millions of people."
Interviewer,"Well, this is this is an interesting perspective. You, of course, are famous for implementing this aetherium protocol. But before we ever get to computer protocols, there are sort of legal and structural protocols that we impose upon ourselves in the form of government and markets that are subordinate to Government. And there's a weird way in which you may start a process by which you write down rules for how a society should function. But once those rules are written down, you may discover all sorts of unintended properties of that rule set. And there's a real question. Can we actually unhook ourselves from the killer app that is capitalism, or American democracy? And if we start to realize that that app is running out of control? Hmm, I guess."
Vitalik,"for myself as a social technologist, and I definitely don't think that we should be kind of overturning entire countries with the new mechanisms overnight. I think."
Interviewer,I wasn't insinuating.
Vitalik,"Oh, definitely. I think like, that's figuring out how to kind of solve like, Grant problems if humanity is a long term goal, but I mean short term goals are there is definite, there's little things that we can make better. Right? So I, and this is actually part of why I find cryptocurrency and blockchain is interesting because they are, in a lot of ways this ideal ground for economic experimentation of different types. Right? So like to give one concrete example and in. So one of the ideas that go on while and myself have come up with and are pushing forward is something called quadratic funding. And the way that quadratic funding works as roughly this, right, so you have a central kind of pool of funding. And you could imagine this coming from a government you could imagine this coming from wealthy donors, you could imagine it just being put together by some crypto economic protocol. It could come from anywhere. And then you allow people to like basically set up projects and you like people Say, I have a project here is something that I'm doing. And if you like this, then you can donate to me. And you let people donate their projects. And then the core of the mechanism is basically that if there is a projects that multiple people donate to, so there's some project you donate to it, and someone else donates to what as well, then your donation doesn't just benefit benefit you, it also benefits the other person and the other person's donation doesn't just benefit them, it also benefits you. And so to kind of counteract that, and of market failure, the mechanism basically says, well, we're going to multiply the effect of your donation by two ads multiply the effect of the other person's donation by two. And so now, both of your incentives are kind of aligned with the whole and you extend this mechanism. So instead of supporting two people, it supports an arbitrary number of people. And you kind of calculate these subsidies across all possible pairs of people. And what you get is this formula that basically says you'll When people donate to different projects, you'll look at how many people donated and how much money have donated. And based on this from the central pool of funding, you give this extra subsidy. And so it basically is like a market for public goods. Right? And in the Ethereum ecosystem, there's something called that get coin grants, where we've basically started like trying to use this mechanism to fund public goods inside the aetherium ecosystem, right? So this could be implementations of the etherion protocol. It could be scaling solutions. It could be wallets, it could be educational resources. And we've had a sniff test around recently with about $200,000 in this central matching pool. And it recently finished and you can go to bitcoin.co slash grants to see the results. And then we got contributions from hundreds of people and the results that gave were actually pretty reasonable."
Interviewer,"So and test. Yeah, and so."
Vitalik,I think Ethereum could have a lot of Value us and just being a test net bed for an decentralized governance and decentralized public good funding infrastructure of this kind?
Interviewer,"Well, I think that that's fascinating. I guess one of the ways in which I would understand that is, you know, when my wife was an economist, and I talk about this stuff, we often talk about a market democracy has these two voting systems, one is $1, one vote, and the other is one person, one vote theoretically, anyway, even if that's honored only in the."
Vitalik,"free eye, and like, liberal democracy does this horrible thing of like treating these as opposite poles where something is either one or the other? And they're and they're often fighting each other when really everything's a spectrum."
Interviewer,"And I like that a lot. I mean, another thing that we've been discussing recently, and this again is sort of drink with with pm Kalani is thinking about the Chicago approximation, where you've got some reality that's incredibly nonlinear and complicated, and then weirdly in a one of these Famous instances where the map is not the territory. You take this incredibly simplified world where agents have this properties you can't even believe you would ascribe to a human being where you call it homo economicus, and it's perfectly rational. And it has all of these characteristics, like an automaton that only makes rational decisions. And then you impose that, like through law and economics programs, and suddenly you've distorted your society by taking the map as the territory so seriously, that you don't realize that you're destroying something in distorting. Yeah."
Vitalik,"No, that's definitely the like, it's a it's one approximation. And, I mean, we're never going to have approximations that are perfect, because the world is just so glad to hear that. Yeah. And the world is just so complicated and so even rapidly changing in the 21st century. Like a proxy in all approximations are bullshit, but like you have to find a couple of good ones that work reasonably well and make progress for us."
Interviewer,"And I think that one of the things that's unfairly done to cryptocurrencies is that we expect them to solve all of the problems that already cropped up. Yes, in our forms of governance in our forms of currency and exchanging court systems. And that what we should be asking of them is to be improvements or to augment already existing systems. Now, one of the odd things about governance is we could view you as in some sense starting a rival virtual country that has a legal system because the aetherium I don't know what to call it network platform protocol."
Vitalik,"Yeah, it rolls coins and it has the right to reassign those coins."
Interviewer,"And not only that, but it has a stand in for the legal system in the form of what are called smart contracts. Normally a we have this concept in governance, I guess it goes back to vapor that a government is supposed to be a monopoly on violence, which is an odd definition that you recover the concept of government from monopolizing violence and then you use sort of unearth and unpack all of the features of government from that one generating function. In some sense a cryptocurrency and smart contracts derive from math rather than violence."
Vitalik,derived from math and social consensus rate.
Interviewer,I love the fact that I was gonna get to that but I know.
Vitalik,"because this is important, right? Because like, for example, you know, you have the Bitcoin blockchain. And then you have the Litecoin blockchain, which operates under almost exactly the set at the same set of rules as the Bitcoin blockchain. And yet, the Bitcoin blockchain has 100 million dollar market cap and the light coin blockchain has a $3 billion market cap or something like that and much less you So, like blockchains are definitely not just math and technology, methods technology are the substrate in maybe in the same way that the military is like the substrate of keeping a country together, but."
Interviewer,they're including police force.
Vitalik,"exactly, but like they're the substrate but they're not the country, right the country is the community."
Interviewer,"Well, and this goes to what I would love to get into you with love to get into with you, which is the way in which different utopian dreams collide in the space of cryptocurrencies. So, for example, there are some dreams that may sound more like what I assume you may be active in the effective altruism community. Is that a possibility? Yeah. Which tries to figure out how to do the most good to do good efficiently rather than sanctimoniously. There are other people who have this idea of I just want retreat from other human beings and I want to be left alone I don't want to be taxed I don't want to be told what to do very strong libertarian perspective sometimes those people are the same people."
Vitalik,"there's two kinds of libertarians there's well there's many ways to split the Aryans the two kinds but one like there's the Leave me alone type and then there's the kind of conquer the world type right the kind that kind of relishes exceeding fiat currency is be destroyed and replaced by Bitcoin and it's kind of you know, creating 1000 year kind of reign of sound money that soon I mean, I generally have this kind of instincts that like when someone says that like we should impose a lot of short term disruption and harm on the entire world for the sake of some nebulous a long term game. That's something to be skeptical of. But so I'm gonna."
Interviewer,line the word skeptical. Hmm. You're using an extreme form of understatement.
Vitalik,"Yeah, yeah. And like, I guess So I'm I'm definitely not in the camp that had to actively relishes like fiat currency is being destroyed. But I mean, there's and I definitely don't think that all bitcoiners do like there is some that do see it as an of a something that's supposed to coexist and something that's supposed to provide a check and balance against the government's monopoly on issuing money without replacing it entirely. So you know, there are there's definitely different visions within individual communities, there's different visions between different communities. And then there's, it's not just visions about what cryptocurrency should do to the world, it's also a divisions about like, what how cryptocurrencies should work internally and what they should do to each other. So like, not in that sense, I guess, like, cryptocurrencies are interesting in in blockchains, not just because of like what they can do to the world but also just as this a microcosm of the world all unto themselves. I mean, like we talked about countries, virtual countries, but you know, there, there's many virtual countries. Now there's over 1400 on coin market cap, and they have some analog of God, do."
Interviewer,you think of them as virtual countries?
Vitalik,"It's all models are bullshit, but some are useful."
Interviewer,"But to the extent that a country is a sensible thing to label, yeah, yeah. So, in that world where we're dealing with often very radical individualism, and a very strong sense that there is something wrong with the coercive aspect of a government. Do you worry that something that you have given birth to, may start to behave in very different ways ways than you would ever want."
Vitalik,"Definitely. I mean, probably the closest that we've seen to things like this happening already would be the the initial coin offering and boom in 2017 and 2018. And like basically what happened there was that people saw that cryptocurrency is are something that could potentially hit a very high value and so people started saying, oh, like, I'm raising money like anyone come in, I give me $50 million. And I'm gonna build a cryptocurrency and I'm gonna make it great and I'll turn your $50 million in 250 billion, guaranteed, and this and it's complicated, right? Because I mean, on the one hand, like the possibility of kind of raising money and using it to fund cryptocurrency developments like it's, it did a lot of good right began like in general, like the open source community. It's like And it kind of acutely suffers from this kind of public goods challenge that we talked about because the an open source software is a very public good. And we saw some very public kind of splats involving open source software being under maintains like the CloudFlare and have issues a couple years back when it turned out that's an open SSL library was like really, really under maintained despite billions of dollars of value depending on it. And with cryptocurrency, suddenly you can make things that are completely open source that through coins do have a funding mechanism. And like, you know, this has massively, massively accelerated the developments of many kinds of cryptography, zero knowledge proofs and peer to peer networking, a lot of other things. But at this, on the other hand, like it's also given rise to this kind of speculation, and in many cases, the projects turned out to be outright fraudulent, right."
Interviewer,"but it's a really delicious and weird situation. I haven't asked you about it yet, but you're right. Presumably your net worth crashed a great deal. We got run up and then came. Came back. Did you know and were you happy in any way about that?"
Vitalik,"Yeah. So when the right at the top of the big bubble like in December 2017 when Bitcoin was hitting 20,000 eath was hitting 1400 I made this tweet and a series of tweets and that sort of became somewhat famous on Myspace where I basically said, the cryptocurrency space has reached half a trillion dollars does does it deserve it? Like do the things that it's actually accomplished? Like hold a candle to the promises that the market is ascribing to it? You know, I mean, the subtext of my answer is not yet and that was proven very right fairly quickly."
Interviewer,"to Didn't short it, did you?"
Vitalik,"So the I did can get and get the aetherium Foundation to sell about 70,000 eath like basically at the top, and that's doubled our runway now. So it was one good decision that had that had a lot of impacts. But it did not short."
Interviewer,"I should say that I was weirdly somewhat relieved as well I viewed that the innovation of decentralized transactions. And then, you know, it's hard for me to say because I actually am convinced that the blockchain should be an intermediate state and should not be the permanent version of decentralized computing. Okay. But I thought that that was such an amazing innovation that you could have a locally enforced mechanism Without a centralized authority, but with a global ledger unfun, which, which I see is a point of intellectual failure, that, in some sense, you're mirroring the transactions of the physical world. So for example, for those listening at home, we don't have a visual here, metallic, has several glass bottles next to him, where he could give one to me, which you shouldn't do right now. But the idea would be that it would no longer be in his space, and it would be in mine. And that property of atoms has been somewhat mirrored in Bitcoin and blockchain and aetherium transactions."
Vitalik,"And this is like, the concept of like money as a thing, right? The scarcity of the 21 million limits. If I give you five coins, I have five less than you have five more."
Interviewer,right and so the idea is that it's a What you're doing is you're porting conservation laws into from the physical layer into the logical layer.
Vitalik,"Right? And yeah, and this then if to some extent kind of reflects the kind of very deeply kind of Austrian economic libertarian origins of the the space way back back in the end of 2009 to 2013 days in creating like digital gold was pretty much the AMA digital payment system was the first use case. But I definitely think that, like we can and should be thinking about point systems that work in ways other than money."
Interviewer,"Well, I agree with that. And I also think that it isn't digital gold because as the saying goes, you know, gold or money has no stench, and that the blockchain is this bizarre difference with the physical world in that it is a distributed ledger that may be somewhat anonymous, but still gives The history like if I hand you $1, and you don't have access to any particular means of analyzing whose DNA is on that dollar, you have no idea where it's been. And these that is not that is violated by the current blockchain type implementations. Yes. So it isn't a complete port of the physical world in digital, but it is a an astounding one. And I guess I get very frustrated with the economics questions like, well, what's good, what's good for where's the killer app? I mean, we have all of whatever's left of human civilization to figure out what this thing is meant to do. Yeah. And I'm not very worried that we're not going to figure it out. I mean, we're going to figure it out sooner or later because a conservation law in digital space is just too valuable. They're wrong. Are you worried at all about the search for like, I just hate this question. Where's that? Where's the killer app? And I'm thinking, chill out, man. This is an astounding intellectual achievement. Is that wrong?"
Vitalik,"Yeah, and I think there's definitely a Yeah, and have a long time to go. And I think in the apps will come and there's the ones that are coming right now are basically going to have financial but I think, I mean, that's kind of true, just in part because the finance the existing financial system is just like so ready and waiting there to be disrupted. That in the long term, like there's, there's a disruptive and."
Interviewer,polite term for destroy.
Vitalik,"Yeah. So Team 12. Right. So one thing that I kind of only realized recently that I found interesting is that there like there aren't kind of two tribes here. There's three tribes, right. And what I mean by this is that there's the tribe that says markets are are great, and there's A tribe that says markets are bad and like we shouldn't move to more things that look like political mechanisms. But then if you look at kind of the the Zeitgeist that's kind of fairly popular in the cryptocurrency space, I mean, definitely even still now to a big extent, it's that markets are great. But the thing that existed and exists like isn't markets. And so I guess like there's people who are pro market and who see kind of the existing financial system as being that, and there's people who are pro market and receive the existing financial system as being like yet another one of the perversions of that that needs to be overcome."
Interviewer,"Well, it's odd because I would love to fix our democracy. I'd love to fix our markets. But I'm, I have to say I believe that I have grown up in a approximately 50 year bubble which the silent generation and then the boomers presided over And my own read is that because of their inability to figure out sufficient innovation to take over from the previously innovative system, that the world of human expertise has been almost completely contaminated by special pleading and political economy, so that many of us who don't have a particularly Austrian or libertarian bent are just sick to death of being lied to by people claimed to be Nobel laureates in economics. Yeah. Dude is Yeah. 70 emotional connection to you."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no, there's definitely things that are that have changed in us and a system that's just not keeping up and doesn't and doesn't understand that there is such a thing as keeping up. It's like, hmm, so, like, one like that. Even Glenn talks about this, right. Like, he talks about kind of the mark markets as social technology mentality versus the, like, basically, End of History mentality, and I guess, like, the way that they can, and I definitely saw this kind of, is, I guess, 10 years ago that said, kind of even more broadly than, like markets versus other mechanisms. It's like, things are 80% efficient and lots of work to make them 95% efficient. Whereas the, the thing that's really going on So things are 3% efficient, and we should work hard on making them 6% efficient. Like if you kind of move away from the narrow context of like I'm, I have something to sell when you have something to buy, which is pretty well optimized already, then there's lots of these and a very big things that are happening that have just completely been missed and in technology and then of network effects in all, and just generally kind of migrating from atoms to bits are definitely all a big part of it."
Interviewer,"So let's talk about something that's a little bit funny, which is if you're starting to replace government, as we were talking about it, and you see it as a monopoly on violence, you notice that very often there there's a very funny role played by organized crime. Now, of course, when we think about organized crime, we tend to get emotionally excited by it for whatever reason, we make lots of movies about it. It occupies the mind is something terrifying and alluring. And there's sort of two weird aspects to organized crime, one of which is violence as a contract enforcement mechanism. In other words, you're you're gambling, so you don't have access to the regular court system. Now you have a gambling debt. And so just the way our government would put you in jail, if you, you know, started doing things, you couldn't fulfill all of your obligations, and you were doing harm to lots of people, you couldn't be stopped. Organized crime has to do something can't maintain jails. So it can put the hurt on somebody for means of contract enforcement. So it's, it's not looking to do violent things. It's looking to run illegal businesses for which there's demand. Yeah, and then it has a problem of enforcement. Then there's another part of it which is violence is the product. So for example, extortion. The shame if anything were to happen to this lovely business that you're running? is a veiled threat pay us or we're going to do harm to your business or, you know, contract killings in the like, Yeah. Are you worried that effectively by introducing parallel structures, both in the form of currency and in the form of contracts, smart contracts that are the cynic one on I guess, of the difference between Bitcoin and aetherium, right that the killer app that is most likely to happen while the technology is still clunky and cumbersome and difficult, is in the parallels space that either you are going to replace organized crime as a place to do contractual business outside of the normal scope, which could be a benefit because organized crime still exists and is a bad thing because it uses violence and you would use Math and in place of it, or that it could actually be used to facilitate violence by, you know, using, let's say prediction markets or something else, to induce people to commit crimes where the committer the committer of violence has unusual information about where the violence will be committed and therefore can profit from it."
Vitalik,"It's definitely a worry that have ion lots of people in the crypto space I've had since the beginning, though. I do feel like at least so far, I've been surprised like, it feels like less of it has happened than we had expected."
Interviewer,the thing. Yeah. Now what do you what accounts for the idea that something that can be drempt has mostly not occurred?
Vitalik,This I definitely have a.
Interviewer,maybe it's a great thing about humans that we didn't realize that we're not nearly the horrible people we thought.
Vitalik,"and I definitely have a couple theories about this. So one of those theories is that like, basically, a lot, a lot of things that people do, and especially a lot of things that people do in the InfoSphere, because like public goods are kind of chronically underfunded, and all that rely really heavily on goodwill. And so, you know, you have goodwill that if someone if you pay someone to write some piece of piece of software for your website, it's not gonna include some blogs code. Yeah, some bug that will steal people's money or tell the FBI where you are that you if you create a system for enforcing agreements that they'll actually get enforced then, even like on internet, internet forums, they depend on I know of a lot of volunteer labor for just things like moderation. And if you create a group that just goes, like, fundamentally against like the vast majority of people's values, Then it's just going to be hard to find volunteer effort for that sort of thing. And like this. So that's probably the big the big reason I think why so far we don't really see a kind of, you know, complicated decentralized structure is being created to facilitate like, black black markets for killing people and so forth. Because let's."
Interviewer,"start out with something more mundane like a numbers racket, right? So a numbers racket would probably be a much simpler application."
Vitalik,So what do you mean by numbers racket here?
Interviewer,"Well, something that takes the place of a lottery where some, let's say some naturally occurring number that would be printed in a newspaper, and presumably, nobody has the influence over what number gets printed. Right, constitutes the lotto draw."
Vitalik,"lotteries have existed on blockchain since the beginning. Yeah, okay. Even. There's definitely been this kind of self community of people that created these things. Kind of provably fair Ponzi contracts where they have a smart contracts and you can throw money in and as soon if you're the person to throw money in as soon as soon as to when people throw money and you get, like 1.9 back or something like that, and this was just a fun game that people have made and like participated didn't even fully knowing what the economics of the thing are. So, yeah, and thing, things like that. It definitely happened, though. I don't like, though, in gambling is the sort of thing that like, there isn't like, there isn't this kind of nine, like 99% plus consensus that it's really horrible and evil, right? Because, like, on the one hand, like lots of people want to ban it, but on the other hand, people do it. Yeah. And it's something that people see negative consequences of but at the same time, it's something good is something that people participate in and enjoy whereas the None of extremely bad stuff like that's there's definitely this kind of this kind of barrier between kind of things that are edgy versus things that are just so far over the edge and for things that are kind of so so far over the edge like it is even with smart contracts and even with all those things, it's still hard to coordinate those structures. And I think like the blockchain, like the block chains, inability to directly read facts about the real world could even be a saving grace here. Because like because of blockchain can't directly read whether or not something in the real world happens. It basically means that if you want to have some application, whether a prediction market or something else that does, like so, can we."
Interviewer,"say a little bit more about the proof of the intellectual problem that you're, you're touching. So the idea is that there may be something that's very perceptible to us about the real world but We might naively think, well, the computer should be able to tell whether that happened. Right? or it didn't happen, and that that's a surprisingly difficult thing to code up reliably. So that the interface between the world of bits and bytes in the world of otherwise physical reality, which often we don't realize we're thinking about subjectively, that it's hard to maintain that interface. So that the way in which the things that have happened in the real world can be definitely agreed upon without us any kind of adjudication inside of the digital, right. Yeah. So I don't know how to say that. Well, blockchains are."
Vitalik,"in a fundamentally programmatic medium, all they see is like data that gets fed into them and what they can compute as a result of that data. And so if you wants to create a smart contract that says if someone figures out how to What the prime factors of a big number are pay them a reward, you can do that because prime non prime factors are something that you can multiply together and verify. But if you want to have a smart contract that says, if there's a hurricane in Sri Lanka, then pay 500 bucks then, like you can't do that on the blockchain itself, because like computer code has no idea what hurricanes are, it has no idea what Sri Lanka is."
Interviewer,"Nobody knows. But in that case, you could have a designation that you know that the national correct you can."
Vitalik,"you can get data from third party sources. And this is the thing that turns it into data. Exactly. This is the thing that a lot of applications are doing. But the thing that's important to keep in mind is that as soon as you do that, like your smart contract is no longer fully trustless."
Interviewer,"Right, right. So there's this concept, which is like a utopian Khan's concept of a trustless legal system, so that you don't have the messiness of humans anywhere in the system. And you can have complete faith and confidence in the contract that you've struck."
Vitalik,"Yeah, right. And like outside of proof, like basically giving bounties for solving math problems, like it's not something that you can 100% achieve."
Interviewer,"So I can't necessarily ensure my vacation that if, if I go all the way to Argentina and the weather is terrible, it pays out because we can't agree what terrible weather is, right? Like you."
Vitalik,"can create structures bit made out of individual participants that can try to align incentives to get people to kind of give to give correct results. So you can have complicated and have contraptions involving people giving different answers and policing each other and rewarding people who give the same answer that other people have committed to and things like this, but like you can only try to approach the, like, the ideal of kind of correct truth like you can never 100% Richard."
Interviewer,now you started aetherium in 2014 2015.
Vitalik,"Started started end of 2013. I mean, it launched in 2015."
Interviewer,Okay. Would you say let's use launch date as an artificial sure date? Would you say you are more or less excited emotionally? Hmm. Then you were when it started. You've now been through. you've logged some miles here. Hmm. I.
Vitalik,"definitely, definitely an excited."
Interviewer,We're excited.
Vitalik,"I think the main difference is kind of more definitely a kind of excited in the sense of like four years. Well, definitely, like, kind of as opposed to indefinite, but like, four years, yeah, four years ago was about like, hey, let's make this platform to kind of try a really a bunch of really cool things. We have no idea what's going to happen and like Just stick it out there. And now like, we know things about things that people are already doing, we know things about things that people wants to do. And we and we also know more about what the limitations are. And so instead of just being this kind of extremely fuzzy dream of like, let's stick smart contracts and algorithms and kind of trust or justify everything, right? It's something that's kind of both more moderate, but also kind of more like seeming much more like it I like it actually has a big chance of kind of transforming the world kind of precisely because that's when moderated to some extent."
Interviewer,"So you more if I gave you a false three choices, and by the way, smart people always hate these things. So feel free to break the model. If I gave you a choice between saying, Are you mostly excited about the technology and the amount of innovation are you mostly excited about? About the business opportunities for yourself. Are you mostly excited about the way in which this could transform human life? Would you be that? Would that be an easy call? Or would you say I reject that decision tree? Some mix of the first and the third?"
Vitalik,"I don't know. I guess like, the framing of business opportunities is definitely kind of never like, this is weird. I mean, despite of even."
Interviewer,I get the sense that you don't love money enough.
Vitalik,"Yeah, this is true. Okay. Hmm. I mean, it's weird, because for a long time, you."
Interviewer,have a lot of it.
Vitalik,"Yeah, well, I have a lot of it. And it's also even weirder because I like for a long time I subscribed so this kind of branch of economics that basically says that like love of money is like the best motivation for Bebo for people to."
Interviewer,have and I'm Randy and I'm.
Vitalik,"well in, I'd say. Me in that area."
Interviewer,"Yeah. But I don't get that. I'll be honest, I don't I just don't get that vibe."
Vitalik,"right? I mean, there's, I've definitely kind of shifted a lot over the years. I think my experience even within the crypto space itself has kind of turned and given me a lot of new information to work with. Like this. Basically in then this goes back to this kind of cryptocurrency is as a microcosm of wider society of thing, right? Like, if you're like, basically any like any movements regardless of what what the movement is for what its goals are to be succeeded needs to be sufficiently big. And once something is sufficiently big, it needs to have internal structure to coordinate and achieve its objectives, which means that it suffers from governance issues, it suffers from public goods The issue is, it suffers from conflicts with adjacent movement. sed suffers from conflicts between its own values and its and its own desire to succeed, and so on and so forth. And like it needs to come up with ways to answer like, basically almost the same kinds of hard problems that the world as a whole is working on. Well."
Interviewer,"you know, it's interesting. When I look at this sort of World of people maybe had an epicenter in the Bay Area, though I think it's less true now. We're trying to figure out what is the future and how do we get there? There's a very clear sense that people's creativity and their intelligence is correlated with their financial success, but it's not very tight. And so there's like an embarrassment that, well, that person is super amazing and then not doing all that well. This person, somehow metabolizing tremendous amount."
Vitalik,"This is something that I've definitely got to realize just from one of my travels, like I've interacted with a lot of kind of super famous people in different kinds of positions, which includes like some world leaders and includes some kind of leaders of like fields in cryptography. And it in you realize that, like, people in these positions, they are impressive, but they're not like super amazing godlike, impressive, right. Some of them are, some of them are but then there's also super amazing God like impressive people that just like don't get to get that much recognition at all."
Interviewer,"What I'm trying to get at is that I think about, like, if you're hanging around with musicians, very often, you'll have somebody who's a super famous musicians and you won't know who's really good. And they'll tell you something you've never heard of you say, well."
Vitalik,"this musician, exactly this Yes."
Interviewer,"Right. And so, you know, if I, if I gave the name of people who are famous for being let's say, physicists, they're very often the people on television As physicists, but they would all point to some guy who doesn't give a lot of interviews and say, well, that's the top guy exactly."
Vitalik,"like basically the social status like, is predicted by competence multiplied by, like, basically publicity skill. And that's half correlated with competence for obvious reasons, right? Like those people also know the people that have the real competence. And."
Interviewer,"that's one of the things that I've always found really interesting about people who have this diehard belief that markets produce justice, which is, I do think that success in markets is somewhat correlated, or has been with things like productivity, but it's also correlated sometimes with how predatory somebody can be or you know, how lucky they happen to be at a particular moment. And one of the questions that I have is if you're really interested in innovation, which is what I do sort of pick up is one of the main things. How does something like aetherium give us a possibility to revitalize innovation after what many of us consider a period of relative stagnancy outside of the areas of computation communication, which everybody knows have exploded. Huh? Do you think about how Ethereum can mediate a new Renaissance, a new generative age? You talk about it a little bit."
Vitalik,"Definitely. And I think there's enough aetherium as a platform for experiments in own governance and public goods funding is one thing I mentioned. And education is another thing that I kind of talk about and you and obviously we do I mean, I have a lot of these blog posts on vitalik.ca and other forums and like this Arrow, one of the big challenges that for example is that like for in an internet educational resources in general, there's basically two kinds, right? There's like papers and Wikipedia and like basically things that are technically accurate, but they're just like horribly not understood and understandable at all. And we should not be forcing people to even try reading them. And then there's Popeye literature which is very accessible, but it's often just actively wrong and really horrible ways. And like I I personally, even before theory, I'm like I did Bitcoin magazine, for example, like I've always tried to find this kind of middle gap this way to explain, take concepts that are technical and then expand them to a broad, a broader audience so they are more accessible. And like this, to me has been important in part because like I view accessibility of information about the technology as a precondition for even the decentralization over the space. Like if the thing technically runs on 50,000 computers, but only 42 people know how it works, then your decentralization, indexes and 50,000. It's 42. And so."
Interviewer,it's a very nice point.
Vitalik,"Yeah. And so trying to kind of improve even like, even how we, in the theorem community and have work on innovation internally. But so those are kind of things that that happen in blockchains as NFL as a lab for trying out new things going to first for the blockchain space, and then potentially, potentially export it to other things. And then we can also look at kind of blockchains as something that can be used to improve and create better institutions. So like one of the theorem foundations, researchers have a lot zamfira he actually got into a theorem because he was looking at how to improve academic publishing. And, like he saw things like you know, the existing peer review mechanism And how they were just very flawed in a bunch of ways. And he thought that, like, Hey, here's potentially a platform that we could use to build something that does better. And like that's one of his core interests and why he's even continuing to work on the technology."
Interviewer,"You know, I hadn't understood how insiders, you'd peer review in an academic context until a finance Professor got drunk at a party and said, you know, that guy who's harassing you in your research and finance, you don't know why he's doing it. So well. Why do you think he's doing so I know, he says, We've created a system where our fees are sky high to consult. And we do this by making the number of professors in our fields small by controlling peer review. And so that effectively, we're conspiracy and restraint and like, this guy's just telling me straight out that this is a gating function to keep their consulting fees high. that this guy is going to do everything that they tell him to do. Because otherwise he can't come into the club and charge these rates. That."
Vitalik,sounds about right.
Interviewer,"Right. So that one of the app, another killer application. So you have one potential suite of applications, which have to do with facilitating illegality, some of that might regard result in net reduction of harm, because you could replace violence with math. Yes. On the other hand, a place where you could have a really positive effect is political economy where by removing the human ability to act badly, you effectively create a much fairer, more representative world exactly, you know, a, what do we do so you have an interest in the two fields that I find Wikipedia can't explain to any normal human being our theoretical math and physics. Even biology you can sort of guess what's going on because you have something concrete. But."
Vitalik,it's even biology. Like you gotta learn math to deeply grok it because otherwise you're just memorizing like names of chemicals.
Interviewer,"Well, but you might hear I have a PhD in math, if I try to read a math paper, one or two fields over from my own field, right? I will do less well with it than if I read a biology paper, even though I've taken a class in biology."
Vitalik,"That sounds right. Yeah. Yeah. Like there's a difference between the level of math that you have to know to just because it's important for you as a philosopher, and then and like, that's about the level of math that I think you need even to be good at biology to be good at economics to be good at a lot of things, right. It's understanding like principles, even things like for example, if you have a trade off between X and Y Right now you're optimizing entirely for x and it's a smooth curve, then if you want a little bit of y, then you can get your first bit of y at almost zero cost of x, right? And that's just a prop. Like it's a property of continuous functions that go from the maximum, the derivative starts at zero. And if you kind of just deeply kind of mentally grok, about like a couple hundred of these facts, while you're deeply kind of mentally grok, like how to walk then, like you get a lot, but then from there, there's also like the frontiers and often I mean, the frontiers are less important."
Interviewer,"Well, so here's a weird thing. I don't know how to bring up when I tried to understand crypto as a space. I'm always confronted by how incredibly Byzantine and impossible it is to understand all of the acronyms, all of the sub pieces of history. I mean, it's an incredibly fragmented experience in which I spent a long period of time just feeling moronic. Isn't it odd that like, if cerium itself suffers from this, this problem? It's hard to know what's going on?"
Vitalik,"Yeah, it's definitely something that we wants to fix. So I mean, if you ever have suggestions on like, what specifically, we can make more understandable, I'm always happy to hear those."
Interviewer,"Fantastic. Now, one thing that I think is really interesting is this episode that occurred in the aetherium space in which you were faced with a very serious question of leadership having to do with an emergency that you could have either allowed to follow the rules that had been previously specified in some sense, or could where you could interject a certain amount of human intervention, thereby letting people know that this was to some extent not mediated, only by rules and computers, can you? Can you say a little bit about this famous incident? And Sure."
Vitalik,"So in 2016, there was this smart contracts that a group called select get launched called the DA O. And D. O stands for decentralized autonomous organization. It's a term I came up with about three years before. And it basically means that you can have a smart contract this computer program that controls digital assets and in code, a set of rules for an organization. And like you can use this kind of smart contract basically as a replacement for things like companies. And so small kid decided to launch a Gao and their Gao was intended to be basically a decentralized VC fund, so people could apply. The Gao would vote on which projects were worth investing in."
Interviewer,"So leaderless rule based, yes. And virtual Exactly."
Vitalik,"knows the hit hit all the cipher punk notes in the in the right place, okay, and the thing lunch too and we were all expecting it during it's kind of initial fundraising phase which was also like an open public blockchain process and to maybe get $5 million but then he got five and he got 10 and I got 20 I got 50 and 100 and then the price of eath went up and I got 200 and then when I was sitting at a friend was."
Interviewer,it all alarming that it was so successful?
Vitalik,"it after the 50 mark, I definitely kind of switched from excitement to deep apprehension, but you know, it's a contracted you let on it."
Interviewer,that you were feeling that way.
Vitalik,"A bit. Okay. You know, so on June 17 2016, when I was in Shanghai at a friend's apartment and it was about 1530 something. In the afternoon, I saw a message in one of The Skype chats that I was that I was in, and someone basically saying, hey guys look at the Dow, it seems like there's some money coming out of it. And so I checked on the public block explorer on the blockchain. And I saw Oh, look that it seems like about $2 million eath has actually already been removed from the Dow and more eath incentive slowly being drained over time. And so I pinged the core developers and I asked, Hey, is this normal? And at first I was thinking, Okay, the alternative is unthinkable. There has to be a reasonable explanation for this. And."
Interviewer,so you were locked into some sort of denial.
Vitalik,"for the beginning. Yes. And the developers looked at it and over the next half hour, as more and more people came online and started chattering with each other, it became clear that the unthinkable has actually happened. And I actually burned about 20 of my own ether. Basically just dossing the Ethereum blockchain itself and just spamming it with transactions to try to kind of slow the attacker often is."
Interviewer,denial of service.
Vitalik,"Yeah, yeah, just spam. The blockchain was transact not."
Interviewer,all of my listeners will know the terms.
Vitalik,"okay, so that the attackers transactions could not get in as quickly because the attacker is transact, the attacker could only withdraw something like a couple hundred eath with every transaction. So it was a slow process, like in the hopes that the developers would find some way to play with."
Interviewer,"intentional inefficiency, or it was just that."
Vitalik,it was it was not intentional.
Interviewer,"So in some weird way, the inefficiency was a good."
Vitalik,"yes, it gets even weirder, there was an even bigger inefficiency. That was that would prove to be an even better thing. So but then the developers, however, did not find a way to plug the hole. But the attacker voluntarily stopped after stealing about 4 million eath from the Dell. But in any case, the this is the second inefficiency, right voluntarily."
Interviewer,"stopped. Yeah, there was a request made."
Vitalik,"no no as in the attacker just stopped. Okay. And so here's the second and bigger inefficiency, the money that was the attacker took out the 4 million eath. It did not go into the attackers wallet immediately. Instead it went into a child smart contract. And only after 35 days, could the attacker actually take that money out? And this was child smart contract, you mean a separate smart contract that that was created through a function call of the main do smart contract. Okay. So this was also not intended, right? It was just like a random quirk of fate that there was this big bug that was the biggest smart contract theft in history up until that point, and it put the money into this convenient box where it would just stay conveniently locked for 35 days, wherever one could stare and look at it."
Interviewer,A little Oh.
Vitalik,"yeah. And the Soon after this, there were calls happening between core developers and the proposal to remedy the situation with a blockchain fork came into play. Right. So basically what happened here is the there was a blockchain fork and emotional issue for this community. Yeah. So why is this so? Well, I guess first of all, what is it exactly? So explain what what would happen. So, in general, a blockchain fork is on normal process, right? You have an upgrade and the developers of aetherium clients implement code that basically says after block number 44370000. Stop processing blocks according to the old rules start processing blocks according to the new rules which have extra features attached. And."
Interviewer,blocks are just sent.
Vitalik,"packages of transactions. Yeah, okay, and Bs and so ever before this sub, I know these code patches are for Proposed, there is this month long period of many months long period of deliberation where changes are proposed people discuss them people talk about them. And generally it's agreed that these changes are good. And so people just go and download the code and because everyone's downloaded the code, the blockchain after block 4370000 followers, these difference in betters are."
Interviewer,"very warm and very human processes. Yeah, cold logic of a machine."
Vitalik,"Exactly. And so, the Dell fork, it was also a fork. It was also a code change implemented by the developers of the clients. That is him was pushed out through a new version of the different clients that people could download. And users went ahead and voluntarily downloaded. And it would basically change the rules of the blockchain, except instead of changing them permanently, it would only do a single one time change and the single one time Change basically said during block 11920000 before processing any transactions, take the ether that stuck in the this child contract and move it into another contract that could then basically refunds it all to the victims. And so this was a very kind of manual intervention, right? It basically says like, we all agree to run code that just irregularly takes us money and just reassigns it to this other thing. So."
Interviewer,"it's very weird because you know, we always think in like a sci fi movie that something that you think is human would rip off its mask and reveal itself to be a computer. And this is the reverse. pewter face is ripped off revealing humans behind this this technological stack?"
Vitalik,"Yes. And, I mean, ultimately, like people talk about head of blockchain immutability and like this is this idea. That basically you're not supposed to do this sort of thing. And."
Interviewer,where does that supposed to come from?
Vitalik,"Exactly. So like there is there's definitely a sense in which it exists technologically, because like actually pulling off one of these forks is incredibly hard. And for example, if it was not the case that the money was conveniently stuck there in one nice little address for 35 days, it would basically not have been possible to do it, right. Because when as soon as you announced this protocol change that says, we're going to take money out of here, put it on there, the attacker could just move the money from there to a different address and basically play this cat and mouse game and the attacker could win. But sometimes there is this possibility where you you absolutely can just like do these interventions and you can just decide to stop writing this code and start running this other code. And the only reason why this is not done more frequently, is basically because there exists these norms right in their existing norms in the blockchain community. Blood zamfira the researcher I mentioned before, kind of calls them a salvos ally, and like named after Nick Sabo, and an example actually dislikes the moniker salvos a lot, but like it is a pretty accurate representation of kind of his beliefs, which is and the beliefs of many in the crypto community, which is basically that, like, even though it technically is code run by humans, we should act as though it is code not run by humans. And like, because it is digital gold, right? Gold is not run by humans, gold is gold. And so if we want to make something that is like gold, then even though we're unfortunately stuck with this thing, run by humans, we should like try as hard as we can to pretend it's not. And like this was the ideology of a lot of people in this space. And the Dell fork very much went against this ideology. And so like, even though in my opinion, like having norms that you can't just like, go and edit whatever you want is valuable, but like when so much such a large fraction of the ecosystem. stuff is at stake. It's worth rethinking things. But like other people were, and if even more rigid in this regard. And so there was this kind of split in the community. And a portion of the community actually did not download the updates, right, a portion of the community did not download these code patches and implement the fork. And they just said, we will continue running our own our old chain. And the old chain has since then been called a theorem classic, and it runs to this day."
Interviewer,This is a fascinating Civil War.
Vitalik,"of it, and I got invited to it, but I haven't had the chance to go Yeah."
Interviewer,"So it's kind of a libertarian Waterworld in the Sacramento Delta. And what was interesting is that one year in order to come to the festival, you had to have a lecture and you had to agree that you would receive the lecture because of problems that had happened in the previous year. And you realize that these libertarians were being forced to invent governance, and rather than just anarchy, you had to have some organized system. And so one of my questions is, is that is that dream of escape from the heavy hand of government. Effectively, not something to be pursued inside of crypto space for the most part because we realize that it is going to require governance and that we can't figure out a way to turn this into a completely cold and methodical process."
Vitalik,"It depends on which version of the dream you subscribe to make the if the version of the dream you Subscribe to as the dream that says that we can finally use algorithms to like, basically completely eliminate humans ability to interfere in things than, like, if your goal is to see that enforced 100% then like, no, you're not going to get that. If your dream is that you dislike how governments have had existing governments and monopolies of violence have hegemony over this social function of coordination and enforcing structures of rules and you want there to exist an alternative, then, like that's something that we can talk about. Right. So, like, if the if the dream is to augments? Yes. And, I mean, I'd argue that the blockchains have a very necessary role now, especially a kind of given modern kind of political trends where there basically is no single traditional public body that's accepted as trustworthy by the entire world and it doesn't look like there's going to be one. But like if your dream is to, and if completely over overturn things and have like some simplistic notion of digital property rights as the only thing that governs behavior, then that's something that like, you can try for, but you're not going to succeed."
Interviewer,"Let me try something else with you that I'm curious about. You and I are both plugged into this weird alternate world that thinks very differently. And I had Andrew Yang, in that chair and you saw that episode of the VLOG before. Some people call this neuro divergence that this is a non neurotypical world. And I would say that both you and I exhibit some indicia of not thinking along standard lines. The thing that occurred to me is that you brought up slate star Codex, which is this website that is extremely influential in our shared world. And I was thinking about the difference between slate star Codex and CNN in terms of sense making. Is there any way in which the Ethereum world can create a counterweight so that the neurodivergent can rest the stranglehold that seemingly the neurotypical institutional world is going to have on sense making at scale? Like is there a way of promoting another blog in this world would be like less wrong? there particular thinkers that I think of as being very important, influential, I think you've given to Aubrey de Grey and later yudkowsky there's like this very different world that isn't well known. And in part I've used podcasting is like pirate radio, which is the phrase I keep, or some is that because you're rushing Yes. What can we do potentially using your technology to even the playing field between corporate sense making and this kind of Home Brewed sense making that seems to me to be of an infinitely superior level? Hmm, well, not infinitely but quite superior."
Vitalik,"Yeah. So I think like once again, there's kind of two aspects to kind of blockchain that I think are equally valuable here. One is the technology itself and then the other is the existing community around the technology and mean with the tech with the technology itself. I mean, you can try to like create institutions for you even things like funding like podcasts, for example. And then like even like things like the kind of get going grants quadratic voting, for example, it would be potentially a great way to kind of funds media organizations. avoids the pitfalls of both, say, present day media which is funded by some combination of advert of like advertising and like horrible clickbait incentives. And at the same time, avoid the pitfalls of like, basically sent essentially controlled media and then create a third alternative. So and like it doesn't even have to be quadratic voting, it could be some other kind of mechanism for funding and blockchains could be used as a base layer for that. There's also the blockchain community as a group of people who care about the many of these kinds of ideas and I mean even a lot of a theory and people are definitely and swayed star Codex adjacent. And I feel like I've tried my best to kind of bring these worlds together and get them to talk to each other. In lien, sometimes it is a challenge because there's ways in which they're similar and there's a lot of things People who are in both and there's also ways in which they're sometimes different. But those, those differences can be a good thing."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I guess I'm concerned that in our we're coming up on an election in the US. And I view fox news in the New York Times, and CNN is like watching professional wrestling. It's got a very clear narrative structure before the facts even come in."
Vitalik,"Yeah, this is this is actually one of the things I've only really started noticing, maybe in the last like, one to two years. Like it's narratives are something that like, don't seem like you're there when you're fully inside of them. But once you kind of step outside, and you start seeing that, like, wait, these people are missing something, and they're making predictions that turn out to be materially incorrect. Like, there's no memory like there's no cost and yeah, yeah, you You want to there's no accountability at all, then it's something that you just actively start thinking, seeking out how to move beyond. Yeah, you know, I think figuring out a better funding model for media organizations in general."
Interviewer,"Because in some ways, what I'm concerned about is that something like podcasting is almost a public good. And so."
Vitalik,totally a public good.
Interviewer,"But advertising is the one thing that I keep, I call it the business model of last resort. Yes. And we are going with an ad supported model, because I don't want to disguise we were somebody who offered to endow the podcast, not not my employer. And I decided against it because I think what I really want to do is to try to figure out how to improve the business model. We've talked about a couple different variations on on advertising in order To make sure that controversial but very sensible and level headed people can weather the storm that the big problem that I keep seeing is that advertisers pull when there's a coordinated campaign to say, drop that program or else Yes. And there's a need for something like the blockchain or a smart contract to make sure that you can't silence people who are speaking decently, just because they've pissed off a very large activist community. Right. So, do you see any way in which the blockchain for example, like I might give up advertising, if I could figure out a way to fund not only this program, but allied programs?"
Vitalik,"So in 2011, when I was starting Bitcoin magazine, I yeah. Well, it started off with like this one anonymous person whose name I'll never know who will aside from T by his internet handle Who was just paying me five Bitcoin, which back then was $4 per article to write articles for him. And I mean, this was five times lower than the minimum wage, but I loved it because it was the higher highest wage I've ever had. And eventually, despite paying me five times less than minimum wage, I Kiba ran out of money. And like he's told me, hey, maybe Bitcoin week, we will have to shut down. And I came up with, with this business model that actually ended up saving it for a few months, and basically saving it all the way until I got rid of poached by Bitcoin magazine. And the business model is basically, I write two articles a week, and we'll publish the first paragraph of each article, kind of publicly, and we'll say the rest of these articles is kind of hidden for ransom. And here are some Bitcoin addresses. And if people can collectively come together and pay 2.5 BTC to these Bitcoin addresses for everybody. Yes, then it's nice. Yeah, and it out. We worked well and it actually started raking in like much more money than Akiba had paid before. So it's not saying like that precise model is gonna save."
Interviewer,"It's a clever, it's a clever exploit. Yeah."
Vitalik,"exactly. And like to me, more clever experiments as like what smart contracts are all about. So like, let's try lots of different things. And we're gonna have come upon some steps forward that are interesting."
Interviewer,"to tell you. I'd love to have you come back and talk to us about other things that other points but let me just close by asking you a couple of questions about the mysterious origins of decentralized computing the blockchain and all of this stuff. Sure. What the hell? Why don't we know who Satoshi is at this point, where Satoshi seemingly came up with the first really viable version of this this idea. We can prove that Yeah, I guess those those blocks have never transacted that, that are under satoshis control one would think. Yeah, and that's a very mysterious origin story."
Vitalik,Yeah. It surprises a lot of people.
Interviewer,Does it surprise you?
Vitalik,"It does. I mean, it's like there's definitely not many people that have managed to stay anonymous kind of through that level of prominence. Like even like silk road does kind of first big round of crypto anarchist outlaw project on top of Bitcoin like after about two years Ross Albert's card. And then the tools for just continuing to look at things that you say until eventually you slip up and you use some word word patterns that match like word patterns that you used under your name, and then you correlate things like it's difficult to get around. Like I've."
Interviewer,"unabomber got away with this for a long time. The Yeah, you know, but the Citizens Committee to investigate the FBI that pulled off this amazing heist in 1971."
Vitalik,"So then Ted wrote his stuff in the 1970s. Right. And that's also 19. Seven, you know, saying, now we have, we have the internet and everyone's stuff is on a law as publicly available. We have machine learning, we have statistical tools."
Interviewer,Do you think it's well known who Satoshi is within a group that doesn't want to talk? No.
Vitalik,"So I am I think the I mean, there's high uncertainty about this, but I think that it's zero urea likely that they said she is one person."
Interviewer,you think he is one person.
Vitalik,"Yeah. And then there isn't some, like a theory grants conspiracy theory. I think you know, Satoshi."
Interviewer,"not that. You know, who Satoshi is."
Vitalik,But do you think I think it's someone I know personally Yeah. So If I had to pick one person and the and I'm not asking.
Interviewer,"you to out that, well, you can say."
Vitalik,"yeah, and I will say it. It's like, it's not an uncommon opinion. I know if I if I had to, like bet my life on one person who could help me, basically because and how was around in the early days, he clearly understood what was going on here. Clearly participated since the beginning. And he also died at the exact time basically, that's it, he disappeared. And so there's a lot of these kind of coincidences in his favor, but then he's the one person I bet on if I had to bet on someone, but I'd also bet against him like it's well under 50%. So it's a pretty good caper. Yeah. And there's, there's definitely a significant chance that it's like someone who's still in the in the crypto space somewhere that I've met at some point. Or it could just be someone we have never met and never will. Hmm he he's done a really Like a job, like, even just kind of setting himself up as this kind of perfect role or she are they? Yes, yes. No. Yeah, she is. She you really like, impressed a lot of people."
Interviewer,"It's pretty true. I find it very inspiring. One of the great intellectual feats of our time, would have anonymous authorship. And the only story I know that's comparable to that is this bizarre breaking story where the there was a woman I believe, named Judy fine gold, who was determined to take the secret to the grave, and the other people in the conspiracy, left the conspiracy after the statute of limitations had run out and they started talking and then her perspective, as we all agreed, we were never going to mention who did it. There's some desire usually, to get caught in an urge to purge."
Vitalik,"Yeah, well, that does Make it more likely there's one person right conspiracies get exponentially harder, the more people you add. That's true."
Interviewer,"It's been fantastic having you here, I want to let you know that you're welcome to come back and to talk about things that are unrelated to aetherium and blockchain and crypto, because I actually, I have to say I found very inspiring your attempt to use this platform to rethink what can economics be repurposed to do and I think that that's an unheralded potential killer app for your your program."
Vitalik,"Thank you. It's, it's, it's been good to be on here."
Interviewer,The following is a conversation with vitalik buterin his second time on the podcast vitalik.
Vitalik,Is the co-founder of ethereum and one of the most influential people in cryptocurrency.
Interviewer,And technology broadly defined quick mention of our sponsors athletic greens magic spoon indeed for.
Vitalik,Sigmatic and better help check them out in the description to support this podcast.
Interviewer,As a side note let me say that ethereum bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies have.
Vitalik,Been taking a wild ride of prices going up and down in the past few months to me.
Interviewer,The prices were never as important as the ideas both technical and philosophical.
Vitalik,Cryptocurrency has the potential to empower billions of people to participate in the global economy in.
Interviewer,A way that resists the manipulation by centralized power also.
Vitalik,With smart contracts layer 2 technologies data pools nfts and of course integration of artificial.
Interviewer,Intelligence into the whole thing we have the opportunity to build tools and worlds.
Vitalik,That transform physical and digital life as we know it hopefully minimizing the suffering in.
Interviewer,The world and maximizing the fun this is the lex friedman podcast and here is.
Vitalik,My conversation with vitalik buterin let's first talk about.
Interviewer,Shiba ino if we can also known as sheba token code shib for contact shiba unu was.
Vitalik,Created in august 2020 modeled off of doshcoin by the anonymous founder.
Interviewer,Known as ryoshi on may 10th this year it had a market capitalization of over 13 billion.
Vitalik,And uh maybe you can explain this but in a crazy move you were given half of shibs uh.
Interviewer,Total supply you uh burned aka destroyed 90 of it that's worth 6.7.
Vitalik,Billion dollars and you donated 10 that's worth 1.2 billion at the time to an uh india covet 19.
Interviewer,Relief fund saying you don't want to be the locus of this much power.
Vitalik,This is uh fascinating why and how were you able to walk away from this much money.
Interviewer,And this much power so i i should probably start by yeah giving some of the backstory around.
Vitalik,You know these coins and this concept of giving me coins uh so you know first of all you know.
Interviewer,Shiba inu as you said is this kind of knockoff of dogecoin right and deutsche coin was this.
Vitalik,Initial kind of fun coin that was created back i think around 2014 or so and it was just created by jackson.
Interviewer,Palmer and like put it out as a joke for a couple of hours and a community formed around it.
Vitalik,And at the beginning people didn't take it very seriously i actually remember putting about 25 000.
Interviewer,Into doge sometime around 2016 and i just remember uh just thinking to myself like okay how.
Vitalik,Am i going to explain my to my mom that i just invested 25 000 into dog coins.
Interviewer,And like what even are dog coins like the only interesting thing about this coin is that there's.
Vitalik,You know a logo of a dog somewhere um but you know of course that ended up being one of the best investments i've.
Interviewer,Ever made and it did really well and then at the end of 2020.
Vitalik,Elon musk of course you know started talking about dogecoin and the market cap just like shot up to.
Interviewer,About 50 billion dollars actually and it shot up multiple times right like the first time.
Vitalik,It went up from about 0.8 cents to about like seven cents and this just happened all in one day.
Interviewer,And i remember um this was when i was still in singapore in the middle of uh.
Vitalik,Kovid and you know i saw that the price just went up by a thousand percent and i was like oh my god my doge is.
Interviewer,Worth like a lot and so i immediately called up some of my friends and told them to like.
Vitalik,Drop everything in scramble and i just sold half the dosh and i got 4.3 million dollars donated the.
Interviewer,Proceeds to give directly and a few hours after i did this the price dropped back down from about seven.
Vitalik,Cents to four cents right so i managed to sell the doge at the top and i remember just uh.
Interviewer,Feeling like i was such an amazing trader but then of course you know the price went up from four.
Vitalik,Cents then to seven and then 50 and just like doge becoming this big phenomenon where there's even a lot of people that.
Interviewer,Have heard of those that have not heard of ethereum is just like something even i wasn't predicting right and so.
Vitalik,After that of course you know we have doge and then people are thinking well you know if the.
Interviewer,Leading dog token is worth 50 billion dollars then surely the second largest dog token deserves.
Vitalik,You know at least seven or eight billion right because i feel like that's the kind of.
Interviewer,What the mindset of these shiba people is um so that of course they did this other gimmick right where.
Vitalik,They gave me half the shiba token supply um they were actually not the first projects to do this uh so.
Interviewer,Around the end of 2020 there was this weird project called teller it's like t-e-l-l-o-r i think they're a.
Vitalik,Chain-link competitor or something like this but i remember they just like dumped.
Interviewer,Fifty thousand dollars worth of their token into my wallet and then they had their twitter arbi.
Vitalik,Just like basically run around saying look look at vitalik's wallet vitalik holds.
Interviewer,Towers he's one of us he's a supporter and as soon as i discovered this i just like.
Vitalik,Publicly sold the tower tokens on you to swap and this created a bit of a twitter splat.
Interviewer,Now the shiva people were more clever the shiva people instead of dumping to that wallet they dumped to my cold.
Vitalik,Wallet right so in a cryptocurrency right there's this concept of like cold.
Interviewer,Wallets and hot wallets basically like the thing that actually owns euro money is like this.
Vitalik,80 digit number called a private key right and a hot wallet is when that private key is just stored in memory on.
Interviewer,Your computer on your phone really easy to access cold wallet means it's either on written down on a piece of paper or.
Vitalik,It's uh on a computer that's just never accessed the internet right so cold is very.
Interviewer,Inconvenient but cold is also much more secure right because even if that computer has some.
Vitalik,Like viruses on it like it's it's like air gap that's not actually going to be able to upload it.
Interviewer,So this cold wallet and like all the money's out of the cold wallet so it's safe for me to talk about my setup now.
Vitalik,Right but it was a laptop that was sitting in canada and i also had.
Interviewer,Um two pieces of paper where i wrote down two numbers on those two pieces of paper one was with me one was in canada.
Vitalik,And if you add those two numbers together you get the private key so because of covid travel restrictions.
Interviewer,And you know this is in this cold wallets in canada like it's very difficult for me to.
Vitalik,Actually access it right and i'm not sure if they knew this maybe they just got lucky but basically they.
Interviewer,You know sent a lot of uh these dog tokens into this wallet where i it was very.
Vitalik,Difficult for me to access it but then i saw these dot co tokens i saw more and more people.
Interviewer,Talking about them and then at some point i realized i realized that like hey these things are.
Vitalik,Worth billions of dollars and like you know there's lots of really good things that you could do with that.
Interviewer,Amount of money and it would actually be a waste to just like see it go so i made the decision that like i would actually.
Vitalik,Power through and figure out how to like safely like basically get my private key.
Interviewer,Um i actually had to call up my family tell them to read out their number off of their piece of paper.
Vitalik,I uh entered that into a fresh laptop that i bought from target then i.
Interviewer,Put in my other number on my piece of paper added the two numbers together on the computer there's the key.
Vitalik,And at the same time like just scrambled for two days setting up a new wallet for to where i.
Interviewer,Could move my youth to safely like getting people to be multi-sig partners just like doing.
Vitalik,All sorts of like stuff that you know 10 years ago you would expect to just be part of a cyberpunk.
Interviewer,You know science fiction novel but you know now it's all real so you're doing this.
Vitalik,All by yourself i essentially most of it by myself so you have to keep it secret right and i.
Interviewer,Needed my family to um actually like go and read the the number on their piece of paper.
Vitalik,And then i am in my new multisig wallet like there's other people that are signatories um but.
Interviewer,You know i'm obviously not going to reveal any details beyond that about.
Vitalik,So i did this right and i actually managed to make get the private key make the first.
Interviewer,Transaction that would just move all my ether to the multisig wallet so it's safe.
Vitalik,And then second transact put the private key on my main computer then started you know like going in and just selling.
Interviewer,Some of the dark tokens and then just like giving them to these different charities now at the time i.
Vitalik,Actually did not even like have any idea of how much you would be able to get right.
Interviewer,Because like on paper the dog tokens are seven billion dollars but like in reality it's.
Vitalik,A very liquid market you know are you going to crash it by yeah and after you sell 1 million worth you're.
Interviewer,Going to crash it after 10 million are you might you actually be able to get like an entire.
Vitalik,200 million i had no idea um so i definitely was just of the mindset like okay i mean i'll sell a bit.
Interviewer,Maybe i get some eth and then you know donated some yeast to give well donated some to other groups and then.
Vitalik,Okay have some dog tokens like i don't have an easy ability to sell more myself but then i'll just.
Interviewer,Like give them to these groups and like you know hopefully they'll do good things with them.
Vitalik,Um it was actually um i actually donated at 20 and dumped 80 percent um yeah so the.
Interviewer,Cove the coved um india group got one batch and then there's.
Vitalik,Another group that got another batch and i don't want to say who they are because i think that.
Interviewer,They want to announce themselves at some point sure yeah but it's uh you know you you can see the fact that.
Vitalik,These transactions were made on the blockchain um but it was uh just.
Interviewer,Very intriguing interesting and unexpected and just an insanely crazy situation it's been a couple weeks.
Vitalik,First of all thank you for uh helping me uh hang up some curtains this is this is a first for the podcast and uh.
Interviewer,Shows uh that you're truly a special person um to be willing to help but now a couple.
Vitalik,Weeks later do you regret any aspect of that decision um i'm sure there are some things that i.
Interviewer,Probably could have done better like i i was actually i was actually talking to some of these charities and i was.
Vitalik,Impressed by just how much money they managed to get out of selling some of these coins.
Interviewer,So i i probably could have done better by just like talking more with the traders and.
Vitalik,Actually ensuring that you know that they can do a better job of maximizing the.
Interviewer,The value of uh of uh all of them but like you know it was a.
Vitalik,Very stressful time and i did have to act quickly like i yeah i did manage to you know make a lot of.
Interviewer,The donations before like a few a few days before the great crypto crash happened.
Vitalik,Uh so it was and it's difficult to like obviously there's parallel universes in which i did better.
Interviewer,But at the same time there's also lots of parallel universes where because i hesitated more.
Vitalik,And tried to spend more time thinking i missed the opportunity uh so you know on that it's like a luck of.
Interviewer,The draw and i'm just you know happy that uh it was everything was able to turn out as well.
Vitalik,As it did but psychologically you mentioned stress how hard was it uh it was stressful right i think well.
Interviewer,One of the really stressful parts was just the fact that i had to basically move all of my funds.
Vitalik,You know including the 325 000 ether from one cold wallet into another hot wallet or sorry into another.
Interviewer,Multi-sig wallet um and you know maybe the multisig wallet had a bug in it maybe.
Vitalik,There's like some mistake i'll make in the middle that causes the the funds to get lost like you know that's.
Interviewer,That part was stressful and i i was definitely stressing out for two days i'm you know triple checking the new.
Vitalik,Wallet i even did a bit of an audit of the code myself i wrote my own javascript to adapt to.
Interviewer,Make confirmations because gnosis safe didn't work with the status wallet well.
Vitalik,Um so there was definite that whole thing was definitely a bit of a marathon um i was also.
Interviewer,A kind of definitely a bit worried about or uncertain i guess how the public and you.
Vitalik,Know including the coin communities would perceive the whole thing um but i was actually impressed like i.
Interviewer,Yeah for every poster that was saying like no you know why yeah why did vitalik like.
Vitalik,Rugby on ice he was simple his wallet was supposed to be a burn address you know there's like 10 people.
Interviewer,That are like oh you know i thought i was just in this because it's a.
Vitalik,It's a fun pyramid gambling thing but instead i ended up being part of this you know great public good thing for.
Interviewer,Humanity and that's like even more amazing uh so the i the amount of that that i.
Vitalik,Got was very impressive so you know all in all let me know i think.
Interviewer,The dog people did great the dog people is there something you can extend to the bigger picture of it in the.
Vitalik,Principles you apply to making this decision is there some principles philosophies.
Interviewer,That you apply also to uh the decisions you make around ethereum um um i think uh.
Vitalik,A big one for me is just this idea that crypto you know isn't just an opportunity.
Interviewer,To give people like slightly better ways to sit to save value and all these things like.
Vitalik,It's also an opportunity to like basically create these like new digital institutions that could.
Interviewer,Serve the public good in new ways and and that's something that i've been.
Vitalik,Interested in for a long time i actually even have this article in bitcoin magazine back in 2014 where i basically.
Interviewer,Suggested this idea that you know you would have coins that represent causes and like people would just like.
Vitalik,Buy and accept those coins because they support those causes so i think it's called markets.
Interviewer,Institutions and currencies a new form of social incentivization or something like that oh my god.
Vitalik,And i'm sure you can find it and throw it in the links um yeah the so that was interesting to kind of.
Interviewer,See becoming real and like in general i mean i think you know public goods are very important.
Vitalik,And on the internet public goods are even more important right like every single lex friedman podcast is just.
Interviewer,On youtube and you know anyone can go and see it like there's no way for you to like.
Vitalik,You know sell it and so that some people can see it but other people can't see it like you know you could do that but then.
Interviewer,You'd obviously be you know reducing your impact so thank you for making the uh the amazing lex freeman podcast still.
Vitalik,Freely available well that's actually a tense thing is uh how do you do it in a way that's not uh.
Interviewer,Controlled in a centralized fashion because actually youtube feels free and open but it.
Vitalik,Nevertheless is one company making centralized decisions and the first time i realized youtube was.
Interviewer,Not forever is when a lot of the joe rogan experience library was pulled from.
Vitalik,Youtube as part of the spotify deal and he made me realize we need to uh it's like the realization that fiat.
Interviewer,Money is centralized is uh realizing that you know they this is not forever and you might want.
Vitalik,To come up with schemes to distribute it to uh decentralize the control of it in a way that audio for podcasters was just.
Interviewer,An rss feed exactly yeah and i think one of the kind of philosophical things that i hope to.
Vitalik,Achieve is kind of decouple the concept of public goods which are.
Interviewer,Incredibly important and are the lifeblood of modern civilization from the the idea that there nick.
Vitalik,Is there can be one central organization that represents the public and like perfectly unders uh understands and.
Interviewer,Can impose their idea of what is the good right like it's when people talk about.
Vitalik,Public goods it just often comes with this baggage of uh you know either centralization or.
Interviewer,Conformism and i think like it doesn't have to right like uh often.
Vitalik,The most important public goods are the ones that are created by you know the crazy individual that's.
Interviewer,That disagree with everyone else so trying to make this kind of synthesis where you combine the values.
Vitalik,Of decentralization and the values of open source but you're not naive about it and like.
Interviewer,You know you realize um that for these things to be produced there needs to be a way for it to be.
Vitalik,Sustainable there needs to be some way of supporting people who are working these projects but at the same.
Interviewer,Time you want to avoid that turning into a vector of centralization.
Vitalik,Like trying to sort of get all of the good things without the bad things to me that's a yeah a big part of.
Interviewer,Sort of what my grand experiment in crypto is about and and like we are doing things in different.
Vitalik,Kinds of things for this right like there's the the git coin grants quadratic.
Interviewer,Funding in the ethereum ecosystem um there's i mean obviously these uh dog coins that just happens.
Vitalik,Like i guess accidentally um there's other projects um that like for example you know.
Interviewer,Uniswap has um their uniswap dao that just has a huge amount of funding.
Vitalik,And like we haven't seen yet how that's going to be deployed but you know it could be potentially.
Interviewer,Deployed to do lots of really good and amazing things do you see ethereum as essentially a.
Vitalik,Mechanism to uh fight for social causes um i definitely see ethereum as.
Interviewer,Being a mechanism to fight for definitely some some specific things that are.
Vitalik,Um that are social causes um like just you know the fact of creating an open financial system that anyone can.
Interviewer,Participate in no matter where they are in the world that's a social cause i'm just you know giving people the.
Vitalik,Ability to organize and create projects even if it's five people in five different.
Interviewer,Countries i think that kind of inclusiveness i think that's a social cause.
Vitalik,And it's a core a core crypto value um but then at the same time like the other.
Interviewer,Important kind of part of the magic of ethereum that you have to balance that against is that it is also this.
Vitalik,Open platform where ultimately you know the thing that go the things that are on ethereum is just.
Interviewer,The things that the community makes of it well you kind of briefly open the door.
Vitalik,So let's go there when it comes to uh government regulation of crypto.
Interviewer,Uh what's the best case scenario what's the worst case scenario in terms of uh you know as you've kind.
Vitalik,Of mentioned ethereum challenges the the the power centers of the world.
Interviewer,And uh how do you see the interplay between govern governments and this new technology that.
Vitalik,Resists centralized power best case and worst case the the best case is um that um.
Interviewer,You know blockchains continue to prosper and we figure out scalability is so that people can actually start.
Vitalik,Doing things on block all you know all of the amazing use cases that people have been talking about instead of today.
Interviewer,Where a lot of the great stuff gets priced out because you know transaction fees are at.
Vitalik,Five to ten dollars and then we see a lot of different um amazing applications happening on.
Interviewer,Blockchains you know it could be like dao is creating new ways for people to.
Vitalik,Inter interact and organize with each other new ways for artists to get funded and.
Interviewer,Just all sorts of these amazing things and there's just enough public.
Vitalik,Um public support and just enough people that see that you know look crypto is clearly.
Interviewer,Doing a lot of good things and and you know there are definitely areas where there's tensions.
Vitalik,But in those areas where there's tensions like there could be some kind of.
Interviewer,Creative and interesting approaches that get figured out right like you know the concept of corporate taxes.
Vitalik,For example right like you know it does it that would disappear as a revenue stream if theoretically.
Interviewer,Corporations just all get replaced by taos but i know like maybe there's some other.
Vitalik,Creative way by which dao like dao's themselves can kind of be co.
Interviewer,You know have some kind of encoded governance that ensures that they have at least some of us some kind of.
Vitalik,Bias towards serving the global public good and you know maybe it does enough of the.
Interviewer,Daos can do enough of that that people are happy with it and and you know there are going to be things.
Vitalik,That people are unhappy about there's always going to be the people that you know wants to surveil everyone but.
Interviewer,If on the the kind of effect of crypto from just.
Vitalik,Empowering people is greater than that and greater than that in a way that people can just easily see.
Interviewer,Then you know that would be a good scenario right and we'll just like become incorpor kind of.
Vitalik,Incorporated and accepted the same way as happened uh with the internet um but the work in the worst case scenario.
Interviewer,Would of course be just like people like suddenly you know flipping and going into moral panic mode.
Vitalik,And just you know oh my god like this technology is used by like you know.
Interviewer,Insert bad group of the day and then i don't think governments have the ability to.
Vitalik,Ban crypto to the extent of just complete like preventing blockchains from existing but they.
Interviewer,Definitely have the ability to really marginalize it right like if you just ban all exchanges i can.
Vitalik,Ban all links from the fiat ecosystem to crypto and you know you ban all kind of.
Interviewer,Mainstream employers from accepting or paying in cryptocurrency then like you could.
Vitalik,You can successfully like turn it into a like you know a fairly kind of niche counterculture thing that.
Interviewer,Has much less impact than otherwise would so it's somewhere between the good scenario in.
Vitalik,The bad scenario i'm obviously hoping for the good well that's interesting also the tension.
Interviewer,Between governments and uh companies like if you have a bunch of billionaires or a bunch of companies.
Vitalik,Like tesla investing in bitcoin and then governments resisting that it's interesting who wins out in that worst.
Interviewer,Case scenario and almost when companies and uh rich quote unquote respectable.
Vitalik,People embrace uh cryptocurrencies bitcoin ethereum.
Interviewer,So on even the dot coins uh it's almost sends a signal to everybody else that this is.
Vitalik,This is a revolution that's here to stay on this one little tangent that you brought up.
Interviewer,This is almost an outdated idea but it's still with us which is cryptocurrencies are used for illegal.
Vitalik,Activity for drugs for crime and so on is there some sense that worries you that if.
Interviewer,Uh if cryptocurrency if ethereum runs the world then crime making money from crime will.
Vitalik,Be easier there's always that possibility like at the same time i think if you look at you.
Interviewer,Know the world as a whole and like the way all the other.
Vitalik,Technological trends are going like you know in-person surveillance is just going up every year.
Interviewer,Right yeah like the if you commit a crime in you know meat space it's getting harder and harder to get away.
Vitalik,With it so like you know if he wants to do something.
Interviewer,And and this is something that's just like happening as a result of you know just better technology.
Vitalik,Information and information transparency like a lot of it's hard to prevent even if.
Interviewer,You really tried um so i the world where like things go dark to such an ex.
Vitalik,You know as the the one the police hawks sometimes like to say um to such an extent.
Interviewer,That like you know oh my god the criminals are committing crimes with impunity and we can't.
Vitalik,See anything like that just seems unlikely um but you know on the other hand like.
Interviewer,The world uh where there just you know is no privacy for example or um the world where there just like is.
Vitalik,No no ability to uh kind of act outside of the the confines of you know mainstream institutions like.
Interviewer,It's uh some that's something that's more realistic and that seems like something that uh could lead to a lot of.
Vitalik,Kind of a lot of scary things right and like even from a government's point of view.
Interviewer,Right like i think governments over the last few years a lot of them they're very worried about.
Vitalik,Sovereignty you know they're worried about like if their um country is economies and you.
Interviewer,Know social environments they're just completely dependent on basically foreign tech.
Vitalik,Companies controlled by foreign governments like you know governments are not on team.
Interviewer,Government right that's like you know the indian government is on you know team india.
Vitalik,You know the russian government is on team russia and so forth right so like you know they don't want the us to.
Interviewer,Be able to like have this big backdoor into everything uh so i mean i do think that a balance.
Vitalik,Is needed but at the same time i uh do and think um i guess.
Interviewer,I i definitely like worry more about the messiah the possibility that just like without things like crypto.
Vitalik,Uh kind of acting outside of institutions becomes too impossible and i don't even necessarily mean.
Interviewer,Outside of governments even just you know outside of corporations like becomes too impossible and there's just.
Vitalik,Like terrible things that come as a result um and if things going in the other.
Interviewer,Direction like it obviously is a a risk but you know at the same time i think in the.
Vitalik,Long term like a crypto can potentially even like offer defenses as much as attacks against that sort of.
Interviewer,Thing yeah many throughout history many of the most destructive things came from.
Vitalik,Centralized institutions versus sort of from the people operating in the shadows.
Interviewer,And you know i've been talking to a bunch of psychedelics folks that people doing researchers like greg.
Vitalik,Doblin in johns hopkins there's a lot of exciting research on psychedelics.
Interviewer,And one thing you could say about operating at the edge of legality it could actually accelerate the.
Vitalik,Adoption of particular things like whether it's marijuana or psychedelics they can help people out it almost.
Interviewer,Accelerates the policy it forces the policy to catch up to where the people stand.
Vitalik,Right so there's a positive way of doing things that are in the gray area of legality.
Interviewer,And creating a market that allows people to to uh in a safe way be able to participate in.
Vitalik,This gray area yeah i mean the other thing to keep in mind of course is that the.
Interviewer,The set of like the kinds of things that just like payment processors as companies try to restrict.
Vitalik,People you from is much larger than the set of things that's illegal right right like part of that is because they.
Interviewer,Want to be super conservative and like the more layers you have the more they're like.
Vitalik,Kids conservative because they're scared of what what the layer below them will do to them.
Interviewer,Sometimes they have their own you know moral opinions of various kinds you know they go after lots of people.
Vitalik,Right like they make life really hard for you know like sex workers for example.
Interviewer,And like you know psychedelics as you mentioned there's uh like a lot of.
Vitalik,Activity even including stuff that is totally legal that just you know there's this like.
Interviewer,You know shadow like paypal credit card governments or whatever you want to call it and.
Vitalik,No no that makes it just hard to participate in this stuff so i think like reducing the number of.
Interviewer,Intermediaries is definitely normally a good thing all right let's talk about one of the most exciting uh.
Vitalik,Technologies like technically philosophically like socially financially in every way.
Interviewer,Which is ethereum 2.0 there's a million things to talk about but at the.
Vitalik,Step one is probably a good thing to do which is can you briefly summarize your vision.
Interviewer,How ethereum 2.0 will make ethereum more scalable secure and sustainable sure.
Vitalik,So i think recently we've actually been kind of de-emphasizing the eth 2.0 branding i guess so the reason.
Interviewer,Behind that was that originally we envisioned something more like a big grand event.
Vitalik,Where you know all the good things would happen at the same time and it would be a new blockchain.
Interviewer,And it would be a new protocol and people would have to take a lot of effort to migrate over.
Vitalik,But later we've slowly changed the roadmap over to something that's much more incremental.
Interviewer,Right so you know proof of stake happens kind of over time and then sharding gets added over time and all these features.
Vitalik,Get added over time and so the experience for just a regular ethereum user.
Interviewer,Still feels very seamless right it's like maybe a little bit more complex than the hard forks that we've already.
Vitalik,Done but from a user's point of view but like not by that much right uh so like.
Interviewer,The big two things that are happening right these are what used to be considered the two.
Vitalik,Flagship features of use 2.0 and now they're just you know the flagship features of the you know.
Interviewer,The next uh evolution of ethereum yeah as uh proof of stake.
Vitalik,And sharding right so proof of stake is a consensus algorithm it's the or it's not just mechanism i.
Interviewer,Should say um it's the difference is that like an algorithm is something that you run by yourself a.
Vitalik,Mechanism is like it involves interactions between people and it could even include.
Interviewer,Incentives and all of that uh so the consensus mechanism uh so by which nodes in.
Vitalik,The network agree on you know which blocks came in which transactions came in in what order.
Interviewer,Uh make sure that once a block gets accepted it can't get reverted and all of these.
Vitalik,Things that we expect from a blockchain um so existing blockchains you know including bitcoin including the ethereum.
Interviewer,Of today and including a lot of them they use proof of work right uh so.
Vitalik,The reason why we need proof of anything is be it is because like they serve this function that i call kind of economic.
Interviewer,Civil resistance so that's obviously you know a big word for.
Vitalik,Especially if you've never heard of sybil's before but like the basic idea is right that you have a network and you.
Interviewer,Have lots of computers that agree on like which block to accept and sometimes you get you know two blocks.
Vitalik,That get published at the same time and you just have to agree on an order so there has to be some kind of voting game.
Interviewer,Yeah but then the question is well in this voting game you know who get who gets a vote who gets to participate.
Vitalik,Now the pro you can't say one person one vote right the reason why you cannot say one person one vote is because.
Interviewer,You need some kind of like authority or some kind of mechanism to say you know who the.
Vitalik,The humans are like and if you don't have that then a bad guy could just come in with a.
Interviewer,Virtual machine or with a computer that has on it 10 billion virtual machines that.
Vitalik,Have 10 billion you know virtual nodes and then just like say look i'm 99 of the network i should control everything.
Interviewer,Uh so to prevent this what proof of work and proof of stake both do is they basically say well the weight of.
Vitalik,Your vote like how much influence your votes have in the consensus is proportional to like what quantity of.
Interviewer,Economic resources you bring in so in the case of proof of work you prove what economic resources you have.
Vitalik,Because your economic resources are computers and you prove that you have them by just.
Interviewer,Running them 24 7 using these hash algorithms right so this does solve the problem right because in order.
Vitalik,To attack the network you have to come in with more computers.
Interviewer,And more money invested into computers and electricity than the rest of the network puts.
Vitalik,Together and that's extremely expensive in proof-of-stake instead of relying on people with computers that are.
Interviewer,Just constantly cranking out hashes 24 7 you as you're like a unit of economic.
Vitalik,Resources you just use like holdings of coins inside the system right so all of these blockchains they.
Interviewer,Have some kind of coin in them bitcoin has bitcoin ethereum has ether um you know they all have a coin.
Vitalik,So why not just use that as the economic the economic resource that you're using to like measure participation.
Interviewer,Um so that's like the quarry distinction between proof of work and proof of stake um.
Vitalik,I like proof of stake and i've liked proof of stake for many years basically because like it just requires.
Interviewer,Much less ongoing resource consumption right like with proof-of-work.
Vitalik,Um you know you have to like actually go and buy these physical computers and these days um you know yeah they.
Interviewer,Have specialized hardware asics um application specific integrated circuits you have to go produce them you have to.
Vitalik,Go buy them and unless you have millions of dollars you know you have to buy them from one of these other people who.
Interviewer,Creates them and those other people often end up taking a huge cut of the profits.
Vitalik,Themselves uh and then you know you have to plug them in you have to just.
Interviewer,Burn all of this electricity that's just um running 24 7. so it consumes a huge amount of energy.
Vitalik,Right and it gets not just energy it also you know just to create the hardware.
Interviewer,Right like people focus a lot on energy but like actually about half the cost of proof of work.
Vitalik,Mining is the cost of the hardware um so hardware is a very big deal too um and you know you need.
Interviewer,This like these this really big and powerful with very specialized hardware another kind that fills up these big.
Vitalik,Warehouses so proof of stake you don't you don't really need that much electricity you.
Interviewer,Just need just a little bit to run right to run a regular computer um you can run proof-of-stake validators.
Vitalik,On computers that you already have um so it's just much less resource intensive and like this is.
Interviewer,Good for a few reasons right like one is you know the kind of environmental rationale that.
Vitalik,You know you're not breaking the environment um the second is that you're not taking away.
Interviewer,Electricity and like other resources from other people i mean like right now there's.
Vitalik,I think just today i saw a story about like iran wanting to shut down some bitcoin mining because.
Interviewer,It was just grabbing up so much electricity that it was you know outbidding the nearby towns and they.
Vitalik,Just didn't have enough um and then there was like chia that was the one that's doing.
Interviewer,Proof of like hard disk mining basically it's just like grabbing up so many hard disks.
Vitalik,There's a there's a shortage right so that's the second reason and then the third more selfish reason is that.
Interviewer,Because participating in consensus does not require so much energy expenditure you don't need to pay people.
Vitalik,As much to participate right so like bitcoin and ethereum they both issue.
Interviewer,Somewhere around four percent of the total supply every year right now to miners so ethereum is about 4.7.
Vitalik,Million ether and the current supply is about 115 million but with proof of stake like we.
Interviewer,Expect it'll be somewhere between 500 000 and one and one million per year um so so that means you know this.
Vitalik,The supply doesn't have to you know increase so quickly um so one of the pros that uh.
Interviewer,That people sort of argue for the proof of work is that uh it is secure because it's much more difficult.
Vitalik,To sort of as you've highlighted is difficult to participate is there um is what are your thoughts.
Interviewer,About the security of the proof-of-stake mechanism is is there ways to make it secure so i.
Vitalik,Think proof of stake is very secure uh because in order to be able to attack the system.
Interviewer,You need to have like basically as much stake as the rest of the network right.
Vitalik,So that means like right now for example we have five million each staking so you have to come up with five million each.
Interviewer,And then join the network and then the the other so five million ethers a lot right it's like um.
Vitalik,How much is it now like 15 billion dollars so that's actually more than i i believe the cost of attacking the.
Interviewer,Bitcoin network and then the second thing is that recovering from attacks is much easier.
Vitalik,In proof-of-stake than proof-of-work right because in proof-of-stake you have like first of.
Interviewer,All we have for many kinds of attacks that you do against this network we have this concept of like automatic.
Vitalik,Slashing right which basically means that in order to like revert a finalized.
Interviewer,Block so if there's one block that's like accepted by the network and you try to.
Vitalik,Convince the network to kind of revert that block and accept a different block in order to make that.
Interviewer,Kind of attack you basically have to have your validator.
Vitalik,Like a big portion of your validators signed to conflicting messages and this is something that like once.
Interviewer,These messages are on the network you can go and prove like look these people did it and so we have.
Vitalik,This feature in the protocol called slashing where you basically take all these people who provably misbehaved.
Interviewer,And you burn their coins right and you don't burn anyone else's coins now there are other cases like for.
Vitalik,Example if instead of reverting blocks the attack just tries to censor everyone.
Interviewer,Right then what you do everyone who got censored would just like basically create the minority chain.
Vitalik,Um and then the community would basically have to do a soft fork right they would just have to say like look.
Interviewer,This chain is clearly attacking us this chain is the one not attacking us and so we're.
Vitalik,Going to join this chain and then what happens is that on that new chain the attackers also lose a lot.
Interviewer,Of coins right yeah so the difference between proof of stake and proof of work.
Vitalik,Is that in a proof-of-stake system like you can identify specific participants and you can say you know.
Interviewer,These and like this isn't like you know a human going in and saying i don't like you i don't like you i don't like you.
Vitalik,This is like automated right you can so the slashing process is automated yes.
Interviewer,Is there ways it can go wrong so that's a painful process where the coins are burned.
Vitalik,Um it is painful yes i think uh i mean the one big unknown of course is like if.
Interviewer,An attack actually happens and like if an attack happens that requires the community to actually choose one of.
Vitalik,These minority forks then like what would the the community actually successfully coordinating on.
Interviewer,This look like right like it's like you know we can talk about it and we can you know write.
Vitalik,Like science fiction novels about it but like until it's happened you don't really know the details of like what it.
Interviewer,Looks like and how difficult it is what are the channels of communication for the community if you can.
Vitalik,Enlighten me a little bit like what you know uh in many ways in the political realm.
Interviewer,Twitter is often used as a way to kind of have these emerging phenomena of large groups of people coming to a.
Vitalik,Consensus right about a particular idea and then there's battle for consensus what's uh.
Interviewer,In the ethereum community how do people what are the sources of natural language based communication.
Vitalik,That have an emergent belief structure that you would say or is it all through money is it all.
Interviewer,Through trading that the communication happens there's definitely talking as well um i.
Vitalik,Mean like we have to agree on protocol changes somehow right like there's twitter there's reddit.
Interviewer,There's um github there's uh all of the various ethereum forums ethereum magicians ethereum research.
Vitalik,There's just in-person communication then there's just kind of like the hidden web of everyone talking to.
Interviewer,Everyone on telegram um or signal uh so it's like some of everything.
Vitalik,Right but i think like the thing to emphasize around like can you actually come to consensus on.
Interviewer,You know whether or not to fork the chain because the attacker is censoring some everyone just for example.
Vitalik,Is like you everyone who's running a node is going to see.
Interviewer,Almost the same thing right like they're going to be off by a few seconds and like maybe they'll be off by a few.
Vitalik,They'll disagree by a few minutes but like if it's a serious attack you know people are gonna know right it's not.
Interviewer,Like one of those things where you know oh it we're trying to agree on like i don't.
Vitalik,Know did epstein kill himself or like some you know read the political facts for like in.
Interviewer,Reality no one knows a single thing about what's actually going on and they're all speculating.
Vitalik,Like it is much more visible right so we do have that but you know at the same time i'm happy.
Interviewer,To admit that like these are fairly untested mechanisms but like at the same time they're also.
Vitalik,Untested mechanisms and proof of work right and like in proof of work it's even.
Interviewer,Harder because in proof of work you don't have the ability to like identify and say.
Vitalik,Like you know i'm going to these miners attacked and so we're not going to let these my um.
Interviewer,These miners in these miners do not attack so we're going to keep them in like you have to pretty much you know.
Vitalik,Either take out none of the miners or you do a fork that changes the proof of work algorithm which takes out all of.
Interviewer,The miners right so the the economics of like recovering from attacks and proof of work at least.
Vitalik,To me actually do seem more unfavorable but you know i'm sure the proof of work.
Interviewer,People you talk to will give a very different and contradictory opinions and that's.
Vitalik,Totally fine and amazing some people describe mev minor extractable value as an.
Interviewer,Existential risk to ethereum what is mev how important is it to solve an mvv.
Vitalik,If it's important what ideas do you have sure how about after this one we'll also talk about sharding because that's.
Interviewer,Amazing and it's part of the return back to sharding and which is no no return to the big picture.
Vitalik,Of the scaling problem as you mentioned i love this conversation you know depth first search instead of brett first.
Interviewer,So uh basically okay ebbyv minor extractable value um it is not different in proof of work and proof of.
Vitalik,Stake right so like if you want to call it you know block proposal extractable.
Interviewer,Value like it sounds a lot sexy but you know we can call it bpef instead of math who cares.
Vitalik,Um but so this is a problem in both proof of work and proof of stake yes so the basic idea is.
Interviewer,That if you have the ability to choose which transactions go into a block and in what order.
Vitalik,Then you have the ability to like take advantage of that position for economic gain.
Interviewer,In a lot more ways than just collecting transaction fees right like for example there's decentralized.
Vitalik,Exchanges on chain like uniswap and like let's say the price of eth versus usdc was 2700.
Interviewer,The previous block but then there was a bit of a market drop and now it's 26.80 where you can go on unit swap and you.
Vitalik,Can just like gobble up the entire part of um you know the automated order book.
Interviewer,That's like between 2700 and 26.80 right and that's and then at the same time you like run a.
Vitalik,Bot and uh you know you buy some yeast back at 26.80 and you've just like made about 10.
Interviewer,Dollars of profit right so or well 10 dollars times you know whatever the depth is right so and.
Vitalik,So there's lots of um little things like that there's also things um that involve like front running other people's.
Interviewer,Transactions so one example of this would be that if someone sends a transaction that.
Vitalik,Says buy me five eth for um whatever price that you can get um then.
Interviewer,But with a maximum of let's say yeah uh 15 000 then you can go and like.
Vitalik,You can send each put a transaction right in front of that transaction and you can like buy up that east first.
Interviewer,And then you resell it to him at you know fifteen thousand dollars minus one yeah so there's then you get to make a.
Vitalik,Little bit of money though exactly so there's a lot of these different like arbitrage front running back running.
Interviewer,These different tricks that allow block proposers to to get some percentage.
Vitalik,On top like overhead exactly and the reason why this is um a challenge is because um.
Interviewer,It's like first of all it's some it sometimes degrades user experience because users get you.
Vitalik,Know less favorable uh trades but there are sometimes ways to like mitigate that for applications.
Interviewer,Sometimes it's not that bad but like the bigger risk that i think some people consider more existential.
Vitalik,Is that there's just much more economies of scale in figuring out how to extract all this.
Interviewer,Revenue i mean because if you're just collecting transaction fees there aren't really economies of scale.
Vitalik,There aren't really benefits to centralizing right because it's a very simple formula you just like grab up the.
Interviewer,Transactions that pay you the most but with mev you know you ha there's all these sophisticated algorithms.
Vitalik,And if you have lots of money then you can hire really smart people to make amazing algorithms and then you can use.
Interviewer,The other half of your money to get a lot of mining power a lot of stake and you get a lot of opportunities.
Vitalik,To use your even better algorithms so there's this risk that like as a result of this.
Interviewer,Mining is basically or or even validating proof of stake is going to centralize.
Vitalik,Um so i think the ecosystems best reply to this sort of risk and it's the direction where projects.
Interviewer,Like flashbots are going already is if you can't eliminate the centralization then you try to firewall.
Vitalik,It right and the way that you fire wallet is you basically say we're going to try to deliberately create a.
Interviewer,Marketplace where people can just do the complicated work of creating.
Vitalik,What are called bundles like bundles of transactions that like are very profitable right and then.
Interviewer,At the other side of the market you just have like block proposes reminders that are just dumb nodes.
Vitalik,And they go and ask the what are called searchers the bundle creators and they just ask like hey like how much.
Interviewer,Can you give me if i put in your bundle and then they just take the highest offer.
Vitalik,Right so you sort of separate out the task and you know you have the easy part and then you have the hard.
Interviewer,Part and you have like this special class of actor called a searcher that does the hard part.
Vitalik,And then the easy part the people doing the easy part which is just miners and validators they kind of.
Interviewer,Just talk to all the different people doing the searching and they just you know accept the highest bidder right.
Vitalik,So and this is also just like interesting uh an interesting example of like economic design philosophy.
Interviewer,Right like sometimes you can't just like make centralization go away sometimes it's inevitable but.
Vitalik,You know at least you can try to kind of contain it you can direct it or you know you can even sort of.
Interviewer,Firewall it away from you know core consensus the parts that really do need to be decentralized.
Vitalik,So but you don't see it as an existential risk it's just incredible it's a bit of a problem that it has to.
Interviewer,Be constantly dealt with it's a i mean it's a risk like there's obviously a risk that you know there it.
Vitalik,It's a very severe problem and that even this flashbots approach has some fatal flaw or whatever.
Interviewer,Um but i'm definitely like we're definitely approaching it with the mindset of you know this is a problem.
Vitalik,And like yes we do have to do some work to solve it but we're doing it and uh so far it's being solved okay let's talk.
Interviewer,About the other really really fascinating part of uh the future of ethereum let's not call it.
Vitalik,Ethereum 2.0 but the future of ethereum that also may require a hard fork i don't know you can.
Interviewer,Correct me on this is well broadly ideas for scaling yes and more.
Vitalik,Specifically sort of uh layer two or uh layer one and two intersection ideas of.
Interviewer,How to achieve scaling and at the core of that is the idea of sharding so.
Vitalik,First what is sharding okay uh so there's two major paradigms for scaling blockchains right as.
Interviewer,You said layer one and layer two and layer one basically means make the blockchain itself like capable.
Vitalik,Of processing more transactions by having you know some mechanism by which you can do that.
Interviewer,Despite the fact that there's a limit to the capacity of each participant in the blockchain.
Vitalik,And then layer two says well we're gonna keep the blockchain as is but we're gonna create clever protocols.
Interviewer,That sit on top of the blockchain that still use the blockchain and then still kind of inherit things like the.
Vitalik,Security guarantees of a blockchain but at the same time a lot of things are done off-chain and so.
Interviewer,You get more scalability that way um so in ethereum the most popular paradigm failure too is rollups and the most.
Vitalik,Popular paradigm for one is sharding so one way to achieve layer one scaling is to increase the.
Interviewer,Block size yes hence the block size wars quote unquote and uh you actually tweeted.
Vitalik,Something about uh people are saying that vitalik changed his mind about the in it.
Interviewer,He went from being a small i went from being big to small big small of them and uh but you said.
Vitalik,I've been a medium blocker all along so maybe you can also comment on on where.
Interviewer,On the very basic aspect before you even get the sharding of where you stand on this block.
Vitalik,Size debate sure so the way that i think about the trade-off is i think about it as a trade-off between.
Interviewer,Making it easy to write to the blockchain and making it easy to read the blockchain.
Vitalik,Right so when i say read i just mean you know have a node and actually verify it and make sure that it's correct and all.
Interviewer,Of those things and then by right i mean send transactions so like.
Vitalik,I think for decentralization it's important for both of these tasks to be accessible.
Interviewer,And i think that they're like about equally important right if you have a chain that's too expensive to read then.
Vitalik,Everyone will just trust a few people to like read for them and then those people can change the rules without anyone.
Interviewer,Else's permission but if on the other hand it becomes really expensive to write.
Vitalik,Then everyone will move on to basically second layer systems that are incredibly centralized and like that takes away.
Interviewer,From you know decentralization and self-sovereignty as well so.
Vitalik,This has been my viewpoints like pretty much the whole time right it's that like you know you need this balance and going.
Interviewer,In one direction or the other direction is very unhealthy in the bitcoin case um basically what.
Vitalik,Happens was that bitcoin originally like at the very beginning it didn't really have a block.
Interviewer,Size it just had an accidental block size of 32 meg or a block size limit of 32 megabytes because.
Vitalik,That just happens to be the limit of the peer-to-peer messages um but that's interesting i didn't even.
Interviewer,Know that part yeah but then um satoshi back in 2010 was worried that even 32 megabyte blocks would be too.
Vitalik,Hard to process so he uh put the limit down to one megabyte and you know i think.
Interviewer,The i put you mean sneaked in there yeah just like made an update to the bitcoin software that made blocks bigger than.
Vitalik,One i think it's a million bytes um invalid and i think the impression that most people.
Interviewer,Had at the time is that you know this is just a temporary safety measure and over time.
Vitalik,You know though as we become more confident in the software that limit would be.
Interviewer,And like raised some uh somewhat um but ba then of when the actual usage of the.
Vitalik,Blockchain started going up and then it started going up first to 100 kilobytes.
Interviewer,Per block then to 250 kilobytes per block then to 500 kilobytes per block um you know they're started kind of.
Vitalik,Coming out of the woodworks this opinion that like no that limit should just not be increased.
Interviewer,And and you know then there are all of these attempts at compromising right um you know first there's like a.
Vitalik,Proposal for 20 megabyte blocks then there was the 248 proposal which is um a bit ironic because the 248.
Interviewer,Proposal started off being like a small block negotiating position but then when the big black people came.
Vitalik,Back and said like hey where are we are we gonna do this they're like oh no no no we don't want them we don't want the.
Interviewer,Block size increases anymore uh so you know there were these two different positions right the small.
Vitalik,Blockers i think they valued one megabyte blocks for two reasons.
Interviewer,One is that they just like really really believe in the importance of being able to read the chain but two is.
Vitalik,That a lot of them really believe in in maintaining this norm of never hard forking.
Interviewer,Right right so the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork is basically that.
Vitalik,In a soft fork um blocks that were any block that's valid under the new rules was still valid under the old.
Interviewer,Rules so if you have a client that verifies according to the old rules then you'll.
Vitalik,Still be able to accept the chain that follows the new rules whereas with a hard fork like you have to.
Interviewer,Update your code in order to stay on the chain and look they have this belief that.
Vitalik,You know soft forks are kind of either less coercive than hard forks which by the way i completely disagree with.
Interviewer,Um i actually think soft forks are more coercive because like basically they force everyone who disagrees to sort of.
Vitalik,Go along by default um but or they have this um opinion that um there's like.
Interviewer,It's more difficult to abuse soft forks to do really mean things like or that like completely violate people's.
Vitalik,Expectations like increasing the supply which is again there i think there is some truth to that um.
Interviewer,So because of you know these reasons they just say we're only going to do soft forks and we.
Vitalik,Don't we wants to just not do any hard forks and they eventually discovered this idea.
Interviewer,Called segregated witness that allows for like a very tiny block size increase to like the.
Vitalik,Equivalent of about two megabytes um with a soft fork it's it's just a really.
Interviewer,Like weird and devious trick like basically what they do is they take the signatures of transactions.
Vitalik,And then they put them outside of the block and then they add an extra rule that.
Interviewer,Says that like every for a block to be valid the blog has to come with a separate like basically extension.
Vitalik,Block that contains all of the transaction signatures right so you know when you measure it.
Interviewer,According to the old rules like you know hey it adds up to less than a million but actually there's this extension.
Vitalik,Block that the old protocol doesn't even know about so it's a hack that that seemed to work.
Interviewer,To do in a small way extend exactly but so you know small block side was like happy.
Vitalik,With these very low levels of block size and the big block side wanted to expand to you know at the very least go.
Interviewer,To four megabytes then you know maybe go maybe eight twenty there are there's disagreements within there as well.
Vitalik,Um i definitely was uh favoring the big side um the whole way through as you can.
Interviewer,Probably tell um but even though so the argument against the big.
Vitalik,Is that uh it uh makes things more centralized yes because fewer people can run and.
Interviewer,Know that verifies the chain and also because any of these things would require a hard fork and.
Vitalik,You know hard forks or inherently risky do you think there's truth to that um i'm pro hard fork i think hard forks.
Interviewer,Are actually like in a yeah you know political economic sense they're better than soft forks.
Vitalik,Well let's okay okay i think it's a beautiful principle as stated that soft.
Interviewer,Forks may be more coarse coercive than hard forks this this is not just about.
Vitalik,Cryptocurrency this is about politics and life that's fascinating so you're okay with hard forks in fact you.
Interviewer,Think hard forks is the right way to make changes because then everybody's forced to make a.
Vitalik,Decision right do you accept this change or not as opposed to ideas being sneaked.
Interviewer,In behind the door and you're and the decisions forced on you exactly yeah okay so but you know.
Vitalik,Hard fork some people say this is when they talk about sort of ethereum is there's some aspect to a hard fork.
Interviewer,Where you're trying to upgrade a what is it airplane while it's flying.
Vitalik,And uh i think softworks are also upgrading an airplane while it's flying but it's just smaller upgrades.
Interviewer,That's like there's some truth to that like there's definitely um there's definitely.
Vitalik,A bit more risk of like a split as a result of a hard fork then as a result of a soft.
Interviewer,Fork um and this split is highly undesirable right well it depends like if it's a split.
Vitalik,Because of a bug then that's horrible if it's a split as a result of political differences then i think like.
Interviewer,A split is better than you know one side being forced to basically just like suck it up and.
Vitalik,Accept the majority position even if it really hates it well there's also political connections.
Interviewer,Throughout the history of the united states it's like sometimes groups of people that strongly disagree.
Vitalik,With each other should be forced to work it out even if they even when a split seems.
Interviewer,Like an easy thing in the short term it depends and i think like well for blockchains in particular the costs of.
Vitalik,People being able to like peacefully do their go off and do their own thing or much lower right like.
Interviewer,You know okay if you have a country and you have two groups then like often enough like fighting out the.
Vitalik,New rules requires you know a civil war it requires everyone to move and so forth but no no.
Interviewer,On a blockchain like you know the costs are lower and so so if you were to look at the way things worked.
Vitalik,Out with the block size wars and there was a split what is the bitcoin cash and bitcoin.
Interviewer,Yeah um would you like you looking putting on your historian hat you mentioned offline you like dan.
Vitalik,Carlin so if dan carlin went to do an episode on the.
Interviewer,On the block size wars uh do you think uh it could have turned out better or do you.
Vitalik,Um are you okay with the way it turned out i'm definitely disappointed with what.
Interviewer,Happened with the block with the the big block side um i think the source of my.
Vitalik,Disappointment is that like one of the things that you notice when just looking at like this political.
Interviewer,Disagreements generally especially when you have environments where you know they're.
Vitalik,Authoritarian or like single party dominated and then there's some opposition party.
Interviewer,And the opposition often has like very legitimate grievances but at the same time the thing you.
Vitalik,Notice is that often enough the opposition just sucks right like it just doesn't have.
Interviewer,You know political capacity it doesn't have like the ability to come up with policy because its.
Vitalik,Entire culture is like designed around resisting much more and then it's designed around like you know.
Interviewer,Actually debating serious policy trade-offs and i i worry or i guess not so much worry.
Vitalik,Because it's already happened i uh unfortunately think that bitcoin cash ended up being a victim of this.
Interviewer,Right like um first no there was a split with bitcoin cash and then of course craig wright came in.
Vitalik,And you know craig wright was uh this basically scammer who just keeps on pretending that he is satoshi nakamoto.
Interviewer,The inventor of uh bitcoin hey craig wright's legal team do you hear me yes i still think your client is a scammer.
Vitalik,So sue me this is definitely gonna be depth first search because i gotta ask you about craigslist.
Interviewer,Because these people have been contacting me and i'm trying to figure out like.
Vitalik,What is up with this human being so for people who don't know there's somebody who is let's start.
Interviewer,There's satoshi nakamoto who is the creator of bitcoin is anonymous and actually most really big people in.
Vitalik,The cryptocurrency space do not like like yourself and others do not dare claim that they are even for.
Interviewer,Fun satoshi nakamoto in fact if satoshi nakamoto is still alive and is like if say you were.
Vitalik,Satisfied it seems like the thing he would do is probably or she is uh.
Interviewer,Trying to remain anonymous on the flip side of that there's a guy named craig wright who continually keeps.
Vitalik,Claiming that he is in fact satoshi nakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people so uh.
Interviewer,On on him if we could just linger on him what do you make of this character uh what what are we supposed to make of.
Vitalik,This character should he be ignored is there any possible truth to his claims.
Interviewer,Um what do you make of him the the analogy that's at the side at the top of my head will get a bit political but.
Vitalik,Um that's fine you've had michael ballas um so um i guess i view craig wright as being.
Interviewer,Kind of like a donald trump figure yes and that like he's not very intellectual um but i think he gets a.
Vitalik,Big audience because he says he he says things that like play to the resentments that.
Interviewer,People have and he says things that uh people wants to hear right like in the in the wake of this block size war.
Vitalik,No the big blockers did feel very disenchanted like they felt that you know bitcoin always had this vision.
Interviewer,That we were supposed to just keep increasing the block size and bitcoin is pewter pure cash it says so in the white.
Vitalik,Paper and then this gr this elitist clique of core devs just like.
Interviewer,Came in and said you know no no we're going to impose this totally different vision.
Vitalik,And if you ever want your scalability you'll have to wait for us to create this.
Interviewer,This totally unproven fancy technology called the lightning network that works on your completely different principles.
Vitalik,And you know they were very angry at this and i mean i think like i think a lot of that anger is justified.
Interviewer,Um but at the same time you know when people are in that mental state like it's very easy for you to.
Vitalik,Just kind of like latch on and if you find someone who expresses anger at the same things that you're.
Interviewer,Angry at and also like it seems like someone who's strong and seems like someone who.
Vitalik,You know might be good to rally around it's very easy to just like get behind that.
Interviewer,But that extra part about where he satoshi i think that's um he could have done it.
Vitalik,Without that but that i mean that just it's a marketing strategy like it sort of gives him more.
Interviewer,Salience like there's other big block personalities right but what's the difference between.
Vitalik,With greg wright he's not just a big a big block personality he's potentially satoshi um and he did say.
Interviewer,All the big block things right like he talked about how oh the concept of a fee market is fundamentally.
Vitalik,Like economically wrong and it should be it should be a free market and you should be able to have walks as big as.
Interviewer,You want like he repeated all the talking points and so a lot of people were kind of sucked into.
Vitalik,That right and so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate.
Interviewer,A big part of the bitcoin cash community for a long time and then eventually if of course um you know more.
Vitalik,And more people started to catch on um he would just say technical things that are completely wrong right.
Interviewer,Like one example of this that i remember is that he mixed up the concept of 256 bits and 2 to the.
Vitalik,Power of 256 bits right um so you know the difference is it's like the difference between you.
Interviewer,Know 80 and the concept of 80 digit numbers right um and because of this like he.
Vitalik,Made this made this argument that said that bitcoin that bitcoin's elliptic curve is.
Interviewer,Friendly to cryptographic pairings like you don't have to understand what that is but if you want.
Vitalik,To know i have articles on both at vitalik.ca um but basically he made this like.
Interviewer,Technical argument that really hedged on this point and then when people when people pressed him on it's like.
Vitalik,Yes what no no like what look exactly the the height is like what two and two to the 256 bits that's uh.
Interviewer,A very uh a very tiny amount of information no no no 2256 bits is more than the.
Vitalik,Amount of information in the universe and like yeah you know equivocated and kind of like.
Interviewer,Preyed on people's inability to and you know understands that mathematical nuance and i called him out.
Vitalik,And eventually i even called him out in person at this conference and soul like i just stood up.
Interviewer,And asked the you know hey you know conference organizer why are you letting this fraud.
Vitalik,Speak at this conference and i remember even some big blockers at the time getting angry at me.
Interviewer,Um but you know eventually they i did get rid of him and then craig well basically craig wright.
Vitalik,Um was forced to split off because the rest of the community refused to accept some network change that he wanted.
Interviewer,And so then there was the bch and bsv and then in the bitcoin cash community there was this drama of.
Vitalik,Are they going to add a developer fund where they redirect 12 and a half percent of the revenue from the miners.
Interviewer,To the devs and according to the libertarian not aggression principle is this technically.
Vitalik,Theft um like his um understanding of the technical depths of cryptocurrency.
Interviewer,Was lacking in a way that you uh satoshi nakamoto certainly would not yes exactly but the point is that even.
Vitalik,After craig wright got expunged the bitcoin cash community kept having these disagreements right and now.
Interviewer,After this uh development funds dispute there's there's a further split between bitcoin cash and abc.
Vitalik,Um so you know the the the brand check three continues to extend right so so in that way it's disappointing to.
Interviewer,See those kinds of splitting there was never a result it is i would have definitely like.
Vitalik,Wanted to see more of a kind of like v principled coin with a like tries to be bitcoin but but you.
Interviewer,Know follows consistent big block values but yeah i know maybe i should just like stop expecting projects that i have no.
Vitalik,Involvement and to uh care at all about what my values are and you know like maybe ethereum just.
Interviewer,Like is is never i think you have a powerful voice and you can inspire other projects.
Vitalik,To do to to to live up to their best possible cells.
Interviewer,Okay so that's the level that's the layer one uh approach the other layer one within the ethereum.
Vitalik,Is the idea of sharding yes what the heck is sharding okay what does the future of shining look like right so.
Interviewer,To summarize that big long tangent that we just uh once it's a beautiful tangent button.
Vitalik,It's tangent and i think like crypto is just uh one of the most underrated aspects of.
Interviewer,Crypto is i think how you can like analyze the you know the sociology and the politics and the anthropology.
Vitalik,And yeah and i'm sure dan carl would have fun exploring the space at some point.
Interviewer,But like the core trade-off right is that if you scale blockchains the dumb way just by increasing the parameters.
Vitalik,Then eventually you just make it harder and harder to participate as a node and you.
Interviewer,End up with a system where there's like 20 computers running the whole thing and it's just very centralized um so.
Vitalik,Shorting basically says well instead of just increasing the parameters what we're going to do is.
Interviewer,We're going to change the blockchain architecture in such a way that each.
Vitalik,Individual node in the blockchain only needs to store a small portion of the data and only.
Interviewer,Needs to process a small portion of the transactions so you can think about it as being like.
Vitalik,Inspired by bitsword right like on bittorrent there's no such thing as a bittorrent full node that has every.
Interviewer,Movie right you know the work is like split up among a huge number of computers and.
Vitalik,Like that makes sense that's uh you know the only sane way to scale a system like that.
Interviewer,Um and if they actually tried making a version bit of bits or that required full nodes.
Vitalik,That store every movie then you know it would have like zero censorship resistance and it would just like.
Interviewer,You know be dead in an instant uh so the challenge with taking that model and applying it to blockchains right is that.
Vitalik,Blockchains aren't just about like spreading data around they're about agreeing on exactly what data was spread.
Interviewer,Around and ensuring that everything that you agree on actually is correct and so you have this paradox.
Vitalik,Where let's say you want to have a system that supports.
Interviewer,10 000 transactions a second but each computer in the network can only personally verify.
Vitalik,100 transactions a second so how can each computer get a guarantee about the other 900.
Interviewer,Without actually going and verifying them themselves yep and it turns out that there are some um.
Vitalik,Like a bundle of different tricks that can do that right so like one of them is uh just random sampling.
Interviewer,So the idea behind random sampling is like let's say for simplicity this is a proof of.
Vitalik,Stake chain and you have 10 000 validators validators like.
Interviewer,You know the stakers and like for simplicity we'll assume they all have the same number of coins right if.
Vitalik,Someone has more coins we'll just kind of split them up and pretends they're tense takers.
Interviewer,Then you you you do like some random shuffling and you basically say these random hundred validators are.
Vitalik,Assigned to validate this block these random hundred validators are assigned to validate this block.
Interviewer,These random hundred validators are assigned to validate this block and so each individual computer only.
Vitalik,Gets assigned to validate like a small piece but then the way that the information.
Interviewer,About like what's evaluated gets passed around right is that when these hundred participants validate a.
Vitalik,Block they all sign a message basically saying like yes.
Interviewer,We agree that this block is valid and then like they combine that signature into one.
Vitalik,And then they broadcast that signature and then everyone else instead of verifying the blocks directly.
Interviewer,Just verifies that signature right and so if i see the signature i'm not directly convinced that that block.
Vitalik,Is valid but what i am convinced of is that out of this committee of or this.
Interviewer,Randomly selected group of 100 validators let's say at least 70 of them agree that this.
Vitalik,Block is valid and so if i trust that you know the majority of these participants are all honest.
Interviewer,Then because it's all randomly selected you know the attacker can't just like force themselves into one committee.
Vitalik,And and so you know the attacker is going to be even at least evenly spread out too and so if you know.
Interviewer,The entire set of validators is mostly honest every committee is going to be mostly honest and so.
Vitalik,Like bad blocks are not going to go through right so that's like one simple form of sharding there's also.
Interviewer,Other more clever things that you can do so for example there's this concept of zk snarks right now called as your.
Vitalik,Knowledge proofs so this is the idea that you can make a cryptographic proof that says.
Interviewer,I verified or i ran some complex computation on this piece of data and i got this answer.
Vitalik,And so if you make these kinds of proofs then like if you see a zika snark that says some block is valid.
Interviewer,Then you're convinced that that block is valid and even if you know everyone in that.
Vitalik,Committee is evil like they have no way of making a a valid proof for a bad block.
Interviewer,Right like because the proof itself like it is a proof that you did the computation.
Vitalik,Where that proof is much easier to verify than just running the computation yourself.
Interviewer,And you know the there's once again you know super awesome.
Vitalik,Mathematical cryptographic magic behind making zk snarks work um so it gives you a little bit of a leg.
Interviewer,Up over the 51 honest exact assumption so it's a little hack that improves upon the random.
Vitalik,Sampling thing exactly and like there's other hacks right like there is another hack called.
Interviewer,Data availability sampling that allows you to make sure that the data in the blocks was actually published.
Vitalik,But like basically like if you stack a couple of these tricks on top of each other.
Interviewer,You can create a system where like i as an individual participant can be convinced that everything that's.
Vitalik,Going on in this distributed blockchain thing is correct without actually personally checking more than like a.
Interviewer,Percent of it so that's charting that's starting but but the.
Vitalik,As i understand maybe correct me on this is uh in the space of ethereum the the sharding happens on some fixed.
Interviewer,Number like th the split is on some fixed number i think it's 64..
Vitalik,Is the currently sort of proposed number so um how does that help scaling is it just.
Interviewer,To fix constant scaling by 64 and is that a way to achieve those.
Vitalik,Crazy the crazy amount of scaling that seems to be required to use cryptocurrency for uh for.
Interviewer,Purchasing so doing like competing with credit cards and visa and so on right so first i.
Vitalik,Think like the 64 can be hard forked up over time um so we have uh set it so that like.
Interviewer,There's theoretically space in the data structure for 1024 shards it's just that 64 of them are.
Vitalik,Turned on um like there are challenges with having more shards because like you have to.
Interviewer,Have logic that just like checks and manages all of those shards and if there's too many.
Vitalik,Of them then that becomes too expensive um but you know even still you can improve quite a bit.
Interviewer,And then the other thing that we're doing is if what we're getting maximum scalability.
Vitalik,By combining roll-ups and sharding right so this might be a good time to talk about.
Interviewer,Roll-ups what are roll-ups okay and now we're moving into layer two ideas yes.
Vitalik,So the idea behind a roll-up is basically that so instead of um just publishing.
Interviewer,Transactions directly on chain and having everyone you know do all of the checking of those transactions.
Vitalik,And what you do is you create a system where users send their transactions to some.
Interviewer,Part like central party called an aggregator and like well theoretically you can have a.
Vitalik,System where like the aggregator switches around or anyone can be an aggregator so.
Interviewer,You know it's still like permissionless to send things um then what the aggregator does is they.
Vitalik,Strip out all of the transaction data that like is not relevant to helping people.
Interviewer,Update the state so when i say the state this is like this is a very important kind of technical term for blockchains i.
Vitalik,Mean like account balances code um like things that are like memory.
Interviewer,Internal memory of smart contracts like basically everything the blockchain actually has to keep track of and.
Vitalik,Remember right so you just put in you take all these transactions strip.
Interviewer,Out all the data that's not relevant to telling people how to update the state and then you take the data that's needed.
Vitalik,To update the state and then you like really compress it right so like for example.
Interviewer,If we say you know i vitalik have an account that's 0x eight blah blah blah blah and.
Vitalik,It's 20 bytes well instead we can say well i have an account that is.
Interviewer,Number one eight seven four two two four in the tree right and that goes down from 20 bytes.
Vitalik,To just like an index and a position which is three bytes right so you use all sorts of these fancy compression.
Interviewer,Tracks then you basically just instead of publishing all these transactions you publish this like tiny.
Vitalik,Compressed blob right so the amount of data that goes on chain goes down by maybe about a factor.
Interviewer,Of ten right and then the second thing is that you don't do the computation on chin.
Vitalik,Instead you do the computation off-chain and there's one of two ways to do this right.
Interviewer,One is called a zk roll up which is you just provide a zika snark that basically says hey look.
Vitalik,I did this computation and uh and i have this proof that here's the here's the you know some hash of the.
Interviewer,Result and it's correct and then you stick it on chain and everyone verifies this one proof.
Vitalik,Instead of verifying all these transactions and then the other approach is called an.
Interviewer,Optimistic roll-up which is basically made of the scheme where like first someone says like hey.
Vitalik,This is what i think the result of the of applying these transactions is and then someone else can say i disagree the.
Interviewer,Result is different and only if two people disagree do you actually do it on like.
Vitalik,Do you actually just like publish all of the data and run the whole that whole blog on chain so if there's.
Interviewer,Disagreements then you just like run everything on chain and whoever was wrong like loses a lot of money.
Vitalik,Right so disagreements are very rare and they're very expensive and in a ck roll up you don't even rely.
Interviewer,On this like challenging game at all you just rely on a proof so you know the core principle is basically.
Vitalik,That instead of lots of transactions and all the trends that everyone verifies every.
Interviewer,Transaction it is you take the transactions you strip strip them down and compress them.
Vitalik,As much as possible then stick that on the blockchain you do need to stick something on the.
Interviewer,Blockchain just so that everyone everyone else can like keep keep up to date with the states so they know.
Vitalik,You know what all the contracts are what all the balances are and all of this but it's a very small amount of data and.
Interviewer,Then you use some one of these other off-chain games you know could be this optimistic game could be a zk-snark to.
Vitalik,Just prove that somebody out there did the compensation and the result is correct.
Interviewer,Right so you're pushing like 90 of the work off chain and then you know well 90 of the data ends 99 of.
Vitalik,The computation option and then you still have 10 of the data and 1 of the computation on chin.
Interviewer,And so you know your scalability goes up by a factor of about a hundred so these systems are already alive for.
Vitalik,For some applications right so there's something called loopering which is just a.
Interviewer,Zk roll up for payments right so you can have you know assets inside of us inside of.
Vitalik,The loopering system and you can go around and transfer them but.
Interviewer,Uh what you um and you get like much lower transaction fees right like instead of five dollars you'd.
Vitalik,Have to pay like less than five cents um but the only problem is that this only supports a couple of applications.
Interviewer,Right now like making one that supports anything that you can do on ethereum just takes a bit more work but.
Vitalik,That's being done as well right so like within a few months i'm expecting you know fully ethereum um capable.
Interviewer,Um roll ups to um be available as well so then so roll ups just summarizing you know do most of the work off chain put.
Vitalik,Only a little bit on chain factor of 100 scaling sharding another factor of 100 scaling 100 times 100.
Interviewer,Factor of 10 000 you know hundreds of thousands of transactions a second and like you know.
Vitalik,There's your scalability okay so you choose scalability you can do a large number of transactions very.
Interviewer,Quickly and uh the cost of doing those transactions much lower you wrote that uh in the long term zka.
Vitalik,Roll-ups are going to win in terms of layer 2 technology specifically you wrote.
Interviewer,In general my own view is that the in the short term optimistic roll ups as you were saying.
Vitalik,Are likely to win out of general purpose evm computation and zk roll ups are likely to win.
Interviewer,Out for simple payments uh exchange in other application specific use cases just as you were saying but in the.
Vitalik,Medium to long term zk roll ups will win out in all use cases as zk snark technology improves.
Interviewer,Why do you think uh zk roll ups are going to win the big picture battle over layer 2.
Vitalik,Technologies so i think zk roll ups like once you accept that the technology works are.
Interviewer,Just like conceptually simpler and they have nicer properties the reason is that they do not have this.
Vitalik,Concept of a challenge game right like as i mentioned in an optimistic roll-up the way that.
Interviewer,You ensure that the results are correct is that you let one person submit and like they just.
Vitalik,Submit with no proof they just say here's what i think the result is and then if someone else disagrees they.
Interviewer,Make their own submission and then if you have two disagreeing submissions then you actually publish it on chain.
Vitalik,And you see who's right but for this to work like you need to actually wait for someone to disagree.
Interviewer,Right so like for example if i have an asset inside of an optimistic roll-up and i wants to withdraw it then i.
Vitalik,Actually have to wait a week to withdraw it because like if the uh a block that contains my.
Interviewer,Withdrawal turns out to be invalid then there needs to be space for someone to disagree with it.
Vitalik,Right whereas with a ck roll up like you don't need time for disagreement because you just have a proof right as soon as.
Interviewer,The block is submitted there's a proof and you know it's correct so disagreements.
Vitalik,Especially in the long term or sparse uh then uh then then you don't want to do the.
Interviewer,Optimistic the the game theoretic thing you know you want to do the zk stock right the z.
Vitalik,Case stuff is just like you can in a ck roll up you can withdraw immediately.
Interviewer,Um you don't have to like worry about the economics of proving as much there's just like fewer issues um the.
Vitalik,Reason why ck roll-ups are not winning everywhere today is because you know zeke's darks is still a crazy new.
Interviewer,Technology right like this is something that 10 years ago you know it existed only in.
Vitalik,Theory and there was none in practice um then you know eight years ago people were just getting excited about it in.
Interviewer,Bitcoin conferences for the first time um like four years starting four years ago.
Vitalik,Or three and a half years ago even that was the first time you were able to make any zika snark based anything on.
Interviewer,Ethereum and then people started making them and zk technology has only really become.
Vitalik,Efficient enough to do a lot of things within the past maybe one and a half years so it's.
Interviewer,It's new technology it's crazy technology it's admittedly scary technology.
Vitalik,If you want to learn more i also have an article about this on vitality.ca it's actually really really good.
Interviewer,Most of your writing uh it's it goes it's technical but it's accessible i highly.
Vitalik,Highly recommend to check out vitalik's articles and blogs whatever whatever you call them.
Interviewer,Yeah it's brilliant summary of the work actually uh ethereum documentation period is really good i think that's.
Vitalik,Somewhat crowdsourced that documentation is really really accessible and brilliant.
Interviewer,Uh but let me ask about sort of other approaches to layer two like side chains so the one popular one.
Vitalik,Is polygon what are your thoughts about polygon which is a layer two.
Interviewer,Network is it positive is it negative for ethereum is it both does it have a future.
Vitalik,Which is its own chain but it's using a theory it's like based on ethereum essentially.
Interviewer,Or maybe you can describe what it is um so i think there is a really big and important difference in security models.
Vitalik,Between roll-ups and side-chains which is basically that roll-ups inherit from the security of ethereum right so.
Interviewer,Like if i have coins inside of bloopering or optimism or arbitrarium um or zk sync.
Vitalik,Um then even if everyone else in the world who is participating in these ecosystems so like hates me and though.
Interviewer,And wants to steal my money i can still personally make sure that you know no matter what.
Vitalik,Happens i get them i get my money out it might be a bit expensive for me to get my money out and i have to do.
Interviewer,Transactions like on the main chain but i'll be able to do it whereas in polygon which is a side chain and so instead of.
Vitalik,Being secured by ethereum it's also in part secured by its own.
Interviewer,Um a proof of state consensus with its own token so if 70 of the whole or even 51.
Vitalik,Of the holders of polygon tokens wanted to take my money in polygon they can right so that's the pro.
Interviewer,And like to be fair like there aren't even like the the supply i don't think is even that.
Vitalik,Widely distributed right so like potentially you could you could this idea 51.
Interviewer,Of the token holders coming together and stealing everything like it's it's not impossible right uh where does.
Vitalik,The scaling of polygon come from like why is it able to process much more transactions.
Interviewer,Than the ethereum main chain what's the idea there i think.
Vitalik,In part like i imagine i'm not sure exactly what its capacity level is but like i imagine it has a higher capacity.
Interviewer,Because it's a bit more willing to take centralization trade-offs.
Vitalik,And then another thing is that like if the ethereum ecosystem like even if it did not do that right if.
Interviewer,You think about an ethereum ecosystem hypothetically scaling with side chains then.
Vitalik,You know you would have 100 copies of polygon and you know they would each have their own tokens they would each.
Interviewer,Have their own chins and so even if each one of those chains was only as scalable as ethereum.
Vitalik,You know you know you could still like the total sum of them would still be 100 times more than ethereum.
Interviewer,Okay um the now the thing that i want to say in polygons favor just to be very fair to them like i i i really you know.
Vitalik,I i definitely really you know respect the work that they're doing so you know start with the um.
Interviewer,A bit with that word of uh not criticism caution right like it's um that they made this.
Vitalik,Kind of deliberate trade-off for very pragmatic reasons which is that the ethereum ecosystem needs to scale.
Interviewer,Now and there are applications that want to do something now and you know if there aren't ethereum.
Vitalik,Friendly options for them then like they're not going to just wait peacefully and do nothing for 12 months.
Interviewer,You know they're going to go to you know either binance smart chain or you know.
Vitalik,One of some other system or potentially something that just has totally no alignment with ethereum.
Interviewer,Values whatsoever um but whereas you know with paul with polygon like.
Vitalik,The best thing that you can say in polygons favor and against optimism is that you know optimism is not live and.
Interviewer,Polygonal is life right like it just takes more work to create a system that has.
Vitalik,These extra roll-ups uh security features and so polygon just said we're gonna be.
Interviewer,The system that makes the pragmatic tradeoff we're gonna go you know functionality first and then.
Vitalik,You know we can talk about adding back the security later so i've talked to them and like in.
Interviewer,Principle i think they're very you know open to the idea of like adding more.
Vitalik,More security and at least becoming more uh becoming a roll up or at least you know.
Interviewer,Adding a polygon chain let's say roll up at some point in the future.
Vitalik,Which is definitely something i think they yeah you know absolutely should follow through one.
Interviewer,But like the fact that like they exist now and so you know applications can kind of bootstrap now.
Vitalik,On a chain that you know even though it's security isn't perfect at least it exists and people can go use it um and.
Interviewer,Then over time you know the chain matures as the applications mature like units.
Vitalik,I think of a very reasonable strategy and i'm definitely really happy that they're part of the.
Interviewer,Ecosystem yeah it's kind of interesting the history of cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,Has this um tension of really good ideas that are hard to implement so they take longer to implement.
Interviewer,And ideas that are not as good but are faster to implement this is like the story of like.
Vitalik,You have like javascript that basically took over the world because it was quick to implement within.
Interviewer,10 days and then like later kept fixing itself i i don't know what to make of that sort.
Vitalik,Of from an engineering perspective i'm more and more becoming comfortable and accepting the fact that our whole.
Interviewer,World will run a technology that's not as good as it could have been just because the crappy solution is.
Vitalik,Faster to implement and it sticks what do you make of that tension i think the.
Interviewer,Compromise that we've been taking within ethereum is like when we have to take the crappy.
Vitalik,Solution we look for crappy solutions that are forward compatible with becoming good over time.
Interviewer,Right like when you build the the quick and dirty thing like you you would still already have ideas in.
Vitalik,Your head about you know what the the more complete thing with all the security features.
Interviewer,Added on would look like right even if it requires a hard fork um yes like even so you know like for.
Vitalik,Example we're sharding right like well yeah i think it's likely that the first version of.
Interviewer,Chardonnay that comes out like is not going to have you know zk snarks and data availability sampling for example.
Vitalik,But we know what these technologies are we feel like we you know have wrapped our heads around.
Interviewer,Them and so we know how to build a system where we can put all the pieces in place.
Vitalik,So that it becomes very easy to bolt those components on in the future uh so like if you do things that way.
Interviewer,Right then at the beginning you can have your system that has the functionality but.
Vitalik,Say has less security or like less sustainability or less of something else but then over time like it's designed in.
Interviewer,Such a way that it has this easy on on-ramp to adding those things right and if you don't think explicitly.
Vitalik,About like being future compatible then you do often end up with a a quick and dirty solution that backs you into a.
Interviewer,Corner and then there are definitely cases where like i think the ethereum.
Vitalik,Ecosystem has suffered from that and we have had to like expand pretty significant effort.
Interviewer,On for example removing features that we didn't realize that we actually can't sustain like one.
Vitalik,Big example is just increasing the yeah the gas costs so like making some operations more expensive when they uh.
Interviewer,Because they should be expensive because they actually take a lot of time in the process.
Vitalik,And um so that's you know making a thing some things more expensive kind of like taking some functionality away.
Interviewer,Um so if you can like be cognizant of where you're likely going into the future and.
Vitalik,If you don't know like even be cognizant of both the most likely paths that you'll take in the future.
Interviewer,And coming like thinking about your road map and coming up with a road map where you know that like if you wants to do.
Vitalik,Either of those things then you have a clean path toward it that's probably the best kind of.
Interviewer,Practical way to get the best of both worlds that we have okay let's talk about this uh wonderful.
Vitalik,Process of merging okay so there's the main net.
Interviewer,Which is the ethereum 1.0 chain or the ch what should we say the chain that uses.
Vitalik,Proof of work as a consensus mechanism and then there is uh what is it called the the beacon chain.
Interviewer,That uses the uh the proof of stake mechanism and i believe the.
Vitalik,Beacon has been deployed successfully is is working so that was in december 2020 there's a.
Interviewer,Bunch of questions around that that's fascinating as well but i think the most fascinating question is.
Vitalik,Um it's about merging those two when do the two chains one that's proof of work.
Interviewer,One that's proof of stake merge and what are the most difficult parts of this process right so i guess.
Vitalik,You've said right the way that we if i set up this proof of stake transition is that at first.
Interviewer,The proof of stake chain just launches on its own right and this is the thing that happened.
Vitalik,In december and the proof of stake chain has been running for close to six months uh.
Interviewer,Now um i mean by the time people watch this it might actually be six months um and but it isn't actually coming to.
Vitalik,Consensus on anything except for itself right so the idea behind that is to just give.
Interviewer,The proof of stake chain time to mature time for people to build the ecosystem around it time to make sure.
Vitalik,That there aren't any bugs um and just like prove to the community that you know proof of stake actually is.
Interviewer,Real and it's and a full transition is realistic because you know the thing that you're.
Vitalik,Transitioning to already exists and already works and then at some point in the future.
Interviewer,You have this event called the merge where you basically take the activity that's being done.
Vitalik,Inside of the proof of work chain and you actually move it over into the proof of stake chain so you get rid of.
Interviewer,The proof of work side completely uh so the way that the merge will work is um and it's definitely gone.
Vitalik,Through a few different iterations like the the earlier versions of this actually required more work for users.
Interviewer,And more work for clients it was much more like oh there's this new chain there's this.
Vitalik,Old chain and then everyone has to like migrate from the old chain to the new chain and then at.
Interviewer,Some point we'll forget about the old chin the new version is designed to be.
Vitalik,Much more seamless for users right so basically what actually happens is that the old chain basically becomes.
Interviewer,Embedded inside the new chain right so at starting from the merge transition block.
Vitalik,Every proof of stake chain block is going to contain a block of the what what we consider now to what we.
Interviewer,Consider to be the ethereum chain today but we'll call it the execution chain and then at the same time.
Vitalik,To create one of these blocks you're not going to need proof of work anymore right so basically at the same time you.
Interviewer,Would both get rid of the proof of work requirements for one of these blocks to be valid.
Vitalik,But instead you require these blocks to be embedded inside of the proof of stake blocks right so.
Interviewer,You basically have like a chain inside a chain and this is you know from an.
Vitalik,Architecture perspective it's you know you might think it's a little bit sub-optimal but it actually has some.
Interviewer,Nice properties and makes it easier to kind of think about the consensus and think about.
Vitalik,The what we call the execution layer like transactions and contracts kind of separately.
Interviewer,And upgrade them separately um and it also just means that the upgrade process is extremely seamless right.
Vitalik,Because from the point of view of a client that's following the chain you basically.
Interviewer,Have to up update nothing right you're still following.
Vitalik,The same chain and follows the same rules except instead of checking proof of work you'll switch to.
Interviewer,Checking that these blocks are embedded inside of blocks of the proof statute so there'll be this merge block that.
Vitalik,Will mark this transition and over time i guess the the new chain will contain the full.
Interviewer,Record of all the transactions that's ever happened on the previous chain on the old chain so like maybe i'm.
Vitalik,Asking a dumb question here but in in this process is the new chain going to have.
Interviewer,All the information of the past transactions the new chain is not going to hold.
Vitalik,Information from what happened in the ethereum chain before the merge right so like ethereum clients of the um.
Interviewer,That um people are going to use like around the time of the merchants soon after the merge.
Vitalik,They're probably just going to sync you know like and check the proof of work chain.
Interviewer,Up to the merge and then they're going to check the proof of stake chain but at some point in the future i think people.
Vitalik,Will just stop bothering checking the proof of work before the merge got it so that old history information.
Interviewer,Is not important for the future or like if you're operating actively on the.
Vitalik,On the new chain that history is not important to you it's not impo let's see so it's not.
Interviewer,Strictly important for um app for just like in any like smart contract or just like.
Vitalik,Applications that run on the blockchain it can be important to users and it can be important for some applications.
Interviewer,But we're basically saying that like maintaining and serving that is not going to be simultaneously the.
Vitalik,Responsibility of every ethereum node if you want that information there can be separate protocols for backing it up.
Interviewer,And like these other protocols actually exist right like there's something called the graph.
Vitalik,Which is doing some history retrieval potentially you can just take that entire chain and stick it on bit torrent.
Interviewer,Like there's lots of ways to like archive it and create kind of customized search.
Vitalik,Protocols for it so what's your sense why so there's a python 2 in python 3 and it took 4.
Interviewer,Ever for people to switch what's your sense why this merge has been taking longer than.
Vitalik,Perhaps was expected i think the biggest reason is just you know we've been.
Interviewer,Underestimating the technical complexity there's a lot of technical complexity in making a successful proof of stake chain.
Vitalik,There's a lot of technical complexity in actually figuring out the transition process.
Interviewer,There's so that's bigger than social complexity so it's uh the technical complexity you would say is the bigger.
Vitalik,Reason for the any delays than the social complexity i i actually think so i and i.
Interviewer,I think we've been very fortunate to not have too much social complexity around the merge.
Vitalik,So not much drama no um i think the the biggest part of the reason is just because we have been talking about proof.
Interviewer,Of stake in charting as being part of the road map since um almost the very beginning of the project.
Vitalik,Right like the very first proof-of-stake blog post does from january 2014 which was you know um.
Interviewer,Two months after the project started and like maybe even a day after the announcement.
Vitalik,Um so you know it was proof of stake was not something that we uh kind of put on any on anybody by surprise.
Interviewer,And then when the dow fork happened and you know the people on the edc side split off.
Vitalik,I think it also just happens that a lot of the people that were not willing to stomach the dow fork and then join the.
Interviewer,Etc side they were the more bitcoiny types and the more bitcoiny types do also tends to.
Vitalik,Like like proof of work more and so like that also sort of ended up you know sort of.
Interviewer,Like purifying the communities on both sides i guess so ethereum classic is not switching to.
Vitalik,Proof of stake and you know they're happy with their setup and.
Interviewer,By the time that uh you know it came through the beacon chain launching ends and now i think the community is.
Vitalik,There's very strongly in favor of the proof of stake switch but let me ask the question that no.
Interviewer,Engineer wants to hear which is uh the question of timeline when do you think the merge.
Vitalik,Will happen do you have a sense it might happen this year dear sense it might be pushed towards.
Interviewer,Next year 2022 um or uh or even beyond um i think early 2022 was like the most.
Vitalik,Realistic there's i think there's definitely still like an optimistic case of it happening.
Interviewer,This year but like the realistic thing to count on is definitely the early part of.
Vitalik,Very early part of next year is there specific things that stand out to you that are.
Interviewer,Like do they'll make you feel good about progress if you see it happening um so the thing.
Vitalik,That we had last month is that we had this online hackathon called rayonism where.
Interviewer,Basically a bunch of uh the different uh client developers that are going to be part of the transition.
Vitalik,Like hacks together some test nets of the post-merge ethereum chain so these were only test nets of what.
Interviewer,Would happen after the merge they were not test nets of the transition itself so the thing that people are working on.
Vitalik,Now actually is the transition um so having a full specification of both the.
Interviewer,Transition and post transition i mean we have specifications now but like in a realistic way.
Vitalik,Though probably needs to have a couple of changes and have things that continue to be ironed out.
Interviewer,And then have a yet test net that does both the transition and the post transition and then like.
Vitalik,Once you have a test network then you just have to do a lot of testing and audit it um and then.
Interviewer,You know do some runs on not just a specialized test network but on say an existing test network like a rob center.
Vitalik,Rinkeby that ethereum people already significantly use and if it works then.
Interviewer,You can deploy the transition on mainnet just as a quick comment because this is fascinating in august of.
Vitalik,Last year there was this uh medalla i believe it's pronounced madasha it's a.
Interviewer,South american subway station i forget where but spell with two l's.
Vitalik,Yeah yeah because that's you know that's how spanish works right like the two else have uh.
Interviewer,Dasha yeah okay cool anyway but i read about it in uh middle of august august 14th there.
Vitalik,Was an incident on that test net um what how does this process work like what do you learn from.
Interviewer,Those kinds of incidents when stuff goes wrong in the test process um i think uh that.
Vitalik,Incidence was that there was a consensus failure of some kindness i remember um.
Interviewer,Basically just different clients interpreting things in different ways and then one of them getting kicked off.
Vitalik,The network and then it ended up taking a while to actually like.
Interviewer,Get everyone to get back online like a big part of the reason why it took weeks to resolve right is because.
Vitalik,It's on a test network like the coins are valueless and so there's not really this big push of any kind for.
Interviewer,People to actually you know going down with a new client so they can start participating again.
Vitalik,And so you know it definitely took a while until the chain started finalizing again um.
Interviewer,But and then also like there was i think another round of just not finalizing in october.
Vitalik,As i remember um that i mean there were definitely things that we learned like there were.
Interviewer,A lot of things especially that client developers just learned about like optimization.
Vitalik,And how to build their clients in a way that they can process things efficiently um there's a lot that we.
Interviewer,Learned from just like seeing the full life cycle of what happens when more than a third of the validators go.
Vitalik,Offline and then finalization stops and then that kind of weird unusual state of the chain.
Interviewer,Continues for a while and then eventually everyone who is not participating just.
Vitalik,Gets enough of their stake like we don't use the word swash we use the word weak for this but like basically also burned.
Interviewer,Um until you know the people who are participating go back up to two thirds and then the chain goes back to.
Vitalik,Finalizing so just seeing all of those edge cases play out live i think actually helped a.
Interviewer,Lot and probably helped to really contribute to making us feel better about midnight i.
Vitalik,Mean there's also an incident just recently in april 24th of 2021 where uh.
Interviewer,This was on beacon i guess there was a bug discovered in the software client prism.
Vitalik,That prevented roughly 70 percent of validators on the network from producing blocks i mean maybe you.
Interviewer,Can comment on what happened but broadly like the big picture what kind of stuff.
Vitalik,Are you worried about in terms of problems that might arise we're talking about small bugs i were.
Interviewer,Talking about like emergent social unexpected social bugs you know what are the things.
Vitalik,That worry about the future of ethereum that you want to make sure you construct.
Interviewer,Mechanisms that prevent those things from happening so one of the lucky things there was.
Vitalik,That this particular bug only prevented proposals of blocks it did not prevent attestations.
Interviewer,Right so at the stations is just a mechanism for voting on blocks and it's the attestations that are.
Vitalik,Actually responsible for the chain finalizing so like coming to this more permanent agreement on blocks right.
Interviewer,So the chain was actually quite stable all the way through um the i think the thing that we.
Vitalik,Generally learned from these experience experiences.
Interviewer,Is just how valuable it is to have the some multi-client network right so this is one of these areas.
Vitalik,Where i think ethereum distinguishes itself from like bitcoin for example right that in ethereum we don't have.
Interviewer,One single client that that everyone um just runs right there's multiple implementations of.
Vitalik,The protocol and these multiple implementations they're they all process and verify the blocks that each.
Interviewer,Other can you know verify right so they all speak the same language.
Vitalik,Now sometimes when there's a bug they disagree right and when two clients disagree because of a.
Interviewer,Bug we call this a consensus failure and consensus failures are pretty serious right and when.
Vitalik,You have um clients monoculture like bitcoin does then like it's more rare to have.
Interviewer,Consensus failures do you still have them actually bitcoin had a consensus failure between two different versions.
Vitalik,Of the same client back in 2013 um but they're less likely to happen but the interesting thing is that the.
Interviewer,Multi-client architecture has actually i think saved ethereum much more than it's heard it.
Vitalik,So even in this most recent incidents right like prism was not producing blocks but all the other clients were.
Interviewer,Still producing blocks um there's four others right yes it's a prism.
Vitalik,Nimbus teku and the white house um and then also ethereum back in 2016 had this fun.
Interviewer,Event that we call the shanghai dos attacks uh they're called that because uh.
Vitalik,The attacks started like right on the first day of a of our annual conference at defcon that.
Interviewer,Happens to be in shanghai that year so what happened like basically was that someone came up with a way to create.
Vitalik,Blocks that were very slow for one clients to process but not the other client.
Interviewer,So at that time there were basically two ethereum clients there were they were called geth and parity.
Vitalik,Um right now i think the top three ones are gath nethermind and baso um but.
Interviewer,What happened as a result of us having two clients is that the attacker was just.
Vitalik,Not able to come up with blocks that both clients were like uh completely failing at processing.
Interviewer,And so like a lot of the miners and a lot of network participants they just kept on switching between the two.
Vitalik,Implementations depending on which one worked and that actually really helped the.
Interviewer,The chain i kind of survived through that month of attacks as the attacker just like kept on.
Vitalik,Hammering at our system and identifying all of the weaknesses and just like forcing our clients to do.
Interviewer,This you know rapid sprint of just like optimizing the hell out of everything and make sure.
Vitalik,There aren't any of those uh dust blocks or uh and dust bugs remaining um so that was.
Interviewer,Another example and then like as a counterpoint as a counter example so.
Vitalik,Like something that also shows the point from the other side um bitcoin had this bug in 2010 right.
Interviewer,The balance overflow bug basically someone created a transaction that had two.
Vitalik,Outputs and those outputs had were both of a few billion bitcoin so like about two to the power.
Interviewer,Of 63 satoshis and then if you add those numbers together you you go above to the power.
Vitalik,Of 64. and of course you know computers like once you go above to the power of 64 you.
Interviewer,Wrap around and so the bitcoin nodes thought that there was enough money to pay for the.
Vitalik,Transaction because it was asking for let's say like a billion satoshis or something but actually it was asking for.
Interviewer,To the power of 64 plus a billion and so you know the attacker just managed to create like.
Vitalik,Billions of bitcoin out of thin air and this was not only discovered and fixed after something like 12 hours.
Interviewer,Um but you know if there had been like if bitcoin had been a multiple implementation system.
Vitalik,Then what would have almost certainly happened is like one of the clients would have.
Interviewer,Bugged out but the other clients would have probably you know actually had a check.
Vitalik,For that right and so there would have been a consensus failure but at least that would have.
Interviewer,Um like alerted everyone that there is a problem very quickly and it also would have given.
Vitalik,Everyone just like obvious social permission to go and you know pick which whichever one of the.
Interviewer,Chains is correct and solve the problem um so like that's i think a big learning that we've had.
Vitalik,From multiple of our experiences in the ethereum ecosystem just like.
Interviewer,Validating this multi-client model you know to be fair it's a model that we get criticized for a lot right like.
Vitalik,Bitcoin people talk about you know the risk of consensus failures that this creates.
Interviewer,Um vc types are like well you know isn't it expensive and wasteful to funds three software teams where you could just be.
Vitalik,Making you know one quote focused effort you know they love the word focused and like you know.
Interviewer,Ethereum is not that but it's amazing despite not being that yeah um the.
Vitalik,Basically yes so that was interesting and and then you know there have definitely been other.
Interviewer,Learnings as well just from like seeing the chain live and you know seeing what actually is the.
Vitalik,Staking experience like what are the actual incentives for all the different participants um.
Interviewer,So i definitely feel like we're gaining a lot from this sort of one year of uh trial running the chain before we.
Vitalik,Actually make all of ethereum depend on it let me ask uh perhaps a strange question.
Interviewer,But uh you know proponents of bitcoin will say uh things like bitcoin fixes everything.
Vitalik,So why do we need ethereum uh versus like bitcoin plus lightning network for scalability.
Interviewer,Uh and then using bitcoin for with this proof of work for security so in this kind of um.
Vitalik,It is perhaps sort of a strange question but it's a high-level question why do we need another technology.
Interviewer,Yes there's a bunch of nice features but like doesn't bitcoin fix everything already.
Vitalik,So and the thing that always attracted me about.
Interviewer,Bitcoin is you know these values of you know decentralization creating these open provisional systems that anyone can.
Vitalik,Participate in and that aren't just going to flop over and die if whoever created them gets.
Interviewer,Bored and like no that are resistance to like whoever runs them breaking the rules and all of these.
Vitalik,Things right and i think that pretty strongly that these principles are.
Interviewer,Like really valid in importance to much more things than just money right like bitcoin is.
Vitalik,Uh the blockchain for money and ethereum is uh built from the start as a general.
Interviewer,Purpose blockchain right it's you know there is ether the asset on ethereum but then you can also make.
Vitalik,You know decentralized financial things what we call d5 today um you know you can make like ens the.
Interviewer,Decentralized domain name system um you can put make prediction markets on it.
Vitalik,You can make totally non-financial systems that just like keep track of whether or not.
Interviewer,Some certificate was signed or whether or not some like cryptographic key got revoked.
Vitalik,There's this big long list of like just interesting things that you could use about blockchains to do.
Interviewer,Right like basically they are sort of the missing piece that um where without them the kinds of.
Vitalik,Things that a decentralized computer network can do is very limited and once you have them you know a lot of.
Interviewer,Those limitations end up going away uh and so ethereum was like always from the.
Vitalik,Beginning about that right it's about like hey this isn't just money this is there's so.
Interviewer,Much more that you could do if you could just go ahead and make any infrastructure.
Vitalik,Or you know digital institution or dao or whatever you want to call it where you the kind of the base layer of.
Interviewer,The logic is just executed in this open and transparent way where everyone can see what's going on or you know if you.
Vitalik,Like your zero knowledge proofs at least everyone can see proofs that prove to you that.
Interviewer,What's going on follows the rules um and you don't need to like just constantly keep trusting.
Vitalik,Centralized actors and hence the smart contracts exactly as being a sort of a core technology as.
Interviewer,Part of ethereum yes exactly smart contracts the computer programs that are running on ethereum.
Vitalik,They are like the core of what makes ethereum general purpose yeah um so i think like i do think that.
Interviewer,You know there's a lot more that wrong with the world than just money right like i'm not one of.
Vitalik,These people who thinks that you know if you get rid of fiat currency and you replace it with cryptocurrency.
Interviewer,Then suddenly wars are going to go away right because like first of all um you know like.
Vitalik,Senoraj revenue is only a small portion of government revenue right it's like what.
Interviewer,Five ten percent something like that second of all like if you are the sort of um this is one of.
Vitalik,The things i don't even get about their philosophy like let's say you're the sort of person who.
Interviewer,Is a like an extreme and very distrusting libertarian and you think that these governments are terrible.
Vitalik,Right like we we know today that governments find a combination of you know things like welfare and things.
Interviewer,Like you know the military that you know goes and like bombs people in afghanistan right and.
Vitalik,The so the question you have to ask is like okay you um with your new um you know.
Interviewer,Magic newfangled cyber currency that takes over the world take away the government's ability to.
Vitalik,Have seniors revenue and so you reduce the government's revenue by 10 if the government is that evil which.
Interviewer,Portion of its um expenses is it going to take that 10 from is it gonna stop the bombing people.
Vitalik,In afghanistan or is it going to cut welfare if you think it's the first you have a.
Interviewer,Very optimistic view of the government right so that's i guess my perspective on like why the.
Vitalik,Whole um you know we're going to save the world and create and.
Interviewer,Uh create peace by like denying governments the right to stealth taxation kind of perspective doesn't.
Vitalik,Really make much sense for me and i do think that there is real value that comes from a.
Interviewer,Decentralized and open currency like just the fact that there is a financial infrastructure that anyone in the world.
Vitalik,Can you know go ahead and use right like it's.
Interviewer,And that's something that can easily be a big boon for people right there's a lot of places.
Vitalik,Where the uh currency and is much less stable than the dollar and you know these people like they don't.
Interviewer,Like well if they use bitcoin their only option is to get big ones right which you know are also pretty.
Vitalik,Volatile um if they use ethereum then you know they can get ether but then they can.
Interviewer,Also get stable coins right and you might think that you know oh you're not being ideologically pure.
Vitalik,Now you're giving them stable coins which are mirroring dollars and obviously dollars are going to collapse.
Interviewer,Too but the reality is that delvers are vastly more stable than the venezuelan.
Vitalik,Bolivar so like there are really like meaningful and beneficial.
Interviewer,Things that you can give to people by create having a global and open financial system.
Vitalik,But i think if you want to actually do that like you have to have much more than just a currency right.
Interviewer,And then if you want to go beyond financial things then you know you have to.
Vitalik,Obviously have much more than a currency and then you know you also have to actually.
Interviewer,Actually take scalability seriously because the non-financial applications like nobody's going to pay five dollars.
Vitalik,A transaction for them can we return to dogs sure no no no no no no no no the other one's.
Interviewer,Categorically forbidden get categorical is there any cryptocurrency based on cats actually i i think there are like.
Vitalik,Was there was cat coin there was neon coin for some reason they just didn't catch.
Interviewer,On as much as the dog coins did okay so let's talk about dogecoin and elon musk.
Vitalik,Elon said that quote ideally doge speeds up block time 10x increases block size 10x and drops.
Interviewer,Fee 100x then it wins hands down end quote you said in the blog post partially responding to.
Vitalik,That that there are subtle technical reasons why this is not possible.
Interviewer,To this elon said that you quote fear the doge uh so let's talk about this.
Vitalik,What are the technical uh hurdles for dogecoin that prevent it from becoming one of the primary.
Interviewer,Cryptocurrencies of the world and do you in fact fear the doge i definitely feel.
Vitalik,Obligated to correct the record i definitely do not fear the dosh okay no i love the.
Interviewer,Dosh um i actually visited the doge in japan a few years back it's uh.
Vitalik,She's an amazing dog he's still alive wait the original doge yeah oh wow um.
Interviewer,So you know we accept doge every every year for our annual def con conferences.
Vitalik,Um so and i definitely you know don't think ethereum is opposed to dot coins i mean.
Interviewer,Like i kind of wants to feel like you know ethereum is at least a little bit in spirit itself a dog coin and then you.
Vitalik,Know as i'm as i mentioned you know i love doge i bought i bought a bunch of doughs i still hold.
Interviewer,Some a bunch of dosh the on the scalability question like the challenge basically is like.
Vitalik,The limits uh scalability as a and the trade-offs with centralization right like if you just.
Interviewer,Increase the parameters without doing anything else then it just becomes more and more difficult for people to.
Vitalik,Validate the chain and uh just becomes more likely that the chain becomes centralized and.
Interviewer,Becomes vulnerable to all kinds of capture so does it need like some of the layer two technologies that.
Vitalik,We've been talking about um i mean i personally think that you know if doge wants to.
Interviewer,Somehow bridge to ethereum and then people can trade doge thousands of times a second inside of.
Vitalik,Loopering then you know that would be amazing i mean if they want to just like take zika roll up style technology and.
Interviewer,Just have thousands of transactions a second on their own chain then that's um you know that would be a great outcome.
Vitalik,As well so what is there ways for ethereum and uh dogecoin to work together so.
Interviewer,Okay so there's a power behind a person like elon musk pushing the development of a cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,Is there ways to leverage that power and that momentum to improve ethereum to improve some of.
Interviewer,The sort of uh cryptocurrencies that are already technologically advanced and.
Vitalik,Pushing forward that kind of technology i i definitely think there is room for you know that uh there's that meme.
Interviewer,Of doge like taking over that's the door i've seen it is there a way to ride that.
Vitalik,Uh that storm that wave of the doge has taken over i think if we could have a secure doshu ethereum bridge then.
Interviewer,You know that would be amazing and then when ethereum gets its scalability any scalability thing that works for.
Vitalik,Ethereum assets you would be able to also like trade wrapped doors with extremely low.
Interviewer,Transaction fees and very high speed as well is there uh is there precedence for.
Vitalik,Building secure bridges between cryptocurrencies is that i mean how difficult is this.
Interviewer,Kind of task that's it's definitely something that's in its infancy infancy there definitely have been some.
Vitalik,Cross-chain interaction things that have been done before um so one the earliest is probably the.
Interviewer,Concept of merge mining right when a chain just makes its entire proof-of-work algorithm dependent on.
Vitalik,The proof-of-work algorithm of another chain and so i think famous doshcoin actually merged mines.
Interviewer,The litecoin which is i think in retrospect it's not looking like a very good choice because now.
Vitalik,Deutsche coin is bigger than litecoin um but um you know if there's potentially some.
Interviewer,Way for dogecoin to merge mine within ethereum proof of stake ins of some kinds then.
Vitalik,Like that could be an interesting alternative um if so that's one type of like chain.
Interviewer,Interaction as far as like bridges like one chain reading another chain.
Vitalik,Early in ethereum's history there was this project called btc relay it's a smart contract on ethereum that.
Interviewer,Just verifies bitcoin blocks i think people stopped really caring about and maintaining it because there.
Vitalik,Just weren't enough applications that were actually interested in using it at the time and.
Interviewer,The transaction fees got too high to actually maintain it so i i think if we want to make a btc.
Vitalik,Relay 2.0 and that becomes cheaper because you know it uses snarks or something like.
Interviewer,That then you probably could but and maybe now is the time when you actually.
Vitalik,Like can do that sort of one-way verification but the one challenge though is that.
Interviewer,If he wants to have a bridge that allows you to move assets between chins then you don't just need one-way.
Vitalik,Verification you need two-way verification right and ethereum can verify anything.
Interviewer,Because ethereum smart contracts can just run arbitrary code but if you want bitcoin to be able to do.
Vitalik,Things based on what happens in ethereum lands then like bitcoin would have to basically.
Interviewer,Well they can do everything with soft forks because like you know that that's their religion.
Vitalik,But no they'll they'll do it that way and if doge wants to make a fork where that allow allows for.
Interviewer,Like two-way transferability with the ethereum then you know.
Vitalik,They could i mean i i think that would be a lovely collaboration to make if there's interest i think there might.
Interviewer,Actually even be some multi-sig funds that have some um some funding it's just a bounty for.
Vitalik,Someone to make a bridge between the two yeah could you maybe try to psychoanalyze elon musk for a brief.
Interviewer,Second so what are your thoughts about tesla and elon musk's journey through the.
Vitalik,Cryptocurrency world so first with bitcoin and then with doshcoin.
Interviewer,So acquiring a large acquiring holding a large amount of bitcoin and i believe at least considering the.
Vitalik,Acquiring and holding a large amount of doshcoin positives negatives what do you think the future.
Interviewer,For tesla and spacex in the cryptocurrency space looks like do you think they'll consider ethereum.
Vitalik,Um i'm i'm sure that if you know that they stay in the the cryptocurrency ecosystem at all.
Interviewer,Then they have to at some point yeah you know bitcoin number one dogecoin number i mean you know come on.
Vitalik,It deserves to be number three and then or number two and then ethereum can be whatever that uh.
Interviewer,Whatever that other number is um but um the if ethereum only becomes a dot coin somehow maybe change the logo to.
Vitalik,Incorporate a dog of some sort almost like doors like.
Interviewer,Uh sneaking behind oh that would be that would be fascinating before the emerge happened.
Vitalik,And i think like elon you definitely i think you would make a mistake if you were to kind of.
Interviewer,Ascribe too much like sophisticated malevolent ins or or any intel like deep intentionality to.
Vitalik,The whole process i think like he's just a human being and he likes dogs just like i like dogs yeah.
Interviewer,Right that is i think that is literally the reasoning behind the whole dose dogecoin.
Vitalik,Thing there is some aspect to which i mean the guy.
Interviewer,Helped launch a car into space right like you could you could ask like what is the purpose of that.
Vitalik,I think the purpose of that is uh fun there i think he truly is more and more especially.
Interviewer,Lately embodying the whole idea that the most the most entertaining outcome is the.
Vitalik,Most likely and he's fully embracing the most entertaining outcome and in many ways dogecoin is the most.
Interviewer,Entertaining cryptocurrency as cryptocurrency becomes more and more impactful in the world.
Vitalik,People are getting more and more serious about it and so he's selecting the cryptocurrency that is the most the.
Interviewer,Least serious and the most fun and there's something to that uh like coupling.
Vitalik,Fun with uh technological sophistication um and somehow figuring out a way to do that absolutely you do that well you.
Interviewer,Know i i i want the world to be fun i think the world being fun is great.
Vitalik,Okay let me ask about a couple other technologies if it's okay sure what are your thoughts about chain.
Interviewer,Link and hybrid smart contracts that utilize off-chain external data sources and i think it's definitely necessary.
Vitalik,For smart contracts so that you do a lot of things to use off chain data of some kind right like.
Interviewer,If you want to have a stable coin you need a price oracle so you know what price you're targeting.
Vitalik,Um if he wants to have some fancy you know crop insurance gadget like i always you know.
Interviewer,I think ether risk has been doing a lot of uh good work with that in i think it was either kenya or sri lanka.
Vitalik,Or both like they're they're making a lot of good progress and some in some of those.
Interviewer,Places like you need some kind of oracle to tell you you know did it actually rain.
Vitalik,In this particular area um if he wants to have like assets that mirror other financial assets you need.
Interviewer,An oracle if you want to have a prediction market you need an oracle and.
Vitalik,So projects that provide oracles are definitely really important and there are definitely different kinds of use.
Interviewer,Cases like augur is more about you know events and the auger oracle is designed like i.
Vitalik,Think differently from chain link right like chain link emphasizes the whole you know like we.
Interviewer,Have a fast automated thing that just like gives you data quickly um whereas auger.
Vitalik,Is more you know we don't give a crap about speed um and look we don't need to give a crap.
Interviewer,About speed because if you want to get your money out on a prediction market that where.
Vitalik,In reality it's resolved you can probably just sell your coins for 99 cents anyway.
Interviewer,Um so i mean i i think i mean the chain link is definitely like taking a yeah good and the important.
Vitalik,Part of the oracle design space and i'm definitely happy that there is like that project taking the task on and at.
Interviewer,The same time i do think that you know their their frog army on twitter can get a bit intense sometimes.
Vitalik,But like frog army is there is there a way to incorporate sort of oracle network type.
Interviewer,Of ideas into ethereum i personally would prefer the ethereum base layer.
Vitalik,Like stay away from trying to provide too much functionality because.
Interviewer,I think once you have the ethereum base layer making a claim about like say the us.
Vitalik,Dollar to ethereum price like and at some sense you're basically saying that like ethereum as a.
Interviewer,Base platform starts making what could be geopolitical statements right right like for example you know.
Vitalik,Imagine if there was some you know civil war in the us split up and you had two currencies that both.
Interviewer,Claims to be the us dollar well you know ethereum would would have to pick one for the sake of everyone who's.
Vitalik,Already using that oracle so you know does that mean that the blockchain would be.
Interviewer,Like taking a position in this big megapolitical debate so i think like for the just those kinds.
Vitalik,Of reasons i would personally like prefer um ethereum itself to be more of this sort.
Interviewer,Of pure platform that just analyzes the transactions and just.
Vitalik,Mathematically using uh deterministic consensus rules and then if you need the oracles that can be all your tears.
Interviewer,I think ethereum benefits from not trying to do everything at layer one and having this like very robust way or.
Vitalik,Two ecosystem where you have all these projects doing interesting things yeah focus on the basic technology avoid.
Interviewer,The politics gotcha let me ask a bit of a human question charles hoskinson someone you've worked.
Vitalik,With in the early days of ethereum there appears to my outsider view.
Interviewer,To have been a bit of a falling out is there a positive inspiring human story to be told about.
Vitalik,Why you two parted ways i kind of wants to let the various books about ethereum speak for themselves.
Interviewer,Um but you know you know if i feel like you know since that time i think you know charles has.
Vitalik,Clearly progressed and then he matured in a lot of ways and i mean people who follow charles.
Interviewer,Closely have definitely told me that you know like 2021 charles is very different from.
Vitalik,2014 charles and i'm sure 2021 vitalik is much different from 2014 metallic as well i'm.
Interviewer,Kind of interested how the 2030 and 2040 vitalik and charles look like as well.
Vitalik,Oh interesting like the progression of the humans is this going to be one of those things.
Interviewer,Where like everyone comes full circle and then 2030 vitalik and charles are best friends.
Vitalik,Yeah i mean not necessarily best friends but some kind of uh um are able to reminisce in ways that.
Interviewer,Is um that puts some of the tension of the past behind i think.
Vitalik,Such things are possible um i think you know people definitely absolutely have a right to.
Interviewer,And uh and they should strive to just constantly change and reinvent themselves.
Vitalik,Um is there something you could say about your thoughts about the cardano project.
Interviewer,That charles hoskinson leads they've worked on some interesting ideas that mirror some of the ideas in ethereum.
Vitalik,Proof of stake working on smart contracts and all those kinds of things.
Interviewer,Is there something again positive inspiring that you could say are they a competitor is it.
Vitalik,Complementary technology it's uh and there's definitely interesting ideas in there i mean i do.
Interviewer,Think cardano takes a bit of a different approach than ethereum and that you know they really.
Vitalik,Emphasize having these big academic proofs for everything whereas ethereum tends to be more okay with.
Interviewer,Heuristic arguments and in part because it's just trying to do more faster um but you know there's definitely very.
Vitalik,Interesting things that come out of you know iohk research and so is there can you comment on that kind of idea i.
Interviewer,As sort of uh having a foot in research enjoy charles's kind of emphasis on papers.
Vitalik,And like deep academic rigor is there what's the role of deep research rigor in the world of.
Interviewer,Cryptocurrency interesting i'm actually the sort of person who thinks deep rigor is.
Vitalik,Overrated um the reason why i think deep rigor is overrated is because i think like.
Interviewer,The the in terms of like why protocols fail i think the number of failures or that.
Vitalik,Are outside the model is even more important is like bigger and more important than.
Interviewer,The failures that are inside the model right so if you take selfish mining for example like the.
Vitalik,The that original discovery from 2013 that showed how um bitcoin does.
Interviewer,Like even if it has a 50 uh fault tolerance assuming everyone's honest it only has a.
Vitalik,Yeah you know zero to 33 percent fault tolerance depending on your network model.
Interviewer,If you assume uh rational actors and like to me that wasn't that was a great example of like an outside the model.
Vitalik,Failure right because traditional consensus research just up until.
Interviewer,Or before the blockchain days did not think about like incentivization much right like.
Vitalik,There was a little bit of thought about incentivization there's like a couple of papers on the byzantine.
Interviewer,Altruist rational model but it wasn't that deep it was mostly operating under the assumption that.
Vitalik,You know this we're going to make consensus between 15 participants and these are institutions.
Interviewer,And if something goes wrong then you know if it was we can figure out whether or not it was deliberate offline.
Vitalik,And if they did something evil we consume them whereas in the crypto world you can't do.
Interviewer,That right and so like that whole discovery basically arose just because.
Vitalik,Like you know the model of uh traditional uh consensus research just like didn't cover those possibilities.
Interviewer,And then like once you go out of the model those other issues do exist.
Vitalik,Right um so but then at the same time like there definitely are um protocols that.
Interviewer,Turn out to be insecu that do have failures inside the model like this reminds me of at the.
Vitalik,Time when i think i found a bug in a proposed uh consensus implementation from either.
Interviewer,Bitshares or eos this happened around the end of 2017. um so that was definitely inside the model.
Vitalik,Because like they had a very clear idea of what they were trying to achieve they had a very clear.
Interviewer,Description and like there's a very clear mathematical um argument for why the.
Vitalik,Description doesn't lead to what they're trying to achieve but ultimately what you're trying to achieve can never.
Interviewer,Be fully like described in formal language right like i think this is the big discovery of you.
Vitalik,Know the ai safety people for example right like just having a a specification of what.
Interviewer,You want is an insanely hard problem and like the more powerful the optimizer that you're giving the instructions to.
Vitalik,The more you have to be careful and and so you know i think there are kind of these two sides.
Interviewer,And then the other thing is that a lot like a lot of the academic approach ends up.
Vitalik,Like basically optimizing for other people inside of the academic system and it doesn't really optimize for like.
Interviewer,Curious outsiders whereas like i personally met like totally optimized for curious outsiders or at least i feel.
Vitalik,Like i strive to so i guess like that's my case for why i like tends to behave in ways that you.
Interviewer,Know occasionally traditional academic types criticize as being reckless um.
Vitalik,But i you know on the other hand you know there's i mean there's definitely real benefits.
Interviewer,That come from like just taking us a rigorous approach especially when you.
Vitalik,Know you know what the thing that ex like you know what the specification is of what you're trying to get.
Interviewer,And like you're trying to kind of improve your way or provide protocols that actually.
Vitalik,Provide that like you know exactly what you're looking for i feel like realistically.
Interviewer,You probably wants to do both kinds of analysis and like sometimes even want to do both.
Vitalik,Kinds of analysis and stages right like you have you want to do more quick and dirty.
Interviewer,Things and even want public feedback on the quick and dirty stuff and then later on you formalize it more.
Vitalik,And then you get more feedback um like in general i guess i feel like the norms of research in.
Interviewer,The future like the internet has just changed so much there's no way that it's not going.
Vitalik,And you know it's it's even changed like collaboration structures and like the patterns in which we work with each.
Interviewer,Other there's no way that the correct structure for.
Vitalik,Club collaborative research is the same as what it was 15 years ago but like what combination of these.
Interviewer,Existing components and of new ideas it is like that's something that's you know totally legitimate to kind of fight it.
Vitalik,Out and i think it's great that there's different ecosystems that have different attitudes to things.
Interviewer,Like you know i think you know there's a big possibility that you know things that the ethereum.
Vitalik,Ways that the ethereum ecosystem approaches some problems is totally wrong and if there's other ecosystems or.
Interviewer,Different principles and they can do well that's something that we can learn from in the spirit of the depth.
Vitalik,First search can you comment on ai safety and some people are really worried about the.
Interviewer,Existential risks of artificial intelligence is there something you could say that's.
Vitalik,Uh hopeful about how we avoid in the same kind of line of uh reasoning about.
Interviewer,Creating formal models versus kind of looking outside the model into what the real world actually is like is.
Vitalik,There some lessons from that we can take and map onto the ai safety world where the potentials of the technology whether.
Interviewer,It's in autonomous uh weapon systems or just the paperclip problem.
Vitalik,Uh that we can avoid ai destroying the world so my impression is actually that like.
Interviewer,This is more of a kind of faraway impression and it could be wrong that it might even be.
Vitalik,That one of the challenges that ai is not formal enough like because ai does is very like.
Interviewer,Practitioner oriented right like it's all about like hey i found a couple of hacks and look i ran.
Vitalik,Them and look you know they seem to improve classification accuracy from you know 0.684 to 0.773.
Interviewer,Uh so a lot of the time like there just isn't actual science behind like why this hack.
Vitalik,Works and why this uh other hack doesn't work you just sort of like trial and error your way into it.
Interviewer,Um but and i could see how that approach works but at the same time like that approach is.
Vitalik,Not good for legibility for example it's not good for like understanding what the heck is actually going on.
Interviewer,Like how these kinds of systems conceivably might fail like there's even you know a debate on.
Vitalik,Like can you take gpt3 like things and just scale them up and their intelligence will continue to.
Interviewer,Improve or is there just like some types of reasoning that they're fundamentally bad at and like.
Vitalik,Yeah they're not gonna get good at it no matter how much you like scale this exact same approach and add more.
Interviewer,Hardware to it so having like thinking about what's going on more.
Vitalik,Explicitly i mean my understanding is that a big part of a ai safety research is trying to do.
Interviewer,That sort of stuff right and formalize yeah formalize try to improve just ai legibility.
Vitalik,Like trying to understand you know if the ai makes some classification so we can actually see.
Interviewer,Like what happens and what's going on in the middle right whereas with crypto or with traditional.
Vitalik,Cryptography you know it's like very much not well okay i mean.
Interviewer,I shouldn't quite say that it's traditional cryptography is this interesting mix of being very formal and.
Vitalik,Being very informal because it's very formal with given these security assumptions prove that.
Interviewer,The protocol works under these security assumptions the places where it's very informal is.
Vitalik,Like well how do we even know that there isn't an efficient algorithm for factoring numbers.
Interviewer,Yeah we kind of tried it for 40 years and then you know so far no one's found anything.
Vitalik,Better than the gen general number field sieve and like okay fine we'll just assume it's fine.
Interviewer,You know how do we know you can't i'm gonna find uh the the discrete log between two elliptic curve points like.
Vitalik,No did it a couple of decades no one's found anything faster than like baby step giant step.
Interviewer,Stuff uh so that's and like there's there's a there's definitely uh.
Vitalik,Ways in which that approach really makes sense right because at least you can concentrate your analysis.
Interviewer,On a small number of building blocks and like you know you do have some intuitive reasoning about those building blocks.
Vitalik,But like at least there's a small number of building blocks and lots of people are looking at.
Interviewer,Them and then everything else just sort of gets formally built on top and you.
Vitalik,Actually can like mathematically reduce the security of big thanks to building blocks right.
Interviewer,Like you can have mathematical proofs that say you know if you make a zk snark of a yes.
Vitalik,Statement when in reality that statement is false then you can use that to like.
Interviewer,Extract information out of elliptic curves that you know it completely breaks the problem or something like.
Vitalik,That uh so so zika is an example where formalism is.
Interviewer,Is beneficial absolutely yeah and so maybe you can have the same kind of stuff in the ai safety within.
Vitalik,Within ai systems that you can get get a hold of some kind of aspect of the systems that you can.
Interviewer,Control right provably and then in blockchains and cryptocurrency i.
Vitalik,Think the one area where consensus like mechanisms is still more an art than a science.
Interviewer,Is that these aren't just like technological systems they're crypto economic systems right and they make.
Vitalik,Assumptions about people and which assumptions you can make about people is not something that you can.
Interviewer,Prove with math right the even just the basic 51 percent exact people are honest can you trust.
Vitalik,The 51 percent um if you can't trust the 51 can you trust the other 49.
Interviewer,To be able to coordinate on like making their own fork what will happen to coin prices like how.
Vitalik,Do people as human beings react to these events like there's all of these assumptions.
Interviewer,Yeah but you know at the same time look if you can write down the assumptions then you can like do.
Vitalik,Formal things with them i almost forgot to ask you about one of the most exciting aspects.
Interviewer,Of ethereum i mean it's non-technical i think it's a it's a societal it's social which is.
Vitalik,Nfts so what do you think what do you think about the explosion of nfts in the recent.
Interviewer,Months especially in the art world and beyond and what does the future look like so this is maybe.
Vitalik,The social impact on the world on on the individual creators of all kinds like is that something you've actually.
Interviewer,Expected to see and ft's having this kind of impact and beyond.
Vitalik,What do you think will happen in the uh in the digital space with nfts in virtual reality and gaming all those.
Interviewer,Kinds of things i was definitely surprised by like nfts in particular.
Vitalik,Like i even actually i think might be on record somewhere on some tech conference panel like they were asking you know.
Interviewer,Um it was one of those overrated or underrated sections and asked about nfts and i thought.
Vitalik,And i said like hey i think nfts are overrated yeah and you know in retrospect that turned out to be quite.
Interviewer,Wrong i might think like i guess i just personally.
Vitalik,Can't really relate to this concept of like spending a lot of money on a thing like there's nothing you know there's no.
Interviewer,Queer kind of understanding of why that thing would uh.
Vitalik,Maintain its value right um uniqueness of a thing having value right exactly like that's.
Interviewer,Like i definitely am like cannot really understand you know the psychology behind.
Vitalik,Like buying you know paying two hundred thousand dollars for original art painting i'd be like you know.
Interviewer,If i had a mansion just like give me photocopies of everything you can hang three photocopies of the.
Vitalik,The mona lisa section well i would even have the mona lisa i think i'd probably just like have some.
Interviewer,Nyan cats or something that's one thing where mathematics or theoretical computer science cannot.
Vitalik,Formalize why the heck nfts are valuable exactly but the thing that uh that.
Interviewer,Makes me very happy about the space now that it has happened is that i mean this gets back to the.
Vitalik,Conversation that we had at the beginning right like i'm interested in this concept of.
Interviewer,Decentralized public goods funding right like i want things that are good and valuable to as.
Vitalik,Much as possible also be things that can't you know economically sustain the people who produce them.
Interviewer,Right because if you don't have that then either the public goods just don't get produced at all.
Vitalik,Or people make like centralized versions that have some of the properties and try to be substitutes but actually just like.
Interviewer,Concentrate control in a very small group right and you know both of those things are.
Vitalik,Not very nice uh so the nice thing about nfts would be well if you're an artist and you can.
Interviewer,Just mint nfts and this is a source of revenue it's like great that's another stream of revenue for.
Vitalik,You know creative work that often does still get get underfunded and that's amazing.
Interviewer,Okay let me ask you a weird question we talk about craig wright a little bit but a lot of people write to me one of two.
Vitalik,Emails one email uh is uh calling any coin outside of bitcoin a uh.
Interviewer,A scam and then the other email is saying my my favorite coin is the best coin.
Vitalik,It's going to save the world whatever that coin is uh and so i sit back and i look at i.
Interviewer,Have no idea i i trust i tried to figure out like the humans that i trust in this space.
Vitalik,Just but basic human qualities but do you think some coins are scams uh.
Interviewer,Do you think some coins maybe another way to ask it are scammier than other coins.
Vitalik,How are people that are looking outside of the space where there's all these cryptocurrencies supposed to.
Interviewer,Figure out what is a scam and not or how to use the right kind of language when talking.
Vitalik,About them because there's the harshness of the language from the bitcoin maximalist.
Interviewer,That doesn't just say everything is a scam including ethereum.
Vitalik,Uh but they use terms like coin that says it's not only a scam it's like a waste of time i mean.
Interviewer,Every word you can use they say that that's very harsh and then some people are just apply the.
Vitalik,Word scam a lit much much more conservatively and just refer to coins that legitimately are trying to.
Interviewer,Scam people out of their money as scams so what do we do with this word scam should.
Vitalik,It ever be applied to coins and uh is it a a binary thing or is it the gray area.
Interviewer,Hmm it's i think it's definitely a gray area like there's definitely things that are really in actual scams.
Vitalik,Like i mean bit connects would be one example of uh something that's away on the scam.
Interviewer,Spectrum did you see their 2017 promotional video by the way big connect yeah hey what's up what's up.
Vitalik,What's up piconic this is it was this three minute 48 second video that was just of this.
Interviewer,Guy making this totally crazy rant and it was at some.
Vitalik,Conference in vietnam where they were of course like trying to convince a whole bunch of people to buy.
Interviewer,This coin and they had this claims about how it would go to go up in value yeah that was definitely like the peak.
Vitalik,Of these pure completely scammy coins and you know that was definitely really terrible and.
Interviewer,I actually i feel like we have less despite cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger.
Vitalik,We actually have quite a bit less of that now but then of course you know there's this bit this.
Interviewer,Spectrum of things that are not completely scams um and then things that are.
Vitalik,Not scams and that are technically totally fine projects but where the their community is just incredibly.
Interviewer,Sketchy and then all the way to you know things that are where the community is nice but.
Vitalik,Maybe the project is just fundamentally incapable of achieving what it's trying to do or.
Interviewer,In the community doesn't realize and then you know a really good project right so.
Vitalik,Like if you want to go a step like well if that's 100 scam then like you.
Interviewer,Know what would i call like say 80 scam well like bitcoin sv is one example this is a craig wright's.
Vitalik,Fork of bitcoin like theoretically it's a blockchain right it's a fork of bitcoin.
Interviewer,It has some you know 500 12 megabyte blocks if you really wanted to you could use.
Vitalik,The blockchain you know it's uh it satisfies the property is that you know you can send transactions.
Interviewer,Onto it you can probably um you know use it as as a backup to store your files if you.
Vitalik,Really wanted to just because it has it has so much space you know it might fail but.
Interviewer,Like it's the but at the same time like you know as they basically said like craig wright is.
Vitalik,A scammer and like half the you know community is just totally bad insane so the humans.
Interviewer,The humans of a particular cryptocurrency is what makes for a scam and not like the humans at the top that.
Vitalik,Have a voice right guiding the community yeah like i think you know in the case of bsv like.
Interviewer,The humans they yeah make just completely wrong and just obviously.
Vitalik,Wrong claims about like what bsv is capable of accomplishing and like what it concealed we could.
Interviewer,Accomplish and like there's just a lot of aspects of it that make it feel like a money grab so that's one example.
Vitalik,And then you know you gotta go a bit further and then you know you have like the trons of the world.
Interviewer,And like you know that's a platform you know you can use it you can do you can do stuff on it but at the same.
Vitalik,Time like you know they did plagiarize the ipfs white paper and then.
Interviewer,You know they had so the scammy qualities yeah see the thing that throws me off a lot this makes it very.
Vitalik,Difficult for me is that most coins but the ones that make me feel like are.
Interviewer,Scammy have a large community of people that are super positive about it like and they'll write to me.
Vitalik,Now that said sort of on the flip side of that bitcoin people are also very positive.
Interviewer,There's some sense and the the reason i was having like squinty eyes looking at.
Vitalik,Bitcoin for quite a while is like why is everyone so.
Interviewer,Positive i was getting total cult vibes like like the ideas are not grounded in truth but are grounded in an obsession.
Vitalik,Of like when you can artificially conjure up a truth which is why i was a little bit like worried about bitcoin.
Interviewer,I think i've learned a lot since then to where like um i i learned to separate the community.
Vitalik,From the ideas and i think bitcoin is a revolutionary idea on on many fronts.
Interviewer,But still a community that's like dogmatically excited about something whatever that is makes me skeptical.
Vitalik,Maybe it's just like my upbringing but when everybody's really excited about something.
Interviewer,It makes me um it makes me skeptical and it make but it also makes me difficult to decide what is this cam or.
Vitalik,Not because some of the most exciting ideas in this world have a community of people who are.
Interviewer,Excited about it right because it's um i don't know i think space exploration is super exciting.
Vitalik,And uh and there's people i know a lot of them that are exceptionally excited about space.
Interviewer,Exploration does that mean it's a scam no no uh so i don't know what to do with that and.
Vitalik,So mostly i just try to stay away i suppose but it's it's unfortunate because i'm sure there's a lot of.
Interviewer,Exciting technologies in that space i mean like in the case of bitcoin like i would definitely not call.
Vitalik,Bitcoin as cam right right i would not i would i would also not call litecoin a scam.
Interviewer,There's people who call litecoin scam because they just like say oh look you know.
Vitalik,It has no fundamental use case and the concept of being silver to bitcoin bitcoin's gold is just like stupid and.
Interviewer,You know it's a bit like millie bitcoin is the silver to bitcoin's gold um but.
Vitalik,The at the same time like if you have these people who are just you know they do seem to earnestly.
Interviewer,Believe this and uh like they are trying to just like make like one be a litecoin as as best.
Vitalik,As they can then like that's to me that's enough for it to not be a scam yeah um.
Interviewer,That's and then so yeah i think the the biggest gray area is definitely between.
Vitalik,Like projects that are earnest and but you know they have just all sorts of these.
Interviewer,Like different combinations of flawed qualities to them yeah yeah i mean the the ones that legitimately is.
Vitalik,A scam is when the key people that are at the head of the project are intentionally lying.
Interviewer,And i think as long as their the intent is to try to do good in the world even if the.
Vitalik,Your actual implementation of that is flawed i think that's not a scam it could be flawed ideas it could be.
Interviewer,Wrong ideas but it's not a scam i'm learning to navigate this space yeah it's definitely a very.
Vitalik,Challenging space to navigate i mean you know it's uh in some ways a reflection of the world.
Interviewer,At large yeah and as we've said maybe offline that.
Vitalik,The fact that money is evolved makes it a little bit more complicated that um you know lives can be ruined.
Interviewer,By um by by the choice of technologies that are taking on so it makes it more real more painful more.
Vitalik,Like elevated the impact of this like imagine like mac versus pc wars if everyone who.
Interviewer,Bought a macbook had 10 apple shares inside of it and everyone who had a pc had 10 microsoft.
Vitalik,Shares inside of it and then you had you know the the elites who bought.
Interviewer,Their macs back in 1983 and that they spent 500 dead and now they have 40 million.
Vitalik,Dollars and they just think that they're these gurus who understands the future of finance and geopolitics and.
Interviewer,They make theories about why you know apple is the one that's going to bring freedom to the world.
Vitalik,And uh window is like you know secretly allied with the access of evil oh that's brilliant so yes this is so.
Interviewer,Brilliant so i think the right way to think about this is we map the some of the cryptocurrency battles.
Vitalik,Into the space of like emacs versus vim or apple versus pc if there was some stock that came along.
Interviewer,With each each implementation of the you know uh each pc each mac that's fascinating.
Vitalik,This is 100 correct 100 correct because then that really energizes the armies of people debating.
Interviewer,Over this in a way that something without money does not okay let me ask you about something.
Vitalik,Really fascinating that you are also excited about which is longevity anti-aging you have donated money to the.
Interviewer,Sense foundation so you have an interest in this whole space of lifespan research what's your vision here or what do you.
Vitalik,Hope to see in anti-aging and longevity research i think i hope to see the concept of.
Interviewer,What of us seeing your parents and grandparents die just slowly disappear from the public consciousness as an.
Vitalik,Experience that happens over the course of uh half a century the same way that getting lost in.
Interviewer,A city slowly disappeared over the public consciousness over the last 50 now that we have smartphones.
Vitalik,The thing you have from nick bostrom the essay uh pinned in your twitter is argues that.
Interviewer,Essentially that you know death is almost unethical like the fact that we don't do something about this thing that.
Vitalik,Um this in the essays is a dragon that keeps.
Interviewer,Like murdering everybody around us including our parents and grandparents is uh.
Vitalik,Like the fact that we don't try to do something aggressively about that dragon is uh doesn't make any sense um.
Interviewer,So you think this is a battle worth fighting a battle for immortality or at least longevity.
Vitalik,I'd say absolutely and i'd say it's a battle where we're really have started over the last.
Interviewer,Five years in particular to see the first cracks of uh no humanities and me starting to make things that look.
Vitalik,Like they'll turn into victories do you uh do you think humans can eventually live forever.
Interviewer,And maybe as a side comment to that what technology do you think will enable that is a genetic modification.
Vitalik,Is it cloning is it uploading your mind define forever like are we talking a thousand years a million.
Interviewer,10 to the 14 10 to the 45 well let's start as i tweeted today eventually everything.
Vitalik,Uh the universe will be filled with supermassive black holes so that that forever maybe like.
Interviewer,Backtracking to work we'll have we'll have 10 the 16 years to figure it out yes.
Vitalik,Uh yeah maybe travel between um between the multiverse between the different universes the multiverse.
Interviewer,I mean but forever meaning like you know uh millennia um um i guess i definitely think that we can.
Vitalik,Get there i definitely think that it's the sort of thing that's going to take an insanely huge amount of.
Interviewer,Work and i definitely think it's the sort of thing where you know once we figure out the first.
Vitalik,Crop of problems and like people start living to 150 we'll just realize that there's like 10 other.
Interviewer,Problems that kill you half a slowly and will have to do more work but you know the good news is that this.
Vitalik,This is you know aubry's longevity escape velocity argument that if you get everyone to lift 250 now then.
Interviewer,You know you have half a century to fix all those other problems as well so yeah i'm optimistic for that reason i think.
Vitalik,Um it you definitely do not want to underestimate.
Interviewer,Uh human ingenuity especially over the long term but just to look at what happens to computers between you know.
Vitalik,The eniac in 1950 and where we are in 2020 right like that's a span of 70 years um so like you know.
Interviewer,Both of us i think with uh you know even just present-day technology and.
Vitalik,We have at least 70 more years to left so just like imagine what kind of sea change will happen in biomedicine.
Interviewer,During that time and the other thing that made me optimistic is that i actually.
Vitalik,Think covet has been this kind of event that's really a kind of pushed um biomedicine and especially like.
Interviewer,Activist approaches to biomedicine really into the public consciousness right like it basically.
Vitalik,It's put people into this mindset that you know wait but like you know it's not just like you know the.
Interviewer,Bits and tweets that are going to save the world you know the bio is actually like.
Vitalik,Super important and huge and um you know ultimately what's uh ending the ending covid basically you know is that.
Interviewer,The vaccines and the vaccines have just been you know amazing and uh if you can take that energy and.
Vitalik,Start and also like this uh i think philosophical attitude that i've noticed like i think.
Interviewer,The way that i would describe the philosophical attitude here this is going more depth first is that i.
Vitalik,Think the way that i kind of interpret part of what i would call late 20th century.
Interviewer,Ideology is that there is this mentality that you know nature is good and disruptions.
Vitalik,From nature are bad and generally you want to minimize disruptions from nature.
Interviewer,And like this exists everywhere in the political spectrum right so there's nature as in literal nature.
Vitalik,And my view is that like the right wing version of that is market sas nature right um markets as nature yeah like you.
Interviewer,Know they the way that that like that kind of philosophy talks about you know.
Vitalik,Markets and like the goal of not interfering with them like you know it's it is very kind of like nature styled.
Interviewer,And then of course you know the the conservative one which is like traditional culture that existed before.
Vitalik,The activists started controlling everything as also being a kind of nature.
Interviewer,Um but the 21st century attitude and like really covet you know has flipped a lot of minds because.
Vitalik,With kovid what's happened is that well no like it's not nature is not safe right the default is like.
Interviewer,You know untold and misery and suffering and tens of millions of people dying the only way out for us is through like.
Vitalik,Basically um human ingenuity and that frame of mind is one that's like much more friendly.
Interviewer,To one uh the this other um change of minds that i want to see which is like basically treating aging.
Vitalik,As an engineering problem right like the default is all 7.8 billion human beings that are currently.
Interviewer,On this earth are going to die and they're going to live their last decade of life in a.
Vitalik,Debilitating pain and the only way to stop that is human ingenuity.
Interviewer,And you know we don't we don't have that solution yet but you know if we work hard we will.
Vitalik,And more and more people on the biology side computational biology are basically converting the mess of the.
Interviewer,The human biology into an engineering problem and once that conversion is happening.
Vitalik,Looking at the the genetical the proteins all those kinds of things once that conversion.
Interviewer,Happens you can now apply the tools that we know how to solve engineering problems.
Vitalik,To solving it that way and then there's also the other version which is you know why do we romanticize this meat.
Interviewer,Vehicle that ultimately is just the thing that carries the brain maybe we can.
Vitalik,More and more convert ourselves into the digital realm this is where like neural link yeah i.
Interviewer,Have the brain computer interfaces and then achieve immortality in the space of information.
Vitalik,In the digital space versus the biology space that stuff's interesting too i agree again i think.
Interviewer,You know we we have enough resources and we should just try all the parallel tracks you know it's great that we have.
Vitalik,People just trying to make our bodies work it's great that we have people trying to.
Interviewer,Upload like or improve brain scanning it's also great that we have just like people improving cryonics so.
Vitalik,Like we could just like you know go to sleep in the freezer and um eventually.
Interviewer,Hopefully sometime in the future you know healthy is going to be able to wake up um all of this uh um you know you.
Vitalik,Know anyone who gets chronically frozen today will be able to wake up but you know.
Interviewer,That's all that's a bad right that's the last resort and then the other interesting thing about um the.
Vitalik,Like extreme uploading approach right is um like.
Interviewer,We're excited about space and one of the points that uh a lot of science or like hard science fiction types make.
Vitalik,Is that you know if you want to explore space that's a lot easier if you're not a human.
Interviewer,Right like one example of this is that you know in the context of humans we're talking.
Vitalik,About like oh we're going to be able to go to the moon oh we're going to be able to go to mars.
Interviewer,But there's this project called starshot i believe right that's basically trying to.
Vitalik,Send spacecraft to mini spacecrafts to alpha centauri and they literally believe that they're.
Interviewer,Going to be able to get spacecraft over to alpha centauri like four light years away by.
Vitalik,Like the 2060s no i mean by traveling close to the speed of light yeah exactly like.
Interviewer,So based the way it works is you know you have these light sails like you basically take the as a spacecraft and.
Vitalik,You shine a laser at it and the laser is insanely strong and quickly accelerated at.
Interviewer,100 g's no i think it was 10 000 gs um until it gets to 20 the speed of light and then you know it goes on your.
Vitalik,Merry way right so if you wants to be in um like personally explore the alpha.
Interviewer,Centauri system within like two centuries or once or one century.
Vitalik,Then you know being a robot is like by far the most practical way to do it because there's no way that a human.
Interviewer,Being can survive 10 000 years so it's it's definitely interesting long term but at the same time.
Vitalik,Like there's definitely a lot of like psychological hang-ups and a lot of like deep philosophy that we'll just have to.
Interviewer,Grapple with well i think to get there i think what it hangs on the.
Vitalik,Topic of whether we can convert consciousness into an engineering problem so like.
Interviewer,Is consciousness tied to our biology because the moment we can convert consciousness into a digital.
Vitalik,Form then we can send it with that light sale to office centauri until then.
Interviewer,A robot is not carrying anything except maybe some basic knowledge like wikipedia it's not carrying.
Vitalik,The flame of human consciousness i have high hopes for converting consciousness into.
Interviewer,Engineering problem in fact i think it's not as difficult as people think i'm i.
Vitalik,Agree with that i'm definitely in the camp that consciousness is a property of the algorithm and not a.
Interviewer,Property of brain structure um the other fun like the kinds of philosophical things we'd have to grab.
Vitalik,With grapple with is like once you upload yourself like you can hit control c you know like.
Interviewer,It would be wouldn't be lovely to have like 10 copies of fellow experience like we could just interview everyone so.
Vitalik,This is i mean this is i i have to ask this question it's a difficult one which.
Interviewer,I don't think he'll be wonderful first of all um sure so in the following way and this.
Vitalik,Has to do with immortality as well there's something about scarcity that creates.
Interviewer,Value or um there's a bunch of philosophers victor franco bernard williams ernest becker they.
Vitalik,Argue that death or the scarcity of life creates meaning.
Interviewer,And the reason we life is beautiful the reason so many moments of experience of.
Vitalik,Of love or delicious food all those things are made delicious because they're.
Interviewer,Finite because they end and because we don't have that many of them and there's a kind of worry that if we.
Vitalik,Extend the human lifespan if we achieve immortality or if we god forbid.
Interviewer,Clone me multiple times then you lose the richness of what it means.
Vitalik,To have this life to have this experience does that worry you at all do you think.
Interviewer,There's some aspect to which death does in fact give meaning to life i guess like.
Vitalik,The one historical parallel and like this might be a bit unfair is that you know.
Interviewer,There have been philosophers that said that have said things like you know war gives like meaning to human.
Vitalik,Collectives and the struggle for supremacy between you know nations and races as this.
Interviewer,Like big driver of progress that like that ensures that ever that everyone strives to be their best.
Vitalik,And um you know of course uh this viewpoint got into the head of a crazy austrian guy and 20 years later his.
Interviewer,Soldiers were shooting at my grandparents um so you know these days we don't.
Vitalik,Really have that but yet life still feels meaningful there's we've still found.
Interviewer,Other ways to uh or them like they're still uh striving for technological progress.
Vitalik,There's still um you know uh striving for self-improvement in general.
Interviewer,And it turns out that you know you don't actually need to have existential conflicts in order to.
Vitalik,In order to have that now maybe you need conflict but we have other kinds of conflicts right look we have you know.
Interviewer,Competition between businesses competition between political ideologies competition between projects.
Vitalik,And so you know these are like whatever what whatever the psychological needs are.
Interviewer,Like they're just our substitutes for it so i guess like yeah so if we uh i'm trying to say i i feel like once we.
Vitalik,Start living to to the age of uh 200 then like i'm just intuitively expecting that.
Interviewer,We'll see some like substitutes emerge in the same way yeah that.
Vitalik,Will will create conflicts of other sorts that lead to less human suffering than wars do like we'll just start.
Interviewer,Playing diablo four five six and because you die in video games so maybe we'll get.
Vitalik,Some of the inkling of scarcity through the activities we partake in as opposed to our own body dying.
Interviewer,I mean i feel shitty when i uh like you can i remember in diablo three you can play.
Vitalik,In hardcore mode where if you die in the game your character is dead maybe you will.
Interviewer,Get the the richness of like what that we currently get from life by having like.
Vitalik,Little artificial versions of ourselves that die interestingly enough as i've just like personally.
Interviewer,Spent more time in this world i've started realizing that you know there is a concept of like.
Vitalik,Real fight finiteness that still like exists and it might even still be a thing that provides meaning that doesn't.
Interviewer,Require anyone to actually die like for example like how many people from.
Vitalik,Middle school or even high school or yours like do you still talk to regularly.
Interviewer,I'm happy to be close friends with like four or five of them okay well like in my case the answer is zero for middle.
Vitalik,School and two for high school you're right right it dropped exactly it dropped.
Interviewer,Right and so like there's a lot of these just like relationships that end up being very finite.
Vitalik,Um a person changes their i feel like a person changes enough of their worldview after 25 years wasn't there even a study.
Interviewer,About this something like a person and themselves 25 years later about as different.
Vitalik,As like two different people or something like this um so you know like i mean just like you.
Interviewer,Can have conflict without bloodshed i think um you know you can you can have finiteness and even you.
Vitalik,Know the the necessary sorrows of uh finiteness that give meaning without.
Interviewer,Like literally any anyone having to end their life and hopefully if we do extend our life.
Vitalik,We'll figure out ways to extend the period of time where there's newer neuroplasticity yes to where we could.
Interviewer,Change our world views continually throughout that time so.
Vitalik,Have some of these different phases of life uh i thought it would be fun to hear you.
Interviewer,Speak a little russian  do you think there's uh so for people.
Vitalik,Who don't speak russian that uh vitalik said that there is um that there is something to the spirit of.
Interviewer,The people that are russian that are working in the cryptocurrency world that uh is a.
Vitalik,Little bit different and it and it's something that uh that connects to some kind of aspect of your.
Interviewer,Own self some kind of roots there it it it's it's kind of interesting do you think.
Vitalik,That there's um does it make you sad that there's these two different worlds.
Interviewer,That are uh sort of in part disconnected by language and i'm sure the same could be.
Vitalik,The case with china and other parts of the world or the language.
Interviewer,Slows the transmission of the beauty of the culture in a certain kind of way where you can't.
Vitalik,Truly collaborate like you can all speak english you're collaborating on maybe a technical level.
Interviewer,But you're not collaborating on the level of like some deep human connection do you see.
Vitalik,That being able to speak both languages there's definitely benefits i think to be able to like.
Interviewer,Speak multiple languages and like once you can right like you it you discover that like even your mindset changes.
Vitalik,While you're in speaking in one language versus the other like people have told me this like.
Interviewer,When i speak russian i sound more like i guess like to the point in pragmatic when i speak chinese i sound more cute.
Vitalik,When i speak english i'm something else um i guess.
Interviewer,There's definitely like a richness that you're missing if you're only like in one of these language bubbles.
Vitalik,But you know i guess the arguments on the other side would be that you know if.
Interviewer,Everyone spoke the same language then like there would just be one bubble right.
Vitalik,This is the challenge i think like there are actually benefits to having cultural diversity and you definitely.
Interviewer,Don't want the entire world to be too conformist yeah and well one of the interesting.
Vitalik,Things about crypto is that it's just a culture that actually like manages to like.
Interviewer,Somehow you know have its uniqueness and brazil and even preserve its independence from.
Vitalik,All of all of these surrounding countries despite being embedded in all of them.
Interviewer,So it uh spans outside the geographical boundaries and language in some ways does as well.
Vitalik,And then in the way these cultures these bubbles are created i mean they overlap in interesting ways it's almost.
Interviewer,Like a hierarchy and the same is the case with the crypto world there's uh you know there's communities.
Vitalik,Associated with these cryptocurrencies there's communities within those communities.
Interviewer,And it's yeah i mean i think like you know it's definitely sad whenever these groups are.
Vitalik,Are fighting each other um and like it's definitely good for them to like if people can cooperate more um.
Interviewer,But you know at the same time like just having like groups of people that have you know.
Vitalik,Different kinds of life experiences like there's definitely something benefit from that so let me ask one last.
Interviewer,Question i don't think i asked you last time the ridiculous question about the.
Vitalik,Meaning of life uh you know dostoevsky said beauty will save the world.
Interviewer,Some people believe money is a big part of happiness and you've turned first of all you've made a.
Vitalik,Lot of money you turned away a lot of money he turned away a lot of power.
Interviewer,So you're a fascinating person to ask what do you think is meaning to life the thing that i've realized with money.
Vitalik,As i uh have experienced both having a little of it and i'm having a lot of it.
Interviewer,Is that um the benefit of like you can get the most out of um money if you think of it not as.
Vitalik,Something that like lets you do and have more things but as something that lets you worry about.
Interviewer,Fewer things right like you know if you have you know if the your savings are just you know non-zero.
Vitalik,At all then you don't have to worry as much about losing your job and.
Interviewer,You know if you feel like you're you have a job that just like really conflicts with your values then.
Vitalik,Like if you have even six months saved up that just makes it easier for you to say bye-bye i'm going to do something.
Interviewer,Else if you have more money then you can .
Vitalik,You know not worry about like even what you're doing the am needing to be profitable at all um once.
Interviewer,You get more money then like you can you know choose transportation options and food options.
Vitalik,That just like have less hassle in your life and allow you to be lazier uh.
Interviewer,So if you like this aspect of just like reducing troubles.
Vitalik,And like opening up room for um other things i think is a big part of it like if you just if you.
Interviewer,Instead think of money as being like this positive or this thing that like gives you stuff.
Vitalik,And you try to derive meaning from the stuff i think that's uh.
Interviewer,Much more likely to be like a road to like basically squandering that opportunity.
Vitalik,So yeah and i guess my philosophy is on that is definitely more subtractive than added over there.
Interviewer,But once you have enough money that you don't have to worry about the money you're burdened with another question.
Vitalik,Which is of meaning and do you think there's meaning to it all or.
Interviewer,It seems like your own life you're trying to build cool stuff that alleviates some level of suffering in.
Vitalik,The world well i mean one way to think about it is like.
Interviewer,Think of think back to like how you thought about life when you were in school.
Vitalik,Right well in school this is interesting to think about right because in a lot of ways like it's just totally.
Interviewer,Outside of bounds of you know the kinds of systems that are like social systems that we live in as.
Vitalik,Um as adults or maybe not like maybe things like academia are intended to replicate parts of school.
Interviewer,Like first of all school is very totalitarian right like you know you have to follow the teacher.
Vitalik,The the teacher's instructions the bulk of your schedule is like forced to be in particular areas and you know you can.
Interviewer,Control um and they're real for you from you know leaving the grounds during this period.
Vitalik,This period of time um you know assign a lot of homework but at the same time also you know.
Interviewer,School is a bit of a bit of a post-scarcity utopia in that you just don't have to worry about.
Vitalik,Getting resources for yourself and you know we've both like lived through 12 years of that.
Interviewer,Right so you know like what does that say about us and i think like in one thing of aspect obviously is.
Vitalik,That in it does like there's definitely like an.
Interviewer,Easiness to living life if all of your decisions are made for you and one of the challenges of.
Vitalik,Adulthood i guess is moving to this uh world where like all your choices are much more self-directed and you just.
Interviewer,Have to like learn to live and deal with that um yeah dealing with the burden of freedom.
Vitalik,In some sense actually interesting and because uh i in some ways i feel like even my first.
Interviewer,Like five years of doing ethereum things uh yeah my life was not even all that.
Vitalik,Self-directed because for a lot of it was just you know responding to obligations right.
Interviewer,Like someone said oh you know come to speak at this event in korea okay you know come to speak of.
Vitalik,This thing in taiwan okay um oh like we need up for ethereum to launch we need.
Interviewer,Um you know this particular piece to be done and tested okay work on that right we know we need some uh um a proof.
Vitalik,Of stake algorithm work on that and the last year of uh coved life um like basically i was like.
Interviewer,Holed up in singapore for much of it right and it gave me a lot more alone time you know i had much less travel.
Vitalik,And that was definitely a very new and interesting experience for me would you characterize it by sadness.
Interviewer,Melancholy hope uh dreaming like innovative period like how would you characterize that alone time.
Vitalik,Sum of all five um definitely some self-discovery um i definitely did like take this uh.
Interviewer,Make this very deliberate decision that like okay i have this time and i'm going to like actually make.
Vitalik,Something meaningful out of it um so like one example of the things i did is i just like actually.
Interviewer,Started really listening to our um audiobooks and podcasts much more like just this year i basically kind of.
Vitalik,Discovered that the podcast space is real for the first time i guess like before that you know there would be.
Interviewer,Things that i would get interviewed for but yeah i was not really kind of like mentally.
Vitalik,Incorporated i did not mentally incorporate this um idea that like podcasts are a thing that.
Interviewer,You can go listen to and this year i did okay you know my friend uh.
Vitalik,Um carl lafourche one of the the optimism people uh recommended hardcore history to me.
Interviewer,And so i went ahead and just listens to all the hardcore histories uh but then after that.
Vitalik,Like yeah listen to like 10 lux speedmans and then a bunch of others says and.
Interviewer,After that i also got into um audiobooks um oh i listened to the entire um the rise and fall of the third reich the.
Vitalik,Whole thing 45 hours that that was fascinating so what else did you ask about because dana's gonna.
Interviewer,Love hearing this i'm gonna tell you do you have uh do you have a period of history whether it's dan or in general.
Vitalik,That you draw for your own life like kind of thinking about the world about human nature that you go to.
Interviewer,Is it world war ii is it uh wrath of the cons the injengus is it some other more ancient.
Vitalik,History is it world war one is there something that kind of echoes with you.
Interviewer,In the voice of dan or or anyone else that you connect to i feel like the 1930s and 40s are.
Vitalik,Fascinating because they force you to like really grapple with uh the question of like you know where does.
Interviewer,Evil come from right like the sort of mental puzzle that i've always had in my head.
Vitalik,Is like on the one hand um you know things like the holocaust happened but on the other hand if you just go and.
Interviewer,Like have a coffee with with uh people then like a hundred times out of a hundred everyone just seems so.
Vitalik,Nice yeah yeah so yeah exactly yeah like how do you.
Interviewer,Kind of reconcile the macro in the micro there right and that's the sort of thing that's very.
Vitalik,Difficult if you don't have um a lot of i guess the right kind of.
Interviewer,Personal experience like especially if your personal experience starts off being sheltered like it was.
Vitalik,For me right like i you know this i know the stereotype is that the nerds get bullied in school but like actually.
Interviewer,For me in my school experience was just being treated with kindness by everyone yeah.
Vitalik,And so that definitely made it harder to understand things i remember actually being pretty.
Interviewer,Blindsided when i started ethereum and then within six months there started being.
Vitalik,Fights over like who would get more shares if ethereum turned out to be a company and.
Interviewer,Then i suggested we should just make it be a non-profit and somehow that ended up upsetting people.
Vitalik,Um so so the fascinating thing for me is that like i've been you know.
Interviewer,Obviously reading and listening to the history and then at the same time just like.
Vitalik,Observing things happening in the crypto space and so one of my interesting.
Interviewer,Um like mental intuitions that i've gotten is that i think like most evil doesn't come out of greed.
Vitalik,It comes out of fear and like one example of this in ethereum lands right is um.
Interviewer,Like i think the part of ethereum history where i thought that the ethereum community was at its lowest and.
Vitalik,Even when i personally was at my lowest and if you go back to the dow fork in 2016 right.
Interviewer,So you know the dow hack happens and then we made this controversial decision to change the ethereum protocol.
Vitalik,Uh and we um you know then there was that ethereum classic split and.
Interviewer,As soon as that ethereum classic split um happened you know there was like a lot of anger.
Vitalik,Everywhere and there started there started especially being anger when.
Interviewer,The price of etc started like taking up right so this was the time when ether started off being 13 dollars and.
Vitalik,Then ethereum classic started at zero but then suddenly there was this one day when.
Interviewer,Like eath dropped to 12.5 etc went up to 0.5 and then they dropped more and people.
Vitalik,Were saying things like um you know oh this whole thing ethereum classic is just as like a psyop by.
Interviewer,You know the bitcoin community and just the wealthy bitcoiners trying to destroy ethereum.
Vitalik,And like in the back of my mind i knew that that wasn't entirely true like there were definitely were.
Interviewer,Bitcoiners but at the same time like i think blaming political like internal disa or.
Vitalik,Blaming disagreements on foreign interference right like this is the sort of thing that you know like.
Interviewer,Countries governments do all the time like it's a very convenient excuse right because.
Vitalik,It allows you to just like blame these things that are happening on the foreigners and.
Interviewer,Avoid like actually grappling with the facts that like well no actually you have people in your very own community.
Vitalik,Who just disagree with you and have a different belief and.
Interviewer,I think you know i feel like the ethereum community like during that time did not do a very good job of grappling.
Vitalik,With that and i feel like like i during that time did not do a very good job of grappling.
Interviewer,With that and so there was a lot of like blaming the bitcoiners there were also even.
Vitalik,A lot of people calling for us to use trademark one like basically sue exchanges.
Interviewer,And like try to prevent them from listing ethereum classic and like to me that was very unethical.
Vitalik,Right like this uh using like basically using the government as.
Interviewer,A weapon to uh try to attack the other cryptocurrency and like destroy it as like goes completely against them.
Vitalik,You know the ideals of freedom and you know like things that at least in theory were supposed to stand for um.
Interviewer,But you know like in that particular time like basically.
Vitalik,What was happening was that you know the etc price was rising and at the same time the th price was dropping in.
Interviewer,Lockstep and it really and there are a lot of bitcoin people basically saying this is.
Vitalik,The end of ethereum and i think a lot of people really were afraid that ethereum would be just like completely.
Interviewer,Destroyed as a result of this and so like that's where the anger came from exactly that's.
Vitalik,Yeah exactly it came from the fear and like that's what i like allowed people to rationalize like in.
Interviewer,Abandonment of principles that i think they would not have um accepted in other circumstances and.
Vitalik,I i definitely like to to some extent played along with this myself right and i do definitely.
Interviewer,Regret that to some extent uh well and i i definitely regret like the the excesses completely um but.
Vitalik,So that and then obviously you know bitcoin block size war similar sort of stuff happened uh.
Interviewer,So like that that insight was interesting um because like it does mentally make a lot of sense.
Vitalik,Right like when you're actually afraid that you know unless you act in some way that you know your entire world.
Interviewer,Is going to collapse like it's much easier to just rationalize you know forgetting your.
Vitalik,Principles and doing whatever you have to to just save the specific thing that you care.
Interviewer,About it feels like the right thing to do the the brave thing to do is in the face.
Vitalik,Of fear to still have compassion to still have love.
Interviewer,As opposed to hate so the the darkest moments the the toughest moments of human.
Vitalik,History are those where fear is everywhere and despite that like the way to get out of that.
Interviewer,Is uh is through love not giving into the fear and again that's the lesson that you draw.
Vitalik,From all those moments of history yeah well i i like you have in terms of those coffee and the kindness that.
Interviewer,People have it does seem that everybody has the capacity for evil and everybody has the.
Vitalik,Capacity for love and you just have to create mechanisms and incentives.
Interviewer,That uh prioritize the latter over the former vitalik you're one of the most.
Vitalik,Interesting people i've gotten a chance to talk to um thank you so much for talking i i.
Interviewer,Hope we get a chance to talk again i hope but i can at least be at some small part this would be awesome on a.
Vitalik,Podcast with you and dan carlin that would be an awesome conversation uh like thank you so much for doing.
Interviewer,So much incredible technical innovation that inspires the computer scientists uh the economist.
Vitalik,Inspires the world and what technology can do and now with longevity i do hope we live a a very long time.
Interviewer,And play diablo to make that long time fun thank you so much for talking today thank you to alex this was.
Vitalik,Great thanks for listening to this conversation with vitalik buterin and.
Interviewer,Thank you to athletic greens magic spoon indeed four sigmatic and better help check them.
Vitalik,Out in the description to support this podcast and now let me leave you with some words.
Interviewer,From nelson mandela when a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in.
Vitalik,He has no choice but to become an outlaw thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
Interviewer,"So you wrote the Etherum whitepaper a little over four years ago and Ethereum has been live now for about two and a half years and it's now a project worth about 90 billion dollars. What were your feelings, expectations, and vision when you first conceived with the project? And how has the reality of Ethereum compare to what you initially thought?"
Vitalik,"When I came up with the idea, I thought that the idea clearly made sense. And, the second thought I had is this is clearly the next logical step to take with blockchains. If we can go from blockchains to one application to blockchains with five applications to blockchains with built in general purpose programming languages. So, my next thought is why hasn't anyone done it yet? And, my response to that fact was, well it has to be because there is some kind of fatal flaw in the design. And basically something that as soon as I released a whitepaper, five really smart cryptographers would come in, email me and basically tell me why I'm completely stupid in even suggesting something like this. And, to my surprise, this just totally ended up not happening and a lot of the cryptographers I respected at the time actually sent emails saying that, you know, wow this is a great idea, I'm excited to be following the progress."
Interviewer,"Wait, just to go back to that, so when you thought that you would put this out there and then go back to university and stuff like that. What exactly were you envisioning? Why did you think that you wouldn't need to be involved in? How small did you think this would be? And I don't even know what you're picturing there or what you were picturing then?"
Vitalik,"The first version of Ethereum that I had conceptualized was actually much less ambitious than what I ended up coming up with a few months later. And, it's definitely not as ambitious as what I'm thinking about right now. I don't know if you're familiar with protocols like Mastercoin? These are protocols that existed back in 2013 where they're not their own independent blockchains. They're kind of meta protocols on top of another protocol. So the idea would be that you would run a nod of another blockchain. So it could be Bitcoin. In my case, it was Primecoin or something else and then you would also run this other node and this other node would just kind of tell you a different way of interpreting the transactions in the underlying blockchain. So it's kind of like embedded your language inside of another language."
Interviewer,"We were saying that Ethereum has continued to surprise you as you've gone along and it's turned out much different from your expectations. What are some of the other ways that it's differed as you've gone along? This is now, four years ago that you were talking about. I'm sure your vision of what it would be and how it's turned out has been quite different over this time period."
Vitalik,"Yeah. I would say just the sheer scale of attention, application usage, pretty much everything is a vastly bigger than I ever thought it would be. I would say that's on two fronts. Where the first front is in Ethereum's role inside of crypto. The second role is just the size of crypto itself, including bitcoin, including the various altcoins, including bitcoincash and so forth. I was definitely not expecting $15,000 prices. So that's one very big thing that I was surprised about. Another thing that I was surprised about is probably just the various set of specific challenges we ended up happening. Things like the various set of logistical issues of setting up the foundation or the DAO fork, dos attacks, scaling challenges. When I was thinking of Ethereum, I wasn't really thinking too deeply about a lot of that stuff. Overtime it's just, certain things ended up happening."
Interviewer,"One other thing I wanted to ask you about when we talk about initial vision versus reality. I did see a 2016 WIRED article that you talked about how blockchains will empower the little guy and also dis-empower the big guy. And there was a quote in the article, you said, ""And personally, I say screw the big guy. They have enough money already."" But, if I look at all the different things that Ethereum is doing. The Ethereum enterprise alliance counts companies like JP Morgan, BP, Microsoft as members. Why form an alliance like that, that would enable the big guy to use your technology? How do these kinds of companies figure into your vision for what Ethereum can bring about?"
Vitalik,"That's definitely a good question. I don't remember the exact context into which I made the quote. I do really think that blockchain's primary value is in empowering people that don't have access to basically, in part, finance, in part contracting ability, in part just the ability to make other people trust them and things like that already. As far as where big companies can fit in, I do think that they have a role and I do think the smart ones that take the first step and are willing to kind of play with the technology rather than rather than against it, can survive and even benefit from the whole process. One example I could give the very practically is if you look at something like Microsoft for example, you might notice that Microsoft's kind of roll and position in the space, just the tech space as a whole has really changed in the last 20 years. Where in the 1990's they were this kind of evil big, bad monopolists that was constantly suing people and constantly abusing its monoploy position in various ways. And, the open source free software, cultural Zeitgeist is basically that these people are the devil and Linux is going to come in and save us. Now I say this as a continued proud linux user, But, over the last few years it seems as though people emphasize the desktop proprietary side, much less because basically everything's moved over to the web."
Interviewer,"Well, I was going to ask you, here in the US, Vladimir Putin doesn't have the best reputation. And I wanted to ask why you met with him. So, do you also kind of count him in the same bucket is what you were just describing or why did you meet with him?"
Vitalik,"I think the meeting with him in particular was probably a bit over hyped, because it was basically, we ended up talking for maybe one or two minutes. I met him and I got to see his personality a bit and let him know that Ethereum and blockchain technologies and so-forth exist. And what we're up to. And he's like, ""OK, great. The Russian people are building cool tech to improve the economy."" And I think that inside of the Russian government in particular, there are kinds of people lower down who are more interested and there are people lower down who are less interested."
Interviewer,"Well, speaking of pushing things into good direction, you recently tweeted about how the market cap of all cryptos had reached more than half a trillion dollars. And I think now it's like around 700 billion. But you then you said, ""Oh, I don't know if the companies have earned it."" And, you gave some examples, for instance, you were wondering how many un-banked people have been banked or how many Venezuelans were protected from hyperinflation. And here on the other hand, when we look at the actual things people are using crypto for, it's things like initial coin offerings and Crypto Kitties. So how do you think we will get from these particular applications of crypto that basically benefit the already privileged. To the world changing ones that you idealized in your tweets?"
Vitalik,"Yeah. So first of all, I definitely will say that if I was worried at 500 billion. At 740 billion I'm even more worried. I'd say that a large part of it is that right now there is a lot of expectation that stuff will be built. And there are people who are building stuff. There's that UN World Food Program that I keep talking about. There are various identity projects. There's various stuff. And all these various different countries."
Interviewer,Some of those things are private blockchain though right? Are they public?
Vitalik,"A lot are, but one of the key reasons why a lot of it is going private is because the public blockchain scale ability is total crap. Basically, there's a lot of stuff that's being built on a lot of stuff that people want to build, but it's really because of the technical obstacles that they can't do it at this point."
Interviewer,So does that mean that you think some of these things will actually flourish more in private blockchains or do you think it's just happening for now?
Vitalik,"I think in the short term, a lot of these things will definitely flourish more in private blockchains. In the medium term, I really hope that we can make public blockchain scale ability be good enough that, even the naturally private blockchains just end up being moved on to public blockchains. Because, the public blockchain based layer, the scale ability is good enough and why not? One example of this is that there was this technology called plasma, I'm sure you've heard a lot about that Joseph Poon came up with a few months ago. And this basically allows you to kind of have, you know what the Bitcoin people were promising back in 2013, which is kind of private chains anchored in a public chain. In the case of plasma, the anchoring actually is meaningful and there's a good mathematical understanding of what the anchoring is, which basically is that, if you have one coin inside the plasma chain than even if the plasma chain totally breaks, then you could use that to recover one coin inside the public chain."
Interviewer,"Wait, just so I understand what you're describing. It sounds like you think the way we're going to get to these world changing applications on blockchain is by having these institutions that already provide many of those types of services, like the world economic forum or other institutions like that, having them implement programs on blockchains. Is that how you think we'll get there?"
Vitalik,"There's both paths right. First of all, the reason why the institutions can be helpful is because they have existing customers or existing users. They can adopt stuff very quickly. Then, regular people being able to just kind of transact with each other peer to peer, I think is a more transformative thing. I think the institutional aspect is transformative as well because you're basically convincing companies to build applications where you do not have to trust the company in order to trust the application. And you know, this is something that existing institutions really are not used to at this point. But, the more peer to peer side I think it's just going to scale a bit later because it doesn't depend on just a few people changing their minds. It really depends much more on this kind of slower and more organic growth and kind of, people changing their culture and changing their expectations. That's already happening on its own, right? The Ethereum blockchain has 1.15 million transactions happening on it every day. So that's more transactions than for example, rides on Uber. That's happened without a single mainstream ministry usecase being adopted. That's just a collection of a large number of little use cases. And, just added up together, it ends up to have a very significant amount of economic impact. That's doing 13 operations a second and that's valuing the Ethereum blockchain enough to be paying something like half a million dollars every day in transaction fees. There is clearly stuff happening and I think it clearly is true that if we just enabled more scale ability than more stuff will happen."
Interviewer,"Right. And, is that why you announce these grants?"
Vitalik,"Right, exactly. So the kind of conclusion of all this is basically that there's all these institutions that want to do stuff and there are just regular people that want to do stuff and for both of them, the bottleneck right now, basically is scalability. The grant program is definitely a large part of our multiple pronged strategy that we starting rolling out in 2014 to just deal with that."

Vitalik,"For proof of stake the pros are number one, I think that it can have higher security. What I mean by that is basically that I think proof of stake can be designed so it's more expensive to attack it. And I think proof of stake can be designed so that it's easier to recover from an attack. With proof of work, for example, if someone has more computing power than the rest of the network combined, they can't just double spend once, right? What they can do is they can do what I call a spawn camping attack. Where they basically just kind of keep on preventing any other blocks from getting into the blockchain forever and just mining empty blocks forever and just continually rendering the blockchain usable."
Interviewer,How does that work?
Vitalik,"The way that you would do this, let's say you have all of your hypothetical 51 percent hash power just on one laptop. I mean in reality it's much bigger. But for sImplicity we'll say that. Then you disconnect your laptop from the internet. Then you mine for two hours. Then you reconnect to the internet, publish all the blocks immediately. That'll just totally erase all the other work that's been done in the last two hours. And it will make your chain and be the longest chain, then turn the laptop back off then mine for two hours. Then keep on going and then just repeat this forever. So what that does is that first of all, it ensures that only your blocks are going to be part of the chain. And the second thing is it insurers that basically any other miner who participates, there will be times when it looks like they can mine, but then there blocks will still just be reverted anyway. So it just wastes all their time."
Interviewer,Do you worry at all about switching it this late in the game?
Vitalik,"I definitely worry about it and we're definitely going through the process fairly slowly and carefully. But, I personally do think that proof of stake is part of making this overarching philosophy I have of how blockchains can succeed. Basically, there's a couple of philosophies here, right? Like the way that I would describe proof of work, Bitcoin philosophy is they say, ""Well yes, blockchains are very expensive and blockchains are very expensive by design because you need to be very expensive in order to get censorship resistance and therefore the only blockchain applications that are really going to succeed are those applications that really, really need censorship resistance over and above everything else."" So you can probably find lots of proof of work advocates discussing this pretty explicitly."
Interviewer,"I think what's interesting to me is just to hear you describe all this. It sounds like your vision is maybe a little bit more pragmatic, whereas some of the rhetoric I maybe hear from some of the other blockchains or at least from people such as like Bitcoin maximalists or something is a little bit more anti-establishment. But you, it sounds like are having a more pragmatic, user friendly focus. And, having a vision for a large swath of society, whether it's institutions and wealthy people, as well as the little guy that we talked about at the beginning, using the blockchain."
Vitalik,"They're definitely going to get some adoption. Though, I do think that a lot of them are targeting somewhat different properties than what Ethereum does. So for example, one piece of technology that a lot of these platforms rely on is something caled DPOS, delegated proof of stake, which is basically a system where the entire network is run by something like 20 to 40 computers. And, the only way that other participants in the system can have an influence is basically by voting on who the participants are. And, this basically is the entire security model of the system. It's basically a consortium chain where people with coins gets to control who the consortium is. I personally believe that this is nowhere near decentralized enough for a public blockchain system to really stay public in the long term."
Interviewer,"To speak about governance and your blog post, I was wondering how you plan to implement governance in Ethereum because as we just discussed, some of these blockchains they have onchain governance and you wrote in your blog posts. I'll just quote this for people who didn't read it, the abstract says that you believe quote, ""tightly coupled onchain voting is overrated."" And I have a feeling they're, you're referencing things like Tezos. You also said, ""the status quote unquote, informal governance as practiced by Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Zcash and similar systems is much less bad than commonly thought."" You also said, ""people who think that the purpose of blockchains is to completely expung soft, mushy human intuitions and feelings in favor of completely algorithmic governance, emphasis on completely are absolutely crazy."" I really liked that phrasing there. And then you also said. ""loosely coupled voting as done by carbon votes in similar systems is underrated."" So why do you have all these opinions and how do you think people should be thinking about Blockchain governance?"
Vitalik,"There's a few examples that is use in my post. Regarding tightly coupled onchain voting being overrated. I think my main argument against it basically is that it really runs the risk of creating a system where people believe that if the government's algorithm outputs the decision, then the decision is legitimate. But there's plenty of situations where a decision that's approved by 60 percent of coin holders really should be viewed as an illegitimate one. So even something like, like if there is some convenient way to separate a 60 percent of coin holders, into group A and 40 percent is a group B. Well you could imagine a decision that just finds some way to double the coin holdings of everyone who is part of group A. And then the 60 percent group or the group A are going to vote for it. This is like the standard two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner problem. Basically I worry that if you have a blockchain that really deeply enshrines tightly coupled governance, then that sort of stuff will end up happening. And possibly even worse stuff will end up happening. Like I mentioned, these bribing attacks that happened to Lisk. I do think that there's basically 5 or 10 different ways that various more or less subtle forms of bribing attacks can happen. And, I basically view this in the same way that Bitcoiners view the nothing at stake problem of proof-of-stake. I personally don't think that the requirements to log on every year is an issue. They think that this is something that even if it works OK for a while, ultimately is the death knell of decentralization. And there I disagree. But that's the kind of opinion that I have about this Blockchain voting stuff."
Interviewer,"Just one thing I wanted to add there was about the on chain voting is it is sort of one of those things where if you know what is going to be the threshold, then you can game the system. So, people will always be trying to do that."
Vitalik,"Totally. So as far as informal governance goes, I think that people, often don't realize the extent to which the systems within a formal governance actually, have governance. And the governance actually does work quite well at both ensuring that the protocol changes that are made are changes that are good. And preventing one person from having too much power over the system. On the one hand, people say for example, that Ethereum is completely centralize around myself. And, it's true for example, that I run the long term research agenda. But, if you look at the actual process that we've institutionalized between, Geth, C++, Parity and Harmony developers for actually taking changes that people either on the research team have come up with or people in the community have come up with, and, turning them into things that get implemented and become part of the protocol. That actually is something that has been fairly institutionalized, meaningfully de-centralized that actually works quite well. Right. Basically, we have these open core developer calls that happened every two weeks and participants from everyone of the major implementations, like, Geth, Parity and so forth, participate in the calls. We discuss them and generally end up adopting changes by consensus and it ends up, I would say, working fairly well and people who are actually part of the process or who actually watch it closely tend to be fairly happy with it."
Interviewer,"This was something that was going to ask you about because, I do see this criticism of how Ethereum is governed, sometimes it's people just saying, ""Oh, Vitalik is a benevolent dictator."" But then other people saying, ""He's the single point of failure for Ethereum."" Do you think that you are? For instance, you did say in twitter the other day, ""If things continue in this immature fashion, I'm going to leave."" Let's say you really did decide to leave and you were so angry you didn't put any succession process in place. What would happen then?"
Vitalik,"So first of all, I want to correct the record on a small thing, which was I didn't say that I will leave if things continue to being a immature. I said that I will leave if price memes and people being immature continue to be the only thing that gets accomplished. So there's a real difference between those two that people didn't capture. I am definitely not going to abandon the refugees in Jordan that the UN World Food Program applications on top of Ethereum are working on feeding just because there was people saying stupid stuff on twitter. Where I am going to leave is if that stuff doesn't materialize and the only thing that's happening is people say stupid stuff on twitter."
Interviewer,I'm with you there. I will stop covering the space also if the same thing happens. So I think we both agree on that.
Vitalik,"As far as what happens if I do leave. I would actually say that the extents to which I am a single point of failure is probably dropping fairly rapidly. For example, over the last six months we've really scaled up our research team. And, we have a team in python that's developing the sharding specification. That's pretty much has a fairly high degree of autonomy at this point. And, I personally have actually quite a bit of confidence in these people. I think that if I get run over by a bus tomorrow, I really do believe that they will be able to carry version 1 of basic sharding to completion basically on their own. As far as proof of stake, we have the alpha Casper FFG testnet. So the algorithm is very close to basically being what it needs to be. On the plasma side, the situation is fairly similar. We are definitely trying hard to basically make sure that we have a large and growing core group of people that understand the ideas and understand the vision enough that basically any of them can execute it through regardless of what happens."
Interviewer,"Is there a governmental kind of infrastructure around you? Three years from now, what will the Ethereum foundation's organizational structure look like?"
Vitalik,"Right. If we replace that question with the question of will Ethereum be meaningfully independent of myself. There are two, kind of threat models that you can have, right? The first is, what if I disappear? You know, what if I get kidnapped, what if I get run over by a bus? And the second is, what if I become corrupt or evil in some way. For the first one, I think basically I answered that question by basically saying that the research team is growing, we're rapidly adding smart people and this is basically the only way to really solve the problem. As far as solving the second issue goes. I think that part of that is going to resolve itself over time because as these research sheds and development teams grow, they're going to inevitably started having their own opinions that they contribute to discussions and we'll get harder for any one person to force things through."
Interviewer,"I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier in the conversation about how Ethereum is actually being used and how that maybe had differed from what you imagined. So obviously, this past year we saw the initial coin offerings, just really, really took off. And, Ethereum was the main platform where they were holding those ICO's. Especially now when we're seeing so many of them. And also there are a number where, maybe he might say, they're at the very least un-serious and at the very worst scams. How do you feel about the fact that Ethereum is the main platform for this activity?"
Vitalik,"I would say that first of all, every single scam that's happening is definitely unfortunate. But, it's kind of an inevitable part of a rapidly evolving economy. In the crypto currency and ICO space, very few people and that's including regular people on the street, including regulators, including people fairly deep into this space, a lot of the time have a good idea of how to judge many of these projects. And, that basically means that projects that, in my opinion really shouldn't be proliferating, proliferate for some time. And, I think that up until now, I definitely don't think that scams are the majority of projects that are taking place. Especially among the successful ones. I do think that a lot of the stuff that's being funded actually is a genuine innovation that's hopefully going to mature and come out over the next couple of years. And, I personally do think that the space actually is growing up more and more. I'd expect that in 2018, 2019, any new ICO's that end up happening in this space. I think, first of all, are not going to raise as much money as the previous ones did. Probably even despite the fact that right now the cryptocurrency prices are three times higher than they were before."
Interviewer,So why do you think that just because there's too much noise or why?
Vitalik,"Because I think if there is an extremely good one then possibly, but in general there is already less hype and people are already noticing that, ""oh wait."" The first round of these projects, didn't do remotely as well as the crypto currencies that people will give up in order to participate. And I think that's having a fairly significant effects. And also, regulation is definitely have a significant effect. Also, the increasing number of these projects is having decreasing effect. It's a lot easier to argue that you have a 1% chance of changing the world when there's only 4 other projects out there, then when there is 40 other projects out there. I do think that the future of these projects is going to ends up being smaller. The other reason why I think that's the case is that a lot of these fairly early stage projects. Or, projects by people who have already spent a lot of time establishing themselves in this space in 2014 to 2015. I think that most of the people that have that property have basically figured out what they're doing at this point. Projects that are run by people totally new coming into the space, I think are likely to be less successful. That's just my own opinion."
Interviewer,"Although frankly it's been a little bit dispiriting to see how some of the people having these ICO's that really don't have a background in this space are still able to raise a lot of money. So, to go back to what I mentioned earlier about the ponzi schemes and scams that are going on. So here we've seen this year or last year now that there's been a lot of debate over how much responsibility platforms like facebook and twitter have in monitoring things like fake news or trolls on their sites. So do you think Ethereum or the Ethereum community, do they have a responsibility to monitor or audit the different projects that launch ICO's on Ethereum?"
Vitalik,"Ethereum platform, definitely no, Ethereum community, yes."
Interviewer,What do you mean by that?
Vitalik,"If the Ethereum platform itself starts actively policing what applications are built on it, then that basically kills the whole idea of censorship resistance way more than anything that happed with the DAO dip. So that's basically just a non-starter both philosophically and probably technologically as well, because actually implementing something like that would require hard forks pretty much every day to weed project out that we disapproved of. We're not even going there. I think is the general lesson that we learned. As far as the community goes, I think there are a lot of things that the community can do to encourage good projects to appear and get more attention and discourage bad project to get less attention."
Interviewer,One other thing that I wanted to ask you about was you've written about the difficulties with having ICO's in terms of ensuring a wide distribution but then also ensuring that people can participate or that they can get in at the valuation that they think is reasonable. So you wrote about interactive coin offerings. What are those and what problems are they solving for ICO's?
Vitalik,"at problem is an interactive coin offering solving for ICO's? The idea is that there are two kinds of ICO's. There's a capped ICO and an uncapped ICO. In a capped sale, the main challenge basically is, oh, what happens if the sale ends in one minute. And, basically whoever is the best at sending the transaction and first wins. And I think that's an approach that's just incredibly unfair. It's incredibly inefficient and the long run equilibrium, I think it's basically that miners are gonna always be the ones that get in ahead. The other kind of sale is that uncapped one. And in an uncapped sale, that's also bad because people have no certainty about what the valuation is that they're participating at. So the compromise between the two is a dynamic cap or interactive models. Where people can basically in an interactive ICO send in though an ETH smart contract. Then when they send ETH they also have to specify what is the maximum valuation they are willing to participate at. And, as soon as you have, ""X"" dollars worth of people that are willing to participate at valuation ""X"". Basically, that is the valuation. And people who are ok with that valuation, the contract accepts them and they end up participating and people who specify that they, that they wanted a lower valuation, their coins end up getting refunded. So the idea is that the contract just basically calculates what the supply demand intersection is and accepts everyone who was ok with a higher price and doesn't accept people who wanted a lower price. With that kind of model, I think that we can solve at least some of the problems from both sides."
Interviewer,"I really like that. I actually hadn't heard that one before and I really like how it solves yet another trust issue with the ICO space, where you might think that a project sounds really good, but if you put your money in, there's no guarantee that the developers, you know, could have just painted some lovely picture but then have no real intention to actually carry it through. I wanted to actually ask you, what types of blockchain applications do you think will be the first mainstream breakout we'll see? With wide adoption?"
Vitalik,CryptoKitties has clearly had a breakout.
Interviewer,I mean really mainstream. I don't know if that's quite big enough.
Vitalik,"Well, it's going to happen in stages, right? A lot of the stuff that's happening right now I think has a chance of really breaking out into the mainstream. But basically, usability has to go up and transaction fees have to go down. So, if those two issues are solved than things like cryptic currency payments, things like CryptoKitties, things like DNS, things like that...."
Interviewer,"Why CryptoKitties? When you say things like CryptoKitties, what is it about that, that you think will take off?"
Vitalik,"I actually think that the idea of digital collectibles is a totally fine idea. And, it seems to be something that like, it's gotten my non-technical family members using Ethereum DAPPS for the first time. When you see that, then you realize you have something that actually has best market potential. Now granted, it's not a kind of feed the poor, bring world peace, save the world sort of thing. But, at the same time, you know, it is something real, it is something that gets people excited. It is something that I think is a great example of something that benefits from the blockchain to a moderate extent. Because it's not the sort of thing that would get, literally shut down by governments if it was on a central server. But, at the same time, the idea of a collectible just really does just become more interesting if it's not dependent on a single company for its ongoing existence. That's just one reason why I think it's an interesting example to look at as an example of a paradigm."
Interviewer,And what do you think would be the first type of blockchain application that would go mainstream but also provide a social good?
Vitalik,"I think crypto currency payments and remittances and things like that are starting to be useful already. I think some of the identity stuff is going to get out fairly soon. Also, once some of the decentralized exchange infrastructure comes out. There's some projects I talk about OmiseGo a lot. The idea there is that it's a project that's trying to use public blockchain based de-centralized exchange in order to improve interoperability between various different digital payment wallets in developing countries. And, that's something that actually really does benefit from being on a decentralized platform that's not controlled by any one company. And, that's an example of something that's looking to launch at least a basic version next year. So I think things in the payments and identity space are definitely something to look toward. Another thing that I'm personally interested in is at the intersection of blockchains and strong cryptography. So this includes things like blockchain based privacy, preserving polling systems. Based on things like ring signature and zero knowledge proofs. And, I'm actually thinking of, even right now we're trying to like look for applications that would be a willing to be the first to benefit from that sort of thing."
Interviewer,"Yeah. I was going to ask you that. So Ethereum is going to add privacy. So why do you think it's important to add that when we already have privacy coins, like Zcash, Monero and Dash?"
Vitalik,"Zcash, Monero and Dash add privacy to money. Ethereum's advanced cryptography experiments can add privacy to all the other applications other than money. Examples include, things like, as I mentioned, privacy, preserving polling systems on the blockchain and privacy, preserving smart contract systems, privacy, preserving digital identity layers. So if you think about the original pitch of Ethereum, ""Bitcoin does money"", ""Namecoin does domain names"", ""Ethereum does everything"" and then you can think of it as, ""Zcash is privacy for money"" and ""Ethereum's privacy experiments are privacy for the other stuff.""."
Interviewer,One other thing I was going to ask you was how disruptive do you think crypto will be to governments?
Vitalik,"I think it's definitely going to be disruptive in some ways. I like the philosophy behind at least crypto currency as being, to make national borders as irrelevant for payments as they are for email. And, practically speaking, yeah, that's a very disruptive thing. I do think that governments are going to have to change a lot of the ways in which they think about things right now. Especially with things like the internet and the sharing economy applications. At least they've had an opportunity to get use to the first wave of this sort of thing. And, I think blockchain based applications are to some extent are going to be the second wave of a similar trend. So similar in some ways, but also different in other ways because you don't have the kind of big corporations at the center controlling everything."
Interviewer,What do you worry about?
Vitalik,"I worry about, first of all the possibility that the speculative side of cryptocurrencies will continue to grow and succeed without the practical value of the cryptocurrencies growing and catching up to compensate. I worry a lot of the time of about the to wealth distribution consequences that some of that might have. So basically where you just have totally random people who happened to have bought a few thousand bitcoins since 2010 and now they basically end up being multi-millionaires and they could be on their way to becoming billionaires without really having done any work. And, I do worry about what kind of effect that will have on society. I noticed that there's a lot of people who kind of cheer the wealth redistribution that's coming from cryptocurrency. Because they think, it's old money that's being disempowered and flashy new tech money that's being empowered. But, I'm skeptical that people who are involved in crypto currency are better people than people who are involved in the banking system. I think if cryptos succeeds, it's not because it empowers better people. It's because it empowers better institutions. And better incentive structure and better way for existing people to interact with each other. I used to believe, if you saw some of the things that I wrote maybe four years ago, that the idea that crypto distributes wealth to what I thought are better people is going to be a large positive social consequence. But after watching the way that Bitcoin maximalists treat Ethereum. The way that the Bitcoin scaling debate happened, the way that all of these, various scam projects are going. I've really realized that no. It's definitely, absolutely no. It's not true that a crypto people are any better than people anywhere else in the world. I actually really do worry about what happens if wealth transferred to these people, and the resulting kind of super empowerment of these kinds of people ends up being the largest social consequences of the blockchain space."
Interviewer,And do you have any crypto predictions for 2018?
Vitalik,"Crypto predictions are very hard to make because a lot of the predictions I ended up making just continually end up being consistently wrong. And the stuff that ends up happening just ends up being stuff that's totally unexpected. If you look at the big stories of 2017, right? Well, I did successfully predict Bitcoin split into core and cash. That's one place where I was successful. I probably did predict Bitcoin dominance continuing to decline. I did not predict that transaction fees would go all the way up to $20. Actually there was this kind of sad moment that I had about a few weeks ago where I just paid something like a $6 transaction fee in order to reload my namecheap account with bitcoin. And that transaction ended up being delayed by a couple of hours and I basically just said, ""screw that. I'm using my credit card."" And I'm like, ok, when cryptocurrency is inferior to credit cards for just simple payments and buying stuff on the internet, I really kind of deeply inside kind of feel and know that the space kind of lost its way to some extent. I definitely did not predict the price increases. I definitely did not predict in a lot of this stuff that's happened outside of the Ethereum space. Like the sheer size and scale of the various ICO's for example. For 2018 I guess my concrete projections I do think ICO's are going to be quieter through 2018 than they have been through 2017. I think that Bitcoin's dominance is probably going to continue to erode and the space is going to continue to diversify."
Interviewer,"Well, I will add one prediction that isn't my own, but that I saw both Fred Wilson and Olaf Carlson-Wee made on TV. And both of them said that they thought that we would see the marketcap of Ethereum surpassing that a Bitcoin. So, that's out there for listeners. One other thing I would add is also Olaf was on the podcast and he was a fantastic guest. You should go back and listen to that episode. Vitalik is there anything I didn't ask you that you want to mention? Anything that you know has been like floating around your brain that you haven't gotten a chance to talk about?"
Vitalik,"No, I think we've gone through everything."
Interviewer,All right. Well it's been fantastic having you as a guest. Where can people get in touch with you or see your work?
Vitalik,Thank you very much. It was great to be here.
Interviewer,"Ok, and your twitter or anything like that."
Vitalik,"Vitalik Buterin, just my name."
Interviewer,Q Tell me about the weekend. What did you think?
Vitalik,"I think it's widely distributed! At the beginning it was more highly concentrated in Silicon Valley, Berlin, and a few other places, but now there are hubs of blockchain talent all around the world. I see many successful teams in the US, Europe, Australia, and recently more in China as well."
Interviewer,"Governments are increasingly involved in blockchain, either through regulation or their own initiatives. Consortium chains are garnering increasing attention and popularity. Do you think that either or both of these moves diminish the potential for decentralization?"
Vitalik,"My impression is actually that public chains are gaining more support recently, including from large enterprises and even government applications in a few cases. Consortium chains are of course the more safe and conservative option, and much more powerful than public chains in the short term because public chains have scalability issues, but I think public chains will prove themselves to be more safe and scalable with time."
Interviewer,"How do you think China's increased activity in the blockchain world, both by the private and public sectors, will affect the development of the technology in the next decade? What are some pros and cons?"
Vitalik,"I am definitely happy that so many in China are interested in building blockchain applications. We are in a time when there is great concern about what technologies can be trusted; blockchains cannot solve all problems but there are definitely some things that blockchains can make better by making it easier to build platforms where users control their own data, improving auditability and transparency of algorithms, etc."
Interviewer,"Ethereum is one of the chains available on China's BSN, according to Red Date. How was the decision to participate taken, can you describe the reasoning? How do you think you can manage the collaboration/competition relationship given that both projects pertain to smart contracts and Dapps?"
Vitalik,"That decision was taken by the BSN group, it would be better to ask them for their reasoning! I think they simply want to give developers options and the ability to use high-quality public networks that are widely used, and Ethereum is absolutely at the forefront of that. I don't see BSN as being a competitor to Ethereum; I see it as being a different layer."
Interviewer,What is your take on the BSN more broadly? What will its impact be?
Vitalik,I think it's still too early to tell; it remains to be seen exactly what kinds of projects will be built on BSN and how it will evolve. It's important to not try to guess too much from early initial information about a project when it's being released; e.g. I think this is one of the mistakes that people made with Libra.
Interviewer,"It is said that back in 2013 you proposed creating a scripting language on top of Bitcoin, but that this didn't go down well. If this is true, what do you think looking back on that interaction now? Is there anything you would have done differently? Do you think that, ultimately, the creation of Ethereum was for the best?"
Vitalik,"This is a misconception; I did not actually propose to build on bitcoin first. I proposed to build on Primecoin instead of Bitcoin, because at the time the Bitcoin community was already having debates with many people pushing to change the protocol to make it impossible to build second-layer protocols of the type that I wanted to build on top. A big part of the reason why I wanted to build on Primecoin instead of building an independent blockchain was because at the time I expected I would have to write the code myself and I did not see myself capable of writing an independent blockchain from scratch. However, when I published the idea, far more people quickly offered to help, and so I did feel like I had the ability to create Ethereum as a separate blockchain."
Interviewer,You began your career as a journalist at Bitcoin Magazine. Have skills from media helped you in your later career? What is the most common mistake journalists and public speakers make when communicating blockchain with the general public?
Vitalik,"Probably the two most important skills that I learned were (i) an understanding of the tech and economics and other properties of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and (ii) writing skills. I think the biggest mistake made by a lot of educational writing is that there are usually two types of educational writing. First, there is writing that tries to fully explain the idea technically, with the goal of helping people fully understand it and be able to implement it; however, this writing tends to be very academic, very difficult to read, and often written to be read by people who studied the same things in university as the author etc etc. Second, there is writing that targets the general public, but is completely technically inaccurate. I feel like there is a large missing space in between these two extremes, and it's what I try to target with a lot of my writing."
Interviewer,What was it like to be paid in Bitcoin (BTC) in the early 2010s? What did your family and friends tell you? What were the most important reasons why you got involved with cryptos?
Vitalik,"Being paid with BTC for the first time definitely felt like becoming part of a new world. My family and friends were not too interested at first, though I became interested very quickly; I found the combination of math and technology and ideas around open source software, digital communities and freedom very attractive. It took time for other people to find cryptocurrencies interesting as well."
Interviewer,"What is the most important roadblock in a blockchain-powered internet, back in the early 2010s and today? How was your thinking about the technology changed? Have you discovered new potential/limits that you didn't see before?"
Vitalik,"There are definitely many things that I understand now that I did not understand well back then. One example of this is around decentralized governance. In the early 2010s, I was very interested in DAOs (fully decentralized companies running on the blockchain) and similar ideas, but I understood little about the challenges of actually building them and the economics of governance mechanisms."
Interviewer,"Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2.0) is adopting a proof of stake consensus algorithm to improve the network's scalability and efficiency. But it's likely that staking pools, much like mining pools, will emerge to dominate the network, increasing centralization. Will Eth2.0 sacrifice some decentralization for scalability? How do you plan to deal with centralization stemming from staking pools?"
Vitalik,"The Eth2.0 research team takes decentralization very seriously. We have made many protocol changes to try to make the protocol more friendly to individual and small-scale stakers. Staking pools are definitely going to happen, through it is definitely our hope, and our expectation, that there is less centralization in staking than there was in mining."
Interviewer,When did you first have the impression or idea about Ethereum?
Vitalik,"I was working on Mastercoin and colored coins back in 2013; after a few weeks working on the projects I realized how the approach of trying to target a specific set of use cases was too limited, and started trying to make a blockchain that supported more and more general forms of computation. After a few iterations, the idea that is now called Ethereum, at least in a very early form, emerged."
Interviewer,How will Ethereum will be governed in future?
Vitalik,"That's a complicated question; built-in governance structures have benefits but they also have hidden costs. For example, if you take a Dash/Tezos-style coin voting governance model and enshrine it as a social contract, then you are also creating an expectation that anything that this governance model outputs is legitimate. Expands issuance by 5x and gives it to a coalition consisting of 60% of token holders? Sorry, the 60% voted for it. One guy bribes the voters (note that bribing can take some quite realistic indirect forms, eg. running an online wallet that provides users convenience but votes on their behalf) and makes a change that benefits themselves? Hey, vote results are vote results. So IMO the social contract in any blockchain must necessarily be at least to some extent subjective."
Interviewer,"Should Ethereum have a built-in governance structure like dash? If not, why not?"
Vitalik,"That's a complicated question; built-in governance structures have benefits but they also have hidden costs. For example, if you take a Dash/Tezos-style coin voting governance model and enshrine it as a social contract, then you are also creating an expectation that anything that this governance model outputs is legitimate. Expands issuance by 5x and gives it to a coalition consisting of 60% of token holders? Sorry, the 60% voted for it. One guy bribes the voters (note that bribing can take some quite realistic indirect forms, eg. running an online wallet that provides users convenience but votes on their behalf) and makes a change that benefits themselves? Hey, vote results are vote results. So IMO the social contract in any blockchain must necessarily be at least to some extent subjective."
Interviewer, Do you agree that hard forks are the way to the future or do you expect a different method to serve as updates in the future (like soft forks or something new).
Vitalik,"I personally like hard forks. Particularly, I like the fact that they give users a measure of control, requiring them to opt in to protocol changes. Sure, they can be a little more chaotic if they're controversial, but that's the price of freedom."
Interviewer,What are the biggest organizational challenges for the Ethereum Foundation this year?
Vitalik,"Finding sources of revenue other than our existing ether reserves (no worries, we still have ~$11m worth of ETH on top of our fiat reserves)."
Interviewer,"I'll begin at the end then move back to the beginning. On Reddit, someone asked Vitalik about the future he sees coming out of the technology he's working on. Vitalik described a scenario:."
Vitalik,Since I was about ten or so. For half a decade I mainly programmed video games that I ended up playing myself immediately after I wrote them.
Interviewer,"When did you realize that Bitcoin was important and interesting, and not just a fake currency for nerds?"
Vitalik,"My dad told me about it. And my immediate reaction was, ""Well, it has no intrinsic value, it's backed by nothing, so it's never going to work."" I just ignored it for a few weeks. Then I heard about it again from a completely different source, and if I hear about something twice it's probably at least somewhat legit, so I looked into it. Once I started, I got in pretty quickly."
Interviewer,"People have been writing about the decentralized database called the blockchain, and about the idea that Bitcoin is a way of establishing consensus without a third party like a bank or a government."
Vitalik,"A blockchain is a database or ledger that updates itself according to certain rules. In the case of Bitcoin, the database stores how many bitcoins everyone has. The rule is that if you have some number of bitcoins, then you have the ability to reduce that number by some amount but not by more than what you have and increase the balance of someone else's account by the same amount. It's a mathematical formula that's defined by three lines of computer code."
Interviewer,"You were trying to build on top of Bitcoin and you got frustrated, right?"
Vitalik,"I was working on a project called Colored Coins a way of creating your own asset and using the Bitcoin blockchain to track it and another project called Master Coin, which was trying to build financial tools on top of Bitcoin. And I noticed that these different approaches to extending Bitcoin's functionality were trying to increase the number of features. Imagine if you had a calculator and then people realized that, oh, hey, people might also want to use the device in their pocket to listen to music, so let's take a calculator and tape a Walkman to it, and oh, by the way, people want a clock, so let's tape a watch to the side as well. Meanwhile, Apple comes out with the iPhone, which can do just about a million different things. Ethereum is the idea that, instead of taking a calculator and taping a Walkman to it and so forth, you just have a computer, and that computer runs arbitrary program code, which you can use for whatever sort of app or feature you want. Bitcoin was never designed to be the foundational base layer for everything."
Interviewer,"""Everything"" meaning ""decentralized computing""?"
Vitalik,"Decentralized computing, decentralized name registry, asset management, and so forth. I kept on noticing various technical issues. We were trying to strap on functionality to something that was never meant to have functionality strapped on. People sometimes call Bitcoin the HTTP or TCP/IP of money. HTTP and TCP/IP are foundational base Internet protocols that are behind just about everything. But Bitcoin is more like SMTP, which is a protocol for email. Imagine that email is the first thing that came out, and people started trying to implement PayPal inside of email, or Netflix video streaming on top of email. People would be sending thousands of emails back and forth, and then you'd have something that would be trying to translate those emails into a movie. I realized it would make sense to build something which I named Ethereum that's properly designed to be a foundational platform that makes it possible to do just about anything decentralized."
Interviewer,"That was about a year ago. In the past year, you've had a multimillion-dollar presale of ether, which is the currency of Ethereum, but it functions more like gas or oil because it pays to run cycles of computing. Ethereum hasn't been launched yet, but the blockchain, the genesis block, is going to launch soon. When Ethereum launches, what is it going to be?"
Vitalik,"Ethereum will have a browser. You can think of it as being similar to a browser that you use to access the Internet. The difference is that when you're looking at a webpage on a web browser on the centralized Internet, your browser sends a request to the server ""Please give me the website to Google.com"" and Google servers reply with the data that gives the website. There's HTML code that depicts what the website looks like, and there's javascript code that dictates what the website does. You click search, and then there's javascript that takes what you search and sends the search query to Google, and Google replies with whatever the results are. With the Ethereum browser, basically it's all the same except instead of javascript calling the server, javascript can call the blockchain."
Interviewer,"Let's say that people start developing for Ethereum and increasingly use it. A few years down the road, what does that look like? Are we going to re-create the Internet we have now, except decentralized?"
Vitalik,"I can see services emerging that replicate what Dropbox does, what Uber and Airbnb do, and so forth, but in a decentralized format. The benefit would be that you don't have a company that charges 20 percent. You could argue, of course, that if these monopolizing middlemen are charging 20 percent and then a decentralized solution comes out that does equal the functionality at the cost of 3 percent, the centralized middlemen will move their fees down to 3 percent, and they'll still be around. But people like decentralized systems not only because they charge 3 percent and have these particular rules now, but because they commit to having those same rules forever. There are a lot of cases of companies being nice while they're the underdog and then once they get large enough they just don't need to care all that much anymore. Here, you know what the rules are, and you know that the rules are going to continue being the rules for the foreseeable future."
Interviewer,You have an idea that a lot of the functionality of the financial system which is quite opaque in certain ways could be replaced with little bits of code that are much more transparent and affordable.
Vitalik,"The financial system is very complex, and not many people understand exactly what's going on. It's not really clear under what circumstances some financial derivative is going to collapse and you'll end up with absolutely nothing. With centralized stock exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ, high-frequency-trading companies are setting up servers right beside the exchanges and have a 200-millisecond advantage over anyone else. If the same thing were implemented on a blockchain, then there is no server, and while a better Internet connection would give you a better time, there's nothing to huddle up to. Another advantage is that the whole thing is completely transparent. On the blockchain, you can see it. You can do statistical analysis on the whole thing in real time. If you are going to get some particular financial derivative that is inside Ethereum, you can see what it's backed by, you can see under what conditions you're going to end up getting what, and so forth."
Interviewer,"The economist Steve Randy Waldman recently gave a talk about the possibility for decentralized, opt-in social insurance using Ethereum. Will it be possible to replace governmental functions with decentralized structures, or fill in services that might be lacking as governments cut back?"
Vitalik,"The idea behind the presentation Steve gave is that even back before the government started getting seriously involved in welfare, at least to the extent that it is today, there were things like fraternal organizations and unions. You would have a bunch of people who would agree to participate in this organization, they'd all chip in some amount, and if anyone needed money because they got into hard times, they would get it. It's like insurance except it's a decentralized, not-for-profit model where everything that goes into the system ends up directly going to help someone."
Interviewer,"So you pay in, and you can look at the code and see that your money's there in case you need it."
Vitalik,"You can take alternative economic models that have existed for hundreds of years in a lot of cases, and by porting them onto the blockchain, it's more scalable and transparent. Potentially, you get the benefits of it happening across multiple countries. If you do it locally then the problem is well, if you have one of these things inside of New York City, and there's a big flood going through New York, and suddenly everybody needs all of it at the same time, then we have a problem. Whereas if you set one of them up with some people you know on the Internet, and they're in ten different countries, that creates something a lot more robust and reliable."
Interviewer,"This puts me in mind of the privatization of Social Security, where you have something that the state can potentially do rather efficiently, versus putting it all on the individual is that the way you see this going, or is that not the right analogy?"
Vitalik,"There's a lot of ways to do privatization. The ones that end up going horribly wrong are generally those where you take the existing government thing and sell it off for 10 percent market value to your buddy. Private things are sometimes less efficient in practice because you have middlemen who end up taking profits. Whereas here the point is to get the best of both worlds by having an opt-in system where you can try different models but in a decentralized, community-based fashion."
Interviewer,"Although still, some people are going to make better decisions than others, and opt in to things that work versus things that bankrupt them."
Vitalik,"The idea that people might end up doing something stupid, I suppose, is an argument against any system that empowers people."
Interviewer,"But you see more and more functions that we've traditionally thought of as central-government functions being able to be decentralized in a similar way. There's a lot of futurism around the idea that the state is going to be hollowed out by these structures that allow us to do things on a small-group level that we formerly needed a big, centralized institution to take care of."
Vitalik,"The state is a model of economic organizing. Big companies are a model of economic organizing. So if this new model of economic organizing turns out to actually be practical, it probably will hollow out both the state and big companies to a partial extent. You have to look at the economics and see if it makes sense in a particular case."
Interviewer,"Can you describe the idea behind a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO?"
Vitalik,"The idea behind DAOs is that instead of having an organization that's managed by a few people, we have an organization that's managed by an algorithm. It's like a computer program that has the ability to hire and fire people. It has customers and all the same kinds of relationships that you would expect a company to have, except it works on its own and is incorruptible and so forth. There are many different things that you could think of as being either full DAOs or partial DAOs. You could even think of Bitcoin itself as being a partial DAO. One service that Bitcoin needs is people to secure it. The Bitcoin protocol has a built-in mechanism where if you are a miner and you help secure the network, then you automatically get paid 25 BTC every block. There's already an entire industry in which people are organizing on their own to figure out how to best fulfill this functionality that the Bitcoin network wants them to fulfill. DAOs can create these sort of large mechanisms that create incentives to build some kind of shared infrastructure."
Interviewer,"I know you're interested in basic income as one plank of your ideal future society. Is there a way of potentially building that on top of Ethereum? Can you create a new currency, like Bitcoin, ex nihilo, that has an egalitarian or antipoverty function?"
Vitalik,"That distributes units of currency equally to each individual person? Yeah, you can. The number one problem is that you need a secure mechanism for figuring out that two different people are actually two people and not one person. The second problem is, is the extra revenue from producing currency units actually enough to pay everyone and help everyone survive? It might not be, in which case you might have to supplement it with both decentralized insurance and traditional government programs. Or we just might have to wait half a century for technology to advance even more."
Interviewer,"Timothy May wrote his ""Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"" around 1988. Is that a tradition that you feel like you're part of?"
Vitalik,"The idea behind cryptoanarchy is basically to create a society where the economic mechanisms are all based on the Internet, and anonymous, or rather pseudonymous. Each identity is protected by public-key cryptography. Not just the more expansive concept of regulation, but even antifraud laws, would be substituted by this identity and reputation mechanism. If you screw people over, they will report that, and your account will become disreputable very quickly. So you have a system where government intrusion is not possible because all these interactions happen purely online in this convenient, encrypted form. On the other hand, the government is hypothetically not necessary because even though things are anonymous, you have a much larger amount of information available. Mechanisms like reputation worked perfectly fine in traditional societies where people know one another personally, but started working less well in larger, more anonymous modern societies. It might start working again on the Internet, because even though we have lots of people we have lots of information again. That's the party line with respect to how cryptoanarchism is supposed to work. In practice, I think, various experiments will provide a lot of educational value on what the actual benefits are."
Interviewer,So far there's been a Bitcoin drug market on the dark web
Vitalik,"It did pretty well, I think. Hundreds of millions of dollars of trading over a couple years. We saw a practical implementation of close to pure cryptoanarchist ideology. It used public-key cryptography to encrypt messages, it used Tor to encrypt the source and destination involved, and it used Bitcoin to make the currency anonymous. It was an online market that looked very nice and respectable, like eBay, but instead of the headings being ""Home,"" ""Furniture,"" ""Kitchen,"" and so forth, they'd be ""Ecstasy,"" ""LSD,"" ""Fake Passports.""."
Interviewer,"At the beginning of this talk, I quoted your vision of the future. That was the idea that micro payments happen all the time, and you're tracking the money in a government that's essentially a database, and you can see it going into life-extension research, and so on. Do you see things actually moving in this direction?"
Vitalik,"It's moving in that direction in some respects already. For instance, it's becoming more efficient to pay for resources on an ultra-metered basis that captures exactly how much you're consuming."
Interviewer,And what's the governance here? Is this democracy? Is it something else?
Vitalik,"It's hard to say. Efforts at creating some new model of running things rarely end up completely winning and replacing things 100 percent. Democracy is going to continue existing in some form for a very long time. Sure, its decisions aren't always good, but there are many more protections against decisions that are really bad. You could see other forms of decentralized governance emerging that don't necessarily look like people voting on everything. There's been interesting research done by people like the economist Robin Hanson on using prediction markets to make decisions. DAOs could have other models. The answer's probably different for every system."
Interviewer,Nice to see you Vitalik!
Vitalik,well thank you!
Interviewer,and to absorb all the materials on primecoin within one day and wrote such nice long article.
Vitalik,not many people toe that middle ground line between writing and advanced comp-sci I suppose.
Interviewer,yup sunny has my vote by a mile.
Vitalik,"so, question 1."
Interviewer,"Yeah it's a pen identity, similar to Satoshi's tradition I guess."
Vitalik,any hints as to what you do outside of altcoins?
Interviewer,Ripple is not really a coin.
Vitalik,"I throw it in there because I think it's idea of ""consensus"" is a serious competitor to PoW/PoS, and brilliant if it can be made to work. It has problems though, no doubt about that."
Interviewer,Although I didn't really take that extreme measures so at least some of my friends know I am doing this.
Vitalik,do you think it will?
Interviewer,I did some c programming before and currently work mostly on cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,"yep, I agree."
Interviewer,if so I think the market is now trying to wrestle with (1) with all these altcoins.
Vitalik,how so?
Interviewer,from my point of view I don't think early adopter is an 'issue' per se with bitcoin.
Vitalik,why do you say that?
Interviewer,"one observation is that lots of miners and investors are looking at new altcoins hoping to strike it right, even if it is a pure clone without anything new."
Vitalik,"yeah, I'm finding the interest in pure clones very strange."
Interviewer,i guess this has to do with the early adopter issue that you mentioned.
Vitalik,why do you think people care about them?
Interviewer,"That also perplexs me a bit but I think the market is treating the currencies as competing companies, you know like stocks."
Vitalik,because the block reward would keep going down.
Interviewer,this could become a basis for it to lose dominance in the long term.
Vitalik,question
Interviewer,but as a designer I need to be aware of the possibilities so this is part of the reasons for introducing primecoin.
Vitalik,but a hundred years down the line they'll both be very low.
Interviewer,"I think designing for a hundred year is unrealistic, but I do look at 20 years and possibly beyond."
Vitalik,"the inverse quadratic rule, right."
Interviewer,yeah for primecoin block value is 999/difficulty^2.
Vitalik,question
Interviewer,so when moore's law hit the wall it would become constant generation but still low inflation.
Vitalik,with some fudge factor near the beginning.
Interviewer,this is because I don't like to guess a fixed schedule.
Vitalik,"well, it's determined by the market in the exact opposite way that, say, gold supply is determined by the market."
Interviewer,"not exactly, it actually still resembles gold."
Vitalik,primecoin
Interviewer,"more supply is temporary, just like say the 2nd week of primecoin there are a lot more production than normal."
Vitalik,"well, that was the lag in difficulty adjustment."
Interviewer,but for gold mining it just appears on a longer time scale so it's less obvious.
Vitalik,"now, though, my estimate of the final supply of xpm got adjusted down by 50-100 mil after that big spike."
Interviewer,"it's not really different they are connected, for gold mining you are just moving future production to now, it's just over many years so not obvious."
Vitalik,"hmm, that's an interesting argument actually."
Interviewer,whereas bitcoin/primecoin adjust difficulty in a week or two.
Vitalik,I personally have always wanted a coin with deliberately slow difficulty adjustment (eg. timespan of 3-12 months); seems like that would also approximate gold in a different way.
Interviewer,that wouldn't work well because block spacing would be destroyed.
Vitalik,true.
Interviewer,for example several altcoins got stuck at high difficulty after the first few days.
Vitalik,maybe make difficulty adjustment rapid but increase the reward for some time instead....
Interviewer,it's generally agreed now that bitcoin's 2-week adjustment schedule is not suitable for a new altcoin.
Vitalik,"the problem there wasn't the 2-week schedule, so much as the 2016 block schedule."
Interviewer,"yeah this problem was actually hit by namecoin, the first altcoin so they developed merge mining for this."
Vitalik,talking about what your strategy with Primecoin was.
Interviewer,"of course first I had to have the idea that a primecoin could technically work, but then i am looking for reasons why we should run two coins so primecoin can be made."
Vitalik,is that accurate?
Interviewer,so that's primecoin strategic reason.
Vitalik,in terms of new ideas.
Interviewer,"yeah its already in primecoin, it's an updated version of ppcoin's checkpoint system."
Vitalik,so how does this new checkpointing system work?
Interviewer,"basically developers can broadcast a checkpoint to the network, and if an user turns on the checkpoint enforcement in the node then it would follow the block chain fork of the checkpoint."
Vitalik,how did the system work before?
Interviewer,in ppcoin right now the checkpoints are enforced by default so users have no say in whether to follow it or not.
Vitalik,"ah, okay, so hardcoded into software essentially."
Interviewer,yeah but it will be switched over in the future.
Vitalik,Although there are built-in checks to ensure even in the checkpoint mode developers cannot arbitrarily abuse his power <- what kinds of built-in checks are you talking about?
Interviewer,the system is designed because threat of 51% attack is real with altcoins.
Vitalik,what if a developer sends two conflicting checkpoints to two parts of the network at the same time?
Interviewer,that would cause the network to fork and requires manual intervention like restarting or upgrading client.
Vitalik,"okay, makes sense."
Interviewer,in primecoin user could also then ignore checkpoint and just follow the fork with more work.
Vitalik,"is it a jsonrpc command to do this, or are you planning on adding a GUI as well?"
Interviewer,oh the Qt now has debug window which can do all the rpc commands.
Vitalik,"right, forgot about that."
Interviewer,but if needed we could add it as an option setting.
Vitalik,are you planning on integrating the latest btc features eventually? (eg. payment protocol).
Interviewer,sure both primecoin and ppcoin should keep reasonably up-to-date with bitcoin features.
Vitalik,what is ppcoin 0.4 going to have? The advanced checkpointing system?
Interviewer,"It's mainly a refresh to bitcoin v0.8 features, but there could also be some adjustment on certain protocols."
Vitalik,yeah it seems like proof of stake is slowly becoming more accepted.
Interviewer,just past several weeks saw at least three copies released in china and went into speculative frenzy.
Vitalik,"""proof of excellence""."
Interviewer,it's a concept although there is no concrete designs around this concept.
Vitalik,so a coin might have some kind of internal AI tournament?
Interviewer,so it's a possible candidate to replace the functions of proof-of-work.
Vitalik,true.
Interviewer,right and most games AI can play better than human.
Vitalik,yeah.
Interviewer,that's one of its issues because its distribution is a lot more concentrated than proof-of-work.
Vitalik,yes.
Interviewer,I am actually quite surprised that Bitcoin Magazine carried primecoin the first day since my impression earlier was that there was no interest.
Vitalik,"six months ago, altcoins were almost irrelevant."
Interviewer,and only time i saw anything mentioned was ripple.
Vitalik,consider this.
Interviewer,yeah i got a few messages regarding ideas of other useful work types.
Vitalik,we came up with the idea of an AI challenge-based coin independently too (although no progress toward anything practical).
Interviewer,that's what I hope primecoin would inspire other designers to do.
Vitalik,F@H?
Interviewer,So i have seen a lot of such attempts fail because of lack of funding for development.
Vitalik,"yeah, the problem there is how you make it uncheatable."
Interviewer,that's a good chat thanks a lot Vitalik.
Vitalik,"alright, thank you too!"
Interviewer,"Tim, this is Naval speaking. Tim, thanks for having us. We're joined by Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik is the, I believe now 27 year-old creator of Ethereum, which is the most exciting cryptocurrency since Bitcoin, and has incredibly broad ambitions and capabilities. Vitalik is a really interesting guy because not only did he create Ethereum or co-create it, he also is a multidisciplinary polymath. His blog at vitalik.ca is full of lots of great ideas and insights and thoughts. He runs the Ethereum Foundation. He's contributed to all kinds of things like automatic market-makers, roll-ups, social recovery wallets, decentralized finance, scalability of blockchains, governance, all kinds of great ideas in the cryptocurrency space. He also thinks a lot about public goods, radical markets, wealth distribution. He runs a very active Twitter account where he good-naturedly engages with all kinds of people who are constantly trying to get into fights with him, which is what people do on Twitter. And yeah, and we're very lucky to have him."
Vitalik,"Thank you very much for the introduction, Naval. It's good to be here."
Interviewer,"Yeah. So, I'm going to start just right off the bat, we're probably going to try and keep this fairly basic and high level. For those of you who are quite experienced with cryptocurrencies, this may be a very general conversation, but at the same time, I'm going to ask Vitalik some hard questions. We're not going to let him get away with just the PR angle."
Vitalik,"Sure. So the one-sentence explanation of Ethereum that I sometimes give is it's a general-purpose blockchain. So this, of course, makes more sense if you already know what a blockchain is. Right? It's this decentralized network of many different computers that are together maintaining this kind of ledger or let's say database together. And different participants have very particular ways of plugging into that. They can sense transactions that do very particular things, but no one can tamper with the system in a way that's outside of the rules."
Interviewer,"That's a great overview. And I liked that Excel analogy of it's a spreadsheet with macros instead of a spreadsheet where you control your own cells. I'll also try and articulate in a few ways that I understand it, around the edges, because I think Ethereum is one of those things that's now quite a bit bigger than you. It probably has evolved in ways that even you didn't fully anticipate. So in some sense, we're discovering Ethereum and no longer just building it."
Vitalik,"So, first of all, I think ETH, the asset, is a cryptocurrency and in itself is an application and the first application of Ethereum. Going beyond financial things a bit, I mentioned ENS, the Ethereum Name System. So ENS, you can think of it as a decentralized name system. For example, when you go to ethereum.org, there is DNS, Domain Name System which has this big table that maintains this mapping of, well, if a person enters, if you're on .com the server, they actually have to talk to it, to talk to the website like some particular IP address. And this DNS system that maintains this public relationship is a fairly centralized system with a very small number of servers running it. So ENS is a fully decentralized alternative that is running on the Ethereum blockchain."
Interviewer,"Yeah. And DeFi, decentralized finance is this gigantic new category in which entire companies and protocols are being built in a decentralized way that allow you to do a lot of things that would have required Wall Street, along with bankers and judges and lawyers and accountants to handle. But now is done through smart contracts that are living on the Ethereum blockchain. And these smart contracts are at the core of the Ethereum blockchain. And we talked about these in the Nick Szabo podcast, but he famously described it as like an automated vending machine is an example of a smart contract where you put in money in a certain slot, and there's a certain set of rules and you press certain buttons and you get certain products in exchange. But these smart contracts, obviously now are getting far, far more complicated can actually be used, not just to compose financial applications, but even applications that we don't normally think of as financial."
Vitalik,"Yeah, I know and I think like the blockchain environment is definitely one that operates under somewhat different rules than the traditional environments, right? Like just one example of this is the idea of forking, right? So the one story that happens at around the beginning of last year that I just love to tell because of how it combines together with the values of the space so nicely is there was this platform called Steem and In Steem, there is Steem the platform and then there's Steem, the company, right? And Steem was its own blockchain and Steem, the company, they did have some Steemit tokens, but they didn't have the right to just do whatever they want with this Steem of the platform because it was a decentralized thing, but they had some tokens and then Steem, the platform had a voting mechanism as holders of Steem tokens could vote on changes."
Interviewer,"Yeah. Vitalik had this great line in his blog, where he said we wanted digital nations but we got digital nationalism. And there's a lot of truth in that. But basically these are like digital nations. And one of the analogies that I use for DeFi is that these are like crypto castles made of math that are freely trading with each other. Just imagine people are building applications on top of Ethereum, they're protected by mathematics, those are the walls and those castles and their moats, which are rivers of cryptography. But then they have free trade policy with each other. So that creates a lot of innovation, but if one of them starts misbehaving, then its people can leave and go to the next crypto castle or this is where the analogy breaks down. They can actually replicate it, just create a copy and move to that one, like in the Steem and Hive example."
Vitalik,"So I think the core idea is to make a general purpose blockchain, and to open the gates for people to build what they want to build on top of it, right? Like the background story for when Ethereum was starting to be formed, was that this was just the time when the idea of a blockchain beyond Bitcoin was just starting to gain legitimacy. And people were just starting to realize that there are these applications for blockchains other than just running a currency and in the end would be nice to build a platform that can actually support them. And so at the beginning, right, you had single purpose blockchains, you had Bitcoin for currency, you had Namecoin for domain names. You would have like single purpose protocols, like colored coins for issuing assets."
Interviewer,Thank you. Extremely helpful.
Vitalik,"Sure. So I think one other thing that's important to add just to give a complete picture of scaling is that there's these two families of scaling, layer 1 scaling and layer 2 scaling, where layer 1 scaling basically says, well, let's make the blockchain itself better. And the layer 2 scaling says, well, let's come up with protocols that sit on top of the blockchain and that use the blockchain in more clever ways to provide the same kinds of security guarantees that a blockchain has, but that provide a much more scalability because you're not just kind of doubly sticking like literally everything and doing everything on a blockchain directly. And so like, Bitcoin, for example, especially after the scaling war is focused exclusively on layer 2, right? Whereas, like say Bitcoin Cash is very layer 1 focused.So."
Interviewer,"And this is a classic thing in computing. Like say so for example, when I go to a website, the Domain Name System is at a different layer, the DNS servers, and then the HTTP servers serve up the webpage or another layer on top. And then there's a caching layer where some of the data might be kept closer to me. And then on my own computers where I run the JavaScript, because I don't want to run that JavaScript way back on the HTTP server or the DNS server. So there is a long, rich history in computing of stacking layers, upon layers. As you get closer to the point of the user, that's the point at which you use more compute and you execute more and more of the code."
Vitalik,"Right. Well, the way that I would describe it is like in comparison to Bitcoin, which is very layer 2 focused and Bitcoin Cash, which is very layer 1 focused. Ethereum takes a moderate approach. So we do both kinds of scaling, right? So there is the Eth2 effort, which you mentioned, which, it is layer 1 scaling, right? Is basically saying well we're going to make this big upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, and we're going to move it from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake where proof-of-work is this current consensus mechanism that keeps the blockchain secure, that broadens on having a large number of computers, just constantly cranking out these kind of mathematical hash solutions and it's 24/7 and proof-of-stake is a much more energy efficient alternative."
Interviewer,"Yeah. So before we get to layer 2 so layer 1 is, you're saying is proof-of-stake, which is moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and sharding, which is breaking it into pieces and having different pieces do different things, and then try to reconcile them. On the proof-of-stake side, I mean that itself is a whole big debate that could take up the entire podcast."
Vitalik,"The core idea basically is that in any decentralized consensus system where you don't have a central registry that keeps track of who the different humans are, you need some way for people to basically vote on which blocks got and which transactions got included in the network. And you need for that vote to be secure against what's called a sybil attack. A sybil attack is when one attacker just pretends to have one million different accounts. And normally in Reddit and Google accounts and Twitter and all of these centralized systems, this is done using centralized mechanisms, right? They sometimes require a phone number verification and then phone numbers themselves often end up having some KYC on top of them. There is various AI techniques to try to detect bots, but in a decentralized system, we don't have this set of centralized registry of who gets to be an actual user."
Interviewer,Yeah. I will say this is extremely helpful. Thank you.
Vitalik,"Yeah, the way that I would just briefly summarize the proof-of-stake case there is that proof-of-stake can actually survive at least in the opinion of proof-of-stake supporters with much lower rewards than a proof-of-work can. And the reason is, and because of how proof-of-stake works, the ratio between the cost of attacking a system and the cost of just running it becomes more favorable. But this is a long debate. I've written on it. I have a post on vitalik.ca, but if you just scroll down to the most recent one called Proof-of-Stake and then proof-of-work proponents have their own posts as well. So I encourage you to read all of them."
Interviewer,"So going back to, this is all layer 1 scaling, switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, start sharding the blockchain, and this gets you some tens of times improvement, like 20 times, 25 times improvement."
Vitalik,100 times.
Interviewer,"100 times. Fantastic. So then there's layer 2, which stacks on top."
Vitalik,"Yes. So layer 2, as I mentioned is about creating protocols that we have on top of the blockchain, that only use the blockchain in very particular ways. So there's lots of techniques for this, right? The simplest layer 2, to explain, I think is a very special purpose layer 2 called a payment channel. So the idea behind a payment channel is, let's say, I am selling you, Naval, an Internet connection and you're paying me per megabyte. Let's say you're paying me one cent per megabyte. Now, if we want to do this over the blockchain, the naive way to do it is every time a megabyte of data passes through the connection, you would just make an on-chain transaction and you send me one cent. The problem is this requires lots and lots of transactions."
Interviewer,"Yeah. So if I can summarize this for a second for our listeners. Basically what you're saying is, let's say that you and I have a long-lived contract for some service, rather than publishing every little aspect of that contract under the Ethereum blockchain and flooding it, we go off to the side, we do a whole series of transactions, but every time we do a transaction, each of us stamp it and say, ""Yeah, that little piece was done."" And we update the transaction between the two of us. And then when we're finished, either one of us can go back to the blockchain and submit the record of all the transactions and say, ""Look, it's signed by both of us. So this is valid."" But either one of us can submit it and the blockchain executes it. So the blockchain only needs to know when we left with how much money staked on this transaction and when we came back and what the total change was. It doesn't need to keep track of all the intermediate pieces."
Vitalik,"Exactly. Yes, that's a good summary. Now, channels are, I think the simplest layer 2, but they're also the least powerful layer 2, right? They can only do payments, but they have a hard time doing many kinds of smart contracts, and so the channels exist and they are being used for more and more things, and there are great, but the thing that the Ethereum ecosystem is the most excited about is something called rollups. Now, I don't want us to actually go in and fully explain the rollups because they're even more complicated than channels, but for those who are interested, I do have an article. Once again, go to vitalik.ca. Scroll down, I think it's called An Incomplete Guide to Rollups. And so I describe channels and also this thing called plasma, and then also rollups."
Interviewer,"Rollups are fascinating. I've been looking into them a little bit and they're worth learning about. It's basically the idea is just that, there's these very complex machines that are not on the blockchain, that are off the blockchain, that are running the transactions, but then they're submitting different kinds of proofs back to the blockchain to say, ""Don't worry, this was a valid transaction."" And the two different approaches, Optimism is optimistic where basically optimistic rollups say, ""We assume people are doing the right thing, but we're watching. And if someone commits fraud or makes a mistake, then they get punished for that fraud."" Whereas there are these zero knowledge-base rollups pioneered by StarkWare and others, which are basically saying, ""Hey, actually, we're going to submit proofs, which are much shorter than the actual computation, that the computation was done properly."" But I think these give together what? Another 100X speed up?"
Vitalik,Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yes.
Interviewer,"So if you combine the Eth2 layer 1 speed up and the layer 2 rollup speed up, then you get the 10,000 times speed up."
Vitalik,"Exactly. You're going to get, some were over 100,000 transactions a second, and one other really nice feature of sharding by the way, is that it's quadratic, right? So if the efficiency of computers increases by a factor of two, then you can support twice as many shards and each shard can be twice as large. And so the capacity of the whole system increases by a factor of four, right? And so, we actually expect that capacity to increase going even far beyond 100,000 over the next couple of decades."
Interviewer,"So, is it a stretch to say that sharding increases capacity as a square of Moore's law, as opposed to just at Moore's law?"
Vitalik,"Yes, this is the, mm-hmm (affirmative)."
Interviewer,"So now if we get to 100,000 plus transactions per second, that's a lot. I mean, to give it a comparable metric. There's about 100,000 tweets per second at Twitter during peak times, and obviously these transactions are going to be much more sophisticated and or could be much more sophisticated than a single tweet. They can actually be arbitrary computer programs running on the side. So that's quite a bit of scalability. So then I think the question comes up, well, where is it? A lot of people I know who are building apps on top of ETH have now had to come up with backup plans. There are competitive blockchains that are coming up, which trade-off decentralization security for speed."
Vitalik,"Great and very important question. So, I mean, I'll start off with the progress of Eth2. So I think it's important to reiterate, because I think a lot of people haven't fully absorbed this. The Eth2 chain is already running, right? So there's already a proof-of-stake chain. It does not yet have sharding, but the proof-of-stake system is running. The thing that has not yet happened is the event that we call the merge, which is where we basically actually take the existing activity on Ethereum and we fully move it over from the proof-of-work chain to the proof-of-stake chain. And then the proof-of-work changes, basically becomes irrelevant from there. The reason why we took this multi-step approach, where we first start the proof-of-stake system, and then we let both run in parallel for some time and then we merge at the end is just to give proof-of-stake sometime to prove itself before the entire ecosystem is asked to upgrade over. But basically, the proof-of-stake thing exists, has been stable, running ever since the launch and at some point fairly soon, we are going to actually go and merge all of the proof-of-work activity onto it."
Interviewer,"So you're basically saying fully, very confident that something like an Optimism or a ZK based rollup, will be solving a 100X scalability problem within the next few months."
Vitalik,"Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think there's definitely a lot of people who are not going to be comfortable moving over just because it's new technology and new technology always has risks, but I expect there there'll be plenty of applications. I mean, possibly even nonfinancial applications like the Nifties, and domain names and so forth, to start off just because the risks are lower if things do break and then creeping up to higher and higher value things as people become more comfortable over time."
Interviewer,"So do you think that Ethereum could have a scaling schism, like Bitcoin did? Bitcoin split famously into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, or the block size debate a few years back, which is all around scaling and some people were saying Bitcoin should be digital cash and so therefore, it needs these big blocks and it needs to handle more transactions. And other people said, no, no, Bitcoin is a Swiss bank account. It's digital gold, and it needs to be secure. And lots of small nodes have to be able to run it. So we care more about security than we do about handling small transactions and the small block people won. And so Bitcoin forked. And now of course, what we call Bitcoin is a small block Bitcoin that won that debate. Do you think that there's a possibility that some miners and people will stay on Eth1 instead of Eth2?"
Vitalik,"I think so, except I do think that the risks are much lower. A big part of the reason why is because we've been very open about proof-of-stake and sharding being the vision of basically from the first day. And I mean, Ethereum did already have this schism, right? Of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. And a lot of the proof-of-work proponents did actually move over to Ethereum Classic already because they recognize that Ethereum Classic community and ideology was one that's more aligned with that continuing proof-of-work forever. And so, why stay on the chain where the core developers and lots of people are eagerly expecting a proof-of-stake change if you can just move on to a platform already that accepts your values? So I think that was one of the factors that did actually end up making the Eth2 transition a bit more secure."
Interviewer,"So that's interesting. You don't even really run Ethereum. You have disagreements with developers and they could even change it in a way that you don't like. Has that happened yet? Has there been a case where something has been implemented into Ethereum that the community or the other developers wanted, which you disagreed with?"
Vitalik,"There's definitely been changes that I've wanted to push forward that I gave up on fairly quickly because there weren't enough core developers or the community ended up disagreeing on them. There's been changes that were pushed forward by some people who are not myself. And then where I just kept completely silent. So block reward decreases, for example, I was completely silent or mostly silent. ProgPow was mostly silent. It was obvious that the ProgPower side was losing. Things that I was trying to push forward. I mean, those are harder to find just because I tend to just naturally understand what the community would accept and I don't really try to push things that I don't think would be successful. I mean, there's some minutia around scaling strategies and statelessness and state management strategies where myself and some other core developers have some different opinions. And so there's a lot of back and forth where we try to satisfy each other's concerns."
Interviewer,Yeah. My sense from afar is you're more coordinating than dictating and you're doing what? Are you running the Ethereum Foundation? Is there an organization you're a part of? Or are you just a roving individual with a laptop and a few friends who just writes blog posts and submits proposals?
Vitalik,"Some of both. And I do the proposal submitting, I do some writing proof of concepts and in Python, I do some trying to coordinate people. The Ethereum Foundation as an organization exists. So the executive director of that is Aya Miyaguchi. She has been doing a lot of the logistical things for about the past three years and has done an amazing job. And, I ended up coordinating and working with her quite a lot on various things. But even the Ethereum Foundation, it has an important role because it has this large pool of capital and this high level of public legitimacy, but it's not nearly the only organization within Ethereum, right?"
Interviewer,"So Uniswap is interesting. Uniswap is, for those of you don't know, it's an application built on top of Ethereum, but it has its own token. And it's one of the first automated market makers and decentralized platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies with each other without having to use a centralized authority like a Coinbase or a Gemini or a CoinList, instead you just go on to Uniswap and it's a smart contract. It's not owned or run by anybody except the community and a few developers, and there's a token associated with it, but you can just automatically trade with this smart contract to turn, say, your Ethereum into a stable coin to get the equivalent of dollars or back. And so this shows how the Ethereum ecosystem is very different than the Bitcoin ecosystem."
Vitalik,"No, this is definitely a very important topic. Tokens are one of those things that's really like playing with fire, right? On the other hand, fire is crucial to human civilization, but on the other hand, fire is very evil. It can burn up your family if you're not careful. So the thing with tokens, right, is that the crypto is, space is not the only space that tried to build decentralized things, right? There were a lot of decentralized projects that are outside the crypto space, like Diaspora, the decentralized alternative to Facebook that people tried to build around 2010, is one good example. But the challenge with this pre-blockchain or non-blockchain decentralization or crypto, is that it's harder to align the incentives and motivate people to actually want to participate in building and growing the community at a large scale. You can get idealists, but the problem with idealism is that idealism is not very socially scalable. And so cryptocurrency, on the other hand, can appeal to universal values, right? Where the real universal value is getting rich for a lot of people."
Interviewer,And it seems with ETH you've been a bit of both. You've got a bit of both.
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,"You've got people who have ETH to getting rich, and then there's also a movement."
Vitalik,"Right. Exactly. And I think that balance is important, right? I think the failure of a lot of non-blockchain crypto shows the inability to do things at scale without that financial incentive. But at the same time, a lot of the more, at least in my opinion, a moral project within crypto that just care about the pump and the volume and getting a powerful and expensive token that they can get rich off of. Those projects end up not really doing well in the long term either. Right? And there have been plenty of projects where just VC funds gave hundreds of millions of dollars of capital to them, but the reality is that hundreds of millions of dollars of capital just can't buy you a soul. Right? And so, I think a lot of people end up stumbling and falling on that to some extent. So, crypto, yeah."
Interviewer,"I was going to say, I think some of that is just driven by the pre-mine phenomenon where Bitcoin had a so-called fair launch, although you can debate how fair it was, but how fair the distribution is today. But everyone started mining at the same time or everyone who was aware of it. Whereas a lot of coins that have come subsequently, the team has a pre-mine where they get a bunch of the coin in advance. And as the amount of the pre-mine goes up and the competition moves from, hey, let's mine as much Bitcoin as possible to, hey, let's just create the winning blockchain and then get the big pre-mine. So it's just move the competition from mining to creating or forking. So it's almost inevitable once pre-mines became a little bit accepted that there would be so many different blockchains."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no, I think that's definitely fair too. Ethereum, once again, that's fairly, moderate there. There was a pre-mine but no, the pre-mine was only about 12 percent, actually about 10 percent of the total supply. And people did have the opportunity to mine or to get by in the sale. And so a lot of people had the opportunity to become part of the ecosystem. But I do think that the less monetary, the movement aspect of this is important, right? If you'll just go to CoinMarketCap and you'll look at some of the top 10 coins other than say Bitcoin and Ethereum, you can't always give a good answer for what values does that token represent. Whereas, for Bitcoin, you can, for Ethereum, you can, for ZCash, for example, I think you can."
Interviewer,"Yeah. The backdrop on SushiSwap is Uniswap was this automated market maker, this decentralized exchange that launched and then they got attacked. They got cloned by this other one called SushiSwap. Joke on UNI Sushi. And then they tried to steal the Uniswap community by saying, ""Hey, come here and we'll pay you more by giving you tokens."" And then Uniswap was forced to actually create a token, which they then gave away to their community, which are called airdrops. It's like helicopter drops of money, except now it's in made-up tokens. So there's all this interesting stuff that goes on in crypto where trying to build and maintain communities, you have to figure out how to distribute the spoils, but contrast how this is compared to say Facebook or Twitter, you don't see Mark Zuckerberg airdropping Facebook stock on the users and you don't see Jack Dorsey airdropping Twitter revenues on the users, but that's exactly what happens in blockchain land. And Ethereum might've had a small pre-mine, but I do remember early on, looking at Ethereum and I think I talked to Balaji Srinivasan, one of your other guests, about it, Tim, where we were looking at ETH back in the day when it was first launching. And we were just really confused because it seemed like there was this one brilliant technical guy surrounded by 15 other people who all had the title co-founder and it was very confusing to evaluate as an investor."
Vitalik,"Comparing the regulatory situation of Ethereum and Bitcoin, I think both benefit from being highly international, right. Bitcoin has a strong community in the US, it has a strong community in China. It has a strong community in the EU and lots of other places. Ethereum is very similar in that regard. In other words, these very strong communities in lots of different countries, including countries that are not geopolitically on the same page with each other. There's a lot of resiliency in that sense. Now, of course the other aspect of politics is that it's not just about what they can do. It's also about what they want to do. The reality is that regulators have cracked down on cryptocurrency significantly less than they theoretically could, right. They theoretically could make something like Coinbase illegal overnight."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"And I think the reality is that they don't, in part because they do see a lot of the positive value that's coming out of these platforms, right. There are even regulators that want to use public blockchains and even things like Ethereum to build applications on top of them. They see value in some of the advantages that the things like stablecoins for example, could provide and non-financial applications of various kinds."
Interviewer,"Yeah. If you wanted to build a fraud proof voting application, you'd probably do it in Ethereum."
Vitalik,That'd be interesting.
Interviewer,"Yeah. Cryptocurrencies are inherently designed to be sovereign resistant, right. They're designed to be stateless. And so the geographic redundancy is one aspect of it. And some countries try to ban it. I think for a while, people think China tried to ban it and that failed. And right now, India is talking about banning it and that will end in tears, right. That's not going to go well when you leave your country out of the innovation in the next 10 years, so hopefully they don't do that. But there's also redundancy in terms of design. For example, going to proof-of-stake is a different kind of redundancy than being just all proof-of-work. You're not subject to the same kinds of attacks I think being used for all kinds of applications."
Vitalik,"Yeah. One thing that I think you alluded to a little bit, is that there's this proposal called EIP-1559, which redesigns how their transaction fee market works. And there's a lot of very wonky economic math for why the specific changes that it makes sense, but one of the consequences of that change is that the majority of fees, instead of going to the miner or corporate creates the block, we'd get burned. It would just literally get deleted out of existence. And so if demands to use Ethereum is high enough, then there would actually be more ETH being destroyed than is being created. And so the joke that I would sometimes make is, if Bitcoin knows if fixed supply is sound money, then if you have a decreasing supply, does that make us some ultrasound money? And actually it's not even that far-fetched a possibility. If you look at the transaction fees for the last month, they actually have been on a lot of days greater than the block rewards for that day."
Interviewer,"It's interesting. Bitcoin, the value is in the currency or in the Bitcoin itself. Whereas in ETH, the value is in the blockchain being used and the ETH is the by-product of it. Yeah, to use my strained castles made of math analogy, I think of Bitcoin is the big impregnable citadel the Fort Knox, into which you're putting your gold and the thing has high walls and is guarded really well. And they don't change much. And it's the same as it was in 2009 or 2011, so that no one can break in but ETH has this dynamic network of little city states that are trading with each other, so the more trade there is, the more free flow of information and goods, the more valuable the whole system becomes but no single point of it is necessarily as impregnable."
Vitalik,"Yeah. I'd agree with that, with one reservation, which is that I think the Bitcoin ecosystem does have its own ticking time bomb demons too, like Tether is one example."
Interviewer,"Yeah. There are pieces around the Bitcoin ecosystem that are semi centralized or of unknown trustworthiness and do rely on trusted third parties, I should say, but as the Bitcoin people say, ""Not your keys, not your coin.""."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"And trusted third parties are security holes. They're aware of that. I think the Bitcoin maximalists, which I believe is a term that you co-coined, the Bitcoin maximalists would say, ""Well, that's not Bitcoin, right. That's something else.""."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"One of the things to think about here, and I think you care about this more than most people in crypto, which is nice, is that you do seem to care about wealth inequality, the Gini coefficient, and the distribution of coins. And one of the criticisms about crypto that I see a lot is like, ""Well, okay. You're getting rid of the old oligarchs for this new financial system, but you're just replacing them with new oligarchs, who are the original Bitcoin and ETH holders.""."
Vitalik,"This is definitely, I think, one of the challenging questions for the community to grapple with. This is actually one of the reasons why I really like Ethereum's more multicurrency welcoming ecosystem, right. Sure, okay. You have ETH and there's a limited set of opportunities to get new ETH directly from the tap. And at some point, the supply is going to stabilize and if you're buying ETH, you're buying ETH from previous people but at the same time, there are these new applications that are launching. You have your UNI, as I mentioned, where the distribution was I thought, quite egalitarian, right. As I mentioned, the $400 UNI stimulus checks that just go to everyone who ever used the application, at least once and they could try really hard to not favor wealthy users too much."
Interviewer,"The problem is when it's unobtrusive, it's very easy to do it very sneakily."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"And these taxes have to be collected now, whereas printing can kick the can down the road for the next person to solve."
Vitalik,"Right, right. This is the argument in the other direction."
Interviewer,"There's a moral hazard there. And I think we're watching it play out. Where we printed $8 trillion last year, and who's going to pay for it?"
Vitalik,"Right, the nice thing about cryptocurrency of course, is that the ecosystem is much more transparent. And so it's easier to analyze and understand what the rules are. And within the context of a crypto ecosystem, as I mentioned, you can still do very egalitarian things. You can still reward people who were very important early contributors to things that ended up being very important. You could still do all of those things. And we do have a responsibility to get the balance right, but the environment is just inherently a more open and honest one, just because these are decentralized systems and everyone does just, they see exactly what's going on."
Interviewer,"Yeah. It's certainly more transparent. You can tell what the money supply of ETH is at any given point, good luck doing that with the US dollar money supply. Or you can tell what the inflation on ETH is at any given point. And as you say, there's opportunities to build more applications on top of ETH and maybe ETH is the app store for decentralized applications but some of those applications can go on to capture just as much value and create just as much value as ETH itself."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"I think that'll be, the really interesting development in the last year is just to see applications on top of ETH really creating and capturing and building lots of wealth and value. And so in that sense, this 2021 and 2020 run-up seem a little different to me than the 2017 run-up, which was based on just a lot of hype, frankly. As we see crypto playing out, you've also had some very interesting thoughts on everything from radical markets to political philosophy, to what happened in 2020 and so on. And we could spend a whole podcast on that but just at a very high level, you had a really good post on your blog saying Endnotes on 2020. And it was about a lot more than just crypto. What else are you really interested in these days? Is it AGI? Is it life extension? Is it public goods? Is it different kinds of voting schemes? What's really on top of mind for you that's not directly crypto related?"
Vitalik,"Some of all of those. I think the changing way in which economics works is definitely one of those really important topics, right. There's a couple of different changes that's happening. One of them that I talked about is just public goods becoming more important, right. A lot of the ways that people had thought of economics 50 or a hundred years ago, they're just focused on private goods, like cars, houses, food, things like that but there's also public goods, right, which are projects that benefit a large and unselective group of people."
Interviewer,"Basically, these public goods are aware that the costs are concentrated. If I want to fund scientific research, I do it out of my own pocket, but it benefits all of humanity. The benefits are distributed."
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,And so these tend to be undersupplied. There tend to be too few of them.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,And so there are schemes out there to tackle some of them. I think you've talked about quadratic funding as an example.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,What is quadratic funding?
Vitalik,"Quadratic funding is this interesting mechanism that basically says anyone can donate money to public goods through the mechanism but to compensate for this under provision that you talk about, the mechanism provides a subsidy to every public good. And that subsidy depends not just on the amount that was contributed but also on the total number of people who contributed, right. For example, if there's two projects, they both got a hundred dollars but one of them got say, $80 from one person and $20 from another person. And the second project just got $1 from each of a hundred people, the second public good is much more public than the first public good. And the tragedy of the commons on the second one, is, much greater, right."
Interviewer,"A question on quadratic funding, just to hop in here, since I'm involved with a few different types of scientific research. Are those funders in those experiments that you've run, anonymized or de-anonymized because I'm thinking through the example you gave and how there are other plausible explanations for why there might be two funders. I'm just thinking about for instance, reputational risk associated with certain types of scientific research."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,There are other plausible explanations but those largely hinge on named names versus them being anonymous.
Vitalik,"Yes, right."
Interviewer,"How do you think about other contributing factors, depending on how you're conducting the experiments?"
Vitalik,"Sure. First of all, in quadratic funding, unfortunately, you do need to have some kind of model for identity because you need to prevent the two people from just pretending that they are 100 people."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"But with cryptography, you actually can do fancy things that give you most of the benefit from having anonymity, despite needing to have an identity system. Basically, you can have a system where people can make all these contributions and they are done in such a way that the system identifies how many unique contributors there are for each project but where the system does not get an idea, nobody actually gets any idea of exactly which particular person donated how much money to which particular project, right. And this is done using this really important and fascinating topic of a zero-knowledge proof cryptography. And zero-knowledge proof cryptography, basically, the idea is that it allows you to make cryptographic proofs that some statement that's true. I can make a cryptographic proof that says that I have 100 coins or that you assigned a message that contains some facts about me and it was signed with your key and you can make these proofs but where the proof does not reveal the contents of the thing that it's proven, right."
Interviewer,"Seems very powerful. Just to follow up on that, thinking of scientific research, I'm going to ask you what areas you might have particular personal interest in. I know you have some interest in life extension as evidenced by the dragon slang parable on your website or that you link to from your Twitter bio but it strikes me that the quadratic funding experiments would also be heavily dependent on equally simplistic or simplified communication of competing, not necessarily competing but contrasted scientific studies, right because there are some instances just in my experience where scientific studies that require a lot of scientific knowledge or due diligence, would have fewer funders compared to others but that doesn't necessarily reflect less importance or impact potential."
Vitalik,"Yes. No, this is also a very important point. And I think the solution to this is that quadratic funding by itself doesn't solve all the problems and you have to combine quadratic funding with other mechanisms. I can give two examples. One example of how you could do this, is you could just set up an organization where the organization has some smart people and those smart people do a good job of picking who the scientists are that are really worth funding. And then that organization gets a five- or 10-year history. And people see that, ""Oh. Yes, this organization does have a surprisingly good track record of funding studies that actually do end up turning out to be meaningful five years down the line.""."
Interviewer,"I love this possibility to combine also, right. You could potentially have all of the elements that you described combined."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And Naval, you sound like you want to jump in."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no. You brought up life extension. Life extension is definitely really important to me. And the coronavirus has actually even had the positive side effect of speeding this along in some ways but there's a lot of extremely promising things happening in biotech, right. And I think there's a very significant chance that where we're standing today, is basically, is for biotech, the equivalent of where computers were in 1950, right. And so if you imagine the difference between the ENIAC and a modern laptop or smartphone, that's the difference that we're going to see between the biotech of 2020 and the biotech of 2090."
Interviewer,"Do you think that's realistic though, given all the three-letter agencies that slow down experimentation development? Because I worry it's more like nuclear power where they can't tolerate a single death, so the innovation isn't really allowed."
Vitalik,"Right, so this is where I say a controversial thing, which is I think I'm very happy that the coronavirus has helped to de-legitimize bioconservatism to the extent that it has."
Interviewer,Yeah I agree with that. The Moderna vaccine was ready on January 13th.
Vitalik,"Yes. And even things like human challenge studies like the default I think bioethics opinion around a year ago was like ""Oh, my God this is unethical."" And now, like in the UK, they're actually happening. No, this is great."
Interviewer,"Yeah, it is good if it breaks down bioconservatism to some extent, because the pace of innovation is too low. It's like what we've done to nuclear power if we do that to biotech and we kind of have already to some extent but if we do it even more then, there's no chance of grandma living forever, there's not even a chance of me living 50 years longer, let alone grandma living forever. You're 27; I'd love to see where you're at 47. You're going to be a really interesting guy. You already are, but you're going to be an even more interesting guy."
Vitalik,But I hope you guys can both come to my thousandth birthday party.
Interviewer,"Well, are you on some kind of caloric restriction or intermittent fasting?"
Vitalik,"So far I do the poor man's intermittent fasting, which is that I just usually don't eat breakfast. I do again the usual exercise, nothing too fancy. I eat kind of at least a couple of the basic supplements that the life extension cool people are recommending. Nothing too much fancier than that so far, though very closely watching this space and then I'm sure I'll end up doing much more things so 10 or even five years from now."
Interviewer,Do you take rapamycin?
Vitalik,I do not take rapamycin. Metformin is the one that I take. Ashwagandha is another that I take.
Interviewer,"And just for those people listening, who should know this. Number one, none of this is medical advice. Number two, metformin, just as an example, none of these things should be taken without advice of a medical professional, metformin is used in the treatment of type two diabetes, glucophage, but I'm also familiar with it. How do you decide what to implement versus not implement for yourself personally?"
Vitalik,"I just ask around a lot of people in the life extension community. I read the studies as I look at just what are some of the high level results, and then just kind of narrow it down to a couple of things."
Interviewer,"It is remarkable how many people in various sub-communities have been using a lot of these interventions longitudinally. I remember when I was working on my second book looking into trans-resveratrol and finding, even at that time this was 2008, 2009. People who had for years been using want to say 500 milligrams per day. So you were able to identify certain long-term effects and side effects granted anecdotally, but still having an N of, I don't know, maybe a thousand people on this forum. So there is a lot to be gleaned from these groups."
Vitalik,"It is, yeah. It's literally half the deaths of World War II for every year that it gets delayed or however that number of lives saved for every year that gets brought earlier."
Interviewer,"One analogy I heard that I liked was, ""We're all born time billionaires with billions of seconds of life."" And then we spend those and now you get to someone like Warren Buffett and I'm sure he would trade a hundred billion dollars for more billions of seconds, but he can't, right? In fact, healthcare is the ultimate inelastic good. On your deathbed you'll spend any amount of money to live even an hour longer. So certainly the economic incentives are there, the personal incentives are there, but because of this concept that people who don't know what they're doing are going to hear something and run out and ingest some substance and then die, drink bleach, or take too much rapamycin, because of that kind of fear we're not allowed to do any real innovation or discovery and it's literally killing us outright."
Vitalik,"Yeah. I think that another important thing also is just kind of international outreach and more connections because ultimately the US is not the center of the universe and there's plenty of very smart people in the EU like Singapore, China, India, Canada, whatever other places. And there's a lot of great talent there that I think could also benefit, help all of humanity solve problems faster. So if we can just work together on the problem more, hopefully, prevent kind of like stupid nationalism from adding too much friction between things."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I think a lot of the newer generation, rather than just being patrons of the arts, they're trying to figure out how to become patrons of science. And instead of just doing venture capital, we'd all like to figure out a model for venture research because we need more science, right? Science is upstream of technology and the faster we can move science, the more it'll benefit us across the board. So I don't know where else you want to take this Tim but I have some kind of more of the closing questions type for Vitalik. If you're ready for those."
Vitalik,"Well, aging is an example that's like it's the contrarian in the world, but definitely not contrarian among my circles, I guess."
Interviewer,"When I went through your writings, the idea that there will be many blockchains and many tokens, right, is quite different. The idea that the internet has increased the number of public goods rather than the number of private goods is actually quite contrarian because we think of it as going more and more private property, but on the internet it's one-to-many so there's all these public goods. And I think you were the first one to really hammer that point home in a big way. And then I think this aging thing is another one. So, I'm just digging, seeing if there's any more."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no, another thing that might've been iconoclastic two years ago, but is very much not today would be a kind of just geographic decentralization, right? Even with Ethereum we took a very active effort of not making it too centralized in any one country or any one city in any one place. And I feel like we've benefited a lot from that, but now of course, everyone is geographically decentralizing and Coinbase has announced that none of its management live in San Francisco and so forth."
Interviewer,Yeah. It's very hard to associate Ethereum with a single country. I think it was created by mostly Canadians and your blog has a .ca on top of the domain.
Vitalik,"Well, it depends. I'm a Canadian, but then my blog has a .ca the foundation is Swiss, and now there is a Singaporean entity as well. A lot of the initial developers were German. A lot of developers are from the US as well, one of the most efficient Eth2 clients is based in Australia. So I feel like we kind of actually took those values seriously and did it well."
Interviewer,"And the Foundation has spent a lot of time in East Asia. I think I've seen you kind of go conference to conference in East Asia, and Korea, and Japan, and places like that spreading the word so, it is quite decentralized geographically, what advice do you have for someone who wants to get into Ethereum, and doesn't just want to go and buy the token, right? Who actually wants to dive into the ecosystem, what is a person to do to get involved in the Ethereum community and the ecosystem? Where are the points of leverage?"
Vitalik,"I think one is learning to build an application and actually trying to build an application is I think one, a great place to start. If that's the sort of thing that interests you, even if you don't turn it out as a full-time developer, it's like forcing yourself through the process still helps you just understand what are the different pieces and actually what function do they serve? Another approach there is, well now obviously, they're kind of temporarily suspended, but generally there's a lot of local communities that kind of in-person meetups and all that, that people can be part of and that's often a great opportunity to get to meet other Ethereum people."
Interviewer,"Yeah, for those of you who are curious, I think Vitalik's blog has spawned quite a few of the things in the Ethereum secret ecosystem. I think it was one of your musings that led to the creation of Uniswap. And, recently you've been talking about roll-ups, and social wallets, and all kinds of other things that we built on top. Although maybe this is the first year where I feel like the community is outpacing your ideas like with Nifties, and with some of the games that are coming up on top of ETH and so on. it does seem like there's a lot of innovation going on. It's hard to keep up. It's very very hard to keep up, but that's a good thing."
Vitalik,"Yeah the moon math is definitely significantly less moony than it was even one or two years ago, even Zk-SNARKs, another term for zero-knowledge proofs, have just become considerably simpler sometime around one and a half years ago. I might even try to make another post. I might modify my most recent ones on vitalik.ca where I tried to talk about like, how, roughly, Zk-SNARKs work. And I actually feel like I need an explanation that at least the high school version of myself would have understood, which is, it's still not perfect, but it's significantly more understandable than any of the previous ones have been. So I feel like the ideas are definitely trickling down. So I do have another answer to the question of what contrarian things or what things are you thinking about that other people are not thinking about yet?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. I think there's a lot of good points you just made. One I like is that government is not an entity or an enemy on the battlefield. It may just be the battlefield that all of these factors can kind of win simultaneously. I think you made this point in your blog in one place where you said that in 2020, big government won, big social media won, big centralized applications won, but decentralized also won. So you can have multiple winners. These aren't necessarily either or you've also made an argument in one of your blog posts, which is also beyond the scope of this podcast. But I think it's worth digging into for people interested in game theory, where you basically point out that a lot of the toy models that we consider when we're evaluating how these things will end up have a so-called Nash equilibrium."
Vitalik,"Sure. So for any language, my usual approach is, I think at the beginning, you do need some kind of explicit program. So one thing that I've used is the Pimsleur podcasts. So that's P-I-M-S-L-E-U-R, so it's just a series of these 90-minute, sorry, 90 30-minute podcasts or 2,700 minutes, or about two days in total that, you'll listen to one of them every day and they just help teach you the language from nothing up to some very basic level over the course of these 90 episodes. So you start from that, but then even after that, you don't have nearly enough to understand anything. So from there, sometimes you can find other podcasts, and eventually you graduate to just regular podcasts in that language."
Interviewer,"Yeah great advice. And I'll just add to that Google translate with image translation can be an incredible savior in lands where you don't understand the orthography. So, in Japan, my brother doesn't speak Japanese, but we traveled there and he was able to more or less accurately translate kanji, hans, and the Chinese characters using Google Translate, it was remarkably accurate. It's improved a lot. And as I understand it, another thing that you've done is watching, now I'd like to clarify here, is it watching films in other languages, or is it watching English language films with subtitles in your target language, which is also something I've done."
Vitalik,It is watching films in other languages. Sometimes with subtitles in English.
Interviewer,"Got it. Thank you. Naval would you like to wrap up, would you like to."
Vitalik,"I think I'm not even the youngest already. I mean like Hayden from Uniswap is even younger than I am. And you know, the Uniswap treasury has more funds in it than the Ethereum Foundation treasury. And so this revolution proceeds fast, man."
Interviewer,"Yeah. When I was first starting out my first company, I remember I was 25 and CEO and company was valued highly. And the CTO of the company, he was in his mid-thirties, he said, ""Huh."" He said, ""So you're used to being the smartest young guy in the room, right? Just wait till you get old."" And here we are. Thank you, gentlemen."
Vitalik,Ethereum has a lot of interesting technical ideas that are defining the future of blogging technology.
Interviewer,And the topic is one of the most brilliant people innovating in the space today.
Vitalik,"Unlike Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown person or group that created Bitcoin, Retallack is very well known and at a young age is thrust into the limelight as one of the main faces of the technology that may redefine the nature of money and all forms of digital transactions in the 21st century."
Interviewer,"This is the artificial intelligence podcast, if you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars, an Apple podcast supported on Patrón or simply connect with me on Twitter."

Interviewer,And now here's my conversation with the topic Budarin.
Vitalik,"So before we talk about the fundamental ideas behind a theory of the currency, perhaps it'd be nice to to talk about the the origin story of Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto."
Interviewer,"You gave a talk that started with sort of asking the question, what did Satoshi Nakamoto actually invent? Maybe you could say, who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what did he invent? Sure."
Vitalik,So Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came up with Bitcoin.
Interviewer,"So the reason why I say the name by which we know is that this is the anonymous fellow who has shown himself to us only over the Internet, just by first publishing the white paper for Bitcoin, then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin, and then talking to the very early Bitcoin community on Bitcoin forums and and interacting with that, but helping the project blog for a couple of years."
Vitalik,"And then at some point in late 2010, early 2011, he disappeared."
Interviewer,So Bitcoin is a fairly unique project and how it has this kind of.
Vitalik,Mythical kind of quasi godlike founder who is just kind of popped in and did the thing and then disappeared and we've somehow just never heard from him again.
Interviewer,So in 2008 was the white paper was the first do you know the white paper was the first time the name will actually appear Satoshi Nakamoto?.
Vitalik,"If so, so how is it possible that the creator of such impactful project remains anonymous?."
Interviewer,"That's a tough question and there's no similarity to it in the history of technology, as far as I'm aware."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"So one possibility is that it's Delphine because Delphine was also active in the Bitcoin community and as how Affinia in those two beginning years and how is how thin he may be, he is one of the people at the end of early cypherpunk community."
Vitalik,"He was a computer scientist, computer scientists, cryptographers, people interested in technology, Internet freedom, those kinds of topics."
Interviewer,Was it correct that there that he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest or the first transaction of Bitcoin?.
Vitalik,"Yes, the first transaction of Bitcoin was between Satoshi and Delphine."
Interviewer,"Do you think he knew who Satoshi was if he wasn't Satoshi, you probably know how is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything about their fundamental identity?."
Vitalik,Is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the Internet? I like to think about it because you and I just met now there's a there's a depth of knowledge that we now have about each other that's like physical like my vision system is able to recognize you.
Interviewer,I can also verify your identity of uniqueness.
Vitalik,"Like, yeah, this like it's very hard to fake you being you."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"So the Internet, the Internet has a fundamentally different quality to it, which is just fascinating."
Interviewer,"Definitely interesting, as I definitely just know a lot of people just by their Internet handles."
Vitalik,"And to me when I think of them, like I see their Internet handles and one of them has a profile picture is the same kind of face that's kind of not quite human with a bunch of psychedelic colors."
Interviewer,And what I visualize have to just visualize that that's not an actual face.
Vitalik,"Yeah, you are the creator of the second."
Interviewer,"Well, he's currently the second most popular cryptocurrency Ethereum."
Vitalik,"So on this topic for just the Constitution to come over for a little bit longer, you may be the most qualified person to speak to the psychology of this anonymity that we're talking about, like your identity is known, like I've just verified it."
Interviewer,"But from your perspective, what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining anonymous like a fucking psychoanalyse, Satoshi Nakamoto? Is there something interesting there or is that just a peculiar quirk of him?."
Vitalik,It definitely helps create this kind of image of this sort of neutral thing that doesn't belong to anyone.
Interviewer,"And then you've created a project and because you're anonymous and because you also have disappear or as unfortunately happened to health, any of that is him."
Vitalik,He ended up dying of Gehrig's disease and he is in a cryogenic freezer now.
Interviewer,"But if you pop in and you and you created an in your God and all that's remaining of that whole process is the thing itself, then no one can go and try to interpret any of your other behavior and try to understand, like, oh, the this person wrote this thing in some essay idea at age 16 where he expressed particular opinions about democracy."
Vitalik,"And so because of that, this project is like is a state that's trying to do this specific thing."
Interviewer,"Instead, it creates this environment where the thing is what you make of it and it doesn't have the right or the burden of your other ideas, political thought and so on."
Vitalik,So so now we're sitting with you.
Interviewer,Do you feel the burden of being kind of the face of a theory?.
Vitalik,"I mean, there's a very large community of developers, but nevertheless, you know, is there like a burden associated with that?."
Interviewer,There definitely is.
Vitalik,"This is definitely a big reason why I've been trying to kind of push for the Ethereum ecosystem to become more decentralized in many ways, just encouraging a lot of and, of course, theory and work to happen outside of the theory of foundation and of expanding the number of people that are making different kinds of decisions, having kind of multiple software limitations instead of one and all of these things."
Interviewer,"There's a lot of things that have tried to do it to and remove myself as a single points of failure, because that is something that a lot of people criticize, criticize me for."
Vitalik,"So if you look at, like, the most fundamentally successful open source projects, it seems that it's a sad reality."
Interviewer,When I think about it is it seems to be that one person is a crucial contributor.
Vitalik,"Often you feel Galina's from from for for Linux, for the kernel that is possible."
Interviewer,And I'm definitely not planning to disappear.
Vitalik,"And that's the interesting tension that projects that this kind of desire a single entity, and yet they're fundamentally distributed."
Interviewer,I don't know if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking about the future of cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,Does there need to be a leader?.
Interviewer,"There's different kinds of leaders, you know, there's there's dictators who control all the money, there's people who control organizations, there's a kind of high priests that just have themselves have their Twitter followers."
Vitalik,"What kind of leader are you, would you say?."
Interviewer,"You know, in these days, actually a bit more of the high in the high priest direction than before? Yeah, like."
Vitalik,"I definitely actually don't do all that much of kind of going around and ordering theory foundation people to do things, because I think those things are important."
Interviewer,"If there's something that I do think it's important that I do, just usually I kind of say it publicly or just sort of say it to people."
Vitalik,And quite often projects just sort of start doing it.
Interviewer,So let's ask the high philosophical question about money.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,What at the highest level is money? What is money?.
Vitalik,It's a kind of game and it's a game where you have points.
Interviewer,"And if you have points, there is this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else's points by the same number."
Vitalik,"And these sorts of fair game, hopefully."
Interviewer,"Well, it's one kind of fair game."
Vitalik,"Like, for example, you know, you can have other kinds of fair games, like you're going to have a game where if I give someone a points and you give someone a points, then instead of that person getting two points, that person gets four points."
Interviewer,And that's also fair is the but no money is easy to set up for.
Vitalik,And it serves a lot of useful functions.
Interviewer,And so it kind of just survives in society as a meme for thousands of years.
Vitalik,"It's useful for the storage of wealth, it's useful for the exchange of value, and it's also useful for denominating future payments to account as a unit of account."
Interviewer,So what if you look at the history of money in human civilization?.
Vitalik,"What just if you're a student of history, like how has its role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time, in your view? Even if we just look at the 20th century before and then leading up to cryptocurrency, that's something you think about."
Interviewer,"Yeah, and I think I think the big thing in the 20th century is that if we saw a lot more intermediation and yes, I think in the first part is kind of the move from being adding more of different kinds of banking."
Vitalik,And then we saw the move from that of dollars being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold.
Interviewer,That's only redeemable by certain people.
Vitalik,"The dollar is not being backed by anything, too."
Interviewer,"And it's just this system where you have a bunch of free floating currencies and then people like getting rid of bank accounts and then those things becoming electronic, people getting accounts with payment processors that have bank accounts."
Vitalik,So
Interviewer,So what do you make of that?.
Vitalik,"That's a fascinating philosophical idea, that money might not be backed by anything."
Interviewer,What is that like confessing to you that money can exist without being backed by something physical?.
Vitalik,It definitely is.
Interviewer,"What do you make of that fact? How is that possible? Is that stable? If you look at the future of human civilization, is it possible to have money at the large scale, at such a hugely productive and rich societies, be able to operate successfully without money being backed by anything physical? Feel like? The interesting thing about the 21st century especially, is that a lot of the important valuable things are not backed by anything."
Vitalik,"Like if you look at the tech companies, for example, something like Twitter, and you could theoretically imagine that if all of the employees wanted to, they could kind of come together, they would quit and start working on Twitter 2.0 and then."
Interviewer,The value of and just kind of build the the the exact same products or possibly build a better product and then just kind of continue on from there.
Vitalik,And the original the original Twitter would just not have people left anymore.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,Like the there is theoretically kind of code and like IP that's owned by the company.
Interviewer,"But in reality, like good programmers could probably read up, rewrite all that stuff in three months."
Vitalik,So the like the reason why the thing has value is just kind of network effects and coordination.
Interviewer,Problems like these employees in reality are going to switch all at once.
Vitalik,And also the users aren't all going to switch at once because it's just difficult for them to switch at once.
Interviewer,"And so there is this kind of metastable and if equilibrium in interactions between thousands and millions of people that are just actually quite sticky, even though if you try to kind of assume that every once a perfectly rational and kind of perfectly slippery spherical cow, they don't seem to exist at all that stickiness."
Vitalik,"Do you have a sense, a grasp of the sort of the fundamental dynamic, like the physics of that stickiness? It seems to work, but and I think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely in it working."
Interviewer,"And it's you know, it's the sort of thing that's definitely been economically model a lot like one the kind of analogy of something similar that you often see in textbooks as like what is the government like if for like 80 percent of people in a country just like tomorrow, suddenly had the idea that the laws that are currently the laws and the government that currently is the government are just people."
Vitalik,And some other thing is the government and they just kind of start acting like it then that we're kind of become the new reality.
Interviewer,"And then the question is, well, what happens if and if between zero and 80 people or an 80 percent of people start believing that like what is the thing? You all you see is that if there is one of these kind of switches happening is kind of revolution, then if you're the first person to join, then you probably don't have the incentive to do that."
Vitalik,"But then if you're the 50 fifth percentile person to join, then suddenly becomes quite safe, too."
Interviewer,And so it's definitely is the sort of thing that you can kind of try to analyze that understands mathematically.
Vitalik,But one of the kind of results is that the sort of like when the switch happens definitely can be chaotic sometimes.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"But still like to me, the idea that the network effects that the fact that human beings at a scale like millions or billions can share even the idea of currency like."
Interviewer,"Yeah, all agree."
Vitalik,That's just I know economic model.
Interviewer,"I'm a skeptic on economics and it's like some my my favorite sort of field, maybe recreationally."
Vitalik,Psychology is trying to change human behavior.
Interviewer,"And I think sometimes people just kind of pretend that they can have a grasp on human behavior, even though we it's such a messy space that all the models that psychology or economics, those different perspectives on human behavior can have or are difficult."
Vitalik,It's difficult to know how much that's wishful thinking and how much it is actually getting to the core of understanding human behavior.
Interviewer,"But on that idea, what do you think is the role of money in human motivation?."
Vitalik,"So do you think money from an economics perspective, from a psychology perspective, is core to like human desires?."
Interviewer,Money is definitely very far from the only motivator.
Vitalik,It is a big motivator.
Interviewer,"And that's one of the closest things you have to a universal motivator, I think, because ultimately, in almost any person in the world, if you ask them to do something, they'll be more inclined to do it."
Vitalik,If you also offer some offer the money.
Interviewer,And that's like there's definitely many cases where people will do things other than things that maximize how much money they have.
Vitalik,And that happens all the time.
Interviewer,"But like the a lot of those other things are kind of much more specific to and if that person is and of what their situation is, the relationship between the motive in the action and these other things."
Vitalik,"What do you think is the interplay of the other motivator, like Neetu prospectives, power?."
Interviewer,"Do you think money equals power or do you think those are conflicting ideas? Do you think I mean, that's one of the ideas that decentralized currency, decentralized applications are looking at, is who holds the power?."
Vitalik,"Yeah, money is there."
Interviewer,"Only a kind of power, and there's definitely people who want money because it gives them power, and then even if my money doesn't seem to explicitly be about money, a lot of things that people spend money on are ultimately about social status of some kind."
Vitalik,So I definitely view those two things as of Interplaying.
Interviewer,And then there's also money as just a way of like measuring how successful you are.
Vitalik,"I guess the scoreboard right to this kind of gets back to the game, really."
Interviewer,"Like if you have four billion dollars, then the main benefit you get from going out, one of the big benefits you get from going up to six billion dollars is that now instead of being below the guy who has five year above, the guy who has five."
Vitalik,So you think money could be kind of in the game of life? It's also a measure of self-worth is Zarqawi.
Interviewer,It's definitely how how a lot of people perceive it.
Vitalik,Define ourselves in the hierarchy of.
Interviewer,"Yeah, and I'm not not saying it's sign of a healthy thing that people define their self-worth as money because it's definitely far from a perfect indicator of how much you value you provide to society or anything like this."
Vitalik,"But I definitely think that as a matter of kind of current practice, a bunch of people do feel that way."
Interviewer,So what does utopia from an economic perspective look like to you?.
Vitalik,What is a perfect world look like?.
Interviewer,I guess segue to the economist's utopia would be one where kind of.
Vitalik,"Everything is incentive airlines in the in the sense that there are kind of conflicts between what satisfies your goals and of what is good for everyone in the world, in the world as a whole, would you think that would look like?."
Interviewer,Does that mean they're still poor people and rich people? There's still income inequality.
Vitalik,Do you think sort of Marxist ideas are strong?.
Interviewer,"Do you think sort of ideas of objectivism are like where the market rules is strong? Like what? Is there a different economic philosophies that just seem to be reflective of utopia would be? No, I definitely think the existing economic philosophy is do end up kind of systematically deviating from the utopia."
Vitalik,"And a lot of ways, like one of the big things I talk about, for example, is public goods and public goods are especially important on the Internet has like the idea is what kind of money has this game where I was a few coin, a few coins and you gave the same number of coins, that this usually happens in a trade where I wish some money."
Interviewer,"You gain some money, you lose a sandwich and I get a sandwich."
Vitalik,And this kind of model works really well when the thing that we're using money to incentivize the sort of private goods.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,Things that you provide to one person to really benefit comes to one person.
Interviewer,"But the like on the Internet especially, but also many, many contacts."
Vitalik,"And if off the Internet there's actions that of individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit going to one person, the benefit just goes to many people at the same time."
Interviewer,And you can't control where the benefit goes to.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So, for example, this podcast know we publish it and when it's published, you don't have any fine grained control over like, oh, these thirty eight thousand people could watch it and then like these other twenty nine thousand people can't."
Vitalik,It's like once the number goes high enough then people just copy it.
Interviewer,And then when I write articles on a blog that they're just free for everyone and that stuff's even harder to prevent anyone from copying.
Vitalik,"So aside from that, things like, you know, scientific research, for example, and even taking more pedestrian examples like climate change mitigation would be a big one."
Interviewer,So there's a lot of things in the world where you have these kind of individual actions which have concentrated costs and distributed benefits and money as a point system does not do a good job of encouraging these things.
Vitalik,"And one of the other things, even tangentially connected to crypto, but kind of theoretically outside of it that I work on is the sort of mechanism called quadratics funding."
Interviewer,"And the way to think about it is kind of imagine a point system where if if one person gives coins and gives coins to one other person, then it works the same way as money."
Vitalik,"But if multiple people give coins to one person and they do so anonymously, so it's kind of not in consideration for a specific service to that person themselves, then the number of coins the received by that person is of greater than just the sum of the number of coins that have given by those different people."
Interviewer,"So the actual formula is you take the square root of the amount that each person gave, then you add all the square roots and then you have to square the subscript."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,Then give that.
Vitalik,"And the idea here would basically be that if let's say, for example, you just started going off kind of planting a lot of trees and there's a bunch of people that are really happy that you're planting trees."
Interviewer,So they go an all kind of throw a coin your way.
Vitalik,"Then the there is like basically the fact that kind of you get more than the Sobhi, you get this kind of square of some of these of a square root, some of these tiny amounts is that this actually kind of compensates for the tragedy of the commons redness."
Interviewer,There is even this kind of mathematical proof that it's sort of optimally compensates for it.
Vitalik,"What is the tragedy of the Commons? This is just this idea that if there is this situation where there is some public good that lots of people benefit from, then no individual person wants to contribute to it, because if they contribute, they only get a small part of the benefit from their contribution."
Interviewer,But they pay the full cost of their contribution.
Vitalik,In which context is this?.
Interviewer,So what does the term quadratic quadratic funding like?.
Vitalik,What's in which context does this mechanism use for so obvious?.
Interviewer,You said.
Vitalik,"To combat the tragedy of the Commons, but in which context you see it as useful if you practice this."
Interviewer,"Yes, theoretically public goods in general."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So like like services, like what do we what are we talking about?."
Vitalik,"What the public does within the ethereal ecosystem, for example, like we've actually tried using this mechanism."
Interviewer,I wrote a couple of articles about the sort of on Vitello dossier where I go through some of the most recent rounds.
Vitalik,And it's been really interesting.
Interviewer,"Some of the top ones that people supported, there were things like just online user interfaces that make it easier for people to interact with a theory."
Vitalik,"There was no documentation, there are podcasts, there were no software and of clients the kind of implementations of the theory and protocol of privacy tools, just like lots of things that are useful to lots of people."
Interviewer,There weren't a lot of people are contributing like funding a particular particular entity.
Vitalik,That's really that's really interesting.
Interviewer,"Is there something special about the quadratic, the the the sum of the square roots? And."
Vitalik,"Yeah, so another way to think about it is like, imagine if any people each give a dollar, then the person gets and squared."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,And and so each individual person's contribution gets multiplied by an and because they have nine people.
Interviewer,And so that kind of perfectly compensates for the kind of end one tragedy of the commons.
Vitalik,I just wonder if the squared part is fundamental though.
Interviewer,It is.
Vitalik,And I'd recommend you go to the overtalk Nazia.
Interviewer,"I have this article called A Quadratic Payments, a Primer and highly recommended."
Vitalik,It's kind of at least my attempt so far of exploiting the intuition behind this intuition.
Interviewer,"So if we could, can we go to the the very basics?."
Vitalik,What is the block chain?.
Interviewer,"Or perhaps we might even start at the the Byzantine generals problem in presenting fault tolerance in general, that I Bitcoin was taking steps to providing a solution for them."
Vitalik,"So the Byzantine generals problem, it's this paper that Leslie Lamport published in nineteen eighty two where he has to start experiments where if you have two generals that are kind of camped out on opposite sides of a city and they're planning when to attack the city, then the question is then of how could those generals coordinate with each other and they could send messengers between each other."
Interviewer,But those messengers kind of could get sniped by the enemy on the road road.
Vitalik,"Some of those messages could end up being traitors, that if things could end up happening and with just the two best generals, it turns out that there's kind of no solution and a finite number of rounds."
Interviewer,That guarantee is that they will be able to kind of coordinate on the same answer.
Vitalik,"But then in the case where you have more than two generals to then once we analyze this case as like, ah, the messenger message is kind of just all messages are the messages kind of signed messages."
Interviewer,So I could give you a solid message and you can pass along that side the message.
Vitalik,And the third party could still verify that.
Interviewer,I originally made that message.
Vitalik,"And depending on those different cases, there is kind of different bounds."
Interviewer,"I'd like given how many generals that how many traitors among those generals and like under what conditions, you actually can't agree what to launch an attack."
Vitalik,So it's actually a big misconception that the Byzantine generals problem was unsolved.
Interviewer,So ultimately the reports solved it.
Vitalik,"The thing that was unsolved, though, is that all of these solutions assume that you have already agreed on a fixed list of who the generals are."
Interviewer,And these generals have to be kind of semi trusted to some extent.
Vitalik,"They can't just be anonymous people because if they're anonymous, then, like the enemy could just be ninety nine percent of the generals."
Interviewer,And so.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"The, um, in the 1980s, in the nineteen nineties, head of the general use case for distributed system stuff was more kind of enterprise, the stuff where you could kind of assume that you know who the nodes are that are running these kind of computer networks."
Vitalik,"So if you wants to have some kind of decentralized computer network that pretends to be a single computer that you can kind of do and have operations on, then it's made out of the sort of fifty and specific computers."
Interviewer,And we know kind of cool and where they are.
Vitalik,"And so we have a good reason to believe that, say, at least 11 of them would be fine and it could also be within a six."
Interviewer,Legal system.
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,"Almost a network of devices, sensors go on like an airplanes and I think like flight systems in general still use these kinds of ideas."
Vitalik,Yep.
Interviewer,Yep.
Vitalik,So that's the 80s.
Interviewer,That's the 80s and 90s.
Vitalik,"Now, the cypherpunks had a different use case in mind, which is that they wanted to create a fully decentralized global position with currency."
Interviewer,"And the problem here is that they didn't want any authorities and they didn't even want any kind of privilege, the list of people."
Vitalik,"And so now the question is, well, how do you use these techniques to create consensus when you have no way of kind of measuring identity is right."
Interviewer,You have no way of determining whether or not some 99 percent of participants aren't actually all the same guy.
Vitalik,"And so the clever solution that Satoshi had, this is kind of going back to that presentation I made at Def Con a few months ago where I said that the things that she invented was crypto economics."
Interviewer,"Is this really neat idea that you can use economic resources to kind of limit identify how many identities you can get and the if there isn't any existing decentralized digital currency, that the only way to do this is with proof of work."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So with proof of work, the solution is just."
Vitalik,"You publish a solution to a hard mathematical puzzle that takes some kind of clearly calculable amount of computational power to solve, you get an identity and then you solve five of those puzzles, you get five identities."
Interviewer,And then these are the identities that we run the kids and the cell growth of between.
Vitalik,So the proof of work mechanism you just described is like the fundamental idea proposed in man in the white paper defines bitcoin.
Interviewer,What's the idea of consensus that we wish to reach worldwide consensus important here? What is consensus?.
Vitalik,"So the goal here is just simple technical terms is to basically kind of wired together a set of a large number of computers in such a way that the kind of pretends to the outside world to be a single computer where that single user keeps working, even if a large portion of the kind of constituents computers that make it up, break it kind of break in arbitrary ways, like they could shut off, they could try to actively break a system, they could do lots of things."
Interviewer,So the reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do this is because they wanted to run one particular program on this virtual computer.
Vitalik,And the one particular program that they wanted to run is just a currency system.
Interviewer,Right? It's a system that just processes a series of transactions.
Vitalik,"And for every transaction, it verifies that the sender has enough coins to pay for the transaction and verifies that the digital signature is correct."
Interviewer,"And if the checks pass, then it subtracts the coins from one account to announce the coins to the other account to roughly."
Vitalik,"So first of all, the the the proof of work idea has kind of I mean, at least to me, seems pretty fascinating."
Interviewer,It is.
Vitalik,"I mean, that's a kind of revolutionary idea."
Interviewer,Is it is it obvious to come up with that? You can use you can exchange basically computational resources for for identity.
Vitalik,So it's it actually has a pretty long history.
Interviewer,"It was first proposed in a paper by Cynthia Work and the DNA or in nineteen ninety four, I believe, and the original use case was combating email spam."
Vitalik,"So the idea is that if you send an email, you have to send it with the work attached and like this makes it reasonably cheap to send emails to your friends, but it makes it really expensive to send spam to a billion people."
Interviewer,"Yeah, that's a simple, brilliant idea."
Vitalik,So maybe also taking a step back.
Interviewer,So what is the role of block chain in this?.
Vitalik,What is the block chain? Sure.
Interviewer,So the blocking my way of thinking about it is that it is this kind of system where you have this kind of one virtual computer created by a bunch of these nodes in the network.
Vitalik,"And the reason why the term block chain is used is because the data structure that these systems used, at least so far, is one where they have different nodes in the network periodically publish blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions together with a pointer, like a hash of a a previous block that it builds on top of."
Interviewer,And so you have a series of blocks that that nodes in the network create for each bullet points to the previous block.
Vitalik,And so you have this chain of them is fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of block chain or a lot of possibilities of different ways to make sure there's no funny stuff going on.
Interviewer,There are indeed a lot of possibilities.
Vitalik,"So any kind of just simple architecture, as I just described, the way the fault tolerance happens is like this, right? So you have a bunch of nodes and they're just happily of occasionally creating blocks, building on top of each other's blocks."
Interviewer,"And let's say you have kind of one block, we'll call it kind of block one and then someone else builds another block, honestly, or called block two."
Vitalik,Then we have an attacker.
Interviewer,"And what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries to revert back to the way they revert back to is instead of doing the thing they're supposed to do, which is build a block on top of block two or they're going to build another block on top of block one."
Vitalik,"Um, so you have block one, which has two children, block to block to prime."
Interviewer,"Now, this might sometimes even happen by random chance if two nodes in the network just happen to create blocks at the same time and they don't hear about each other things before they create their own."
Vitalik,But this also could happen because of an attack.
Interviewer,"Now, if this happens, you have an attack then the no."
Vitalik,"In the Bitcoin system, the nodes follow the longest chain."
Interviewer,"So if this attack had happened and when the original channel had more than two blocks on it, so if it was trying to kind of revert more than more than two blocks, then everyone would just I would just ignore it and everyone would just keep following the regular chain."
Vitalik,"But here, you know, we have block two and we have block two prime."
Interviewer,And so that you were kind of either and then whatever block the next block is created on top of.
Vitalik,Soucy Block three is now created on top of block two prime.
Interviewer,Then everyone agrees that Block three is the new head and block two prime is just kind of forgotten.
Vitalik,And then everyone just kind of peacefully builds on top of block three and then continues.
Interviewer,So how difficult is it to mess the system? I know.
Vitalik,"So how if we look at the general problem, like how many what fraction of people who participate in the system have to be bad players in order to mess with actually."
Interviewer,"OK, what's there is there is there a good number theory as well, depending on what your model of the participants is and what kind of attack we're talking about, it's anywhere between twenty three point two and fifty percent."
Vitalik,"Of what? Of all of the computing power of the network, sorry."
Interviewer,So twenty to twenty three point between twenty three point two and fifty percent and 50 percent can be compromised.
Vitalik,"So, like, once your once your purse, your portion of the total computing power of the network goes above the twenty three point to level, that there's a lot of things that you could mean, things that you can potentially do."
Interviewer,"And as your percentage of the network kind of keeps going up, then the your abilities as you mean things kind of goes higher than if you have above 50 percent, then you can just break everything."
Vitalik,So how hard is it to achieve that level?.
Interviewer,It seems that.
Vitalik,"So far, historically speaking, it's been exceptionally difficult."
Interviewer,So this is a challenging question.
Vitalik,So the economic cost of acquiring that level of stuff from scratch is fairly high.
Interviewer,I think it's somewhere in the low billions of dollars.
Vitalik,"And when you say that stuff, you mean computational resources?."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So specifically specialized hardware and of ASX that people use to solve these puzzles just to do the mining is not a small tangent.
Interviewer,So obviously I work a lot and deep learning with GPS and asks for that application.
Vitalik,And I tangentially kind of hear that so many of these cities and views are sold out because of this other application.
Interviewer,"I would do if you can comment, I don't know if you're familiar or interested in the space, what kind of a6 what kind of hardware is generally used these days for to do the actual computation for the proof of work."
Vitalik,Sure.
Interviewer,So in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum are a bit different.
Vitalik,"So in the case of Bitcoin, there is an algorithm called the shots."
Interviewer,Fifty six.
Vitalik,That's just a hash function.
Interviewer,"And so the puzzle is just coming up with a number, with the hash over the numbers below some threshold."
Vitalik,"And so because the hashes are designed to be random, you just have to keep on trying different numbers until one works."
Interviewer,And the Aztecs are just like specialized circuits that contain additive circuits for evaluating this hash over and over again.
Vitalik,And you have like millions or billions of these hash evaluators and just stacked on top of each other inside of a box.
Interviewer,And you just keep on running the box 24/7.
Vitalik,And there there's literally specialized hardware designed for this.
Interviewer,"Yes, this is we live in an amazing world."
Vitalik,Another tangent and I'll come back to the basics.
Interviewer,But does quantum computing throw a wrench into any of this?.
Vitalik,Very good question.
Interviewer,So quantum computers have two main and to families of algorithms that are relevant to cryptography.
Vitalik,One is Shor's algorithm ensures the algorithm is one that kind of completely breaks the hardness of some specific kinds of mathematical problems.
Interviewer,So the one that you've probably heard of is it makes it very easy to factor in numbers.
Vitalik,"So figure out kind of what prime factors are, the kind of that you need to multiply together to get some number, even if that number is extremely big."
Interviewer,Shor's algorithm can also be used to break elliptic curve cryptography.
Vitalik,It can break any kind of hit in order groups.
Interviewer,"The big breaks, a lot of kind of cryptographic nice things that we're used to."
Vitalik,"But the good news is that for every kind of major use of things that Shor's algorithm breaks, we already know of quantum proof alternative's."
Interviewer,"Right now, we don't use these Quisenberry alternatives yet because in many cases they're five to 10 times less efficient."
Vitalik,"But and the crypto industry in general, ahead of those of this is coming eventually and sort of ready to take the hit and switch to that stuff when we when we have to."
Interviewer,The second algorithm that is the relevance of cryptography is Grovers algorithm and engravers algorithm might even be a bit more familiar to people that's basically usually described as solving search problems.
Vitalik,"But the idea here is that if you have a problem over the form, finds a number that satisfies some property, then if with a classical computer you need to try and have end times before before you find the number, then with the quantum computer, you only need to do a square root of N computations."
Interviewer,And Grovers could potentially be used for mining.
Vitalik,But there's two possibilities here.
Interviewer,One is that Grovers could be used for mining and whoever creates the first working quantum computer that could do Grovers will just mind way faster than everyone else.
Vitalik,"And we'll see another round of what we saw when ASX came out, which is that's kind of the new hardware, just kind of dominated the old stuff."
Interviewer,"And then eventually it switched to a new equilibrium, by the way, way faster, not exponentially faster, quite dramatically faster, radically faster, which is not sort of it's not game changing."
Vitalik,I would say it's like ASX like you said it would be.
Interviewer,Exactly.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,So it would not necessarily break proof of work.
Vitalik,That's right.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"Now, the other kind of possible world, right, is that quantum computers have a lot of overhead."
Interviewer,There is a lot of complexity involved in maintaining quantum states.
Vitalik,"And there's also, as we've been realising recently, making quantum computers actually work requires that of quantum error correction, which requires kind of a thousand real cubits per logical garbage."
Interviewer,"And so there the very real possibility that the overhead of running a quantum computer will be higher than the speed up you get with Grovers, which would."
Vitalik,"Kind of sad, but which would also mean the proof of work will just keep working fine, so beautifully put, so, so proof of work is the core idea of Bitcoin is there are other core ideas before we kind of take a step towards the origin story and ideas of Ethereum."
Interviewer,Is there other stuff that were key to the white paper of Bitcoin?.
Vitalik,"There is proof of work and that there is just the cryptography is just kind of public keys and signatures that are used to verify transactions, those two really big things."
Interviewer,"So then what is the origin story? Maybe the human side, but also the technical side of a theory, I'm sure."
Vitalik,"So I joins the Bitcoin community in 2011, and they started by just writing."
Interviewer,I first wrote for this sort of online thing called Bitcoin Weekly.
Vitalik,Then I started writing for Bitcoin magazine and sorry to interrupt.
Interviewer,"You have this funny kind of story, true or not, is that you were disillusioned by the downsides of centralized control from your experience with, Wow, World of Warcraft."
Vitalik,"Is this true or you're just being witty? I mean, the event is true of the fact that that's the reason I do decentralization is what you maybe just a small tangent."
Interviewer,Have you always had a skepticism of centralized control? Is that some degree?.
Vitalik,Has that feeling evolved over time or is that just always been a core feeling that decentralized control is the future of human society?.
Interviewer,It's definitely been something that felt very attractive to me ever since I could have heard that such a thing is possible.
Vitalik,Possible even.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So great.
Interviewer,So you're enjoying the Bitcoin community in 2011.
Vitalik,You say you began writing.
Interviewer,So what's next?.
Vitalik,"I started writing, moved from high school to university."
Interviewer,"Halfway in between that, I spent a year in the university."
Vitalik,"Then at the end of that year, I dropped out to do Bitcoin things full time."
Interviewer,"And this was a combination of continuing to write Bitcoin magazine, but also increasingly to work on software projects."
Vitalik,"And I traveled around the world for about six months and just going to different Bitcoin communities like I went to first in New Hampshire, then Spain, other European places, Israel and then San Francisco and along the way."
Interviewer,And I've met a lot of other people that are working on different Bitcoin projects.
Vitalik,"And when I was in Israel, there were some very smart teams there that were working on ideas that people were starting to have called Bitcoin 2.0."
Interviewer,"So one of these was colored coins, which is basically saying that, hey, let's not just use the bullshit for Bitcoin, but it's also a kind of issue, other kinds of assets on it."
Vitalik,"And then there was a protocol called Master Quired that supported issuing assets, but also supported many other things, like financial contracts, like domain name registration and a lot of different things together."
Interviewer,And I spent some time working with these teams and I quickly realized that this masticating protocol could be improved by a kind of generalising it more right.
Vitalik,So the best the analogy I use is that the MasterCard protocol was like the Swiss Army knife.
Interviewer,You have twenty five different transaction types for twenty five different applications.
Vitalik,But what I realized is that you could replace a bunch of them with things that are more general-purpose.
Interviewer,So one of them was that you could replace like three transaction types for three types of financial contracts with a generic transaction type for a financial contract.
Vitalik,Just once you specify a mathematical formula for kind of how much money each side gets.
Interviewer,"By the way, it's a small pause once you see a financial contract, just the terminology, what is the contract? What's a financial contract?."
Vitalik,"So this is just generally an agreement where kind of either one or two parties kind of put collateral or kind of end and then they, depending on if certain conditions like this could involve prices of assets that could involve the actions of the two parties, could involve other things, but they kind of get have different amounts of kind of assets out that just depend on things that happened."
Interviewer,So a contract is really a financial contract is at the core.
Vitalik,It's it's the core interactive element of a financial system.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,There's there's many different kinds of financial contract.
Interviewer,There's things like options where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing that you have for some specific price for some period of time.
Vitalik,"There's contracts for difference where you basically are kind of making a bet that says, like for every dollar this thing goes up, I'll give you seven dollars, or for every dollar the thing goes down, you give me seven dollars or something like that."
Interviewer,And but the main idea that.
Vitalik,These contracts have to be enforced and trust them.
Interviewer,"Yes, exactly."
Vitalik,You have to trust that they will work out in a system where nobody can be trusted.
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,"This is such a beautiful, complicated system."
Interviewer,"OK, so so you are seeking to kind of generalize this basic framework of contracts."
Vitalik,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,So what does that entail? So what technically are the steps to creating a theory?.
Vitalik,I'm sure so I guess just kind of continue a bit with this master coin story.
Interviewer,So started by giving ideas for how to generalize the thing.
Vitalik,"And eventually this turned into a much more kind of fully fledged proposal that just says, hey, how about you scrap all your future is and instead you just put in this programming language."
Interviewer,"And I gave this idea to them and their response was something like, hey, this is great, but this seems complicated and it seems like something that we're not going to be able to put onto our roadmap for a while."
Vitalik,"And my response to this was like, we do not realize how revolutionary this is."
Interviewer,We'll just go do it myself.
Vitalik,"And then I was the name of the programming, which I just called it ultimate scripting."
Interviewer,So then I kind of went through a couple more rounds of iteration and then the idea for a theory of itself started to form.
Vitalik,And the idea here is that you just have a block chain where the core unit of the thing is what we call contracts as these accounts that can hold assets and they have their own internal memory but that are controlled by a piece of code.
Interviewer,"And so if I send some ether to a contract, the only thing that can determine where that either the currency inside a theory goes after that is the code of that contract itself."
Vitalik,"And so basically, you're kind of sending assets to computer programs becomes this sort of paradigm for creating these sort of a self executing agreements, self executing as so-called."
Interviewer,The code is sort of part of this contract.
Vitalik,So that that's what's meant by smart contracts.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So how hard was it to build this kind of thing?.
Interviewer,Harder than expected.
Vitalik,"Originally, I actually thought that this would be a thing that I would kind of casually work on for a couple of months, publish and then go back to university."
Interviewer,"Then I released it and a bunch of people or I released a white paper, white paper that was there."
Vitalik,"The idea, the white paper, a whole bunch of people came in offering to help a huge number of people and have expressed interest."
Interviewer,And this was something that was totally not expecting.
Vitalik,And then I realized that this would be something this kind of much bigger than I had ever thought that it would be.
Interviewer,And then we started on this kind of much longer development slog of making something that lives up to this sort of much higher level of expectations.
Vitalik,What are some of the is it fundamentally like software engineering challenges? It was social.
Interviewer,"OK, so there's no social."
Vitalik,So so what are the biggest interesting challenges that you've learned about human civilization and in software engineering through this process?.
Interviewer,So I guess one of the challenges for me is that I'm one of the kind of apparently unusual geeks who was sort of never treated with anything but kindness in school.
Vitalik,"And so when I got into crypto, I never expected everyone would just kind of be the same kind of altruistic and nice in that same way."
Interviewer,But the job of the algorithm that I used for finding co-founders for this thing was not very good.
Vitalik,It was sort of literally what computer scientists called the greedy algorithm.
Interviewer,It's sort of the first 50 people who applied back offering to help kind of are the co-founders.
Vitalik,"I mean, like literally the people that form formed to be the founders, co-founders of the community, the algorithm."
Interviewer,I like how you call it the algorithm.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And so what happened was that these especially as the project got really big, like there started to be a lot of this kind of infighting and there were a lot of like I wanted the thing to be a nonprofit and some of them wanted to be a for profit."
Vitalik,And then there started to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with each other.
Interviewer,There were people that were kind of trying to get an advantage for themselves and a lot of different ways.
Vitalik,And this just about six months later led to this big governance crisis.
Interviewer,"And then we got a reshuffled leadership, a bid, and then the project kept on going."
Vitalik,"Then nine months later, there was another governance crisis and an."
Interviewer,There was the third governance crisis.
Vitalik,"So is there a way to if you're looking at the human side of things, is there a way to optimize this aspect of the cryptocurrency world?."
Interviewer,It seems that there is.
Vitalik,"From my perspective, there's a lot of different characters and personalities and egos."
Interviewer,"And like you said, I don't know if."
Vitalik,"You know, I also like to think that most of the world, most of the people in the world are well-intentioned, but the way those intentions are realized may perhaps come off, as you know, as negative."
Interviewer,"What is there is there a hopeful message here about creating a governance structure for cryptocurrency that where everyone gets along and after about four rounds of reshuffle, I think we've actually come up with something that seems to be pretty stable and happy and think I mean, I definitely do think that most people are well intentioned."
Vitalik,I just think that one of the reasons why I like decentralization is just because there is like this thing about power where power attracts people with egos.
Interviewer,And so that just allows those very small percentage of people to just to ruin so many things.
Vitalik,You think ego as you think ego has a use like is ego always bad?.
Interviewer,It seems like sometimes does.
Vitalik,"But then the theory research team, I feel like we've found also a lot of a lot of very good people that are just."
Interviewer,"Primarily, you're just interested in things for the technology and things seem to just generally be going quite well."
Vitalik,"Yeah, when you're when the focus and the passion is in the tech, so on."
Interviewer,So that's the human side of things with the technology side.
Vitalik,"What have you learned? What have been the biggest challenges of bringing a theory to life? On the technology side, so I think, first of all, just."
Interviewer,"There are others, like the first law of software development, which is that when someone gives you a timetable of a switch, the unit of times, the next largest unit of time and one, we basically fell victim to that."
Vitalik,"And so instead of taking that like three months, that ended up taking 20 months to watch the thing."
Interviewer,"And that was just, I think, underestimating the sheer technical complexity of the thing."
Vitalik,"There were research challenges like so for example, one of the things that we've been saying from the start that we would do one is a switch from a proof of work to proof of stake, more proof of stake as to this alternative consensus mechanism where instead of having to waste a lot of computing power on solving these mathematical puzzles that don't mean anything, you kind of prove that you have access to coins inside of the system and this that it gives you some level of participation and the consensus."
Interviewer,Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit? I understand the idea of before work.
Vitalik,I know that a lot of people say that the idea of proof of steak is really appealing.
Interviewer,Maybe linger a longer explain what it is.
Vitalik,Sure.
Interviewer,"So basically, the idea is like if I kind of walk up a hundred coins, then I turn that into a kind of, quote, virtual binder and the system itself kind of automatically, sort of randomly assigns that in a virtual binder is a right to create blocks that particular travels."
Vitalik,"And then if someone else has 200 coins and then a walk on the walk, there's 200 coins, then they get a kind of twice as big a virtual binder."
Interviewer,They'll be able to create their blocks twice as often.
Vitalik,"So it tries to kind of do similar things to proof of work, except instead of the thing kind of limiting your participation to being your ability to crank out solutions to kind of hash challenges."
Interviewer,The thing that really makes your participation is kind of how much coins you're walking into this mechanism.
Vitalik,"OK, so interesting so that that limited participation doesn't require you to run a lot of compute."
Interviewer,"Does that mean that the richer you are, so rich people are more like their identities, more right."
Vitalik,And the stable.
Interviewer,"Yeah, four or five or whatever, whatever the right terminology is, right, and this is definitely a covid critique, I think my usual answer to this is that like proof of work is even more of that kind of system."
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,"Yeah, because I didn't mean it."
Vitalik,"And that that as a criticism, I think you're exactly right."
Interviewer,That's equivalent to proof of war because the same kind of thing.
Vitalik,"But the before work, you have to also use physical resources."
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,And broken computers and burn trees and all of that stuff.
Interviewer,Is there a way to mess with the system of the proof of proof stake?.
Vitalik,There is.
Interviewer,But you will once again need to have a very large portion of all the coins that are locked in the system to do anything bad.
Vitalik,Got it.
Interviewer,"Yeah, and just that maybe take a small change in one of the criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact that it gets for the proof of work mechanism if to use so much energy in the world."
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,Is one of the motivations of proof of stake is to move away from this.
Vitalik,Definitely.
Interviewer,What's your sense of that? Maybe I'm just under informed.
Vitalik,Is there like legitimately environmental impact from this?.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So the latest thing was that Bitcoin consumed as much energy as the country of Austria or something like that.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"And then Ethereum as of right now, maybe only like half an order of magnitude smaller than Bitcoin."
Interviewer,I've heard you talk about a Ethereum 2.0.
Vitalik,So what's the what's the dream of Ethereum 2.0? What's what's the status of proof of state? Because the mechanism that Ethereum moves towards and also how do you move to a different mechanism of consensus within a cryptocurrency?.
Interviewer,So Ethereum 2.0 is a collection of major upgrades that we've wanted to do to Ethereum for quite some time.
Vitalik,"The two big ones, one is proof of stake and the other is that we call sharding."
Interviewer,"Sharding solves another problem with big chains, which is a scalability."
Vitalik,"And what Sharding does is it basically says instead of every participant in the network having to personally download and verify every transaction, every participant in the network only downloads and verifies a small portion of transactions."
Interviewer,And then you kind of randomly distribute who gets how much work.
Vitalik,"And because of how the distribution is random, it still has the property that you need a large portion of the entire network to corrupt what's going on inside of any Shahd."
Interviewer,But the system is still at a very redundance and very secure as brilliant.
Vitalik,How hard is that to implement and how hard is proof of stake to implement? Like on the technical level?.
Interviewer,"Yeah, software level, proof of stake and sharding are both challenging."
Vitalik,I'd say sharding is a bit more challenging.
Interviewer,The reason is that proof of stake is kind of just a change to the core.
Vitalik,The consensus layer works.
Interviewer,"Sharding does both that, but it's also a change to the networking layer."
Vitalik,"The reason is that sharding is kind of pointless if at the networking layer you still do what you do today, which is you kind of gossip everything, which means that if someone publishes something, every other node in the client hears it from on the networking layer."
Interviewer,And so instead we have to have enough sub networks and the ability to quickly switch between sub networks and other sub networks talk to each other.
Vitalik,And this is all doable.
Interviewer,But it's a more complex architecture and it's definitely the sort of thing that has not yet been done in cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,"So most most of the networking layer in cryptocurrency is you're shouting broadcast messages and this is more like ad hoc networks, like you're shouting within smaller groups, smaller group, but you have like a bunch of subnet like executive and you have to switch to, oh, man, I'd love to see the as it it's a beautiful idea."
Interviewer,"So from a graph, theoretical perspective, but just the software and who's responsible is Ethereum project like the people involved, would they be implementing like what's the actual you know, this is like legit software engineering who like how does that work?."
Vitalik,"How do people collaborate, build that kind of project? Is this like almost like is there a software engineering lead?."
Interviewer,Is there is a legit almost like large scale open source project is.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,So we have someone named Danny Ryan on our team who has just been brilliant and regrade all around.
Vitalik,And he is a kind of de facto kind of development coordinator.
Interviewer,I guess it's like you have to invent job titles for this stuff.
Vitalik,"And the reason is that, look, we also have this unique kind of organizational structure where the Ethereum Foundation itself and it does research in-house, but then the actual implementation is done by independent teams that are separate companies and they're located all around the world and fun places like Australia."
Interviewer,And so you can kind of just need a bunch of sort of almost non.
Vitalik,"Cat herding to just keep getting these people to talk to each other and kind of implement this back, make sure that everyone agrees on what's going on and kind of how to interpret different things."
Interviewer,"So how far into the future are we from these two mechanisms and a theorem to point out like, what's your sense of the timeline, keeping in mind the previous comment you made about the sort of general Kurzem software projects?."
Vitalik,So Ethereum 2.0 is split into three phases.
Interviewer,So Phase Zero just creates a bit of stake network.
Vitalik,And it's actually separate from kind of proof of the proven work network at the beginning just to kind of give it time to grow and improve itself.
Interviewer,The people get to choose.
Vitalik,Sorry to interrupt.
Interviewer,"If people get to choose, I guess we can think as they choose to move over if they want to, then phase one adds sharding, but it only adds sharding of active data storage and not sharding of computation."
Vitalik,"And then after that, there is that of the merger phase, which is where the and the accounts are kind of smart contracts like all of the activity on the existing etha, one system just kind of gets cut and pasted into two and the word change gets forgotten and then and things all the things that were living there before and just kind of continue living inside of the system."
Interviewer,So for timeline's phase zero has been kind of almost fully implemented and now it's just a matter of a whole bunch of security auditing and testing.
Vitalik,"My own experience is that right now it feels like right about a phase comparable to when we were doing the original Ethereum launch, when we were maybe about four months away from launch."
Interviewer,But that's just a hunch and that's just a hunch.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"So how you know, it took it took over a decade for people to move from Python to Python three."
Vitalik,"How do you see the move from, like this phase of zero of four four different concepts?."
Interviewer,The mechanism do you see there being a drastic phase shift in people just kind of jumping to this better mechanism?.
Vitalik,"So in phase zero, don't expect too many people to do much because in phase zero, in phase one, the new chain of deliberately, it doesn't have too much functionality or none."
Interviewer,"It's there just like if you want to be a proof of stake validator, you can get things started."
Vitalik,"If you want to store data for other botulin applications, you can get started."
Interviewer,But existing applications will largely keep living on E one.
Vitalik,"And then when the merger happens, then the merger is the operation that happens all at once."
Interviewer,So that's sort of one of the benefits of such a system.
Vitalik,"Like on the one hand, you have to coordinate the upgrade, but on the other hand, the upgrade can be coordinated."
Interviewer,"So what's Kasparov FFG, by the way, Kasparov G is the consensus algorithm that we are using for the of stake."
Vitalik,"Is there something interesting specific about Kasparov of like some beautiful aspect of it that there is so Kasparov Evgenia combines together kind of two different schools of, say, algorithm design."
Interviewer,So the general two different schools of the of the design are right.
Vitalik,One is at a 50 percent fault tolerant but dependent on network security.
Interviewer,"So 50 percent volks, holer fault tolerant, but it gets all read up to 50 percent of fault's, but not more."
Vitalik,"But it depends on an assumption that all of the nodes can talk, talk to each other within some of a limited period of time."
Interviewer,"Like if I send the message, you'll receive it within a few seconds."
Vitalik,"And the second school is thirty three percent fault tolerant but safe under a synchrony, which means that if we agree on something, then nothing is finalized."
Interviewer,"And even if the network goes horribly wonky the second after that thing is finalized, there's no way to revert that thing."
Vitalik,And that's fascinating how you would make that happen.
Interviewer,It's definitely quite clever.
Vitalik,I'd recommend the Kasparov of paper if you just search like archive.
Interviewer,I said like er XIV Kasper FFG.
Vitalik,It's the papers and archive.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,Who are the authors.
Interviewer,Myself and Virgil Griffith.
Vitalik,That's awesome.
Interviewer,I take a small tangent.
Vitalik,This idea of just putting out white papers and papers and putting them on archives is putting them publicly.
Interviewer,"Is it, is that at the core."
Vitalik,Is that a necessary component of currencies that the tradition started with and Satoshi Nakamoto is what we make of it? What do you make of the future of that kind of sharing of ideas?.
Interviewer,"I guess so, yeah."
Vitalik,"And it's definitely something that's kind of mandatory for crypto because, like, crypto is all about making systems where you don't have to trust the operators to trust that the thing works."
Interviewer,"And so if anything behind our system works is closed, source to that kind of kills the point."
Vitalik,"And so there is the kind of a sense in which the fundamental properties of the category of the thing we're trying to build just kind of forces openness, but also openness just has proven to be a really great way to collaborate."
Interviewer,And there's actually a lot of sort of innovation and academic collaboration that's just kind of happened ad hoc in the crypto space the last few years.
Vitalik,"So like, for example, we have this forum called Ethe Research that's like ETG or NCAR, the dots."
Interviewer,And there we publish kind of just ideas in a form that's kind of how formal like it's halfway in between.
Vitalik,"Like it's it's a kind of a text right up and you can have math in it, but it's often sort of much shorter than a paper."
Interviewer,"And it turns out that the great majority of new ideas, like they're just kind of fairly small nuggets that you can explain in like five to 10 lines that they don't really need the whole format of the paper."
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,They don't require the kind of like 10 pages of filler.
Vitalik,And so introduction conclusion is not needed.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So instead you just kind of publish the idea that people will your comments on it.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,This has been so great for us.
Interviewer,I think I interrupted you.
Vitalik,Was there something else on Caspar FFG that's just Casper FFG is just kind of combines together these two schools.
Interviewer,"And so basically it creates this system where if you have more than 50 percent that are honest then and you have network synchrony, then the thing kind of goes has a chain."
Vitalik,"But then if Network Sacranie fails, then kind of the last few blocks of the chain might get replaced."
Interviewer,But anything that was finalized by this set of more asynchronous process gets like can't be reverted.
Vitalik,And so you essentially get a kind of best of both worlds between those two models.
Interviewer,"OK, so I know what I'm doing to you reading the Gettysburg Paper."
Vitalik,"I apologize for the romanticized question, but what to you are some or the most beautiful idea in the world of a theorem? Just something surprising, something beautiful, something powerful."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"I mean, I think the fact that money can just emerge out of a database if enough people believe in it, I think is definitely one of those things that's up there."
Interviewer,I think one of the things that I really love about a theorem is also this concept of possibility.
Vitalik,"So this is the idea that if I build an application on top of a theory, then you can build an application that talks to my application and you don't even need my permission."
Interviewer,You don't even need to talk to me.
Vitalik,"But so one really fun example of this, as there was this sort of game on a theory called Crypto Kiddie's, the just involvement of breeding digital cats."
Interviewer,"And someone else created a game called Crypto Dragons, where the way you play Crypto Dragons is you have a dragon and you have to foetid crypto kitties."
Vitalik,"And they just created the whole thing, just like as an ethereal contract that you would send these these tokens that are defined by this other Ethereum contract."
Interviewer,"And for the interoperability to happen, like the projects that don't really need to look, the teams don't really need to talk to each other."
Vitalik,"You just kind of interface with the existing program arbitrarily, composable in this kind of way."
Interviewer,You have different groups that could be working.
Vitalik,And so you could see it scaling to just outside of dragons and kiddie's.
Interviewer,It could be built like entire ecosystems of software.
Vitalik,"Yeah, it's kind of like I mean, especially in the decentralized finance space that's been popping up in the last two years."
Interviewer,There has been a huge amount of of really interesting things happen as a result of this is a particular kind of like financial applications kind of thing.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"I mean, there's like stable coins."
Vitalik,"So this is kind of tokens that retain value equal to one dollar, but they're kind of backed by a cryptocurrency that there's decentralized exchanges."
Interviewer,"So as far as decentralized exchanges goes up, there's this really interesting construction that has existed for about one one and a half years now called."
Vitalik,"So what you swipe is that's a smart contract that holds the balances of two tokens we'll call token, and so it can be and it maintains that invariants that the balance of talking a multiplied by the balance of token, B has to equal the same value."
Interviewer,"And so the way that you trade against the thing is basically like you have this kind of curve, you know, like X times Y equals K, and before you trade it at some points on the curve, after you trade, you just like picks up any any other points on the curve."
Vitalik,"And then whatever the Delta X is that's stimulative because you provide whatever the Delta Y is, that's the amount of detail that you get or vice versa."
Interviewer,And that's just and then kind of the slope at the current points on the curve is the price.
Vitalik,And so that just is the whole thing.
Interviewer,And that just allows you to have this exchange for tokens.
Vitalik,"And even if there's very few participants and the whole thing is just like so simple and it's just very easy to set out, very easy to participate in, and it just provides so much value to people."
Interviewer,And the the fundamental the the distributed application infrastructure allows that somehow.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,So this is a smart contract meeting.
Vitalik,This is all a computer program that's just running through some smart contracts who are just fascinating.
Interviewer,They are.
Vitalik,"OK, do you think cryptocurrency may become the main currency in the world one day?."
Interviewer,"So where do you think we're headed in terms of the role of currency, the structure type of currency in the world?."
Vitalik,I definitely expect some fiat currencies to continue to exist and continue to be strong.
Interviewer,"And I definitely expect fiat currencies to also digitize, have their own way over the next couple of decades."
Vitalik,"What's fiat currency, by the way? Oh, just like things like US dollars, like dollars and euros and yet these other things."
Interviewer,And they're sort of backed by governments.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,But I also expect a sort of cryptocurrency to play this kind of important role in just making sure that people always have an alternative if fiat currencies start breaking.
Vitalik,"So if or if you're in some kind of very high inflation place like Venezuela, for example, or if your country just kind of gets cut off, cut off from other financial systems because of something the banks do a gift for any kind of if there is even some major trade disruption or something worse happens, then like cryptocurrency."
Interviewer,"These are the sort of thing that just because of the kind of global neutrality, they're just always there and you can keep using them."
Vitalik,It's interesting that you're quite humble about the possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency.
Interviewer,You don't think there's a possible future where it becomes the main sort of currency because it feels like fear.
Vitalik,It feels like the centralized control by governments of currency is limiting somehow.
Interviewer,Maybe my naive utopian view of the world.
Vitalik,"It's and it's definitely very possible, I think, for cryptocurrency as being the main form of value to work."
Interviewer,"Well, like, you do need to have some much more price stability than they have today."
Vitalik,And there are no stable coins and there are kind of crypto cryptocurrency is to try to be more stable than existing things like Bitcoin and ether.
Interviewer,"But that just is to me, the kind of the main challenge."
Vitalik,Do you think or do you think that's a characteristic of just just being the early days is such a young concept.
Interviewer,Ten years is nothing in the history of money.
Vitalik,And I think it's a combination of two things.
Interviewer,"One is it's it's still early days, but the other is a kind of more durable, any kind of economic problem, which is that the demand for currency is volatile."
Vitalik,"Right, because of like recessions, booms, changes to technology, lots of things."
Interviewer,"And if people's demand for how much currency they want to hold changes and if you have a currency that has a fixed supply, then the change in demand has to be entirely expressed as a change in value of the currency."
Vitalik,And so what that means is that kind of the volatility of demand becomes entirely translated into volatility and head of prices of things that are updated in that currency.
Interviewer,"But if you have a currency where instead the supply can change and so the supply can go up when there's more demand, then you have the supply ahead of absorbing more of that volatility."
Vitalik,And so the price of the currency would absorb whatever the volatility on that topic.
Interviewer,So Bitcoin does have a limited supply of specific fixed supply.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,"What? Was the idea and a theorem doesn't, but can you clarify just in the comments you just made, is a theory qualify to the kind of currency that you're talking about and being flexible in the supply?."
Vitalik,And it's a bit more flexible.
Interviewer,But the thing that you would really want is something that's kind of specifically flexible in response to how valuable the currency is in.
Vitalik,And I'd recommend you to look at stable coins as well.
Interviewer,"SELEK things like die, for example."
Vitalik,It's like baseball that day and with stable coins.
Interviewer,Is that a type of cryptocurrency? It is the type of cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,It's a type of cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart contract.
Interviewer,One of these Ethereum computer programs that where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether and then it is basically like that people deposit and then it issues die.
Vitalik,And the reason why people deposit is because they want to kind of go high leverage on their ether.
Interviewer,"And so it kind of pairs these two sets of users, one that wants stability and one that kind of wants extra risk together with each other."
Vitalik,"And it basically creates or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they'll be that they have this asset that can that can be later converted back into the ether, but specifically at the end of the one dollar rate."
Interviewer,And it has some kind of stabilizing network effects.
Vitalik,"Yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,It has many kinds of stabilizing mechanisms in it.
Vitalik,That's fascinating.
Interviewer,"OK, this world is awesome."
Vitalik,"Technically, just from a scientific perspective, it's an awesome world that I often don't see from an outsider's perspective."
Interviewer,"What I often see is kind of maybe hype and a little bit, if I may say so, like charlatanism."
Vitalik,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"And you don't often see, at least from an outsider's perspective, the beautiful science of it and the engineering of it maybe."
Vitalik,"Is there a comment you can make of who to follow, how to learn about this world without being interrupted by the charlatans and the hype people in this space?."
Interviewer,I think you do need to just know the specific just people to follow.
Vitalik,"Like, there's you know, there's all the kind of the cryptographers and the researchers."
Interviewer,There's just like even just the theory research crew like myself and grad Danny Just and the other people were.
Vitalik,And then the academic cryptographers before this today was at Stanford.
Interviewer,And Stanford has the center for watching the research and of anybody that's really famous and great cryptographer is running it.
Vitalik,And there's a lot of other people there.
Interviewer,"And there's people working on zero knowledge proofs, for example, and Zucco from the caches of one other person that I respect."
Vitalik,"So I think if you follow the technical, you crawl along that."
Interviewer,"Yeah, you just start with your and group and and look at academics day by day and so on, and then just cautiously expand the network of people who follow."
Vitalik,"Yeah, exactly."
Interviewer,"And like, if someone seems to to self promotional, then just like remove them because they're books that are."
Vitalik,"So there's these white papers and we just discussed about, about ideas being condense into really small parts is there are books that are emerging that are kind of good introductory material, so prefer historical ones."
Interviewer,"Then there's like Nathaniel Popper's Digital Gold, which is just about the history of Bitcoin."
Vitalik,There's one thing Matthew Lysenko doubts that there's one about the history of Ethereum for technical ones and there's a sense of Nobelists mastering Ethereum.
Interviewer,Great.
Vitalik,"So let me ask you, sort of sorry to pull back to the."
Interviewer,"The idea of governments and decentralized currency, you know, there's a tension between decentralization of currency and the power of nations, the power of governments, you what's your sense about that tension? Can."
Vitalik,Is there some rule for regulation of currency?.
Interviewer,You.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is there like is the government the enemy of digital currency of distributed currency or can they be like cautious friends?.
Vitalik,"I mean, I think the one thing that people forget is that it's clearly not entirely an enemy because they think if."
Interviewer,"There had been so much government regulation on the hand of centralized, issuing centralized digital currencies that we'd be seeing things that people like Google and Facebook and Twitter just kind of issuing them left and right."
Vitalik,"And then if that was the case, then decentralized currencies would still appeal to some people, but they definitely would appeal to less people than today."
Interviewer,"So even in that sense, I think it's clearly been sort of more of a just kind of set the stage for the end of the existence of the sector in some ways."
Vitalik,"But also and I think some of both, there's definitely things that governments can do in some cases have done to hurt the spread of and of growth of a of by chance."
Interviewer,There is things that they've done to help.
Vitalik,"And there have been, in some cases, definitely done a good job of going after fraudulent projects and going after some of the projects that have some of the craziest and most misleading marketing."
Interviewer,There is also the possibility that governments will end up using Billikens for a lot of different things like governments than they do a lot more than just regulating.
Vitalik,There is also the they have the kind of.
Interviewer,Identity records say they have a property registry is even their own currency is secure.
Vitalik,Lots of different things that they're operating and there's even watching applications in a lot of those.
Interviewer,"And they can you know, they can leverage technology to do a lot of good for our society."
Vitalik,It is a little unfortunate that governments often lag behind in terms of their acceptance of leverage of technology.
Interviewer,"If you look at the autonomous vehicle space, I in general, there there are a few years behind."
Vitalik,It'd be nice to help them catch up.
Interviewer,That's a that's always ongoing problem.
Vitalik,You met Vladimir Putin to discuss the centralised currency or you're born and where we were in Colombia.
Interviewer,It's a city about 150 kilometers south of Moscow.
Vitalik,"In Russia, yes."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,I grew up in Moscow.
Interviewer,"I mean, it's Vladimir Putin is the central figure in this part of the world."
Vitalik,"So what was that like, meeting or meeting him?."
Interviewer,What was that experience like? He's taller and photos than in person.
Vitalik,"Yeah, he's."
Interviewer,"Yeah, that's right."
Vitalik,He's five seven I think.
Interviewer,Five eight maybe.
Vitalik,"Yeah, it's the."
Interviewer,"Unfortunately, we didn't actually have too much of a chance to talk to him, like I managed to see him for about one minute at the end of this meeting."
Vitalik,And I did get a chance to see of some of the other end of government ministers.
Interviewer,And he recommended some and some of them are are actually interested in trying to use some fortunes to look for various government use cases of corruption and other things.
Vitalik,And I have it's hard to tell from one conversation kind of what things are genuine and what things are just like gold watch.
Interviewer,It is cool that you watch it.
Vitalik,"But, you know, when I when I listen to, like, Barack Obama talk about artificial intelligence, there's certain things I hear were OK."
Interviewer,"So he may not be an expert in AI, but he knows he actually studied it carefully enough to think about it like he can, like even if he's just reading a Wikipedia page, like he really thought about what this technology means."
Vitalik,"Did you get a sense that Putin or some of the ministers like thought about block chain, thought about the fundamentals of technology, like understand it intuitively, or are they too old school to try to grasp it somewhere, old school somewhere or a new school?."
Interviewer,It depends.
Vitalik,It's it's definitely depends on who you talk to.
Interviewer,"I mean, that's an open question for me with Putin, because Putin has said, I don't know, I've only talked to him for about one minutes, but sometimes you can pick up sort of insights as a quick comment."
Vitalik,"They're there about maybe you can correct me on this, but there are three thousand cryptocurrency is being actively traded."
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,And Ethereum is one of a lot of people believe that there will be the main cryptocurrency.
Interviewer,"I think Bitcoin is currently still the main cryptocurrency, but Ethereum very likely might become that the main one."
Vitalik,Is this kind of diversity good in the world? This is sticking around.
Interviewer,"Should there should there be a winner? Like should there be some consensus globally around Bitcoin or around a theory? I'm like, what's your what's your sense?."
Vitalik,I definitely think the diversity is good.
Interviewer,And I definitely think also that there's probably too many people trying to make separate fortunes.
Vitalik,"And of right now, the numbers should definitely be greater than one and probably greater than two or even five."
Interviewer,"Not three thousand, not three thousand."
Vitalik,And also not even like forty high quality platforms to try to do the same thing.
Interviewer,"There's definitely this range from just like one person who just like wrongly thinks that you can create a cryptocurrency in like twelve hours and doesn't even think about kind of the community aspects of maintaining it, going to people actually trying, but only creating a really tiny one or two like scammer's to people making something that's actually successful."
Vitalik,And then there's a lot of different categories of watching the project in terms of what it's trying to do and what applications it's for.
Interviewer,And I think the experimentation is definitely healthy.
Vitalik,"If you look at the two worlds, that might be a little bit disjointed, but the distributed applications, cryptocurrency and in the world of artificial intelligence, do you see there's some overlap between these worlds that both worry about centralized control? Is there is some overlap."
Interviewer,That's interesting that you think about do you think about A.I.
Vitalik,much?.
Interviewer,"Yeah, and I think definitely and have thought about things like in like the ahead of control problems that a lot of the problems and all of those things you worry about the potential threat of A.I."
Vitalik,"It's definitely one of the things I worry about is they think but there's a lot of kind of common challenges because in both cases, what you're ultimately trying to do is you're trying to kind of get a simple system to direct a more complex system, like in the case of these strong eyes, the idea would be that the simple systems people and the complex system as well, whatever thing the people, the people end up unleashing on the universe, that will hopefully be a great thing in in the case of block change, the end of the complex."
Interviewer,"Well, the simple thing is the algorithm, which is a piece of static and fully open source code."
Vitalik,And the more complex thing is just the all of the different possible.
Interviewer,"And if human actors, the end of the strategy is that they might choose to participate in the network, do you think about your own mortality, like what you hope to accomplish in your life?."
Vitalik,"You know, I definitely I definitely think about ending my own mortality."
Interviewer,"So that's if I gave you the option to live forever, would you? Depends a lot on what the find does the."
Vitalik,"And if it's one of those things where I'm going to be a kind of like floating through empty space for ten to the seventy five years to know if it's forever worth of having, you know, of fulfilling life with meaning with with friends, to just spend the time with what's going to be meaningful challenges to explore an individual."
Interviewer,Interesting things to be working on then I think absolutely.
Vitalik,It's beautifully put live forever but you'd have to check the fine print.
Interviewer,I think there's no better way to end the talk.
Vitalik,Thank you so much for talking to us.
Interviewer,"So exciting to follow your work distance and thank you for creating a revolutionary idea and sticking with it and building it out, doing some incredible engineering work."

Interviewer,"The thing that I often ask startups on top of a theorem is can you please tell me why using a theory and block chain is better than using Excel? And if they can come up with a good answer, that's when you know you got something really interesting."
Vitalik,Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
Interviewer,"The following is a conversation with Retallack Budarin, cocreator of and author of the white paper that launched Etherial and Ether, which is a cryptocurrency that is currently the second largest digital currency after Bitcoin."
Vitalik,Ethereum has a lot of interesting technical ideas that are defining the future of blogging technology.
Interviewer,And the topic is one of the most brilliant people innovating in the space today.
Vitalik,"Unlike Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown person or group that created Bitcoin, Retallack is very well known and at a young age is thrust into the limelight as one of the main faces of the technology that may redefine the nature of money and all forms of digital transactions in the 21st century."

Interviewer,And now here's my conversation with the topic Budarin.
Vitalik,"So before we talk about the fundamental ideas behind a theory of the currency, perhaps it'd be nice to to talk about the the origin story of Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto."
Interviewer,"You gave a talk that started with sort of asking the question, what did Satoshi Nakamoto actually invent? Maybe you could say, who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what did he invent? Sure."
Vitalik,So Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came up with Bitcoin.
Interviewer,"So the reason why I say the name by which we know is that this is the anonymous fellow who has shown himself to us only over the Internet, just by first publishing the white paper for Bitcoin, then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin, and then talking to the very early Bitcoin community on Bitcoin forums and and interacting with that, but helping the project blog for a couple of years."
Vitalik,"And then at some point in late 2010, early 2011, he disappeared."
Interviewer,So Bitcoin is a fairly unique project and how it has this kind of.
Vitalik,Mythical kind of quasi godlike founder who is just kind of popped in and did the thing and then disappeared and we've somehow just never heard from him again.
Interviewer,So in 2008 was the white paper was the first do you know the white paper was the first time the name will actually appear Satoshi Nakamoto?.
Vitalik,"If so, so how is it possible that the creator of such impactful project remains anonymous?."
Interviewer,"That's a tough question and there's no similarity to it in the history of technology, as far as I'm aware."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"So one possibility is that it's Delphine because Delphine was also active in the Bitcoin community and as how Affinia in those two beginning years and how is how thin he may be, he is one of the people at the end of early cypherpunk community."
Vitalik,"He was a computer scientist, computer scientists, cryptographers, people interested in technology, Internet freedom, those kinds of topics."
Interviewer,Was it correct that there that he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest or the first transaction of Bitcoin?.
Vitalik,"Yes, the first transaction of Bitcoin was between Satoshi and Delphine."
Interviewer,"Do you think he knew who Satoshi was if he wasn't Satoshi, you probably know how is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything about their fundamental identity?."
Vitalik,Is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the Internet? I like to think about it because you and I just met now there's a there's a depth of knowledge that we now have about each other that's like physical like my vision system is able to recognize you.
Interviewer,I can also verify your identity of uniqueness.
Vitalik,"Like, yeah, this like it's very hard to fake you being you."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"So the Internet, the Internet has a fundamentally different quality to it, which is just fascinating."
Interviewer,"Definitely interesting, as I definitely just know a lot of people just by their Internet handles."
Vitalik,"And to me when I think of them, like I see their Internet handles and one of them has a profile picture is the same kind of face that's kind of not quite human with a bunch of psychedelic colors."
Interviewer,And what I visualize have to just visualize that that's not an actual face.
Vitalik,"Yeah, you are the creator of the second."
Interviewer,"Well, he's currently the second most popular cryptocurrency Ethereum."
Vitalik,"So on this topic for just the Constitution to come over for a little bit longer, you may be the most qualified person to speak to the psychology of this anonymity that we're talking about, like your identity is known, like I've just verified it."
Interviewer,"But from your perspective, what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining anonymous like a fucking psychoanalyse, Satoshi Nakamoto? Is there something interesting there or is that just a peculiar quirk of him?."
Vitalik,It definitely helps create this kind of image of this sort of neutral thing that doesn't belong to anyone.
Interviewer,"And then you've created a project and because you're anonymous and because you also have disappear or as unfortunately happened to health, any of that is him."
Vitalik,He ended up dying of Gehrig's disease and he is in a cryogenic freezer now.
Interviewer,"But if you pop in and you and you created an in your God and all that's remaining of that whole process is the thing itself, then no one can go and try to interpret any of your other behavior and try to understand, like, oh, the this person wrote this thing in some essay idea at age 16 where he expressed particular opinions about democracy."
Vitalik,"And so because of that, this project is like is a state that's trying to do this specific thing."
Interviewer,"Instead, it creates this environment where the thing is what you make of it and it doesn't have the right or the burden of your other ideas, political thought and so on."
Vitalik,So so now we're sitting with you.
Interviewer,Do you feel the burden of being kind of the face of a theory?.
Vitalik,"I mean, there's a very large community of developers, but nevertheless, you know, is there like a burden associated with that?."
Interviewer,There definitely is.
Vitalik,"This is definitely a big reason why I've been trying to kind of push for the Ethereum ecosystem to become more decentralized in many ways, just encouraging a lot of and, of course, theory and work to happen outside of the theory of foundation and of expanding the number of people that are making different kinds of decisions, having kind of multiple software limitations instead of one and all of these things."
Interviewer,"There's a lot of things that have tried to do it to and remove myself as a single points of failure, because that is something that a lot of people criticize, criticize me for."
Vitalik,"So if you look at, like, the most fundamentally successful open source projects, it seems that it's a sad reality."
Interviewer,When I think about it is it seems to be that one person is a crucial contributor.
Vitalik,"Often you feel Galina's from from for for Linux, for the kernel that is possible."
Interviewer,And I'm definitely not planning to disappear.
Vitalik,"And that's the interesting tension that projects that this kind of desire a single entity, and yet they're fundamentally distributed."
Interviewer,I don't know if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking about the future of cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,Does there need to be a leader?.
Interviewer,"There's different kinds of leaders, you know, there's there's dictators who control all the money, there's people who control organizations, there's a kind of high priests that just have themselves have their Twitter followers."
Vitalik,"What kind of leader are you, would you say?."
Interviewer,"You know, in these days, actually a bit more of the high in the high priest direction than before? Yeah, like."
Vitalik,"I definitely actually don't do all that much of kind of going around and ordering theory foundation people to do things, because I think those things are important."
Interviewer,"If there's something that I do think it's important that I do, just usually I kind of say it publicly or just sort of say it to people."
Vitalik,And quite often projects just sort of start doing it.
Interviewer,So let's ask the high philosophical question about money.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,What at the highest level is money? What is money?.
Vitalik,It's a kind of game and it's a game where you have points.
Interviewer,"And if you have points, there is this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else's points by the same number."
Vitalik,"And these sorts of fair game, hopefully."
Interviewer,"Well, it's one kind of fair game."
Vitalik,"Like, for example, you know, you can have other kinds of fair games, like you're going to have a game where if I give someone a points and you give someone a points, then instead of that person getting two points, that person gets four points."
Interviewer,And that's also fair is the but no money is easy to set up for.
Vitalik,And it serves a lot of useful functions.
Interviewer,And so it kind of just survives in society as a meme for thousands of years.
Vitalik,"It's useful for the storage of wealth, it's useful for the exchange of value, and it's also useful for denominating future payments to account as a unit of account."
Interviewer,So what if you look at the history of money in human civilization?.
Vitalik,"What just if you're a student of history, like how has its role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time, in your view? Even if we just look at the 20th century before and then leading up to cryptocurrency, that's something you think about."
Interviewer,"Yeah, and I think I think the big thing in the 20th century is that if we saw a lot more intermediation and yes, I think in the first part is kind of the move from being adding more of different kinds of banking."
Vitalik,And then we saw the move from that of dollars being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold.
Interviewer,That's only redeemable by certain people.
Vitalik,"The dollar is not being backed by anything, too."
Interviewer,"And it's just this system where you have a bunch of free floating currencies and then people like getting rid of bank accounts and then those things becoming electronic, people getting accounts with payment processors that have bank accounts."
Vitalik,So
Interviewer,So what do you make of that?.
Vitalik,"That's a fascinating philosophical idea, that money might not be backed by anything."
Interviewer,What is that like confessing to you that money can exist without being backed by something physical?.
Vitalik,It definitely is.
Interviewer,"What do you make of that fact? How is that possible? Is that stable? If you look at the future of human civilization, is it possible to have money at the large scale, at such a hugely productive and rich societies, be able to operate successfully without money being backed by anything physical? Feel like? The interesting thing about the 21st century especially, is that a lot of the important valuable things are not backed by anything."
Vitalik,"Like if you look at the tech companies, for example, something like Twitter, and you could theoretically imagine that if all of the employees wanted to, they could kind of come together, they would quit and start working on Twitter 2.0 and then."
Interviewer,The value of and just kind of build the the the exact same products or possibly build a better product and then just kind of continue on from there.
Vitalik,And the original the original Twitter would just not have people left anymore.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,Like the there is theoretically kind of code and like IP that's owned by the company.
Interviewer,"But in reality, like good programmers could probably read up, rewrite all that stuff in three months."
Vitalik,So the like the reason why the thing has value is just kind of network effects and coordination.
Interviewer,Problems like these employees in reality are going to switch all at once.
Vitalik,And also the users aren't all going to switch at once because it's just difficult for them to switch at once.
Interviewer,"And so there is this kind of metastable and if equilibrium in interactions between thousands and millions of people that are just actually quite sticky, even though if you try to kind of assume that every once a perfectly rational and kind of perfectly slippery spherical cow, they don't seem to exist at all that stickiness."
Vitalik,"Do you have a sense, a grasp of the sort of the fundamental dynamic, like the physics of that stickiness? It seems to work, but and I think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely in it working."
Interviewer,"And it's you know, it's the sort of thing that's definitely been economically model a lot like one the kind of analogy of something similar that you often see in textbooks as like what is the government like if for like 80 percent of people in a country just like tomorrow, suddenly had the idea that the laws that are currently the laws and the government that currently is the government are just people."
Vitalik,And some other thing is the government and they just kind of start acting like it then that we're kind of become the new reality.
Interviewer,"And then the question is, well, what happens if and if between zero and 80 people or an 80 percent of people start believing that like what is the thing? You all you see is that if there is one of these kind of switches happening is kind of revolution, then if you're the first person to join, then you probably don't have the incentive to do that."
Vitalik,"But then if you're the 50 fifth percentile person to join, then suddenly becomes quite safe, too."
Interviewer,And so it's definitely is the sort of thing that you can kind of try to analyze that understands mathematically.
Vitalik,But one of the kind of results is that the sort of like when the switch happens definitely can be chaotic sometimes.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"But still like to me, the idea that the network effects that the fact that human beings at a scale like millions or billions can share even the idea of currency like."
Interviewer,"Yeah, all agree."
Vitalik,That's just I know economic model.
Interviewer,"I'm a skeptic on economics and it's like some my my favorite sort of field, maybe recreationally."
Vitalik,Psychology is trying to change human behavior.
Interviewer,"And I think sometimes people just kind of pretend that they can have a grasp on human behavior, even though we it's such a messy space that all the models that psychology or economics, those different perspectives on human behavior can have or are difficult."
Vitalik,It's difficult to know how much that's wishful thinking and how much it is actually getting to the core of understanding human behavior.
Interviewer,"But on that idea, what do you think is the role of money in human motivation?."
Vitalik,"So do you think money from an economics perspective, from a psychology perspective, is core to like human desires?."
Interviewer,Money is definitely very far from the only motivator.
Vitalik,It is a big motivator.
Interviewer,"And that's one of the closest things you have to a universal motivator, I think, because ultimately, in almost any person in the world, if you ask them to do something, they'll be more inclined to do it."
Vitalik,If you also offer some offer the money.
Interviewer,And that's like there's definitely many cases where people will do things other than things that maximize how much money they have.
Vitalik,And that happens all the time.
Interviewer,"But like the a lot of those other things are kind of much more specific to and if that person is and of what their situation is, the relationship between the motive in the action and these other things."
Vitalik,"What do you think is the interplay of the other motivator, like Neetu prospectives, power?."
Interviewer,"Do you think money equals power or do you think those are conflicting ideas? Do you think I mean, that's one of the ideas that decentralized currency, decentralized applications are looking at, is who holds the power?."
Vitalik,"Yeah, money is there."
Interviewer,"Only a kind of power, and there's definitely people who want money because it gives them power, and then even if my money doesn't seem to explicitly be about money, a lot of things that people spend money on are ultimately about social status of some kind."
Vitalik,So I definitely view those two things as of Interplaying.
Interviewer,And then there's also money as just a way of like measuring how successful you are.
Vitalik,"I guess the scoreboard right to this kind of gets back to the game, really."
Interviewer,"Like if you have four billion dollars, then the main benefit you get from going out, one of the big benefits you get from going up to six billion dollars is that now instead of being below the guy who has five year above, the guy who has five."
Vitalik,So you think money could be kind of in the game of life? It's also a measure of self-worth is Zarqawi.
Interviewer,It's definitely how how a lot of people perceive it.
Vitalik,Define ourselves in the hierarchy of.
Interviewer,"Yeah, and I'm not not saying it's sign of a healthy thing that people define their self-worth as money because it's definitely far from a perfect indicator of how much you value you provide to society or anything like this."
Vitalik,"But I definitely think that as a matter of kind of current practice, a bunch of people do feel that way."
Interviewer,So what does utopia from an economic perspective look like to you?.
Vitalik,What is a perfect world look like?.
Interviewer,I guess segue to the economist's utopia would be one where kind of.
Vitalik,"Everything is incentive airlines in the in the sense that there are kind of conflicts between what satisfies your goals and of what is good for everyone in the world, in the world as a whole, would you think that would look like?."
Interviewer,Does that mean they're still poor people and rich people? There's still income inequality.
Vitalik,Do you think sort of Marxist ideas are strong?.
Interviewer,"Do you think sort of ideas of objectivism are like where the market rules is strong? Like what? Is there a different economic philosophies that just seem to be reflective of utopia would be? No, I definitely think the existing economic philosophy is do end up kind of systematically deviating from the utopia."
Vitalik,"And a lot of ways, like one of the big things I talk about, for example, is public goods and public goods are especially important on the Internet has like the idea is what kind of money has this game where I was a few coin, a few coins and you gave the same number of coins, that this usually happens in a trade where I wish some money."
Interviewer,"You gain some money, you lose a sandwich and I get a sandwich."
Vitalik,And this kind of model works really well when the thing that we're using money to incentivize the sort of private goods.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,Things that you provide to one person to really benefit comes to one person.
Interviewer,"But the like on the Internet especially, but also many, many contacts."
Vitalik,"And if off the Internet there's actions that of individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit going to one person, the benefit just goes to many people at the same time."
Interviewer,And you can't control where the benefit goes to.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So, for example, this podcast know we publish it and when it's published, you don't have any fine grained control over like, oh, these thirty eight thousand people could watch it and then like these other twenty nine thousand people can't."
Vitalik,It's like once the number goes high enough then people just copy it.
Interviewer,And then when I write articles on a blog that they're just free for everyone and that stuff's even harder to prevent anyone from copying.
Vitalik,"So aside from that, things like, you know, scientific research, for example, and even taking more pedestrian examples like climate change mitigation would be a big one."
Interviewer,So there's a lot of things in the world where you have these kind of individual actions which have concentrated costs and distributed benefits and money as a point system does not do a good job of encouraging these things.
Vitalik,"And one of the other things, even tangentially connected to crypto, but kind of theoretically outside of it that I work on is the sort of mechanism called quadratics funding."
Interviewer,"And the way to think about it is kind of imagine a point system where if if one person gives coins and gives coins to one other person, then it works the same way as money."
Vitalik,"But if multiple people give coins to one person and they do so anonymously, so it's kind of not in consideration for a specific service to that person themselves, then the number of coins the received by that person is of greater than just the sum of the number of coins that have given by those different people."
Interviewer,"So the actual formula is you take the square root of the amount that each person gave, then you add all the square roots and then you have to square the subscript."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,Then give that.
Vitalik,"And the idea here would basically be that if let's say, for example, you just started going off kind of planting a lot of trees and there's a bunch of people that are really happy that you're planting trees."
Interviewer,So they go an all kind of throw a coin your way.
Vitalik,"Then the there is like basically the fact that kind of you get more than the Sobhi, you get this kind of square of some of these of a square root, some of these tiny amounts is that this actually kind of compensates for the tragedy of the commons redness."
Interviewer,There is even this kind of mathematical proof that it's sort of optimally compensates for it.
Vitalik,"What is the tragedy of the Commons? This is just this idea that if there is this situation where there is some public good that lots of people benefit from, then no individual person wants to contribute to it, because if they contribute, they only get a small part of the benefit from their contribution."
Interviewer,But they pay the full cost of their contribution.
Vitalik,In which context is this?.
Interviewer,So what does the term quadratic quadratic funding like?.
Vitalik,What's in which context does this mechanism use for so obvious?.
Interviewer,You said.
Vitalik,"To combat the tragedy of the Commons, but in which context you see it as useful if you practice this."
Interviewer,"Yes, theoretically public goods in general."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So like like services, like what do we what are we talking about?."
Vitalik,"What the public does within the ethereal ecosystem, for example, like we've actually tried using this mechanism."
Interviewer,I wrote a couple of articles about the sort of on Vitello dossier where I go through some of the most recent rounds.
Vitalik,And it's been really interesting.
Interviewer,"Some of the top ones that people supported, there were things like just online user interfaces that make it easier for people to interact with a theory."
Vitalik,"There was no documentation, there are podcasts, there were no software and of clients the kind of implementations of the theory and protocol of privacy tools, just like lots of things that are useful to lots of people."
Interviewer,There weren't a lot of people are contributing like funding a particular particular entity.
Vitalik,That's really that's really interesting.
Interviewer,"Is there something special about the quadratic, the the the sum of the square roots? And."
Vitalik,"Yeah, so another way to think about it is like, imagine if any people each give a dollar, then the person gets and squared."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,And and so each individual person's contribution gets multiplied by an and because they have nine people.
Interviewer,And so that kind of perfectly compensates for the kind of end one tragedy of the commons.
Vitalik,I just wonder if the squared part is fundamental though.
Interviewer,It is.
Vitalik,And I'd recommend you go to the overtalk Nazia.
Interviewer,"I have this article called A Quadratic Payments, a Primer and highly recommended."
Vitalik,It's kind of at least my attempt so far of exploiting the intuition behind this intuition.
Interviewer,"So if we could, can we go to the the very basics?."
Vitalik,What is the block chain?.
Interviewer,"Or perhaps we might even start at the the Byzantine generals problem in presenting fault tolerance in general, that I Bitcoin was taking steps to providing a solution for them."
Vitalik,"So the Byzantine generals problem, it's this paper that Leslie Lamport published in nineteen eighty two where he has to start experiments where if you have two generals that are kind of camped out on opposite sides of a city and they're planning when to attack the city, then the question is then of how could those generals coordinate with each other and they could send messengers between each other."
Interviewer,But those messengers kind of could get sniped by the enemy on the road road.
Vitalik,"Some of those messages could end up being traitors, that if things could end up happening and with just the two best generals, it turns out that there's kind of no solution and a finite number of rounds."
Interviewer,That guarantee is that they will be able to kind of coordinate on the same answer.
Vitalik,"But then in the case where you have more than two generals to then once we analyze this case as like, ah, the messenger message is kind of just all messages are the messages kind of signed messages."
Interviewer,So I could give you a solid message and you can pass along that side the message.
Vitalik,And the third party could still verify that.
Interviewer,I originally made that message.
Vitalik,"And depending on those different cases, there is kind of different bounds."
Interviewer,"I'd like given how many generals that how many traitors among those generals and like under what conditions, you actually can't agree what to launch an attack."
Vitalik,So it's actually a big misconception that the Byzantine generals problem was unsolved.
Interviewer,So ultimately the reports solved it.
Vitalik,"The thing that was unsolved, though, is that all of these solutions assume that you have already agreed on a fixed list of who the generals are."
Interviewer,And these generals have to be kind of semi trusted to some extent.
Vitalik,"They can't just be anonymous people because if they're anonymous, then, like the enemy could just be ninety nine percent of the generals."
Interviewer,And so.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"The, um, in the 1980s, in the nineteen nineties, head of the general use case for distributed system stuff was more kind of enterprise, the stuff where you could kind of assume that you know who the nodes are that are running these kind of computer networks."
Vitalik,"So if you wants to have some kind of decentralized computer network that pretends to be a single computer that you can kind of do and have operations on, then it's made out of the sort of fifty and specific computers."
Interviewer,And we know kind of cool and where they are.
Vitalik,"And so we have a good reason to believe that, say, at least 11 of them would be fine and it could also be within a six."
Interviewer,Legal system.
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,"Almost a network of devices, sensors go on like an airplanes and I think like flight systems in general still use these kinds of ideas."
Vitalik,Yep.
Interviewer,Yep.
Vitalik,So that's the 80s.
Interviewer,That's the 80s and 90s.
Vitalik,"Now, the cypherpunks had a different use case in mind, which is that they wanted to create a fully decentralized global position with currency."
Interviewer,"And the problem here is that they didn't want any authorities and they didn't even want any kind of privilege, the list of people."
Vitalik,"And so now the question is, well, how do you use these techniques to create consensus when you have no way of kind of measuring identity is right."
Interviewer,You have no way of determining whether or not some 99 percent of participants aren't actually all the same guy.
Vitalik,"And so the clever solution that Satoshi had, this is kind of going back to that presentation I made at Def Con a few months ago where I said that the things that she invented was crypto economics."
Interviewer,"Is this really neat idea that you can use economic resources to kind of limit identify how many identities you can get and the if there isn't any existing decentralized digital currency, that the only way to do this is with proof of work."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So with proof of work, the solution is just."
Vitalik,"You publish a solution to a hard mathematical puzzle that takes some kind of clearly calculable amount of computational power to solve, you get an identity and then you solve five of those puzzles, you get five identities."
Interviewer,And then these are the identities that we run the kids and the cell growth of between.
Vitalik,So the proof of work mechanism you just described is like the fundamental idea proposed in man in the white paper defines bitcoin.
Interviewer,What's the idea of consensus that we wish to reach worldwide consensus important here? What is consensus?.
Vitalik,"So the goal here is just simple technical terms is to basically kind of wired together a set of a large number of computers in such a way that the kind of pretends to the outside world to be a single computer where that single user keeps working, even if a large portion of the kind of constituents computers that make it up, break it kind of break in arbitrary ways, like they could shut off, they could try to actively break a system, they could do lots of things."
Interviewer,So the reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do this is because they wanted to run one particular program on this virtual computer.
Vitalik,And the one particular program that they wanted to run is just a currency system.
Interviewer,Right? It's a system that just processes a series of transactions.
Vitalik,"And for every transaction, it verifies that the sender has enough coins to pay for the transaction and verifies that the digital signature is correct."
Interviewer,"And if the checks pass, then it subtracts the coins from one account to announce the coins to the other account to roughly."
Vitalik,"So first of all, the the the proof of work idea has kind of I mean, at least to me, seems pretty fascinating."
Interviewer,It is.
Vitalik,"I mean, that's a kind of revolutionary idea."
Interviewer,Is it is it obvious to come up with that? You can use you can exchange basically computational resources for for identity.
Vitalik,So it's it actually has a pretty long history.
Interviewer,"It was first proposed in a paper by Cynthia Work and the DNA or in nineteen ninety four, I believe, and the original use case was combating email spam."
Vitalik,"So the idea is that if you send an email, you have to send it with the work attached and like this makes it reasonably cheap to send emails to your friends, but it makes it really expensive to send spam to a billion people."
Interviewer,"Yeah, that's a simple, brilliant idea."
Vitalik,So maybe also taking a step back.
Interviewer,So what is the role of block chain in this?.
Vitalik,What is the block chain? Sure.
Interviewer,So the blocking my way of thinking about it is that it is this kind of system where you have this kind of one virtual computer created by a bunch of these nodes in the network.
Vitalik,"And the reason why the term block chain is used is because the data structure that these systems used, at least so far, is one where they have different nodes in the network periodically publish blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions together with a pointer, like a hash of a a previous block that it builds on top of."
Interviewer,And so you have a series of blocks that that nodes in the network create for each bullet points to the previous block.
Vitalik,And so you have this chain of them is fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of block chain or a lot of possibilities of different ways to make sure there's no funny stuff going on.
Interviewer,There are indeed a lot of possibilities.
Vitalik,"So any kind of just simple architecture, as I just described, the way the fault tolerance happens is like this, right? So you have a bunch of nodes and they're just happily of occasionally creating blocks, building on top of each other's blocks."
Interviewer,"And let's say you have kind of one block, we'll call it kind of block one and then someone else builds another block, honestly, or called block two."
Vitalik,Then we have an attacker.
Interviewer,"And what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries to revert back to the way they revert back to is instead of doing the thing they're supposed to do, which is build a block on top of block two or they're going to build another block on top of block one."
Vitalik,"Um, so you have block one, which has two children, block to block to prime."
Interviewer,"Now, this might sometimes even happen by random chance if two nodes in the network just happen to create blocks at the same time and they don't hear about each other things before they create their own."
Vitalik,But this also could happen because of an attack.
Interviewer,"Now, if this happens, you have an attack then the no."
Vitalik,"In the Bitcoin system, the nodes follow the longest chain."
Interviewer,"So if this attack had happened and when the original channel had more than two blocks on it, so if it was trying to kind of revert more than more than two blocks, then everyone would just I would just ignore it and everyone would just keep following the regular chain."
Vitalik,"But here, you know, we have block two and we have block two prime."
Interviewer,And so that you were kind of either and then whatever block the next block is created on top of.
Vitalik,Soucy Block three is now created on top of block two prime.
Interviewer,Then everyone agrees that Block three is the new head and block two prime is just kind of forgotten.
Vitalik,And then everyone just kind of peacefully builds on top of block three and then continues.
Interviewer,So how difficult is it to mess the system? I know.
Vitalik,"So how if we look at the general problem, like how many what fraction of people who participate in the system have to be bad players in order to mess with actually."
Interviewer,"OK, what's there is there is there a good number theory as well, depending on what your model of the participants is and what kind of attack we're talking about, it's anywhere between twenty three point two and fifty percent."
Vitalik,"Of what? Of all of the computing power of the network, sorry."
Interviewer,So twenty to twenty three point between twenty three point two and fifty percent and 50 percent can be compromised.
Vitalik,"So, like, once your once your purse, your portion of the total computing power of the network goes above the twenty three point to level, that there's a lot of things that you could mean, things that you can potentially do."
Interviewer,"And as your percentage of the network kind of keeps going up, then the your abilities as you mean things kind of goes higher than if you have above 50 percent, then you can just break everything."
Vitalik,So how hard is it to achieve that level?.
Interviewer,It seems that.
Vitalik,"So far, historically speaking, it's been exceptionally difficult."
Interviewer,So this is a challenging question.
Vitalik,So the economic cost of acquiring that level of stuff from scratch is fairly high.
Interviewer,I think it's somewhere in the low billions of dollars.
Vitalik,"And when you say that stuff, you mean computational resources?."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So specifically specialized hardware and of ASX that people use to solve these puzzles just to do the mining is not a small tangent.
Interviewer,So obviously I work a lot and deep learning with GPS and asks for that application.
Vitalik,And I tangentially kind of hear that so many of these cities and views are sold out because of this other application.
Interviewer,"I would do if you can comment, I don't know if you're familiar or interested in the space, what kind of a6 what kind of hardware is generally used these days for to do the actual computation for the proof of work."
Vitalik,Sure.
Interviewer,So in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum are a bit different.
Vitalik,"So in the case of Bitcoin, there is an algorithm called the shots."
Interviewer,Fifty six.
Vitalik,That's just a hash function.
Interviewer,"And so the puzzle is just coming up with a number, with the hash over the numbers below some threshold."
Vitalik,"And so because the hashes are designed to be random, you just have to keep on trying different numbers until one works."
Interviewer,And the Aztecs are just like specialized circuits that contain additive circuits for evaluating this hash over and over again.
Vitalik,And you have like millions or billions of these hash evaluators and just stacked on top of each other inside of a box.
Interviewer,And you just keep on running the box 24/7.
Vitalik,And there there's literally specialized hardware designed for this.
Interviewer,"Yes, this is we live in an amazing world."
Vitalik,Another tangent and I'll come back to the basics.
Interviewer,But does quantum computing throw a wrench into any of this?.
Vitalik,Very good question.
Interviewer,So quantum computers have two main and to families of algorithms that are relevant to cryptography.
Vitalik,One is Shor's algorithm ensures the algorithm is one that kind of completely breaks the hardness of some specific kinds of mathematical problems.
Interviewer,So the one that you've probably heard of is it makes it very easy to factor in numbers.
Vitalik,"So figure out kind of what prime factors are, the kind of that you need to multiply together to get some number, even if that number is extremely big."
Interviewer,Shor's algorithm can also be used to break elliptic curve cryptography.
Vitalik,It can break any kind of hit in order groups.
Interviewer,"The big breaks, a lot of kind of cryptographic nice things that we're used to."
Vitalik,"But the good news is that for every kind of major use of things that Shor's algorithm breaks, we already know of quantum proof alternative's."
Interviewer,"Right now, we don't use these Quisenberry alternatives yet because in many cases they're five to 10 times less efficient."
Vitalik,"But and the crypto industry in general, ahead of those of this is coming eventually and sort of ready to take the hit and switch to that stuff when we when we have to."
Interviewer,The second algorithm that is the relevance of cryptography is Grovers algorithm and engravers algorithm might even be a bit more familiar to people that's basically usually described as solving search problems.
Vitalik,"But the idea here is that if you have a problem over the form, finds a number that satisfies some property, then if with a classical computer you need to try and have end times before before you find the number, then with the quantum computer, you only need to do a square root of N computations."
Interviewer,And Grovers could potentially be used for mining.
Vitalik,But there's two possibilities here.
Interviewer,One is that Grovers could be used for mining and whoever creates the first working quantum computer that could do Grovers will just mind way faster than everyone else.
Vitalik,"And we'll see another round of what we saw when ASX came out, which is that's kind of the new hardware, just kind of dominated the old stuff."
Interviewer,"And then eventually it switched to a new equilibrium, by the way, way faster, not exponentially faster, quite dramatically faster, radically faster, which is not sort of it's not game changing."
Vitalik,I would say it's like ASX like you said it would be.
Interviewer,Exactly.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,So it would not necessarily break proof of work.
Vitalik,That's right.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"Now, the other kind of possible world, right, is that quantum computers have a lot of overhead."
Interviewer,There is a lot of complexity involved in maintaining quantum states.
Vitalik,"And there's also, as we've been realising recently, making quantum computers actually work requires that of quantum error correction, which requires kind of a thousand real cubits per logical garbage."
Interviewer,"And so there the very real possibility that the overhead of running a quantum computer will be higher than the speed up you get with Grovers, which would."
Vitalik,"Kind of sad, but which would also mean the proof of work will just keep working fine, so beautifully put, so, so proof of work is the core idea of Bitcoin is there are other core ideas before we kind of take a step towards the origin story and ideas of Ethereum."
Interviewer,Is there other stuff that were key to the white paper of Bitcoin?.
Vitalik,"There is proof of work and that there is just the cryptography is just kind of public keys and signatures that are used to verify transactions, those two really big things."
Interviewer,"So then what is the origin story? Maybe the human side, but also the technical side of a theory, I'm sure."
Vitalik,"So I joins the Bitcoin community in 2011, and they started by just writing."
Interviewer,I first wrote for this sort of online thing called Bitcoin Weekly.
Vitalik,Then I started writing for Bitcoin magazine and sorry to interrupt.
Interviewer,"You have this funny kind of story, true or not, is that you were disillusioned by the downsides of centralized control from your experience with, Wow, World of Warcraft."
Vitalik,"Is this true or you're just being witty? I mean, the event is true of the fact that that's the reason I do decentralization is what you maybe just a small tangent."
Interviewer,Have you always had a skepticism of centralized control? Is that some degree?.
Vitalik,Has that feeling evolved over time or is that just always been a core feeling that decentralized control is the future of human society?.
Interviewer,It's definitely been something that felt very attractive to me ever since I could have heard that such a thing is possible.
Vitalik,Possible even.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So great.
Interviewer,So you're enjoying the Bitcoin community in 2011.
Vitalik,You say you began writing.
Interviewer,So what's next?.
Vitalik,"I started writing, moved from high school to university."
Interviewer,"Halfway in between that, I spent a year in the university."
Vitalik,"Then at the end of that year, I dropped out to do Bitcoin things full time."
Interviewer,"And this was a combination of continuing to write Bitcoin magazine, but also increasingly to work on software projects."
Vitalik,"And I traveled around the world for about six months and just going to different Bitcoin communities like I went to first in New Hampshire, then Spain, other European places, Israel and then San Francisco and along the way."
Interviewer,And I've met a lot of other people that are working on different Bitcoin projects.
Vitalik,"And when I was in Israel, there were some very smart teams there that were working on ideas that people were starting to have called Bitcoin 2.0."
Interviewer,"So one of these was colored coins, which is basically saying that, hey, let's not just use the bullshit for Bitcoin, but it's also a kind of issue, other kinds of assets on it."
Vitalik,"And then there was a protocol called Master Quired that supported issuing assets, but also supported many other things, like financial contracts, like domain name registration and a lot of different things together."
Interviewer,And I spent some time working with these teams and I quickly realized that this masticating protocol could be improved by a kind of generalising it more right.
Vitalik,So the best the analogy I use is that the MasterCard protocol was like the Swiss Army knife.
Interviewer,You have twenty five different transaction types for twenty five different applications.
Vitalik,But what I realized is that you could replace a bunch of them with things that are more general-purpose.
Interviewer,So one of them was that you could replace like three transaction types for three types of financial contracts with a generic transaction type for a financial contract.
Vitalik,Just once you specify a mathematical formula for kind of how much money each side gets.
Interviewer,"By the way, it's a small pause once you see a financial contract, just the terminology, what is the contract? What's a financial contract?."
Vitalik,"So this is just generally an agreement where kind of either one or two parties kind of put collateral or kind of end and then they, depending on if certain conditions like this could involve prices of assets that could involve the actions of the two parties, could involve other things, but they kind of get have different amounts of kind of assets out that just depend on things that happened."
Interviewer,So a contract is really a financial contract is at the core.
Vitalik,It's it's the core interactive element of a financial system.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,There's there's many different kinds of financial contract.
Interviewer,There's things like options where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing that you have for some specific price for some period of time.
Vitalik,"There's contracts for difference where you basically are kind of making a bet that says, like for every dollar this thing goes up, I'll give you seven dollars, or for every dollar the thing goes down, you give me seven dollars or something like that."
Interviewer,And but the main idea that.
Vitalik,These contracts have to be enforced and trust them.
Interviewer,"Yes, exactly."
Vitalik,You have to trust that they will work out in a system where nobody can be trusted.
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,"This is such a beautiful, complicated system."
Interviewer,"OK, so so you are seeking to kind of generalize this basic framework of contracts."
Vitalik,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,So what does that entail? So what technically are the steps to creating a theory?.
Vitalik,I'm sure so I guess just kind of continue a bit with this master coin story.
Interviewer,So started by giving ideas for how to generalize the thing.
Vitalik,"And eventually this turned into a much more kind of fully fledged proposal that just says, hey, how about you scrap all your future is and instead you just put in this programming language."
Interviewer,"And I gave this idea to them and their response was something like, hey, this is great, but this seems complicated and it seems like something that we're not going to be able to put onto our roadmap for a while."
Vitalik,"And my response to this was like, we do not realize how revolutionary this is."
Interviewer,We'll just go do it myself.
Vitalik,"And then I was the name of the programming, which I just called it ultimate scripting."
Interviewer,So then I kind of went through a couple more rounds of iteration and then the idea for a theory of itself started to form.
Vitalik,And the idea here is that you just have a block chain where the core unit of the thing is what we call contracts as these accounts that can hold assets and they have their own internal memory but that are controlled by a piece of code.
Interviewer,"And so if I send some ether to a contract, the only thing that can determine where that either the currency inside a theory goes after that is the code of that contract itself."
Vitalik,"And so basically, you're kind of sending assets to computer programs becomes this sort of paradigm for creating these sort of a self executing agreements, self executing as so-called."
Interviewer,The code is sort of part of this contract.
Vitalik,So that that's what's meant by smart contracts.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So how hard was it to build this kind of thing?.
Interviewer,Harder than expected.
Vitalik,"Originally, I actually thought that this would be a thing that I would kind of casually work on for a couple of months, publish and then go back to university."
Interviewer,"Then I released it and a bunch of people or I released a white paper, white paper that was there."
Vitalik,"The idea, the white paper, a whole bunch of people came in offering to help a huge number of people and have expressed interest."
Interviewer,And this was something that was totally not expecting.
Vitalik,And then I realized that this would be something this kind of much bigger than I had ever thought that it would be.
Interviewer,And then we started on this kind of much longer development slog of making something that lives up to this sort of much higher level of expectations.
Vitalik,What are some of the is it fundamentally like software engineering challenges? It was social.
Interviewer,"OK, so there's no social."
Vitalik,So so what are the biggest interesting challenges that you've learned about human civilization and in software engineering through this process?.
Interviewer,So I guess one of the challenges for me is that I'm one of the kind of apparently unusual geeks who was sort of never treated with anything but kindness in school.
Vitalik,"And so when I got into crypto, I never expected everyone would just kind of be the same kind of altruistic and nice in that same way."
Interviewer,But the job of the algorithm that I used for finding co-founders for this thing was not very good.
Vitalik,It was sort of literally what computer scientists called the greedy algorithm.
Interviewer,It's sort of the first 50 people who applied back offering to help kind of are the co-founders.
Vitalik,"I mean, like literally the people that form formed to be the founders, co-founders of the community, the algorithm."
Interviewer,I like how you call it the algorithm.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And so what happened was that these especially as the project got really big, like there started to be a lot of this kind of infighting and there were a lot of like I wanted the thing to be a nonprofit and some of them wanted to be a for profit."
Vitalik,And then there started to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with each other.
Interviewer,There were people that were kind of trying to get an advantage for themselves and a lot of different ways.
Vitalik,And this just about six months later led to this big governance crisis.
Interviewer,"And then we got a reshuffled leadership, a bid, and then the project kept on going."
Vitalik,"Then nine months later, there was another governance crisis and an."
Interviewer,There was the third governance crisis.
Vitalik,"So is there a way to if you're looking at the human side of things, is there a way to optimize this aspect of the cryptocurrency world?."
Interviewer,It seems that there is.
Vitalik,"From my perspective, there's a lot of different characters and personalities and egos."
Interviewer,"And like you said, I don't know if."
Vitalik,"You know, I also like to think that most of the world, most of the people in the world are well-intentioned, but the way those intentions are realized may perhaps come off, as you know, as negative."
Interviewer,"What is there is there a hopeful message here about creating a governance structure for cryptocurrency that where everyone gets along and after about four rounds of reshuffle, I think we've actually come up with something that seems to be pretty stable and happy and think I mean, I definitely do think that most people are well intentioned."
Vitalik,I just think that one of the reasons why I like decentralization is just because there is like this thing about power where power attracts people with egos.
Interviewer,And so that just allows those very small percentage of people to just to ruin so many things.
Vitalik,You think ego as you think ego has a use like is ego always bad?.
Interviewer,It seems like sometimes does.
Vitalik,"But then the theory research team, I feel like we've found also a lot of a lot of very good people that are just."
Interviewer,"Primarily, you're just interested in things for the technology and things seem to just generally be going quite well."
Vitalik,"Yeah, when you're when the focus and the passion is in the tech, so on."
Interviewer,So that's the human side of things with the technology side.
Vitalik,"What have you learned? What have been the biggest challenges of bringing a theory to life? On the technology side, so I think, first of all, just."
Interviewer,"There are others, like the first law of software development, which is that when someone gives you a timetable of a switch, the unit of times, the next largest unit of time and one, we basically fell victim to that."
Vitalik,"And so instead of taking that like three months, that ended up taking 20 months to watch the thing."
Interviewer,"And that was just, I think, underestimating the sheer technical complexity of the thing."
Vitalik,"There were research challenges like so for example, one of the things that we've been saying from the start that we would do one is a switch from a proof of work to proof of stake, more proof of stake as to this alternative consensus mechanism where instead of having to waste a lot of computing power on solving these mathematical puzzles that don't mean anything, you kind of prove that you have access to coins inside of the system and this that it gives you some level of participation and the consensus."
Interviewer,Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit? I understand the idea of before work.
Vitalik,I know that a lot of people say that the idea of proof of steak is really appealing.
Interviewer,Maybe linger a longer explain what it is.
Vitalik,Sure.
Interviewer,"So basically, the idea is like if I kind of walk up a hundred coins, then I turn that into a kind of, quote, virtual binder and the system itself kind of automatically, sort of randomly assigns that in a virtual binder is a right to create blocks that particular travels."
Vitalik,"And then if someone else has 200 coins and then a walk on the walk, there's 200 coins, then they get a kind of twice as big a virtual binder."
Interviewer,They'll be able to create their blocks twice as often.
Vitalik,"So it tries to kind of do similar things to proof of work, except instead of the thing kind of limiting your participation to being your ability to crank out solutions to kind of hash challenges."
Interviewer,The thing that really makes your participation is kind of how much coins you're walking into this mechanism.
Vitalik,"OK, so interesting so that that limited participation doesn't require you to run a lot of compute."
Interviewer,"Does that mean that the richer you are, so rich people are more like their identities, more right."
Vitalik,And the stable.
Interviewer,"Yeah, four or five or whatever, whatever the right terminology is, right, and this is definitely a covid critique, I think my usual answer to this is that like proof of work is even more of that kind of system."
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,"Yeah, because I didn't mean it."
Vitalik,"And that that as a criticism, I think you're exactly right."
Interviewer,That's equivalent to proof of war because the same kind of thing.
Vitalik,"But the before work, you have to also use physical resources."
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,And broken computers and burn trees and all of that stuff.
Interviewer,Is there a way to mess with the system of the proof of proof stake?.
Vitalik,There is.
Interviewer,But you will once again need to have a very large portion of all the coins that are locked in the system to do anything bad.
Vitalik,Got it.
Interviewer,"Yeah, and just that maybe take a small change in one of the criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact that it gets for the proof of work mechanism if to use so much energy in the world."
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,Is one of the motivations of proof of stake is to move away from this.
Vitalik,Definitely.
Interviewer,What's your sense of that? Maybe I'm just under informed.
Vitalik,Is there like legitimately environmental impact from this?.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So the latest thing was that Bitcoin consumed as much energy as the country of Austria or something like that.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"And then Ethereum as of right now, maybe only like half an order of magnitude smaller than Bitcoin."
Interviewer,I've heard you talk about a Ethereum 2.0.
Vitalik,So what's the what's the dream of Ethereum 2.0? What's what's the status of proof of state? Because the mechanism that Ethereum moves towards and also how do you move to a different mechanism of consensus within a cryptocurrency?.
Interviewer,So Ethereum 2.0 is a collection of major upgrades that we've wanted to do to Ethereum for quite some time.
Vitalik,"The two big ones, one is proof of stake and the other is that we call sharding."
Interviewer,"Sharding solves another problem with big chains, which is a scalability."
Vitalik,"And what Sharding does is it basically says instead of every participant in the network having to personally download and verify every transaction, every participant in the network only downloads and verifies a small portion of transactions."
Interviewer,And then you kind of randomly distribute who gets how much work.
Vitalik,"And because of how the distribution is random, it still has the property that you need a large portion of the entire network to corrupt what's going on inside of any Shahd."
Interviewer,But the system is still at a very redundance and very secure as brilliant.
Vitalik,How hard is that to implement and how hard is proof of stake to implement? Like on the technical level?.
Interviewer,"Yeah, software level, proof of stake and sharding are both challenging."
Vitalik,I'd say sharding is a bit more challenging.
Interviewer,The reason is that proof of stake is kind of just a change to the core.
Vitalik,The consensus layer works.
Interviewer,"Sharding does both that, but it's also a change to the networking layer."
Vitalik,"The reason is that sharding is kind of pointless if at the networking layer you still do what you do today, which is you kind of gossip everything, which means that if someone publishes something, every other node in the client hears it from on the networking layer."
Interviewer,And so instead we have to have enough sub networks and the ability to quickly switch between sub networks and other sub networks talk to each other.
Vitalik,And this is all doable.
Interviewer,But it's a more complex architecture and it's definitely the sort of thing that has not yet been done in cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,"So most most of the networking layer in cryptocurrency is you're shouting broadcast messages and this is more like ad hoc networks, like you're shouting within smaller groups, smaller group, but you have like a bunch of subnet like executive and you have to switch to, oh, man, I'd love to see the as it it's a beautiful idea."
Interviewer,"So from a graph, theoretical perspective, but just the software and who's responsible is Ethereum project like the people involved, would they be implementing like what's the actual you know, this is like legit software engineering who like how does that work?."
Vitalik,"How do people collaborate, build that kind of project? Is this like almost like is there a software engineering lead?."
Interviewer,Is there is a legit almost like large scale open source project is.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,So we have someone named Danny Ryan on our team who has just been brilliant and regrade all around.
Vitalik,And he is a kind of de facto kind of development coordinator.
Interviewer,I guess it's like you have to invent job titles for this stuff.
Vitalik,"And the reason is that, look, we also have this unique kind of organizational structure where the Ethereum Foundation itself and it does research in-house, but then the actual implementation is done by independent teams that are separate companies and they're located all around the world and fun places like Australia."
Interviewer,And so you can kind of just need a bunch of sort of almost non.
Vitalik,"Cat herding to just keep getting these people to talk to each other and kind of implement this back, make sure that everyone agrees on what's going on and kind of how to interpret different things."
Interviewer,"So how far into the future are we from these two mechanisms and a theorem to point out like, what's your sense of the timeline, keeping in mind the previous comment you made about the sort of general Kurzem software projects?."
Vitalik,So Ethereum 2.0 is split into three phases.
Interviewer,So Phase Zero just creates a bit of stake network.
Vitalik,And it's actually separate from kind of proof of the proven work network at the beginning just to kind of give it time to grow and improve itself.
Interviewer,The people get to choose.
Vitalik,Sorry to interrupt.
Interviewer,"If people get to choose, I guess we can think as they choose to move over if they want to, then phase one adds sharding, but it only adds sharding of active data storage and not sharding of computation."
Vitalik,"And then after that, there is that of the merger phase, which is where the and the accounts are kind of smart contracts like all of the activity on the existing etha, one system just kind of gets cut and pasted into two and the word change gets forgotten and then and things all the things that were living there before and just kind of continue living inside of the system."
Interviewer,So for timeline's phase zero has been kind of almost fully implemented and now it's just a matter of a whole bunch of security auditing and testing.
Vitalik,"My own experience is that right now it feels like right about a phase comparable to when we were doing the original Ethereum launch, when we were maybe about four months away from launch."
Interviewer,But that's just a hunch and that's just a hunch.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"So how you know, it took it took over a decade for people to move from Python to Python three."
Vitalik,"How do you see the move from, like this phase of zero of four four different concepts?."
Interviewer,The mechanism do you see there being a drastic phase shift in people just kind of jumping to this better mechanism?.
Vitalik,"So in phase zero, don't expect too many people to do much because in phase zero, in phase one, the new chain of deliberately, it doesn't have too much functionality or none."
Interviewer,"It's there just like if you want to be a proof of stake validator, you can get things started."
Vitalik,"If you want to store data for other botulin applications, you can get started."
Interviewer,But existing applications will largely keep living on E one.
Vitalik,"And then when the merger happens, then the merger is the operation that happens all at once."
Interviewer,So that's sort of one of the benefits of such a system.
Vitalik,"Like on the one hand, you have to coordinate the upgrade, but on the other hand, the upgrade can be coordinated."
Interviewer,"So what's Kasparov FFG, by the way, Kasparov G is the consensus algorithm that we are using for the of stake."
Vitalik,"Is there something interesting specific about Kasparov of like some beautiful aspect of it that there is so Kasparov Evgenia combines together kind of two different schools of, say, algorithm design."
Interviewer,So the general two different schools of the of the design are right.
Vitalik,One is at a 50 percent fault tolerant but dependent on network security.
Interviewer,"So 50 percent volks, holer fault tolerant, but it gets all read up to 50 percent of fault's, but not more."
Vitalik,"But it depends on an assumption that all of the nodes can talk, talk to each other within some of a limited period of time."
Interviewer,"Like if I send the message, you'll receive it within a few seconds."
Vitalik,"And the second school is thirty three percent fault tolerant but safe under a synchrony, which means that if we agree on something, then nothing is finalized."
Interviewer,"And even if the network goes horribly wonky the second after that thing is finalized, there's no way to revert that thing."
Vitalik,And that's fascinating how you would make that happen.
Interviewer,It's definitely quite clever.
Vitalik,I'd recommend the Kasparov of paper if you just search like archive.
Interviewer,I said like er XIV Kasper FFG.
Vitalik,It's the papers and archive.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,Who are the authors.
Interviewer,Myself and Virgil Griffith.
Vitalik,That's awesome.
Interviewer,I take a small tangent.
Vitalik,This idea of just putting out white papers and papers and putting them on archives is putting them publicly.
Interviewer,"Is it, is that at the core."
Vitalik,Is that a necessary component of currencies that the tradition started with and Satoshi Nakamoto is what we make of it? What do you make of the future of that kind of sharing of ideas?.
Interviewer,"I guess so, yeah."
Vitalik,"And it's definitely something that's kind of mandatory for crypto because, like, crypto is all about making systems where you don't have to trust the operators to trust that the thing works."
Interviewer,"And so if anything behind our system works is closed, source to that kind of kills the point."
Vitalik,"And so there is the kind of a sense in which the fundamental properties of the category of the thing we're trying to build just kind of forces openness, but also openness just has proven to be a really great way to collaborate."
Interviewer,And there's actually a lot of sort of innovation and academic collaboration that's just kind of happened ad hoc in the crypto space the last few years.
Vitalik,"So like, for example, we have this forum called Ethe Research that's like ETG or NCAR, the dots."
Interviewer,And there we publish kind of just ideas in a form that's kind of how formal like it's halfway in between.
Vitalik,"Like it's it's a kind of a text right up and you can have math in it, but it's often sort of much shorter than a paper."
Interviewer,"And it turns out that the great majority of new ideas, like they're just kind of fairly small nuggets that you can explain in like five to 10 lines that they don't really need the whole format of the paper."
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,They don't require the kind of like 10 pages of filler.
Vitalik,And so introduction conclusion is not needed.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So instead you just kind of publish the idea that people will your comments on it.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,This has been so great for us.
Interviewer,I think I interrupted you.
Vitalik,Was there something else on Caspar FFG that's just Casper FFG is just kind of combines together these two schools.
Interviewer,"And so basically it creates this system where if you have more than 50 percent that are honest then and you have network synchrony, then the thing kind of goes has a chain."
Vitalik,"But then if Network Sacranie fails, then kind of the last few blocks of the chain might get replaced."
Interviewer,But anything that was finalized by this set of more asynchronous process gets like can't be reverted.
Vitalik,And so you essentially get a kind of best of both worlds between those two models.
Interviewer,"OK, so I know what I'm doing to you reading the Gettysburg Paper."
Vitalik,"I apologize for the romanticized question, but what to you are some or the most beautiful idea in the world of a theorem? Just something surprising, something beautiful, something powerful."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"I mean, I think the fact that money can just emerge out of a database if enough people believe in it, I think is definitely one of those things that's up there."
Interviewer,I think one of the things that I really love about a theorem is also this concept of possibility.
Vitalik,"So this is the idea that if I build an application on top of a theory, then you can build an application that talks to my application and you don't even need my permission."
Interviewer,You don't even need to talk to me.
Vitalik,"But so one really fun example of this, as there was this sort of game on a theory called Crypto Kiddie's, the just involvement of breeding digital cats."
Interviewer,"And someone else created a game called Crypto Dragons, where the way you play Crypto Dragons is you have a dragon and you have to foetid crypto kitties."
Vitalik,"And they just created the whole thing, just like as an ethereal contract that you would send these these tokens that are defined by this other Ethereum contract."
Interviewer,"And for the interoperability to happen, like the projects that don't really need to look, the teams don't really need to talk to each other."
Vitalik,"You just kind of interface with the existing program arbitrarily, composable in this kind of way."
Interviewer,You have different groups that could be working.
Vitalik,And so you could see it scaling to just outside of dragons and kiddie's.
Interviewer,It could be built like entire ecosystems of software.
Vitalik,"Yeah, it's kind of like I mean, especially in the decentralized finance space that's been popping up in the last two years."
Interviewer,There has been a huge amount of of really interesting things happen as a result of this is a particular kind of like financial applications kind of thing.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"I mean, there's like stable coins."
Vitalik,"So this is kind of tokens that retain value equal to one dollar, but they're kind of backed by a cryptocurrency that there's decentralized exchanges."
Interviewer,"So as far as decentralized exchanges goes up, there's this really interesting construction that has existed for about one one and a half years now called."
Vitalik,"So what you swipe is that's a smart contract that holds the balances of two tokens we'll call token, and so it can be and it maintains that invariants that the balance of talking a multiplied by the balance of token, B has to equal the same value."
Interviewer,"And so the way that you trade against the thing is basically like you have this kind of curve, you know, like X times Y equals K, and before you trade it at some points on the curve, after you trade, you just like picks up any any other points on the curve."
Vitalik,"And then whatever the Delta X is that's stimulative because you provide whatever the Delta Y is, that's the amount of detail that you get or vice versa."
Interviewer,And that's just and then kind of the slope at the current points on the curve is the price.
Vitalik,And so that just is the whole thing.
Interviewer,And that just allows you to have this exchange for tokens.
Vitalik,"And even if there's very few participants and the whole thing is just like so simple and it's just very easy to set out, very easy to participate in, and it just provides so much value to people."
Interviewer,And the the fundamental the the distributed application infrastructure allows that somehow.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,So this is a smart contract meeting.
Vitalik,This is all a computer program that's just running through some smart contracts who are just fascinating.
Interviewer,They are.
Vitalik,"OK, do you think cryptocurrency may become the main currency in the world one day?."
Interviewer,"So where do you think we're headed in terms of the role of currency, the structure type of currency in the world?."
Vitalik,I definitely expect some fiat currencies to continue to exist and continue to be strong.
Interviewer,"And I definitely expect fiat currencies to also digitize, have their own way over the next couple of decades."
Vitalik,"What's fiat currency, by the way? Oh, just like things like US dollars, like dollars and euros and yet these other things."
Interviewer,And they're sort of backed by governments.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,But I also expect a sort of cryptocurrency to play this kind of important role in just making sure that people always have an alternative if fiat currencies start breaking.
Vitalik,"So if or if you're in some kind of very high inflation place like Venezuela, for example, or if your country just kind of gets cut off, cut off from other financial systems because of something the banks do a gift for any kind of if there is even some major trade disruption or something worse happens, then like cryptocurrency."
Interviewer,"These are the sort of thing that just because of the kind of global neutrality, they're just always there and you can keep using them."
Vitalik,It's interesting that you're quite humble about the possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency.
Interviewer,You don't think there's a possible future where it becomes the main sort of currency because it feels like fear.
Vitalik,It feels like the centralized control by governments of currency is limiting somehow.
Interviewer,Maybe my naive utopian view of the world.
Vitalik,"It's and it's definitely very possible, I think, for cryptocurrency as being the main form of value to work."
Interviewer,"Well, like, you do need to have some much more price stability than they have today."
Vitalik,And there are no stable coins and there are kind of crypto cryptocurrency is to try to be more stable than existing things like Bitcoin and ether.
Interviewer,"But that just is to me, the kind of the main challenge."
Vitalik,Do you think or do you think that's a characteristic of just just being the early days is such a young concept.
Interviewer,Ten years is nothing in the history of money.
Vitalik,And I think it's a combination of two things.
Interviewer,"One is it's it's still early days, but the other is a kind of more durable, any kind of economic problem, which is that the demand for currency is volatile."
Vitalik,"Right, because of like recessions, booms, changes to technology, lots of things."
Interviewer,"And if people's demand for how much currency they want to hold changes and if you have a currency that has a fixed supply, then the change in demand has to be entirely expressed as a change in value of the currency."
Vitalik,And so what that means is that kind of the volatility of demand becomes entirely translated into volatility and head of prices of things that are updated in that currency.
Interviewer,"But if you have a currency where instead the supply can change and so the supply can go up when there's more demand, then you have the supply ahead of absorbing more of that volatility."
Vitalik,And so the price of the currency would absorb whatever the volatility on that topic.
Interviewer,So Bitcoin does have a limited supply of specific fixed supply.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,"What? Was the idea and a theorem doesn't, but can you clarify just in the comments you just made, is a theory qualify to the kind of currency that you're talking about and being flexible in the supply?."
Vitalik,And it's a bit more flexible.
Interviewer,But the thing that you would really want is something that's kind of specifically flexible in response to how valuable the currency is in.
Vitalik,And I'd recommend you to look at stable coins as well.
Interviewer,"SELEK things like die, for example."
Vitalik,It's like baseball that day and with stable coins.
Interviewer,Is that a type of cryptocurrency? It is the type of cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,It's a type of cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart contract.
Interviewer,One of these Ethereum computer programs that where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether and then it is basically like that people deposit and then it issues die.
Vitalik,And the reason why people deposit is because they want to kind of go high leverage on their ether.
Interviewer,"And so it kind of pairs these two sets of users, one that wants stability and one that kind of wants extra risk together with each other."
Vitalik,"And it basically creates or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they'll be that they have this asset that can that can be later converted back into the ether, but specifically at the end of the one dollar rate."
Interviewer,And it has some kind of stabilizing network effects.
Vitalik,"Yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,It has many kinds of stabilizing mechanisms in it.
Vitalik,That's fascinating.
Interviewer,"OK, this world is awesome."
Vitalik,"Technically, just from a scientific perspective, it's an awesome world that I often don't see from an outsider's perspective."
Interviewer,"What I often see is kind of maybe hype and a little bit, if I may say so, like charlatanism."
Vitalik,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"And you don't often see, at least from an outsider's perspective, the beautiful science of it and the engineering of it maybe."
Vitalik,"Is there a comment you can make of who to follow, how to learn about this world without being interrupted by the charlatans and the hype people in this space?."
Interviewer,I think you do need to just know the specific just people to follow.
Vitalik,"Like, there's you know, there's all the kind of the cryptographers and the researchers."
Interviewer,There's just like even just the theory research crew like myself and grad Danny Just and the other people were.
Vitalik,And then the academic cryptographers before this today was at Stanford.
Interviewer,And Stanford has the center for watching the research and of anybody that's really famous and great cryptographer is running it.
Vitalik,And there's a lot of other people there.
Interviewer,"And there's people working on zero knowledge proofs, for example, and Zucco from the caches of one other person that I respect."
Vitalik,"So I think if you follow the technical, you crawl along that."
Interviewer,"Yeah, you just start with your and group and and look at academics day by day and so on, and then just cautiously expand the network of people who follow."
Vitalik,"Yeah, exactly."
Interviewer,"And like, if someone seems to to self promotional, then just like remove them because they're books that are."
Vitalik,"So there's these white papers and we just discussed about, about ideas being condense into really small parts is there are books that are emerging that are kind of good introductory material, so prefer historical ones."
Interviewer,"Then there's like Nathaniel Popper's Digital Gold, which is just about the history of Bitcoin."
Vitalik,There's one thing Matthew Lysenko doubts that there's one about the history of Ethereum for technical ones and there's a sense of Nobelists mastering Ethereum.
Interviewer,Great.
Vitalik,"So let me ask you, sort of sorry to pull back to the."
Interviewer,"The idea of governments and decentralized currency, you know, there's a tension between decentralization of currency and the power of nations, the power of governments, you what's your sense about that tension? Can."
Vitalik,Is there some rule for regulation of currency?.
Interviewer,You.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,Is there like is the government the enemy of digital currency of distributed currency or can they be like cautious friends?.
Vitalik,"I mean, I think the one thing that people forget is that it's clearly not entirely an enemy because they think if."
Interviewer,"There had been so much government regulation on the hand of centralized, issuing centralized digital currencies that we'd be seeing things that people like Google and Facebook and Twitter just kind of issuing them left and right."
Vitalik,"And then if that was the case, then decentralized currencies would still appeal to some people, but they definitely would appeal to less people than today."
Interviewer,"So even in that sense, I think it's clearly been sort of more of a just kind of set the stage for the end of the existence of the sector in some ways."
Vitalik,"But also and I think some of both, there's definitely things that governments can do in some cases have done to hurt the spread of and of growth of a of by chance."
Interviewer,There is things that they've done to help.
Vitalik,"And there have been, in some cases, definitely done a good job of going after fraudulent projects and going after some of the projects that have some of the craziest and most misleading marketing."
Interviewer,There is also the possibility that governments will end up using Billikens for a lot of different things like governments than they do a lot more than just regulating.
Vitalik,There is also the they have the kind of.
Interviewer,Identity records say they have a property registry is even their own currency is secure.
Vitalik,Lots of different things that they're operating and there's even watching applications in a lot of those.
Interviewer,"And they can you know, they can leverage technology to do a lot of good for our society."
Vitalik,It is a little unfortunate that governments often lag behind in terms of their acceptance of leverage of technology.
Interviewer,"If you look at the autonomous vehicle space, I in general, there there are a few years behind."
Vitalik,It'd be nice to help them catch up.
Interviewer,That's a that's always ongoing problem.
Vitalik,You met Vladimir Putin to discuss the centralised currency or you're born and where we were in Colombia.
Interviewer,It's a city about 150 kilometers south of Moscow.
Vitalik,"In Russia, yes."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,I grew up in Moscow.
Interviewer,"I mean, it's Vladimir Putin is the central figure in this part of the world."
Vitalik,"So what was that like, meeting or meeting him?."
Interviewer,What was that experience like? He's taller and photos than in person.
Vitalik,"Yeah, he's."
Interviewer,"Yeah, that's right."
Vitalik,He's five seven I think.
Interviewer,Five eight maybe.
Vitalik,"Yeah, it's the."
Interviewer,"Unfortunately, we didn't actually have too much of a chance to talk to him, like I managed to see him for about one minute at the end of this meeting."
Vitalik,And I did get a chance to see of some of the other end of government ministers.
Interviewer,And he recommended some and some of them are are actually interested in trying to use some fortunes to look for various government use cases of corruption and other things.
Vitalik,And I have it's hard to tell from one conversation kind of what things are genuine and what things are just like gold watch.
Interviewer,It is cool that you watch it.
Vitalik,"But, you know, when I when I listen to, like, Barack Obama talk about artificial intelligence, there's certain things I hear were OK."
Interviewer,"So he may not be an expert in AI, but he knows he actually studied it carefully enough to think about it like he can, like even if he's just reading a Wikipedia page, like he really thought about what this technology means."
Vitalik,"Did you get a sense that Putin or some of the ministers like thought about block chain, thought about the fundamentals of technology, like understand it intuitively, or are they too old school to try to grasp it somewhere, old school somewhere or a new school?."
Interviewer,It depends.
Vitalik,It's it's definitely depends on who you talk to.
Interviewer,"I mean, that's an open question for me with Putin, because Putin has said, I don't know, I've only talked to him for about one minutes, but sometimes you can pick up sort of insights as a quick comment."
Vitalik,"They're there about maybe you can correct me on this, but there are three thousand cryptocurrency is being actively traded."
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,And Ethereum is one of a lot of people believe that there will be the main cryptocurrency.
Interviewer,"I think Bitcoin is currently still the main cryptocurrency, but Ethereum very likely might become that the main one."
Vitalik,Is this kind of diversity good in the world? This is sticking around.
Interviewer,"Should there should there be a winner? Like should there be some consensus globally around Bitcoin or around a theory? I'm like, what's your what's your sense?."
Vitalik,I definitely think the diversity is good.
Interviewer,And I definitely think also that there's probably too many people trying to make separate fortunes.
Vitalik,"And of right now, the numbers should definitely be greater than one and probably greater than two or even five."
Interviewer,"Not three thousand, not three thousand."
Vitalik,And also not even like forty high quality platforms to try to do the same thing.
Interviewer,"There's definitely this range from just like one person who just like wrongly thinks that you can create a cryptocurrency in like twelve hours and doesn't even think about kind of the community aspects of maintaining it, going to people actually trying, but only creating a really tiny one or two like scammer's to people making something that's actually successful."
Vitalik,And then there's a lot of different categories of watching the project in terms of what it's trying to do and what applications it's for.
Interviewer,And I think the experimentation is definitely healthy.
Vitalik,"If you look at the two worlds, that might be a little bit disjointed, but the distributed applications, cryptocurrency and in the world of artificial intelligence, do you see there's some overlap between these worlds that both worry about centralized control? Is there is some overlap."
Interviewer,That's interesting that you think about do you think about A.I.
Vitalik,much?.
Interviewer,"Yeah, and I think definitely and have thought about things like in like the ahead of control problems that a lot of the problems and all of those things you worry about the potential threat of A.I."
Vitalik,"It's definitely one of the things I worry about is they think but there's a lot of kind of common challenges because in both cases, what you're ultimately trying to do is you're trying to kind of get a simple system to direct a more complex system, like in the case of these strong eyes, the idea would be that the simple systems people and the complex system as well, whatever thing the people, the people end up unleashing on the universe, that will hopefully be a great thing in in the case of block change, the end of the complex."
Interviewer,"Well, the simple thing is the algorithm, which is a piece of static and fully open source code."
Vitalik,And the more complex thing is just the all of the different possible.
Interviewer,"And if human actors, the end of the strategy is that they might choose to participate in the network, do you think about your own mortality, like what you hope to accomplish in your life?."
Vitalik,"You know, I definitely I definitely think about ending my own mortality."
Interviewer,"So that's if I gave you the option to live forever, would you? Depends a lot on what the find does the."
Vitalik,"And if it's one of those things where I'm going to be a kind of like floating through empty space for ten to the seventy five years to know if it's forever worth of having, you know, of fulfilling life with meaning with with friends, to just spend the time with what's going to be meaningful challenges to explore an individual."
Interviewer,Interesting things to be working on then I think absolutely.
Vitalik,It's beautifully put live forever but you'd have to check the fine print.
Interviewer,I think there's no better way to end the talk.
Vitalik,Thank you so much for talking to us.
Interviewer,"So exciting to follow your work distance and thank you for creating a revolutionary idea and sticking with it and building it out, doing some incredible engineering work."
Vitalik,And thanks for talking today.
Interviewer,Thank you.
Vitalik,"Thanks for listening to this conversation with Vrdolyak Budarin and thank you to our sponsors Express, VPN and Masterclass."
Interviewer,Please consider supporting the podcast by signing up to master class at master class dot com slash Lex and getting Express VPN and Express VPN.
Vitalik,Dotcom neglects pod.
Interviewer,"If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on YouTube."
Vitalik,Review it with five stars and Apple podcast supported on Patron or simply connect with me on Twitter.
Interviewer,Allex Friedman.
Vitalik,And now let me leave you with some words from Retallack Budarin.
Interviewer,"The thing that I often ask startups on top of a theorem is can you please tell me why using a theory and block chain is better than using Excel? And if they can come up with a good answer, that's when you know you got something really interesting."
Vitalik,Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
Interviewer,"We have an important preface, an important caveat, an important disclaimer before we get started, and here it is provided from my lovely lawyers."
Vitalik,Here we go.
Interviewer,I am not an investment adviser.
Vitalik,All opinions are mine alone.
Interviewer,There are risks involved in placing any investment in securities or in Bitcoin or in cryptocurrency or in anything.
Vitalik,"None of the information presented today or really any time since you might be listening to this any time is intended to form the basis for any offer or recommendation or have any regard to the investment objectives, financial situation or needs of any specific person that includes you, my dear listener."
Interviewer,So everything you're going to hear is for informational entertainment purposes only.
Vitalik,"And with that said, please enjoy."
Interviewer,"Hello boys and girls, ladies and germs."
Vitalik,"This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show, where it is normally my job to interview world class performers, to tease out the habits, routines, et cetera, that you can apply to your own lives."
Interviewer,"This episode is a special episode and it is a very detailed, action packed episode."
Vitalik,"At least it was for me and in a sense it pairs really well with an earlier episode in 2017, I did an episode with Naval Rovics, who joins me again in this round two with Nick Zabo, and the title of that episode was The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency, and it really covered everything related to Bitcoin."
Interviewer,"So BTC, smart contracts, all of those fundamentals."
Vitalik,This Volume two is going to cover everything.
Interviewer,"Ethereum and the two people joining me already named one are Navarra overcount, as I might have mentioned."
Vitalik,And he is really the pilot for this conversation.
Interviewer,So he takes the reins as the interviewer can find him on Twitter at Nivel and Aviel.
Vitalik,He is the co-founder and chairman of Angel List.
Interviewer,"He is an angel investor and has invested in more than 100 companies, including many huge successes, including Twitter, Uber, Knowshon Opened or Postmus and Wish among many, many, many, many others."
Vitalik,"You can subscribe to Nivel, his podcast on wealth and happiness on Apple podcast Spotify Overcast."
Interviewer,"Wherever you get your podcasts, you can also find his blog at Noval."
Vitalik,That's Naveh a tell the guest of honor.
Interviewer,And the real expert in this particular episode is Vitalogy Budarin on Twitter at Vitalogy Budarin.
Vitalik,Visite alike Beauty and Vitale is the creator of Astrium.
Interviewer,He first discovered lockshin in cryptocurrency technologies through Bitcoin in 2011 and was immediately excited by the technology and its potential.
Vitalik,"He co-founded Bitcoin magazine in September 2011 and after two and a half years looking at what the existing block chain technology and applications had to offer, wrote the Etherial White Paper in November 2013."
Interviewer,It is hard to believe that it was so relatively recent.
Vitalik,He now leads a theory research team working on future versions of the theory and protocol.
Interviewer,"In 2014, Vitali was a recipient of the two year Thiel Fellowship tech billionaire Peter TEALS project that awards one hundred thousand dollars to twenty promising innovators under twenty so they can pursue their inventions in lieu of a post-secondary institution."
Vitalik,"And boy, oh boy, did that award turn into a hell of a lot of value for the world and a lot of people and of italic, I believe, is now a ripe old 27 years old."
Interviewer,You can find his writing and much more at Vitalogy Seet.
Vitalik,That's vitta like dot seet.
Interviewer,"And for ease of reference and ease of finding, you can find the previous conversation with Nick Zabo on Bitcoin and smart contracts and other core concepts at Tim Dot blog Fortgang Bitcoin."
Vitalik,And you can also find this current conversation with fatales on all things Ethereum at Tim Blog forward a theory that's e r e u m.
Interviewer,"Please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Vitalogy, Budarin and Narval Robert."
Vitalik,"This episode is brought to you by Therese Gunn, I have to their guns and they are worth their weight in gold."
Interviewer,I've been using them every single day.
Vitalik,Whether you're an elite athlete or just a regular person trying to get through your day.
Interviewer,Muscle pain and muscle tension are real things.
Vitalik,That's why I use the third gun.
Interviewer,I use it at night.
Vitalik,I use it after workouts.
Interviewer,It is a handheld percussive therapy device that releases your deepest muscle tension.
Vitalik,"So, for instance, at night I might use it on the bottom of my feet."
Interviewer,It's helped with my plantar fasciitis.
Vitalik,I will have my girlfriend use it up and down the middle of my back and I'll use it on her.
Interviewer,It's an easy way for us to actually trade massages in effect.
Vitalik,"And you can think of it, in fact, as massage reinvented on some level, helps with the performance, helps with recovery, helps with just getting your back to feel better before bed, after you've been sitting for way too many hours."
Interviewer,I love this thing.
Vitalik,And the all new Gen Fourth Ergun has a proprietary brushless motor that is surprisingly quiet.
Interviewer,It's easy to use and about as quiet as an electric toothbrush.
Vitalik,It's pretty astonishing.
Interviewer,"And you really have to feel the Theron's signature power, amplitude and effectiveness to believe it."
Vitalik,"It's one of my favorite gadgets in my house at this point, so I encourage you to check it out."
Interviewer,Try there again.
Vitalik,"That's Thera Ague, and there's no substitute for the Gen 4th Ergun with an old screen."
Interviewer,That's OLED.
Vitalik,"For those wondering, that's organic light emitting, diode screen personalized, they're going to have an incredible combination of quiet and power."
Interviewer,"So go to Thera Garden.com Tim right now and get your Gen Fourth Ergun today, or you can watch the videos on the site which show you all sorts of different ways to use it."
Vitalik,A lot of runner friends of mine use them on their EITE bands after long runs.
Interviewer,There are a million ways to use it.
Vitalik,And the Gen four three guns start at just one hundred and ninety nine dollars.
Interviewer,"I said I have two, I have the Prime and I also have the pro, which is like the super Cadillac version."
Vitalik,My girlfriend loves the soft attachments on that.
Interviewer,So check it out.
Vitalik,Go to third on dotcom.
Interviewer,Tim one more time.
Vitalik,Thoroughgood Dotcom Tim.
Interviewer,"This episode has brought to you by PKP IQ in their brand new supplement, Daily Immune Vitamin C, optimized for absorption, Americans are arguably famous for having the world's most expensive urine."
Vitalik,So are you absorbing your vitamin C or just peeing it out? Studies have shown that you might absorb less than 50 percent of vitamin C when you consume amounts over 1000 milligrams.
Interviewer,Also a gram.
Vitalik,Those are the same thing.
Interviewer,"Peake's daily immune is maximized for absorption with liposomal encapsulation technology like bazooms helped deliver vitamin C to exactly where you need it your cells, not just your bladder."
Vitalik,"And I've been using their packets now for a few weeks, have gone through a number of boxes and I typically take one to two per day, as I would say, maintenance kind of support dose."
Interviewer,And I'll take more than that if I feel any type of cold coming on or any symptoms there of Peak's unique formula supports a healthy immune system and daily immune features a Bufford Nonoo acid form of vitamin C that's gentle on your stomach.
Vitalik,It is a powerful and absorbable vitamin C that fits in your pocket and tastes great.
Interviewer,"So I will often take a handful of these, just stick them in a jeans pocket for the day and then every few hours open up a packet."
Vitalik,"Plus it contains just seven clean ingredients, no preservatives, refined sugar or additives."
Interviewer,All you need to do is open and squeeze it into your mouth.
Vitalik,"No glass, water or spoon needed."
Interviewer,"Personally, I like to have a small chaser of water or carbonated water, but you don't need it."
Vitalik,You can do it on the run.
Interviewer,It's so easy and tastes so good.
Vitalik,Think black European elderberries.
Interviewer,That is the flavor I've been consuming.
Vitalik,You might choose to take it once or twice a day or more as I do.
Interviewer,There's a reason Peake's products have more than 15000 five star reviews.
Vitalik,People are very happy with their products.
Interviewer,Try it for yourself.
Vitalik,Risk free with their thirty day satisfaction guarantee you either love it or you get your money back to go to peak t dotcom tim.
Interviewer,That's QE Atiyeh Dotcom Tim and use code Tim.
Vitalik,"Tim, check out to get five percent off of your first order plus free shipping when you purchase a bundle that's peak T one more time p q you eat a dotcom slash him and he's kotin for five percent off plus free U.S."
Interviewer,shipping on a bundle optimal.
Vitalik,At this altitude I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
Interviewer,Can I ask you a question now? It is.
Vitalik,"What's it like to be a cybernetic organism living tissue over metal inputs go to Paris, so."
Interviewer,"Tim, this is the speaking Tim, thanks for having us."
Vitalik,"We're joined by Retallack Uterine overtalk is the, I believe, now 27 year old creator of Etherial, which is the most exciting cryptocurrency since Bitcoin and has incredibly broad ambitions and capabilities and vitality is a really interesting guy because not only did he create Ethereum or cocreator, but he also is a multidisciplinary polymath."
Interviewer,His blog at Botanica is full of lots of great ideas and insights and thoughts.
Vitalik,He runs the Etherial Foundation.
Interviewer,"He's sort of contributed to all kinds of things like automatic market makers, Roll-Up up social recovery while it's decentralized finance, scalability of block chains, governance, all kinds of great ideas in the cryptocurrency space."
Vitalik,"He also thinks a lot about public goods, radical markets, wealth distribution."
Interviewer,"He runs a very active Twitter account where he good naturedly engages with all kinds of people who are constantly trying to get into fights with him, which is kind of on Twitter."
Vitalik,"And yeah, and we were very lucky to have him."
Interviewer,"I would say that for me, along with Nick Serbo and who we interviewed here in twenty seventeen, who create a bit called and coined the term Smart Contracts, and along with Zuka, who is the irrepressible founder of Vikash, I've always found Vitalik and and Zucco to be sort of the the three people on Twitter that are early on learn a lot about crypto from."
Vitalik,"So welcome Vitale, and thanks for taking the time to talk to us about yourself and in Syria."
Interviewer,Thank you very much for the introduction of all.
Vitalik,It's good to be here.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,So I'm going to start just right off the bat.
Interviewer,We're probably going to try and keep this fairly basic in high level.
Vitalik,"For those of you who are quite experienced of cryptocurrency, is this maybe a very general conversation? But at the same time, I'm going to ask for some hard questions."
Interviewer,"We're not going to let him get away with it, just the the PR angle."
Vitalik,And so but we'll start with some basics.
Interviewer,Let's assume we know what crypto currencies are.
Vitalik,"And for those of you who are not that familiar with it, I would suggest you go back to the podcast that Tim and I did with Nick Serbo back in twenty seventeen, I believe that's titled The Quiet Master of Cryptocurrency."
Interviewer,Correct.
Vitalik,"So once you're kind of up to speed on that, this one will make a lot more sense."
Interviewer,But we're going to get right into not what is crypto or what is bitcoin.
Vitalik,We're going to get into what is the theorem.
Interviewer,So how do you describe it today? Retallack?.
Vitalik,Sure.
Interviewer,So the one sentence explanation of Ethereum that I sometimes gather is it's a general purpose.
Vitalik,"Watchem So this, of course, makes more sense."
Interviewer,"If you already know what of lockshin is right, it's this kind of decentralized network of many different computers that are together maintaining this kind of like a larger or less data base together."
Vitalik,"Different participants have like very particular ways of plugging into that, and they can sense transactions that use very particular things."
Interviewer,But no one can tamper with the system in a way that's outside of the rules.
Vitalik,"And if it expands on the Bitcoin approach, basically saying, well, instead of having rules that are designed around supporting one application, we're going to make something more a general purpose where people can just build their own applications and the rules for whatever applications they build can be and if executed and implemented on the platform."
Interviewer,So one explanation that I heard one person gave is that Bitcoin is like a spreadsheet where everyone only controls their own five squares of the spreadsheet.
Vitalik,"But if you're is a spreadsheet with macros, right."
Interviewer,"So, you know, everyone kind of controls their own accounts, which is kind of their own little piece of this universe."
Vitalik,But then these pieces of the universe can have code and they can interact with each other according to pre-programmed rules.
Interviewer,And you can build a lot of things on top of that.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Like Bitcoin, it's a monetary system on top are kind of famously Ethereum can build, you know, desexualized domain name systems and various decentralized financial contraptions, you know, prediction markets, non-flammable tokens and all sorts of different schemes that people have been coming up with."
Vitalik,And the limit for what you build is basically your own creativity.
Interviewer,"But the core difference between building an application auditorium versus building it on, you know, some traditional centralized platform is this core idea that once you build your application in the application does not need to depend on you or any other single person for its continued existence."
Vitalik,And the application is guaranteed to continue running according to the rules that were specified and that you do not have any ability to have you regularly go in and tamper with it.
Interviewer,That's a great overview.
Vitalik,"And I like that Excel analogy of it's a spreadsheet with macros instead of just spreadsheet where you control your own cells while also trying to articulate in a few ways that I understand it kind of around the edges, because I think Ethereum is one of those things that's now quite a bit bigger than you."
Interviewer,And it probably has evolved in ways.
Vitalik,"It even you didn't fully anticipate, so in some sense, we're discovering a theory of it no longer just building it."
Interviewer,I also like to think of it as kind of an unstoppable application platform.
Vitalik,"So a platform for building unstoppable applications, kind of like a world computer where let's say that we want to run very, very important computer programs where we don't trust the computer itself and we don't trust the other people to execute code on our behalf."
Interviewer,"Then we create a single world computer where we check the code on the machines of many, many different people all around the world who are properly incentivized to maintain a single computing state."
Vitalik,"So if Bitcoin is a shared ledger, then Ethereum is assured computer for the entire world to run its most important applications."
Interviewer,So some of the applications that people are building on it are among the possibly the most important applications of the future.
Vitalik,"So let's talk a little bit about those applications, about what this crustless world computer is doing."
Interviewer,What are the applications today that are the most common and that you're most excited about?.
Vitalik,"So first of all, I think if the asset is a cryptocurrency and it itself is an application and out of the first application of Ethereum going beyond financial things, which I mentioned, it's NSV, the Ethereum name system."
Interviewer,"So E.A., you can think of it as a decentralized name system."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So like, for example, you know, when you go to etherial MSG, there's DNS, the domain name system, which has this kind of table that maintains this mapping of, well, you know, if a person enters a theory on dotcom, the server, they actually have to talk to you to talk to the website and some particular IP address."
Vitalik,And this DNS system that maintains this kind of public relationship is a fairly centralized system with a very small number of servers running it.
Interviewer,So E.A.
Vitalik,is a fully decentralized alternative that is running on the theory unblushing.
Interviewer,And you can use it not just for websites like you can use it just for accounts.
Vitalik,"So, for example, like there is a messaging service called status."
Interviewer,"It's like in terms of like what it feels like to use it, you know, it's a messenger."
Vitalik,It's similar to telegram or Signal or WhatsApp or any of those.
Interviewer,"But the difference is that it is decentralized and so there is no dependence on any single server or there's still dependence on status to a company, which is nice because it makes the whole thing much more censorship resistance, and it makes the whole thing just a much more guaranteed to survive, regardless of what forces wish for, for its existence or wish against its existence in the future."
Vitalik,"Yeah, in essence, this really important part of it, because, well, if you have a chat application, needs to have some name by which I can refer to this resource that I want to talk to, like I want to type in and say I want to talk to the devil and things like Telegraph and Signal and WhatsApp, that knapping is generally basically kind of authenticated and controlled by a server."
Interviewer,But whereas in the States it's all just gone by the theory of lockshin.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So that is one good example, I think, of a kind of not financial, but still very important if you're in that location."
Vitalik,"Now, going beyond those two cases, there's a lot of kind of more complicated things."
Interviewer,"So there are some DFI decentralized finance space, which is this big category that has all sorts of interesting contraptions in it."
Vitalik,"Like so for example, there is a prediction markets."
Interviewer,"So platforms where you can go in like that on different outcomes, like, you know, who's going to win some sports game or, you know, who's going to win some particular election."
Vitalik,There have been very successful prediction markets running on the theory I'm watching.
Interviewer,There's just markets for trading between different kinds of assets.
Vitalik,There is what's called synthetic assets.
Interviewer,"So if you wants to have access to some mainstream real world asset, like, you know, it's all or it could be one example."
Vitalik,"But, you know, you don't have to like dollars like there's lots of other examples as well."
Interviewer,"There is versions of this that are kind of purely virtual, sort of simulated versions that exist purely within the Ethereum environment."
Vitalik,"Now, there is this entire kind of very powerful financial toolkit that exists within the existing ecosystem."
Interviewer,"On the whole, there's just a lot of these interesting things that happen."
Vitalik,"I mean, there's even games that are based on Ethereum."
Interviewer,There's a whole bunch of different things.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And DFI decentralized finance is this gigantic new category in which entire companies and protocols are being built in a decentralized way that allow you to do a lot of things that would have required Wall Street, along with bankers and judges and lawyers and accountants to handle, but now is done through smart contracts that are living on the block chain, on the etherial block chain."
Vitalik,And these smart contracts are kind of at the core of the etherial block chain.
Interviewer,"We talked about these in the next Serbo podcast, but he famously described it."
Vitalik,An automated vending machine is an example of a smart contract where you you put in money in a certain slot and there's a certain set of rules and you press certain buttons and you get certain products in exchange.
Interviewer,"But these smart contracts obviously now are getting far, far more complicated, can actually be used not just to compose financial applications, but even applications that we don't normally think of as financial."
Vitalik,"One way to think about it for those of you who are into computer programming is imagine if every piece of a program, every function had an address from which anyone in the world could reach it, a unique identifier address."
Interviewer,"And it had a slot into which you could insert money so you could call any function wherever it is in the world, you could insert money into it and it would do something on your behalf."
Vitalik,"And so that gives Ethereum applications this very interesting property called comparability, where you can use them almost like Lego blocks."
Interviewer,Each one builds on the rest.
Vitalik,"And so the final product in DFI ends up very, very advanced in the traditional world when let's say like Robin Hood bills the application and then Schwab builds another application and WisdomTree builds a mutual fund or an ETF, those can combine with each other."
Interviewer,"But in the etherial world of DFI, all of these apps by default are open source permission, less programmable and can connect right into each other."
Vitalik,"They can be identified, called and paid for in a permission list, trustfulness kind of way."
Interviewer,"So the infrastructure that gets built in DFI and Ethereum, although it's it's very difficult to build and it's complex, once a piece is built, it is available to everybody and sort of stacks on to each other almost to create one of those Japanese style Voltron robots that just gains in power."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Nivel, let me jump in here."
Vitalik,"Just as a proxy, I'm not even a proxy."
Interviewer,"I am a listener literally in this case, and I'm happy to be the listener."
Vitalik,So I'm both a proxy and an actual listener.
Interviewer,But how does one think about intellectual property if all of these otherwise separate or previously separate applications and so on are now Lego pieces that are kind of natively interconnected? Is that a silly question? I'm just wondering if.
Vitalik,"No, no, it's it's a really good question."
Interviewer,"I mean, my high level view on it is that what block chance do is through consensus, they protect the data so the users own their own private data."
Vitalik,And then sort of the public data that's needed to make the blocks in its integrity is protected by the block chain.
Interviewer,And that's what block chance do they get a whole bunch of people to cooperate on what the canonical output should be? But the code itself is completely open.
Vitalik,It is kind of backwards to what we're used to.
Interviewer,We're used to clotheshorse companies capturing value.
Vitalik,But here all the value is created by open source.
Interviewer,"But yeah, we talk, I'm sure has a different view on this."
Vitalik,"But, you know, there's lots of copycats and clones and there's attacks and forks and so on."
Interviewer,And it's kind of a wild west out there.
Vitalik,But generally so far it does seem like the original products and the best products are succeeding the best.
Interviewer,And there's sort of always in the scoreboard of market cap and transactions and usage.
Vitalik,"But, yeah, it's it's a Wild West out there."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,And I think the Blockin environment is definitely one that operates under somewhat different rules than the traditional environments like that.
Interviewer,Just one example of this is the idea of forging.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So one story that happens around the beginning of last year that I just love to tell because of how it kind of combines together with the values of the space so nicely, is there was this platform called steam."
Vitalik,"And in the steam there's steam, the platform and then your steam the company."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,And steam was its lockshin and steam.
Interviewer,"The company did have some steam tokens, but they didn't have the right to just do whatever they want with the steam, the platform, because it wasn't a centralized thing, but they had some tokens and then steam."
Vitalik,The platform had a voting mechanism and holders of steam tokens can vote on changes.
Interviewer,"But then the steam the company got bought out by Justin Sun, you know, the infamous Tron person and Justin Sunlike basically started doing some things to increase his control over the steam platform."
Vitalik,The community was very unhappy.
Interviewer,What's happening here even kind of took advantage of some of the voting mechanisms and some coins held in exchanges to sort of seize control of at least the formal rules of the platform even further.
Vitalik,But then what happened was that the users were right.
Interviewer,"What the users said is while we're creating a new platform called Hive and Hive is just a fork of steam, it is going to have the same or most with the same rules as M and we're ever going to copy over most of the balances of the steam tokens."
Vitalik,"Except if you participated in the attack, then, you know, your balance goes to zero and then you fork."
Interviewer,"And most of the users like basically have collectively moved over to this New York and, you know, adjusting son had this full control of an empire."
Vitalik,"But then, you know, nobody cared."
Interviewer,"That empire anymore, because everyone now cared about height, right? So now stalking is this primitive that exists."
Vitalik,"And because of it, you know, you do have this ability for just communities to, you know, exert its collective agency and basically protect themselves from being exploited."
Interviewer,"But at the same time, if you as a project team are good to your community, then those same effects work in your favor."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,So those effects work in your favor because our community is willing to support your projects.
Vitalik,"If someone makes a copycats, then, you know, generally very few people are willing to kind of support and provide any assistance to that copycat project unless, of course, you do something to betray the community's trust, in which case, you know that those kinds of situations and the situations that the copycat is for, I think legitimate developers have plenty of ability to build projects to gain from those projects becoming successful."
Interviewer,And there's a lot of ways in which the crypto space does ends up kind of assuring that.
Vitalik,"But, you know, at the same time, it's also not in environments where anyone's level of control is infinite."
Interviewer,"And in some ways, that's the other beautiful thing about the space."
Vitalik,"Vitale has this great line, this blog, where said we want a digital nations, but we got digital nationalism and there's a lot of truth in that."
Interviewer,"But basically, these are these are like digital nations."
Vitalik,And one of the analogies that I use for DFI is that these are like crypto castles made of bath that are freely trading with each other.
Interviewer,"Just imagine, like people are building applications on top of Ethereum."
Vitalik,They're protected by mathematics.
Interviewer,Those are the walls in those castles.
Vitalik,"And there are moats which are rivers of cryptography, but then they have free trade policy with each other."
Interviewer,So that creates a lot of innovation.
Vitalik,"But if one of them starts misbehaving, that is people can leave and go to the next crypto castle or and this is where the analogy breaks down, they can actually replicate it, just create a copy and move to that one, like in the Stephen Hive example."
Interviewer,"Well, that also is I mean, it has comparables outside of the world of blocking and cryptography, insomuch as if we look at, say, WordPress as an open source project."
Vitalik,"You have companies like Automatic and Matt Mullenweg, you might people may notice that, Matt, in the middle of automatic duties, which layers then these for profit services on top of an open source platform."
Interviewer,"And technically, someone could create a competitor."
Vitalik,"But like you said, there are these questions of viability value add and moral leadership and so on."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"So there are some sort of certain elements that contribute to the cerium ecosystem, so to speak, that you can perhaps compare to other things to help educate people as well."
Interviewer,I was just sort of connecting some of the stuff.
Vitalik,That's a good analogy with WordPress.
Interviewer,"The place where the analogy is diverge is that WordPress, it's kind of a single player game, like each person owns their own blog writes and Experion World, you could use a theorem to build a Twitter that everybody owns and it requires social consensus to operate."
Vitalik,But multiple people can put their data.
Interviewer,"And so it's this really weird thing where it's decentralized, it's open source, but it's still used to coordinate and bring people together."
Vitalik,Block channels combine this really weird combo of individualism and individual control and the ability to leave along with consensus and community and cooperation and build this giant public good.
Interviewer,So it is its own thing.
Vitalik,"It's hard to figure out, but it's worth figuring out because this is the next phase of the Internet after mobile."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,Let me if I could jump in just to kind of be the kid in the corner of the class and the back of the class asking questions.
Interviewer,I would love to hear from you.
Vitalik,"It's like, what was the initial vision for a theory and what has most surprised you, if anything?."
Interviewer,"You know, I was doing a bit of reading just on the the Genesis story."
Vitalik,"And first of all, I mean, maybe separately, maybe for another conversation."
Interviewer,It seems like a lot was done right in the beginning.
Vitalik,And I was reading a quote from a wired piece in 2016.
Interviewer,And it's and this please feel free to fact check if it's not accurate.
Vitalik,"But it says, you know, when I came up with a theory and my first thought was, OK, this thing is too good to be true, and I'm going to have five professional cryptographers raining down on me and telling me how stupid I am for not seeing a bunch of very obvious flaws."
Interviewer,"But, you know, dot, dot, dot, two weeks later, I was extremely surprised that none of this happened."
Vitalik,"As it turned out, the core theorem idea was good, fundamentally, completely sound."
Interviewer,I'd love to hear what the core idea was.
Vitalik,Maybe we've already stated it and it's redundant.
Interviewer,"But the initial vision and if anything has been really surprising to you, that has transpired since those early days."
Vitalik,So I think the core idea is to make a general purpose in your hands to kind of open the gates for people to build what they want to build.
Interviewer,"On top of it, the background kind of story, for one, if Iran was starting to be formed, was that this was just the time when the idea of abortion beyond Bitcoin was just starting to gain legitimacy and people were just starting to realize that, you know, there are these applications for blockade's other than just them running a currency."
Vitalik,And it would be nice to ability platform.
Interviewer,They can actually support them.
Vitalik,"And so at the beginning, right, you had single purpose actions."
Interviewer,"You had Bitcoin for currency, you had Namecoin for domain names."
Vitalik,You would have like a single purpose.
Interviewer,Protocol is like colored coins for issuing assets.
Vitalik,The second step is what I called a Swiss Army knife protocols.
Interviewer,"A Swiss Swiss Army knife protocol basically says, well, here's a list of, you know, 25 different applications that we've identified as being important and let's build a to achieve the support of them."
Vitalik,A select master coin was one example of what I called a Swiss Army knife protocol.
Interviewer,"And the problem with Swiss Army knife protocols is that two weeks later, you know, some 14 year old teenager in Finland comes up with a twenty six application."
Vitalik,You have to go hard for the protocol.
Interviewer,"So the next natural step is this kind of general-purpose approach where instead of you are blocks in supporting 25 applications, you're watching sports programming, language and whatever a system with whatever rules he wants to build, you write that in a piece of code and the nodes in the network can all execute the code."
Vitalik,And the network kind of helps to collaboratively enforce the rules of this code for the objects that are in your particular application.
Interviewer,So that was kind of the technical perspective.
Vitalik,"And then there is also the perspective of, well, you know, what did I envision people building on top of it."
Interviewer,It's actually surprising how it hasn't changed that much.
Vitalik,"I'm like I remember some of the very earliest applications included financial gadgets, cell contracts for difference, for one example, which is one very particular subset of the thing that today we call it DFI decentralized file storage."
Interviewer,Kind of like you don't pay people to storage.
Vitalik,Gigabyte of your data was one thing I was excited about.
Interviewer,"Decentralized game systems was excited about those, you know, decentralized trading between different assets, like a lot of the examples of just things that people wanted to do with blockade's at the time, like they are just are the same as what people are doing today, though, there are also new applications, right? Select non-flammable tokens that I briefly mentioned, NFTE."
Vitalik,"The idea here is basically you just create a token that, you know, represents something other than a financial asset."
Interviewer,"And one example of this could be that an NFC can represent video game assets in NFC could represent like a digital work of arch where he wants to sell, kind of like basically bragging rights as being the original owner of it."
Vitalik,"And, you know, there's a lot of these different use cases."
Interviewer,"And these right now, the NFC ecosystem has been extremely successful."
Vitalik,"On about a week ago, there was a yet again catch NFC that got sold for the equivalent of about five hundred eighty thousand dollars."
Interviewer,And so that's an example of a new thing.
Vitalik,Another example of an old thing is that decentralized one-sidedness organizations.
Interviewer,"And so the idea here is, well, you know, let's build an organization where the rules for the decision making in that organization, you know, the equivalent of like shareholder or board voting or whatever he wants to use, could just be written as rules in aspart contracts."
Vitalik,And then the program that executes those rules can be directly in control of whatever assets the organization is supposed to control.
Interviewer,"And, you know, we've seen a couple of examples of that kind of simple Gio's in action, a maker down of which kind of maintains, you know, digestible coin that is algorithmically targets of price of one dollar is one example."
Vitalik,"Now, there's also RHI."
Interviewer,"You know, there's a lot of examples of this, a lot of things that we expected from the beginning."
Vitalik,"Prediction markets also have been part of what we were excited about using watches for since 2014, and they're still around today."
Interviewer,So a lot of old things and also some new things as well.
Vitalik,Thank you.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"I mean, yeah, some of the ones that Vitelli just laid out, like I think your recent guest, Katie Horn, mentioned as Nifty is what she called it, because I wanted to try to I want to try to force that into the lexicon, but got it."
Interviewer,"What you want is a nifty, nifty, yet so nifty lefties are this crazy idea that like owning a digital copy of something and having your name stamped to it somehow gives it more value."
Vitalik,But it seems to work.
Interviewer,It works with collectible trading cards.
Vitalik,It seems to work with digital art.
Interviewer,"And then because of the possibility of the Ethereum infrastructure, you can reuse these nifty items across different games, different museums, different virtual worlds."
Vitalik,"And so you own it in one place and you own it everywhere, which is a very powerful concept."
Interviewer,"So digital scarcity was born with Bitcoin, but."
Vitalik,"Extending into things that are not fungible, that are not exchangeable with each other and that that's been, frankly, for me, a surprising thing that has emerged in a theory m theory, it's funny because you're asking Vitale, what did he expect and what do you not expect?."
Interviewer,I remember when in theory first launched that a lot of computer scientists I spoke with privately said it would never work because it's kind of this crazy idea that the way we're going to get a trusted computer in the cloud is we will each run a copy of all the computations on all of our computers and then we'll sync it up and make sure it matches so that the recipe for building the slowest computer in the world and but somehow we've gotten away with it.
Vitalik,"And so I think the big debate now about a theory has shifted from will it work to will it scale? And when I talk to my friends in the crypto community and say, hey, what do you want me to ask Italic? They send me a list of many, many questions."
Interviewer,But the center piece is always the same.
Vitalik,"And like, how the heck is this thing going to scale? And I would like to get in that conversation."
Interviewer,That is a more complicated conversation is technically sophisticated.
Vitalik,"But basically we're saying, hey, we're going to have one giant mainframe computer in the cloud running everyone's applications so that we can all trust the computer instead of trusting each other."
Interviewer,"But how is that going to scale? Isn't that going to be the slowest computer of all time? And so now we're in a situation where if it's actually cleverly named, it runs on so-called gas, quote unquote."
Vitalik,And there's a limited amount of gas per block in the theory block chain.
Interviewer,"And frankly, the gas, the price of gas has gone up these decentralized finance applications that can be very lucrative."
Vitalik,They're trading large amounts of money and people are eager to use them.
Interviewer,But the price of each of these transactions is going up.
Vitalik,I was trying to do a small DFI transaction the other day and it was one hundred dollar transaction and the price was twenty five dollars just to execute the transaction.
Interviewer,"And that's a very, very high transaction fee."
Vitalik,And an overtalking Cribben working for years on the etherial to project to bring that cost down.
Interviewer,"By the way, as an aside, that is one place where Ethereum really differs from Bitcoin."
Vitalik,"Bitcoin is saying we're digital gold, this thing is immutable, don't change it."
Interviewer,And the fights in the past have been about changing Bitcoin or not.
Vitalik,There was a big famous schism over that.
Interviewer,"But now with Ethereum, you know, the question is the philosophy is we do change it."
Vitalik,We do improve it.
Interviewer,We do make it better.
Vitalik,"But in the process, there is a greater chance that things can go wrong, that it can break."
Interviewer,"So now we're entering Ethereum, too, which is the scalable version of Ethereum."
Vitalik,So it's talk.
Interviewer,"You want to give us a quick overview of Ethereum, too, at a very high level and then we can dig into the pieces, I'm sure."
Vitalik,"So I think one other thing that's important to kind of add, just to give a complete picture of scaling, is that there is these two families are scaling layer one scaling and layer to scaling where layer one scaling basically says, well, let's make the blocking itself better."
Interviewer,"Handle your two scaling says, well, let's come up with protocols that are going to sit on top of the watch in."
Vitalik,"And I used to watch in in more clever ways to provide the same kinds of security guarantees set up, which it has, but that provide much more scalability because you're not just kind of ws taking literally everything and doing everything on a Vijayan directly."
Interviewer,"And so like Bitcoin, for example, you know, especially after the scaling was focused very exclusively on layer two, whereas, you know, Bitcoin cash is very layer one focused."
Vitalik,And this is this is a classic thing in computing.
Interviewer,"Look, so, for example, when I go to a website, the domain name system is at a different layer, the DNS servers and then the HTP servers, a server, the webpage or another layer on top."
Vitalik,And then there's a caching layer where some of the data might be kept closer to me.
Interviewer,And then on my own computer is where I run the JavaScript because I don't want to run that JavaScript way back on the server or the DNS server.
Vitalik,"So there is a long, rich history and computing of stacking layers upon layers."
Interviewer,"As you get closer to the point of the user, that's the point at which you use more compute and you execute more and more of the code."
Vitalik,So basically the idea here is decentralized only what you need to decentralize.
Interviewer,And so Ethereum is going to split into or it's going to have multiple layers.
Vitalik,"And I think what you're saying is layer one is really Ethereum, and that's the least scalable part."
Interviewer,But that's where the security comes in.
Vitalik,And layer two is where the code is run.
Interviewer,And that's that that has different properties which you're going to get into.
Vitalik,"That was the way that I would describe it is in comparison to Bitcoin, which is very clear to focus that Bitcoin cash, which is very clear, one focused Ethereum takes a moderate approach."
Interviewer,So we do both kinds of scaling.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So there is the EU effort, which you mentioned, which, you know, it is layer one scale."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Is basically saying, well, we're going to make this big upgrade of the blocks, then we're going to move it from a fork to approve of stake of we are, you know, proof of which is this current consensus mechanism that keeps supply chain secure, that runs on having a large number of computers just constantly cranking out these kind of mathematical hash solutions 24/7 and."
Vitalik,Steak is a much more energy efficient alternative.
Interviewer,"There's also sharding, which is a layer of one scaling solution that says that instead of every node in the network having to download and process everything, every note to the network only has to download and process a small portion of all of the data."
Vitalik,The Washington protocol is designed in a clever way that still ensures safety despite having that constraints.
Interviewer,So think of it as like combining at least some of the advantages of a Bitcoin style auction.
Vitalik,"And BitTorrent, right."
Interviewer,Like BitTorrent is very layer one scale like this.
Vitalik,There's nobody who downloads every movie or even an index of every movie.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"So before we get to layer two, so layer one is you're saying it's proof of stake, which is moving from proof of work to proof of stake and sharding, which is breaking it into pieces and having different pieces do different things and then try to reconcile them on the proof of stake side."
Interviewer,"I mean, that itself is a whole big debate that could take up the entire podcast."
Vitalik,"Just a quick thanks to one of our sponsors, and we'll be right back to the show."
Interviewer,This episode is brought to you by Wealth Front.
Vitalik,"Did you know if you missed 10 of the best performing days after the 2008 crisis, you would have missed out on 50 percent, five zero percent of your returns? Don't miss out on the best days in the market."
Interviewer,Stay invested in a long term automated investment portfolio.
Vitalik,"Wealth Front pioneered the automated investing movement, sometimes referred to as robo advising, and they currently oversee 20 billion dollars of assets for their clients."
Interviewer,"Wealth Front can help you diversify your portfolio, minimize fees and lower your taxes."
Vitalik,Takes about three minutes to sign up and then Wealth Front will build you a globally diversified portfolio of ETFs based on your risk appetite and manage it for you at an incredibly low cost wealth front.
Interviewer,Software constantly monitors your portfolio day in and day out so you don't have to.
Vitalik,They look for opportunities to rebalance and tax loss harvest to lower the amount of taxes you pay on your investment gains.
Interviewer,"Their newest service is called Autopilot, and it can monitor any checking account for excess cash to move into savings or an investment account."
Vitalik,They've really thought of a ton.
Interviewer,They've checked a lot of boxes.
Vitalik,Smart investing should not feel like a roller coaster ride.
Interviewer,Let the professionals do the work for you.
Vitalik,Go to wealth front dotcom Tim and open a wealth front investment account today and you'll get your first 5000 dollars managed for free for life.
Interviewer,That's wealth front dotcom time.
Vitalik,Wealth Front will automate your investments for the long term and you can get started today at wealth front dotcom tim.
Interviewer,"So the proof of work, I'm familiar with proof of stake, could we just define what that means?."
Vitalik,"The core idea basically is that in any decentralized consensus system where you don't have a central registry that keeps track of the different humans, are you need some way for people to basically vote on like which blocks and which transactions got included in the network."
Interviewer,And you need for that vote to be secure against what's called a civil attack.
Vitalik,A civil attack is when one attacker just pretends to have one million different accounts normally like in like Reddit and Google accounts and Twitter at all of the essential systems like this is done using centralized mechanisms.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,Like they sometimes require phone number verification and then phone numbers themselves often ends up having some kind of KYC.
Interviewer,"On top of that, there is various techniques to try to detect bots."
Vitalik,But in a decentralized system that we don't have the sort of centralized registry of who gets to be an actual user.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,And we don't want to have that.
Interviewer,And so to prevent this civil attack.
Vitalik,"Right, to prevent one person from just generating a billion accounts and outvoting everyone else, the solution is economics, right?."
Interviewer,"The solution is basically that the extent to which you can vote on just this very limited question of which transactions get included, in what order is proportional to how many economic resources you put in."
Vitalik,"So in the case of proof of work, those economic resources come in the form of computing and hardware that you're running."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"Like when you're running this mining software on your computer, you're cranking out these have solutions."
Interviewer,Every hash solution gives you the right to generate a plug in.
Vitalik,The number of solutions that you can generate is proportional to how many computers you put in in proof of stake.
Interviewer,It works a little differently.
Vitalik,But the core principle is that your ability to participate in creating the outcome is proportional to how many coins that are in the system that you're taking.
Interviewer,"And so the reason why grubstake is efficient is because in proof of work, like the way that you're basically prove that you have a computer to the system is by just like running the software on on that computer 24/7 and generating have solutions read like that's the only way to safely do it."
Vitalik,"Because if you did not have to run the computer 24/7, like if you only had to run it 24/7, well, then, you know, you could have one computer that just pretends to be two different computers, but with proof of stake."
Interviewer,"If you have coins, those coins are saved in an account that accounts has an associated public and private key."
Vitalik,"And you can just make a digital signature with the private keys so you don't have to, like, run any computer for longer than a few milliseconds."
Interviewer,"That's the kind of core principle, the supremely helpful."
Vitalik,Thank you.
Interviewer,"Yeah, this is beyond the scope of this podcast, but it is actually hotly debated how much more efficient proof of stake is, because there's also these block chains they have to issue coins to in exchange for the security to the so-called miners or validators in the case of proof of stake."
Vitalik,"And people will spend a dollar to get a dollar, so to speak."
Interviewer,"If you're giving out free coins on the block chain, then people are going to hustle in any which way possible and improve the work."
Vitalik,They'll do it by buying more computing equipment to run more hashes to get the new coins coming out and proof of stake.
Interviewer,They'll have to lock up funds or they'll have to obtain funds to do it.
Vitalik,And there's a cost of doing that to obtaining those funds.
Interviewer,So there's no real free lunch.
Vitalik,"But there are arguments for efficiency with proof of stake, especially as you get to securing very large amounts."
Interviewer,"The way that I would just briefly summarize the state case there is that the states can actually survive, at least in the opinion of state supporters with much lower rewards than Orkan."
Vitalik,"And the reason is and like because of how the state works, the ratio between the cost of attacking a system and the cost of just running, it becomes more favorable."
Interviewer,"But, you know, this is a long debate."
Vitalik,I've written on it.
Interviewer,"I have a post on Fatalis NEA, if you just scroll down, the most recent one called of Stake and then, you know, proof of works."
Vitalik,Republicans have their own posts as well.
Interviewer,So encourage you to read all of them.
Vitalik,So going back.
Interviewer,So this is all there.
Vitalik,One Skillings switch from work to proof of stake starts charting the block chain and this gets you some tens of times improvement like twenty times twenty five times improvement and 300 times a hundred times.
Interviewer,Fantastic.
Vitalik,So then there's layer two which stacks on top.
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,"So layer two as I mentioned, is about creating protocols that live on top of the block chain that only used abortion in very particular ways."
Interviewer,So there's lots of techniques for this.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,Like the simplest layer to to explain I think is a very special purpose kind of layer to call it a payment channel.
Vitalik,"So the idea behind a payment channel is like, let's say I am selling you enough novel and an Internet connection and you're paying me back like let's say you're paying me one cents per."
Interviewer,"Now, if we want to do this over the watch in the naive way to do it is every time megabyte of data passes through the connection, you just make an unchanged transaction."
Vitalik,"And you said to me once said, the problem is this requires lots and lots of transactions and the transaction fees are actually much more expensive than one set."
Interviewer,So it's just completely economically unviable.
Vitalik,So here's what we do instead.
Interviewer,"You put ten dollars into a smart contract, right?."
Vitalik,"So you spend ten dollars on the watch in to an address where according to the rules of the network, once those funds are at that address, those funds are controlled not by a human, but by a computer program."
Interviewer,And that computer program will then have some rules that I'll explain later.
Vitalik,"So at the beginning, you said ten dollars to this contract and so far you actually haven't made any payments because as I explain, the contract has rules that will allow you to get your money out."
Interviewer,"Now, here's what you do."
Vitalik,"After one megabyte, after we have one megabyte worth of Internet data passing between us, you create an off chain message and you recite that awful message that just has the number one set just written on it."
Interviewer,So you will just write the number one set and you attach your signature and you send this to me.
Vitalik,None of this goes on yet.
Interviewer,Then one more megabyte happens.
Vitalik,You write out the message that has the number two sets and you sign it.
Interviewer,You send it to me sometime later.
Vitalik,"Every time a megabyte happens, you just send me one more of these messages that you keep on incrementing the number."
Interviewer,"And let's say after a few hours of this, in total, we've had three hundred and forty seven megabytes worth of communication."
Vitalik,And you've sent me a message that says three dollars and forty seven cents and you are now no longer wants to use my Internet.
Interviewer,You're signing off for the day.
Vitalik,And so we're done.
Interviewer,So now here's what happens.
Vitalik,I can then take your message and your message that says two dollars.
Interviewer,Forty seven cents.
Vitalik,I can attach my own signature to it and I can publish it as a transaction.
Interviewer,"Going to the smart contract and you have your ten dollars in the smart contract has a rule that says if I send one of your messages, I call them Tippett's."
Vitalik,"If I send one of your tickets, if I kind of wrap one of your tickets in an actual transaction and I actually kind of publish your ticket to the auction, then whatever amount of money is on your ticket goes to B and the remainder gets refunded to you."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,So I get my speed always forty seven cents and you get your six dollars and fifty three cents back.
Interviewer,Now it's actually incentive.
Vitalik,Aline's right because I always have the ability to use the most expensive ticket that the most recent ticket that you sent me.
Interviewer,And I don't really have any reason to use one of your older tickets.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,So I'm always going to take your later ticket.
Vitalik,And so I'm always going to claim all of the money that I'm owed and you get your money back.
Interviewer,"Now, if I disappear, then after some period of time, you have the ability to just go in and take the money back for yourself."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So the idea is that it's this contraption where, you know, in reality you've made a payments to these one hundred and forty seven times."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,Like we've had three hundred and forty seven interactions during which the amount of money that's entitled to me goes up and the amount of money that's inside.
Vitalik,Also you go down.
Interviewer,But actually there is only two actual lockshin transactions that are visible to and needs to be processed by the rest of the network.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,So we make three hundred forty seven payments but the you we two of them.
Vitalik,And that's a factor of one hundred and seventy eight to approvement there.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"So surveyance summarizes for a second kind of our listeners basically you're saying is let's say that you and I have a long lived contract for some service rather than publishing every little aspect of that contract under the theory block chain floodgate, we go off to the side."
Interviewer,"We do a whole series of transactions, but every time we do a transaction, each of us like stamp it and say, yeah, that little piece was done and we update the transaction between the two of us."
Vitalik,"And then when we're finished, either one of us can go back to the block chain and submit the the the record of all the transactions and say, look, it's signed by both of us."
Interviewer,So this is valid.
Vitalik,But either one of us can submit it and the block and executes it.
Interviewer,"So the chain only needs to know when we left with how much money staked on this transaction and when we came back and what the total change was, it doesn't need to keep track of all the intermediate pieces."
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,"Yes, that's a good summary."
Vitalik,"Now, channels are, I think, the simplest kind of lawyer, too, but they're also the least powerful tool."
Interviewer,They can only do payments.
Vitalik,They have a hard time doing many kinds of smart contracts.
Interviewer,Channels exist and they are being used for more and more things and they're great.
Vitalik,But the thing is that you have an ecosystem is the most.
Interviewer,Excited about is something called Roelofs.
Vitalik,"Now, I don't want to actually go in and fully explain roll ups because they're even more complicated than channels."
Interviewer,"But for those who are interested, I do have an article once again, you know, go to italics, Isaiah, scroll down like a I think it's called an incomplete guide to Roelofs."
Vitalik,"And so I just write channels and also the second class and also Roelofs and roll ups are really powerful because they can support not just payments, they can support the full generality of applications like exactly the same applications that you can run directly on the author and blocking itself."
Interviewer,"But if you do those things, it's had a role up."
Vitalik,They become one hundred times cheaper.
Interviewer,So it's is a very powerful scalability technology.
Vitalik,"And see if your community loves Roelofs because they're very easy to upgrade to it, because if you run an application on experience and you can just run the exact same application inside of an ethereal virtual machine compatible ROELOF, of which a couple of projects exist."
Interviewer,"And actually, I think a couple of days ago, optimism announced that they're going to launch if they're made that fairly soon."
Vitalik,Europe's are fascinating.
Interviewer,I've been looking into them a little bit and they're worth learning about.
Vitalik,It's basically the idea is just that there's these very complex machines that are not on the block chain that are off the block chain that are running the transactions.
Interviewer,"But then they're submitting different kinds of proofs back to the block chain to say, don't worry, this this was a valid transaction."
Vitalik,And the two different approaches.
Interviewer,Optimism is optimistic.
Vitalik,"We're basically optimistic, Rob, say we assume people are doing the right thing, but we're watching."
Interviewer,"And if someone commits fraud or makes a mistake, then they get punished for that fraud where there is zero knowledge base rule ups pioneered by Starkweather and others, which are basically saying, hey, actually, we're going to submit proofs which are much shorter than the actual computation that the computation was done properly."
Vitalik,"But I think these give together, what, another one hundred speed-up?."
Interviewer,"So if you combine the two layer, one speed up and the layer to roll up, speed up, then you get the ten thousand times speed up."
Vitalik,Exactly.
Interviewer,You could get some somewhere over one hundred thousand transactions a second and one other.
Vitalik,"A really nice feature of charting, by the way, is that I get quadratic, right."
Interviewer,"So if the efficiency of computers increases by a factor of two, then like the you can support twice as many shards and each shard can be twice as large."
Vitalik,And so you're the capacity of the whole system increases by a factor of four.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,And so we actually expect that capacity to increase going even far beyond one hundred thousand over the next couple of decades.
Interviewer,"So is it a stretch to say then that it would that sharding the sharding increase its capacity as a square of Moore's Law as opposed to just that Moore's Law? Yes, this is now if we get to one hundred thousand plus transactions per second, that's a lot."
Vitalik,"I mean, to give a give a comparable metric."
Interviewer,There's a there's about one hundred thousand tweets per second at Twitter during peak times.
Vitalik,And obviously these transactions are going to be much more sophisticated than or could be much more sophisticated than a single tweet that can actually be arbitrary computer programs running on the side.
Interviewer,So that's quite a bit of scalability.
Vitalik,"So so then I think the question comes up, well, where is it? You know, a lot of people I know who are building apps on top of ethe have now had to come up with backup plans, their competitive block chains that are coming up, which trade off decentralization and security for speed."
Interviewer,"So what they'll do is they'll say, well, we'll only have 20 validators run by our friends or maybe the one hundred people that we know and trust."
Vitalik,But an exchange is a lot faster.
Interviewer,Like now.
Vitalik,We don't have to get consensus from unknown people all over the Internet.
Interviewer,We don't need these complicated contraptions and then they can basically run much faster.
Vitalik,So a number of projects are looking at these as backup plans.
Interviewer,But I know that they don't really want to use these because these are less decentralized.
Vitalik,They don't really fully live up to the original promise of block change to the same extent.
Interviewer,"So the real question, I think, in everybody's minds is like, is there a timetable for these? You know, can we can we reliably target a date for certain kinds of improvements because people are betting their businesses on this? Great."
Vitalik,And the very important question.
Interviewer,So I'll start off with the progress that used to.
Vitalik,"So I think it's important to reiterate, because I think a lot of people have it's fully absorb this."
Interviewer,The to a chain is already running.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So there is already a proof of stake in it does not yet have sharding, but the system is running."
Vitalik,"The thing that has not yet happened is the event that we call demerged, which is where we basically actually take on the existing activity on Ethereum and we fully move it over from the work chain to the station and then the proof work changes."
Interviewer,That basically becomes irrelevant from there.
Vitalik,"And the reason why we took this kind of multi step approach where we first start the process system and then we have both running parallel for some time and then we merge at the end is just to give privacy, take some time to prove itself before the entire ecosystem is asked to upgrade over the stake thing exists that's been stably running ever since the launch."
Interviewer,"And at some point fairly soon, you know, we are going to actually go and merge all of the activity onto it."
Vitalik,And so shorting is also going to happen as Sharding right now is in the there are suspects.
Interviewer,There is prototypes of parts of it.
Vitalik,I will admit that we were actually prioritizing the merge even more than Sharding recently.
Interviewer,"There's a reason why for this actually has to do with the other thing, which is Ralf's right."
Vitalik,"The thing to remember is that if you have roll ups but you do not have sharding, you still have 100 X Factor scaling."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"You still have the ability for the bloodshed to go up to somewhere between one thousand and four thousand transactions a second, depending on how complex these transactions are."
Interviewer,"And so with roll ups, as I mentioned to the optimism, you know, fully ETM Capable Roll Up is likely to launch an initial Minett release, some in around a month or so."
Vitalik,"There's also a project called Arbitral, which is also on ECM capable roll up."
Interviewer,There is actually a simpler roll ups that are only capable of processing simple transactions and exchanging between assets like Labrang and Zik Sync and those Roelofs have already been running stably for about a year.
Vitalik,"Right, syrup's Artim."
Interviewer,"In theory, they've been a practical part of scalability of Ethereum for a few users for almost a year."
Vitalik,And so the thing that's left is basically taking that same model and just fully extending it to not just for transactions but also arbitrary applications.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"So Rolf's are coming very soon and we're fully confident that by the time that we add any more scaling, that that sharding will have already been ready for a long time by then."
Interviewer,So you're basically saying.
Vitalik,A very confident that something like an optimism or XXX based Roll-Up will be solving one hundred scalability problem within the next few months?.
Interviewer,I think so.
Vitalik,"And then I think there's definitely a lot of people who are not going to be comfortable moving over just because, you know, it's new technology and new technology always has risks."
Interviewer,"But I expect there will be plenty of applications and possibly even nonfinancial applications like the Niftiest and Zammuto and domain names and so forth to start off just because, like, the risks are lower if things do break and then kind of creeping up to higher and higher value things as people become more comfortable over time."
Vitalik,"So do you think that Ethereum could have a scaling schism like Bitcoin? Did Bitcoin split famously into Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash over the block size debate a few years back, which is all around scaling? And people some people were saying Bitcoin should be digital cash."
Interviewer,And so therefore it needs these big blocks and it needs to handle more transactions.
Vitalik,"And other people said, no, no, Bitcoin is a Swiss bank account is digital gold, and it needs to be secure."
Interviewer,And lots of small nodes have to be able to run it.
Vitalik,So we care more about security than we do about handling small transactions.
Interviewer,And the the small block people one.
Vitalik,And so Bitcoin forked.
Interviewer,"And now, of course, what we call bitcoin is a small block Bitcoin that won that debate."
Vitalik,"Do you think that there's a possibility that miners, some miners and people will stay on ethe one instead of ethe two?."
Interviewer,"I think so, except I do think that the risks are much lower."
Vitalik,A big part of the reason why is because we've been very open about privacy and sharding being the vision basically from the first day and I think we already have.
Interviewer,This gives a bit of a theory on that and Ethereum Classic and a lot of the proof of what proponents did actually move over to two or three unclassy already because they recognize that the theory and classic community and ideology was one that's more aligned with the continuing proof of work forever.
Vitalik,"And so, you know, why stay on the chain where the core developers and lots of people are eagerly expecting a perfect change if you can just move on to a platform already that accepts your values."
Interviewer,So I think that was one of the factors that did actually ends up making the EU transition of a bit more secure.
Vitalik,Another thing also is that I don't really think there is a deep schism of ideologies within a theory.
Interviewer,"I mean, the way that there wasn't Bitcoin like I think in theory everyone is roughly on board with the idea that, you know, you have some layer, one scale and you have somewhere to scale it."
Vitalik,"There are some kind of longer term disagreements like Justin Drak, one of our researchers, for example, is much more into making layer one more powerful, whereas I am more in favor of a simpler layer one and having layer to do more things."
Interviewer,That's not a kind of extremely deep and fundamental disagreements.
Vitalik,I like either approach is going to have lots of scalability and it's going to offer a great environment for Ethereum users.
Interviewer,So that's interesting.
Vitalik,You don't you don't even really run a theorem.
Interviewer,You have disagreements with developers and they could even change it in a way that you don't like.
Vitalik,"Has that happened yet? Has has there been a case where something has been implemented into a theorem that maybe the community or the other developers wanted, which you sort of disagreed with?."
Interviewer,"There's definitely been changes that I wanted to push forward that I mean, I give up on fairly quickly because I know enough words."
Vitalik,Developers or these community ended up disagreeing on them.
Interviewer,There's been changes that were kind of pushed forward by some people who are not myself and then where I just kept completely silent.
Vitalik,"So like block reward decreases, for example, I was completely silent or mostly silence."
Interviewer,It was mostly silence until it was obvious that the bell side was losing things that I was trying to push forward.
Vitalik,"I mean, those are harder to find just because, like, I tends to just naturally understand what the community would accept."
Interviewer,And they don't really try to push things that I don't think would be successful.
Vitalik,"I mean, there's like some minutia around, you know, scaling strategies and statelessness and state management strategies where myself and some other core developers have some different opinions."
Interviewer,And so there's a lot of back and forth where we try to sort of satisfy each other's concerns.
Vitalik,"Yeah, my sense from afar is you're more coordinating than dictating and you're doing what are you running? The Theorem Foundation is an organization you're part of or you just kind of a roving individual with a laptop and a few friends who just kind of writes blog posts and submits proposals and some of those."
Interviewer,"And I do I do the proposal submitting ideas, do some some writing proof of concepts."
Vitalik,And in one place I do a some and of trying to coordinate people.
Interviewer,The Ethereum Foundation as an organization exists.
Vitalik,"So the executive director of that is in the aggregate, she has been."
Interviewer,"Doing a lot of the logistical things for about the past three years and has done an amazing job, ends and ends up then of coordinating and working with her quite a lot on various things."
Vitalik,"But even the Ethereum Foundation, like it has an important role because it has this kind of a large pool of capital and this sort of high level of kind of public legitimacy."
Interviewer,But it's not nearly the only organization that is here.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,Like there is a lot of proposals that got initiated on the outside.
Vitalik,"There's a lot of proposals that got a really huge amount of community support coming from the outside, even organizations other than the foundation that has a lot of resources within their own ecosystem."
Interviewer,"So like, for example, for the first few years, consensus did quite a lot in consensus, is still doing a lot."
Vitalik,But now there's also a DNA swab who's Treasury has just grown a huge amount of they here are even wealthier than the Ethereum Foundation is.
Interviewer,So I think in practice it does end up being this kind of loose collaborative effort which made a lot of different groups.
Vitalik,"So what is interesting to swap is for those of you don't know, it's an application built on top of Ethereum, but it has its own token."
Interviewer,"And it's the it's one of the first automated market makers, a decentralized platform for exchanging crypto currencies with each other without having to use a centralized authority like a Coinbase or a Jemini or a coin list."
Vitalik,"Instead, you just go on to go to UniSuper and it's a smart contract."
Interviewer,It's not owned or run by anybody except the community and a few developers.
Vitalik,And there's a token associated with it.
Interviewer,But you can just automatically trade with this smart contractor and say you're etherial into a stable coin to get the equivalent of dollars are back.
Vitalik,This shows how the Ethereum ecosystem is very different than the Bitcoin ecosystem and the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Interviewer,There's only one coin.
Vitalik,There's Bitcoin and they don't really tolerate other tokens in their orbit.
Interviewer,"Whereas with cerium, you have a lot of other tokens in the orbit."
Vitalik,"And so you'll see block chains that are competing with Ethereum that are trying to, you know, they're making different tradeoffs and whether it's Flow or Evony or whatever, there's a whole bunch of those."
Interviewer,"But then there's also people who are built on top of you, like balancer and in unit swap and whatnot."
Vitalik,"And so what's your view on all these other tokens? How many tokens are there going to be? How do you determine which one makes sense and which one doesn't? And do other block chains makes sense at layer one, or should other tokens only emerge layer two now that Ethereum exists?."
Interviewer,"Now, this is definitely a very important topic in tokens are one of those things that's really like playing with fire, right? Like on the other hand, fire is crucial to human civilization."
Vitalik,"But on the other hand, fire is if you're evil and you burn up your family if you're not careful."
Interviewer,So the with tokens.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Is that the crypto space is not the only space that tried to build decentralized things, like there were a lot of decentralized projects that are outside the purview of space, like a diaspora."
Vitalik,The decentralized alternative to Facebook that people tried to build around 2010 is one good example.
Interviewer,"But the challenge with this kind of free block chain or non blocking decentralization or crypto is that it's harder to kind of align the incentives and motivate people to actually want to participate in, you know, building and growing their community at a large scale."
Vitalik,Like you can get idealists.
Interviewer,But the problem with idealism is that idealism is not very socially scalable.
Vitalik,"Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, can appeal to the kind of universal values like where, you know, the real universal values get rich for a lot of people."
Interviewer,"Yeah, and it seems with if you've done a bit of both, you've got a bit of both."
Vitalik,You've got people who have ethe to getting rich.
Interviewer,And then there's also a movement.
Vitalik,"Right, exactly."
Interviewer,And I like I think that balance is important.
Vitalik,"Like, I think the failure of a lot of non blocking crypto show is the inability to do things at scale without that financial incentive."
Interviewer,"But at the same time, you know, the project, a lot of them, more of, in my opinion, immoral projects within crypto that just care about, you know, the pump and the volume and, you know, getting a powerful, expensive token that they can get rich off of, like those projects set up, but not really doing well in the long term either."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"And there has been plenty of projects where just like VC funds gave, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of capital to them."
Vitalik,"But, you know, the reality is that like hundreds of billions of dollars of capital just can't buy you a soul."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,And so a lot of people end up kind of stumbling and falling on that to some extent.
Interviewer,"Yeah, I think some of that is just driven by the premodern phenomenon where Bitcoin had a so-called fair launch, although you can debate how fair it was, but you know how fair the distribution is today."
Vitalik,"But everyone sort of started mining at the same time or everyone who was aware of it, where a lot of coins that have come subsequently, the team has a pre mine where they get a bunch of the Bitcoin in advance."
Interviewer,"And as the amount of the premium goes up and the competition moves from, hey, let's mine as much Bitcoin as possible to hey, let's create the winning block chain and then get the big prize mine."
Vitalik,So it's just move the competition from mining to creating or forking.
Interviewer,So it's almost inevitable once premiums became a little bit accepted that there would be so many different block chains.
Vitalik,"Yeah, I think that's definitely fair to say."
Interviewer,"They can work in this area once again as a kind of fairly a kind of moderate there, like there was a pre mine."
Vitalik,But now the mine was only about 12 percent of actually going about 10 percent of the total supply.
Interviewer,And people did have the opportunity to mine or to divide the sale.
Vitalik,And so a lot of people had the opportunity to and have become part of the ecosystem.
Interviewer,"But I do think that the less monitoring of the movement aspects of this is important, like if you just go to market cap and you look at some of the top 10 coins other than like, say, Bitcoin and diphtheria, but you can't always give a good answer for, you know, what values does that toolkit represent?."
Vitalik,"Whereas for Bitcoin you can for everything you can for XYZ cash, for example."
Interviewer,I think you can.
Vitalik,So I think there definitely is this kind of a complicated balance between different factors.
Interviewer,"Basically, the coin can help, but too much emphasis on just a coin can hurt."
Vitalik,And it's challenging.
Interviewer,"I think you to swap actually did really well with their coin because like on the one hand, you know, you could kind of criticize it and say, you know, oh, this was only just a measure that it was kind of reactionary that was reacting to, you know, kind of Souci SWAPO trying to kind of swoop in and basically try to push everyone to quickly migrate over."
Vitalik,And they had a coin.
Interviewer,So people got into such a swap because they just wanted to get rich off of it.
Vitalik,And so in a swap reacted by making their own coin.
Interviewer,"But at the same time, they did this one really cool thing, which has a big part of the initial distribution was this very kind of egalitarian airdrop."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Like basically, if you had used the swap even once before the airdrops that began, you would get four hundred unique tokens."
Vitalik,So at the time those tokens were worth about three and a half dollars.
Interviewer,"So the joke was like, you know, doing a swap actually delivered on giving everyone a Samuel check."
Vitalik,"And, you know, people really love that."
Interviewer,And although the supply distribution distribution of Yuni was going to vary widely dispersed and the whole thing was this kind of dowl where a lot of people could participate in decision making.
Vitalik,So I think there's wastage of tokens while there's ways to do tokens poorly.
Interviewer,"Yeah, the backdrop on UniSuper sushi swap is Younus, what was this? Automated market makers decentralized exchange that launched and then they sort of got attacked."
Vitalik,They got Klown by this other one called Sushi Soire Jokin Looney's Sushi.
Interviewer,"And then they tried to, like, steal the UNICEF community by saying, hey, come here and we'll pay you more by giving you tokens."
Vitalik,"And then, Eunice, what was forced to actually create a token which we then gave away to their community, which are called eardrops, like helicopter drops of money, except notes and made up tokens."
Interviewer,So there's all this interesting stuff that goes on in crypto.
Vitalik,We're trying to build and maintain communities.
Interviewer,You have to figure out how to distribute the spoils.
Vitalik,"But contrast how this is compared to, say, Facebook or Twitter."
Interviewer,You don't see Mark Zuckerberg airdropping Facebook's stock on the users and you see Jack Dorsey airdropping Twitter revenues and the users.
Vitalik,But that's exactly what happens in block chain land.
Interviewer,"And, you know, etherial might have had a small pre mine."
Vitalik,"But I do remember early on looking at Ethereum and I think I talked to Baloji Sreenivasan, one of your other guests about Atim, where we were looking at Ethe back in the day when it was first launching."
Interviewer,And we were just really confused because it seemed like there was this one brilliant technical guy surrounded by like 15 other people who all had the title co-founder.
Vitalik,And it was very confusing to evaluate as an investor.
Interviewer,So we ended up not investing to our detriment.
Vitalik,But that's that's my way of saying that this was not a Batalla get rich quick scheme.
Interviewer,"I don't think the Tarlac even had, you know, was even the single largest token holder."
Vitalik,"I think there were many other people who, frankly, you know, had a lot less to do with Ethereum success, who ended up holding a huge number of tokens."
Interviewer,"So to the extent that Retallack is the one who was working on it and pushing it forward, it's a labor of love."
Vitalik,And I've always been super impressed by how his team is very altruistic and really kind of wants to make the world a better place.
Interviewer,"Maybe they're young and naive, but it's, you know, it's refreshing to see that."
Vitalik,"So I think, you know, in terms of branding, a lot of people look at Ethereum as like lift to bitcoins, Uber."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,There's sort of a crypto right wing libertarianism versus a crypto Left-Wing sort of libertarianism Narval.
Interviewer,Let me jump in for one second here.
Vitalik,If I.
Interviewer,May ask a naive question or a novice question maybe.
Vitalik,"And if if I'm completely looking at this the wrong way, I'd love to be corrected, thinking of a theorem and comparing it to, say, Bitcoin and considering the possible regulatory threats to Bitcoin."
Interviewer,And I think probably a stronger focus on cryptocurrency than block chain by regulators.
Vitalik,"And just by extension, if we're thinking of cerium on some level as both cryptocurrency but also as a world computer, maybe as if Amazon had its own cryptocurrency, Bosnians or whatever, whatever they might call it, and then RWC that even if there were a crackdown on currencies, that Ethereum would have some resilience and a."
Interviewer,
Vitalik,Fragility in that respect.
Interviewer,Does it mean that Astrium in its entirety is less subject to regulatory threat or that it can thrive in the face of regulatory threat along the lines of that which Bitcoin could face?.
Vitalik,And that comparing the kind of regulatory situation of etherial Bitcoin and I think like most benefit from being highly international.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,Like Bitcoin has a strong community in the US and has a strong community in China.
Interviewer,"It has a strong community and, you know, the EU and lots of other places."
Vitalik,Ethereum is very similar in that regard.
Interviewer,"You know, there's these very strong communities in lots of different countries, you know, including countries that are a no, not kind of geopolitically on the same page with each other."
Vitalik,So there's a lot of resilience here in that sense.
Interviewer,"Now, of course, the other negative aspect of politics is that it's like it's not just about what they can do."
Vitalik,It's also about what they want to do.
Interviewer,The reality is that regulators have cracked down on cryptocurrency is significantly less than they theoretically could theoretically could make something like Coinbase illegal overnight.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"And I think the reality is that, you know, they yetto in part because they do see a lot of the positive value that's coming out of these platforms."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,There's even regulators that wants to use public auctions and even things like Ethereum to build applications on top of them.
Vitalik,"You know, they see value in some of the kind of advantages that the."
Interviewer,"Things like Steve walkaways, for example, could provide even financial obligations of various kinds."
Vitalik,"Yeah, if you wanted to build a fraud proof voting application, you'd probably do it a material."
Interviewer,"Crypto currencies are inherently designed to be sovereign resistant, right? They're designed to be stateless, and so the geographic redundancy is one aspect of it and some countries try to ban it, like I think for a while people think China tried to ban it and that sort of failed."
Vitalik,And right now India is talking about banning it.
Interviewer,And that will end in tears.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,That's not going to go well when you leave your country out of the innovation in the next 10 years.
Vitalik,So hopefully they don't do that.
Interviewer,But there's also redundancy in terms of design.
Vitalik,"For example, going to proof of stake is a different kind of redundancy than being just all proof of work."
Interviewer,"So you're not subject to the same kinds of attacks, I think, being used for all kinds of applications."
Vitalik,"Could you speak to that? Yes, I prefer workers."
Interviewer,You shut down miners and miners of hardware and equipment.
Vitalik,"You know where they live, right? They need a physical presence."
Interviewer,"Were proof of stake as validators, we just need Internet connection."
Vitalik,And so they're kind of harder to stop and harder to find in theory.
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Vitalik,And then you also have just what applications are running on top of these platforms.
Interviewer,"So if you're just running digital gold, that's one application."
Vitalik,"But if you're also running, as Vatileaks said, you know, functioning prediction markets, public goods, financial systems, voting systems, gaming systems, nifty tokens, art galleries."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"And all those kinds of things, then it gets very hard to shut it down."
Interviewer,And I actually think eventually all Internet traffic will be encrypted and all of it will require cryptocurrency is to kind of just allocate scarce resources.
Vitalik,"Like even today, there are things that we do on the Internet that are centralized, like caching and routing and spam filtering that should be decentralized and involve crypto payments for efficiency."
Interviewer,"And once we sort of start getting to those applications, it'll be very hard to turn off crypto without turning off the Internet."
Vitalik,"It's the native money of the Internet, and so if you take away value transfer from the Internet, the Internet as we know, it will be stunted at best and more likely just ceased to function at some levels."
Interviewer,Thank you.
Vitalik,Back to Universal.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"No, not at all."
Vitalik,No
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"It's I mean, there's there's there's there's an infinite number of rabbit holes we can go down coming back to a theorem for a second."
Interviewer,So there's bitcoin which is clearly digital gold.
Vitalik,"There's a theory which is the world computer and you know, digital gold high price is good."
Interviewer,"You want your gold to go up in value, except to the extent these days digital gold bitcoin has been going up."
Vitalik,But it actually gives me some trepidation.
Interviewer,I tell people it's like my insurance policy is becoming more valuable and my life insurance policy.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"I don't know how I feel about that, but with if it's not clear, the price going up is always that good for adoption, it's good for the people who are pumping and holding."
Vitalik,"But is it so good for the people who are trying to use it? I mean, what do you have any thoughts on the price of IEF and how much, for example, we don't even know exactly how much if there is going to be the future rate."
Interviewer,"The supply curve is a little bit undefined and some people say, oh, it could be too big, this thing will get inflated, whereas the other arguments say, no, there's certain applications we're going to have for which we have to lock up it or even destroy if to use these applications."
Vitalik,So if may end up being more valuable.
Interviewer,Do you have a what is your current point of view and where the east supply heads and what the price means for the ecosystem?.
Vitalik,"Yeah, OK, so one thing that I think you alluded to a little bit is that there is this proposal called IP one five five nine, which kind of decides how the transaction fee market works."
Interviewer,"And there is a lot of kind of very wonkier, a kind of economic base for kind of why the specific changes that it makes makes sense."
Vitalik,"But one of the consequences of that change is that the majority of fears, instead of going to the mine or whoever creates the block, would get burned if you just sort of against weeded out of existence."
Interviewer,"And so if demands to use that the uranium is high enough, then there would actually be more use them as they're being destroyed than is being created."
Vitalik,"And so, you know, the jokes that sometimes make us and bitcoin."
Interviewer,No
Vitalik,"A fixed supply of sound body that, you know, if you have a decreasing supply, does that make us some ultrasound money?."
Interviewer,And it actually is not even that far fetched.
Vitalik,"The possibility, like if you look at the transaction fees for the last month, like they actually have been on a lot of days greater than the block rewards for that for that day."
Interviewer,"So it's interesting because, like, it basically creates this more direct connection between people using the asset watching and, you know, yes, having some value."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Like at the beginning, the way that was even described earlier in the sale is that this is like gas."
Vitalik,"You know, you're buying this token that you need to use."
Interviewer,"And if you watched you Spetz transactions and if the token is actually a consumable rate, then it actually behaves even more like, well, I guess, you know, gasoline, as said, the original metaphor."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Like if people wants to use it, they would actually have to consume it."
Vitalik,And so the value of that is actually something that sort of depends on the Ethereum network being useful.
Interviewer,"And that's see, yeah, it's a bit of a difference, kind of the guiding principle then something like Bitcoin, right, where Bitcoin just derives value from, you know, because the currency derives value from Bitcoin, the currency, Bitcoin, the blocks is this kind of thing often decide that, well, OK, fine, it has to exist, whereas in a theory it's much more of a system worth a fortune is the point."
Vitalik,"And, you know, if the asset gains value from the blocks in doing its its job successfully, it's interesting."
Interviewer,"So Bitcoin, the value is in the currency or in the bitcoin itself, whereas in ethe the values and the blockin being used in the earth is the byproduct of it."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"To use my strained castles made of math analogy, you know, I think bitcoin is like the big impregnable citadel, the Fort Knox into which you're putting your gold and you and the thing has high walls and it's guarded really well and they don't change much."
Vitalik,"And, you know, it's the same as it was in 2009 or 2011 so that no one can break in."
Interviewer,"But Ethe is sort of this dynamic network, a little city states that are trading with each other."
Vitalik,"The more trade there is, the more free flow of information and goods, the more valuable the whole system becomes."
Interviewer,But no single point of it is necessarily as impregnable.
Vitalik,"Like, for example, I do expect that we'll see more hacks and break ins and failures in the ecosystem as a whole, not an earth itself, but in the ecosystem around ethe then we will in the ecosystem around Bitcoin necessarily."
Interviewer,"But at the same time, if it's dynamic and growing and adaptive, which just makes it more of a, you know, an evolving creature."
Vitalik,"Yeah, I'd agree with that was one reservation, which is that I think the Bitcoin ecosystem does have its own kind of ticking time bomb demons to tether is one example."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"There are pieces around the bitcoin ecosystem that are semi centralized or of unknown trustworthiness and do rely on untrusted on trusted third parties, I should say."
Vitalik,"But, you know, as the big."
Interviewer,"When people say, like, not your keys, not your coin, right, and trusted third parties are security holes, so they're aware of that, I think the Bitcoin maximalists, which I believe is a term that you coined, the Bitcoin maximalists, would say, well, that's not Bitcoin, right."
Vitalik,That's something else.
Interviewer,"So, I mean, one of the things to think about here, and I think you care about this more than most people in crypto, which is nice, is that you do seem to care about wealth inequality, the Gini coefficient and the distribution of coins."
Vitalik,"And one of the criticisms about crypto that I see a lot is like, well, OK, so you're getting rid of the old oligarchs with this new financial system, but you're just replacing them with new oligarchs who are the original Bitcoin and ethe holders."
Interviewer,"And how do you think about the distribution of wealth in a crypto run economy as opposed to a fiat currency, a.k.a."
Vitalik,"the US dollar and you know, the euro run economy? This is definitely one."
Interviewer,I think one of the challenging kind of questions for the community to grapple with.
Vitalik,"This is actually one of the reasons why I kind of really like ashram's, kind of more, you know, multi-currency, a welcoming ecosystem."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"Like, you know."
Interviewer,Sure you have.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,"And, you know, there is a limited set of opportunities to kind of get UTF directly from the tap."
Vitalik,"And at some point, you know, the supply is going to stabilize that."
Interviewer,If you're buying if you're just you're buying just from a previous people.
Vitalik,"But at the same time, there are these new applications that are launching."
Interviewer,"You know, you have your you need, as I mentioned, where the distribution was been isolated, quite egalitarian."
Vitalik,"Like as I mentioned, you know, the 400 huni stimulus checks that just go to everyone who ever use the application at least once."
Interviewer,And they could try really hard to not favor wealthy users too much.
Vitalik,And then there's tornado cash had an air drop a couple of weeks back.
Interviewer,So there's more of these assets coming in.
Vitalik,"And I think, like, that kind of churn is healthy, like it."
Interviewer,"You know, it brings new life into the ecosystem, you know, every second, as you liken it to the wealth distribution."
Vitalik,And it does.
Interviewer,Create opportunities for new people to be able to come in and kind of participate on a somewhat level footing as well.
Vitalik,But then you have want to compare all of this to the ecosystem.
Interviewer,"It's a difficult comparison to make just because these institutions are so different and it's kind of difficult to, you know, match one up against the other."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Like a fiat currency is, you know, they basically get created by kind of a combination of, you know, the central bank and the commercial banking ecosystem."
Vitalik,"And in terms of whereas in the market, you've newly generated value comes in like, you know, both sides of that gets some share, essentially, and there's bad things that come out of it."
Interviewer,There's also some good things that come out of it.
Vitalik,"So, like I mean, I know like this is a controversial position among libertarians, but I actually like the idea that, you know, if you have a fiat currency, then the government can print it and just use that as a source of government revenue."
Interviewer,"And the reason why I like it is because I think if the governments can earn to get money through unobtrusive means, that reduces the extent to which it has to rely on getting money through more intrusive means and, you know, relying on taxation and kind of more directly."
Vitalik,"The problem is when it's unobtrusive, it's very easy to do it very sneakily."
Interviewer,"And these tax taxes have to be collected now, whereas printing can kick the can down the road for the next person to solve."
Vitalik,This is arguments in the other direction.
Interviewer,"Yeah, there's a there's a moral hazard there."
Vitalik,And I think we're watching it play out where we printed a trillion dollars last year and who's going to pay for it right now.
Interviewer,"The nice thing about cryptocurrency, of course, is that, like, the ecosystem is much more transparent."
Vitalik,"And so, you know, it's easier to analyze and understand what the rules are."
Interviewer,"And like within the context of a crypto ecosystem, you know, as I mentioned, you can still do very egalitarian things."
Vitalik,"You can still, you know, reward people who were very important early contributors to fix it ended up being very important."
Interviewer,"So, you know, you can still do all of those things."
Vitalik,"And, you know, we do have a responsibility to get the balance right."
Interviewer,"But the environment is just inherently a more kind of open and honest one just because, you know, these are decentralized systems and everyone does just see exactly what's going on."
Vitalik,"Yeah, it's certainly more transparent, like you can tell with the money supply of ether's at any given point."
Interviewer,Good luck doing that with the US dollar money supply.
Vitalik,"Or you can tell with the inflation and if there's any given point and as you say, there's opportunities to build more applications on top of it and maybe even is the App Store for decentralized applications."
Interviewer,But some of those applications can go on to capture just as much value and create just as much value as Ethe itself.
Vitalik,"So I think that'll be the really interesting development in the last year, is just to see applications on top of if you're really creating and capturing and building lots of wealth and add value."
Interviewer,"And so in that sense this twenty, twenty one and twenty, twenty two run up seem a little different to me than the twenty seventeen run up, which was based on just a lot of hype frankly."
Vitalik,"So as we see sort of crypto playing out, you've also had some very interesting thoughts on everything from radical markets to political philosophy to kind of what happened in twenty, twenty and so on."
Interviewer,"And we could spend a whole podcast on that, but just set a very high level."
Vitalik,You had a really good post on your blog saying endnotes on twenty twenty.
Interviewer,And it was about a lot more than just crypto.
Vitalik,So what else are you really interested in these days?.
Interviewer,"I mean, is it AGI, is it life extension, is it public goods? Is it different kinds of voting schemes? What's really on top of mind for you?."
Vitalik,That's not directly crypto related?.
Interviewer,Some of all those.
Vitalik,So I think the changing kind of way in which economics works is definitely one of those really important topics.
Interviewer,There's a couple of different kind of changes that's happening.
Vitalik,Like one of them that I talked about is just public goods becoming more important.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"Like a lot of the ways that people thought of economics, like 50 or 100 years ago, they just kind of focused on private goods like cars, houses, food, you know, things like that."
Interviewer,"But there's also public goods, right."
Vitalik,Which are projects that benefit a large and unselective group of people.
Interviewer,And so no individual person for benefits has the incentive to personally finance the whole thing.
Vitalik,"But it's hard to push people to pay for it because like, you can't deny the benefits of other things to people who don't pay for it, for example."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,And so scientific research is one example of a public good.
Interviewer,My blog is one example of a public good open source.
Vitalik,Software is an example of a public good.
Interviewer,"And like on the Internet, public goods are even more common than private goods are."
Vitalik,"And so, like, our economics just has to."
Interviewer,"Just take that fact seriously and a lot of what's been happening in the blogging space in some ways just is, you know, the crypto world trying to grapple against those things."
Vitalik,"So basically, these public goods are where the costs are concentrated."
Interviewer,"Like if I want to fund scientific research, I do it out of my own pocket, but it benefits all of humanity."
Vitalik,So the benefits are distributed.
Interviewer,And so these tend to be undersupplied.
Vitalik,They tend to be too few of them.
Interviewer,And so there are there are schemes out there to tackle some of them.
Vitalik,I think you've talked about quadratic funding as an example.
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,What is quadratic funding? So quadratic funding is this interesting mechanism that basically says anyone can donate money to public goods through the mechanism.
Interviewer,"But to compensate for this, under a provision that you talk about, the mechanism provides a subsidy to every public good."
Vitalik,"And that subsidy depends not just on the amount that was contributed, but also on the total number of people who contributed."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"So, for example, if there's two projects, the both got 100 hundred dollars, but one of them got a say, eighty dollars from one percent and twenty dollars from another person."
Interviewer,And the second project just got one dollar from each of 100 people.
Vitalik,The second public good is much more public sent the first public good and the tragedy of the Commons on the second one is much greater.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"And so the fact that that the second one managed to get to a hundred dollars despite the one hundred, a tragedy of the commons implies that it's a really important project."
Interviewer,"And so the quadratic funding mechanism actually gives a much greater subsidy to the one dollar from one hundred each of 100 people project than it does from the project that got just the one hundred dollars from, you know, a split between two people."
Vitalik,And so we've been experimenting with the quadratics funding.
Interviewer,There's this thing called Bitcoin grants that happens a few times a year and that's had about a seven or eight rounds by now.
Vitalik,"I forget the exact number just for public goods within the Ethereum ecosystem, and that's worked really well."
Interviewer,So that's been one of the kind of interesting experiments that I've been following.
Vitalik,"Question on quadratic funding, just to hop in here, since I'm involved with a few different types of scientific research, are those funders in those experiments that you've run anonymized or DNA Islamized? Because I'm thinking through the example you gave and how there are other plausible explanations for why there might be two funders."
Interviewer,"I'm just thinking about, for instance, reputational risk associated with certain types of scientific research."
Vitalik,"There are other plausible explanations, but those largely hinge on named names versus them being anonymous."
Interviewer,"So how do you think about other contributing factors, depending on how you're conducting the experiments? Sure."
Vitalik,"So first of all, look, in quadraphonic funding, unfortunately, you do need to have some kind of model for identity because, you know, he needs to prevent the two people from just pretending that they are one hundred people."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"But with cryptography, you actually can do fancy things that give you most of the benefit from having anonymity despite needing to have an identity system."
Interviewer,"Basically, you can have a system where people can make all these contributions and."
Vitalik,"They are done in such a way that the system identifies like how many unique contributors there are for each project, but where the system does not get an idea, like nobody actually gets any idea of exactly which particular person I've donated, how much money to which particular project this is done."
Interviewer,"Using this really important and fascinating topic of zero knowledge of cryptography and zero proof cryptography, like basically the idea is that it allows you to make cryptographic proofs that some statement is true."
Vitalik,"So, like, I can make a cryptographic proof that says that, you know, I have 100 coins or that you signed a message that contains like some some facts about me."
Interviewer,"And it was signed with naughtier and you can make these proofs, but where the proof does not reveal the contents of the thing that it's proving."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So like, for example, I could prove that I have an account that has at least one 100 coins, but I don't have to prove which account to do this."
Vitalik,I don't have to prove exactly how many coins I have.
Interviewer,"And there is a lot of this very fancy mathematical magic that basically creates this protocol where if you give me a proof, then I know that the statement is true, because if the statement is false, you would have had no way to generate the proof."
Vitalik,"But if I have just a proof, I can learn nothing else beyond the fact that that particular statement is correct."
Interviewer,So this is incredibly powerful cryptography itself.
Vitalik,It's behind the cash.
Interviewer,"For example, there's also with your own applications like tornado cash that are using it."
Vitalik,There is zero proofs also have these really nice scalability proofs.
Interviewer,"So these proofs are very quick to verify, even if the statement that they're proving is incredibly complex, not AntiSec Roelofs like some of these are scaling solutions, end up really benefiting from using them."
Vitalik,So very powerful technology.
Interviewer,"And I think it's also very significant from a social perspective because, you know, we have this broader kind of anonymity versus accountability debate, right."
Vitalik,"Of like, you know, the benefits of privacy versus the benefits of like basically a process of reputations and zero knowledge."
Interviewer,"Cryptography is really powerful because it puts in a lot of cases, allow us to get both good things at the same time, like you could get us the benefits of things like persistent reputations, while at the same time getting a lot of the benefits of anonymity."
Vitalik,It seems very powerful.
Interviewer,"Just to follow up on that, you're thinking of scientific research."
Vitalik,I'm going to ask you what areas you might have particular personal interest in.
Interviewer,"I know you have some interest in life extension, as evidenced by the dragon slaying parable on your website or that you link to from your Twitter bio."
Vitalik,"But it strikes me that the quadratic funding experiments would also be heavily dependent on equally simplistic or simplified communication of competing, not necessarily competing, but contrasted scientific studies."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,Because there are some instances just in my experience where scientific studies that require a lot of scientific knowledge or due diligence would have fewer funders compared to others.
Interviewer,But that doesn't necessarily reflect less importance or impact potential.
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,"Now, this is also a very important point."
Vitalik,And I think the solution to this is that quadratic funding by itself doesn't solve all the problems.
Interviewer,And you have to combine quadratic logic with other mechanisms.
Vitalik,So I can give two examples.
Interviewer,One example of how you could do this says you could just set up an organization or that organization has some smart people.
Vitalik,"And, you know, those smart people do a good job of picking who the scientists are that are really worth funding."
Interviewer,"And then that organization gets five or 10 year history and people see that, oh, you know, yes, this organization does have a surprisingly good track record of funding."
Vitalik,"You know, the studies that actually do ends up turning out to be meaningful five years down the line."
Interviewer,And then people will just that contribute through the quadratics funding scheme to this organization and the organization to be able to sort of leverage its own reputation.
Vitalik,"Now, if that organization ends up, you know, doing bad things and abusing this kind of public, trust it, then, you know, people could very easily just stop contributing to it and start contributing to it to another group."
Interviewer,So that's one approach.
Vitalik,Another approach is that there could be clever ways to combine quadratic logic with venture capital.
Interviewer,"So the idea here is that imagine if when people make a public good, they create a coin associated with that public good and you just let people buy the coin."
Vitalik,"And when people buy the coin, the revenues just go to the people who achieve it."
Interviewer,And then what you can do with quadratic flooding is you can basically kind of collectively buy out these coins.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So you can just say, OK, you know, this coin is a point that represents a project that gave the world a, say, a million dollars worth of value."
Vitalik,And so we're going to try to find a billion dollars.
Interviewer,Into the coin.
Vitalik,"And so anyone who bought that coin would be able to benefit, right? And so the idea is that if there are intelligent investors that are able to recognize that something will be valuable, you know, 10 years in the future, then basically they will be able to make a profit off of this."
Interviewer,"And if anyone has something that is maybe difficult for the of wider public to determine is valuable at the beginning, but then is likely to lead to some important outcome that just everyone recognizes is really valuable sometime in the future that, you know, the investors can fill the gap."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"So you have these two approaches, like you can either rely on reputation and kind of do it retrospectively or you can rely on this kind of combination of quadratics funding with some, you know, tokens and investments that you want prospectively."
Vitalik,So I think both of those are really interesting.
Interviewer,I love this possibility to combine also.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"I mean, you could potentially have all of the elements that you described combined."
Vitalik,And I know you sound like you want to jump in.
Interviewer,"I was just thinking that the campaign financing kind of works a little bit like this, maybe accidentally, maybe the system has just navigated to it through kind of complex systems, level intelligence."
Vitalik,"But if you look at campaign financing for when people run for office, there's a maximum limit they can get per donor."
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,And so an individual can only gift a certain amount to a congressman or to a senator or a presidential candidate.
Interviewer,And then the feds also have matching funds on top of that.
Vitalik,"So it's a combination of these schemes because by limiting the amount that any one person can give, you're sort of creating a quadratic, although it's not truly quadratic like, you know, someone very wealthy."
Interviewer,"I guess they could give a lot more through a side vehicle, but then that's less efficient because you're not allowed to coordinate with the main campaign."
Vitalik,So there is kind of a really badly implemented version of quadratic funding with matching dollars already in existence in federal campaign financing.
Interviewer,"Hmm, that's a good point."
Vitalik,"Yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,"But what areas of scientific inquiry or research are on your short list of most personally interesting at the moment? Yeah, so you brought up life extension and life extension is definitely really important to me, like I think in the coronaviruses actually even had the positive side effects of kind of speeding this along in some ways."
Vitalik,But there is a lot of extremely promising things happening in biotech.
Interviewer,"I think there's a very significant chance that, like where we're standing today is basically is for biotech, the equivalent of where computers were in 1950."
Vitalik,"And so if you imagine, you know, the difference between the Aniak and a modern kind of laptop or a smartphone, that's the difference that bruddah see between the biotech of 2020 and the biotech of 2090."
Interviewer,"And so if right now we can already come up with vaccines for a virus, well, a year for deployment to start, but really the whole of the whole thing actually happens much faster."
Vitalik,"And, you know, most of the delay can be blamed on like bio conservatism."
Interviewer,But that's a whole other discussion.
Vitalik,"If you go from even there and then, you know, add 70 years of progress to that much."
Interviewer,"And it's very easy to see even the process of turning into something that just becomes irreversible and it being a regular thing for people to live, you know, one and a half, two centuries and then go even further from there."
Vitalik,There's just a huge kind of nice humanitarian outcome that can come from that.
Interviewer,"You know, basically, like the concept of your grandmother dying is just going to kind of slowly leave the public consciousness the same way that the concept of getting lost in a city absolutely lost to the public consciousness over the last twenty five years as we got better cell phones and mean."
Vitalik,I think that's a really lovely I just kind of a much better world to spend a lot of resources to shoot for.
Interviewer,"Do you think that's realistic, though, given all the three letter agencies that slow down experimentation development? Because I worry it's more like nuclear power, right, where they can't tolerate a single death."
Vitalik,So the innovation isn't really allowed.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"So this is where I say a controversial thing, which is I think I'm very happy that the coronavirus has helped to delegitimize the bio conservatism to the extent that it has."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I agree with that."
Vitalik,"The Moderna vaccine was ready in June 13th, right? Yes."
Interviewer,And like even things like human challenge studies.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Like the default, I think bioethics opinion around a year ago is like, you know, oh my God, this is unethical."
Vitalik,"And, you know, now, like in the UK, they're actually happening that this is great."
Interviewer,"Yeah, it is good if it breaks down by a conservatism to some extent because the pace of innovation is too low."
Vitalik,It's like what we've done to nuclear power if we do that to biotech and we kind of have already to some extent.
Interviewer,"But if we do it even more, then there's no chance of, you know, grandma living forever."
Vitalik,"There's no chance of me living, you know, 50 years longer than the lone grandma living forever."
Interviewer,"You know, you're twenty seven."
Vitalik,I'd love to see where you're at.
Interviewer,Forty seven.
Vitalik,"You're going to be a, you know, really interesting guy."
Interviewer,"You already are, but you're going to be even more interesting guy, even more interesting at 447."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Oh, well, I don't know."
Vitalik,It's simple and I hope you guys can both come to my birthday party.
Interviewer,"Well, are you are you on some kind of caloric restriction or intermittent fasting?."
Vitalik,"So so far, yeah."
Interviewer,"Well, I do like the poor man's intermittent fasting, which is that I just usually don't eat breakfast."
Vitalik,"I do the usual exercise, nothing too fancy."
Interviewer,"I eat kind of at least a couple of the basic supplements that those that's the life extension, what people are recommending."
Vitalik,"Nothing too much fancier than that so far, though, you know, very closely watching the space."
Interviewer,"And I'm sure I'll end up doing much more things, you know, ten or even five years from now."
Vitalik,Do you take rapamycin? I do not take rapamycin for me is the one that I take this and other that I take.
Interviewer,Hmm.
Vitalik,"And just for those people listening, who who who should know this, No."
Interviewer,"One, this none of this is medical advice."
Vitalik,No
Interviewer,"To Metformin, just as an example, none of these things should be taken without the advice of a medical professional."
Vitalik,"Metformin is used in the treatment of Type two diabetes, Glucophage."
Interviewer,But I'm also familiar with it.
Vitalik,How do you decide what to implement versus not implement for yourself?.
Interviewer,"Personally, I just and ask around a lot of people in the life extension community."
Vitalik,"I, you know, read the study is, you know, look at this, just what are some of the high level results? And then just narrow it down to a couple of things."
Interviewer,Hmm.
Vitalik,It is remarkable how many people in various sub communities have been using a lot of these interventions longitudinally.
Interviewer,"I remember when I was working on my second book looking into trans resveratrol and finding even at that time, this was 2008, 2009, people who had for years been using one to say five hundred milligrams per day."
Vitalik,So you were able to identify certain long term effects and side effects.
Interviewer,"Granted, Alnwick."
Vitalik,"Totally, but still having an end of, I don't know, maybe a thousand people on this forum."
Interviewer,So there is a lot to be gleaned from these from these groups.
Vitalik,"There's even a new one making the rounds like peptides, GOP one."
Interviewer,I'm sure you've seen some study floating around in that.
Vitalik,"But, yeah, these things are very unknown."
Interviewer,"I wish these were more out in the open and that there was a very, very strong anti aging research community that was functioning out in the open, that was trading votes on what works and what doesn't and able to run some kind of human trials more efficiently."
Vitalik,Because fighting aging is a is a very time sensitive task.
Interviewer,"It is, yeah."
Vitalik,"So it's not literally half the justice of World War two or four every eight years that, you know, it gets delayed or however that number of lives saved for every year that gets brought earlier."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"One analogy I heard that I liked was, you know, we're all born time billionaires with billions of seconds of life and then we spend those and now you get to someone like Warren Buffett and I'm sure he would trade one hundred billion dollars for more billions of seconds."
Interviewer,But he can't.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"In fact, health care is the ultimate inelastic good."
Vitalik,"On your deathbed, you'll spend any amount of money to live even an hour longer."
Interviewer,"So certainly the economic incentives are there, the personal incentives are there."
Vitalik,"But because of this concept that people who don't know what they're doing are going to hear something and run out and like ingest some substance and then die, you know, drink bleach or take too much rapamycin because of that kind of fear, we're not allowed to do any real innovation or discovery, and it's literally killing us outright."
Interviewer,"And if we just reframed it as well, no, it's not that we're dying of aging."
Vitalik,"We're dying because you won't let us do the innovation, do the research."
Interviewer,It might take on a different take.
Vitalik,But I was actually a little disappointed with the coronavirus response because I thought we would have had faster trials of the vaccines.
Interviewer,But the fact that they were still kind of slow and even now the deployment is being held up because we have to create these perfect vaccine delivery packages instead of just the kind of quick and dirty vaccination.
Vitalik,"And we have to go through these very regimented protocols rather than just saying, everybody just line up and let's just go as quickly as possible because we insist on doing things in kind of this bureaucratic over the control way."
Interviewer,We're still slowing things down.
Vitalik,"And if Coronavirus would get us to accelerate our normal processes into a wartime footing, then what will?."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I, I also just want to add that I think given my experience with a highly stigmatised field of scientific research, which is psychedelics and psychedelic compounds for intractable or difficult to treat psychiatric conditions, I think that life extension or the community itself and proponents thereof could spend a lot of their oxygen and calories trying to convince regulators and three letter acronyms to classify aging as a disease and therefore allocate funding."
Vitalik,And I think that that is going to be very difficult and possibly wasteful compared to decentralized or distributed funding from the citizen philanthropists or donors of various types.
Interviewer,"I think a lot of it's going to come down to to independent financing since that has been the case, even all the way up to phase three trials for compounds that show tremendous effect sizes in the treatment of depression and PTSD and so on."
Vitalik,"And I think another important thing also is just kind of international outreach and more connections, because ultimately, you know, the US is not the center of the universe and there is plenty of very smart people."
Interviewer,"And, you know, the EU like Singapore, China, India, Canada, whatever other places, you know, there's a lot of great talent there that I think could help all of humanity solve these problems faster."
Vitalik,"So if we can just work together on the problem or hopefully prevent stupid nationalism from adding too much friction between things, yeah, I think a lot of the newer generation, rather than just being patrons of the arts, they're trying to figure out how to become patrons of science."
Interviewer,"And instead of just doing venture capital, we all like to figure out a model for venture research because we need more science, right."
Vitalik,Sciences upstream of technology.
Interviewer,"And the faster we can move science, the more it'll benefit us across the board."
Vitalik,"So I don't know where else you want to take this, Tim, but I have some kind of more of the closing questions type of italic."
Interviewer,If you're ready for those.
Vitalik,I want to take this where you want to take this at all.
Interviewer,"OK, yeah."
Vitalik,"So one question I kind of have is given all the tumultuous change in twenty twenty, because coronavirus was a trigger, but it was a trigger for accelerating a lot of things that were already happening, like where do you think the world heads in the next few years where maybe your peers might disagree with you."
Interviewer,What are your contrarian views or you're kind of uniquely held individualistic views on how things are going to play out that are not yet consensus.
Vitalik,And this is unfair because aging was a good one.
Interviewer,You made a solid you went out on a limb on aging is an example.
Vitalik,"That's like the contrarian in the world, but."
Interviewer,"Contrarian among a kind of my circles, I guess, yeah, when I went through your writings, I mean, the idea that there will be many chains and many tokens."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,Is quite different.
Vitalik,"The idea that, yes, the Internet has increased the number of public goods rather than the number of private goods is actually quite contrarian because we think of it as going more and more private property."
Interviewer,But on the Internet is one to many.
Vitalik,So there's all these public goods.
Interviewer,And I think you were the first one to really hammer that point home in a big way.
Vitalik,And then I think this aging thing is another one.
Interviewer,"So I'm just digging, seeing if there's any more, you know, another thing like that might have been very iconoclastic two years ago, but is very much not today would be kind of just geographic decentralization."
Vitalik,Even with hearing.
Interviewer,"I'm like when we took a very active effort of, you know, not making it to a centralized in any one country or any or any one city in any one place."
Vitalik,And I feel like we've benefited a lot from that.
Interviewer,"But now, of course, everyone is geographically decentralizing and Coinbase has announced that like that, if its managements, they'll live in San Francisco and so forth."
Vitalik,It's very hard to associate etherial with a single country.
Interviewer,I think it was created by mostly Canadians.
Vitalik,And your blog has a dot com top level.
Interviewer,"Well, I'm Canadian, but then my blog has a dossier, the foundation of Swiss stands."
Vitalik,And now there's a Singaporean entity as well.
Interviewer,A lot of the initial developers were German.
Vitalik,"You know, a lot of developers are from the US as well."
Interviewer,And one of the most efficient EU clients is based in Australia.
Vitalik,"So I feel like we've had is actually like took those values seriously, Inderjit and did it well."
Interviewer,And Ethereum has spent the foundation has spent a lot of time in East Asia.
Vitalik,"I think I've seen you kind of go to conference, to conference in East Asia and Korea and Japan and places like that spreading the word."
Interviewer,So it is quite decentralized geographically.
Vitalik,What advice do you have for someone who wants to get into Ethereum and doesn't just want to go and buy the token? Who actually wants to dive into the ecosystem? What is the person to do to get involved in the Ethereum community and the ecosystem where the points of leverage?.
Interviewer,"I think what is learning to build an application and actually trying to build an application? Yes, I think one great place to start, if that's the sort of thing that interests you, like, even if you don't turn out as a full time developer and start forcing yourself through, the process still helps you."
Vitalik,"Just understands that, you know, what are the different pieces and actually what function do they serve? Another example."
Interviewer,"Another approach there is well, now obviously check out of temporarily suspended."
Vitalik,But generally there's a lot of local communities that that of in-person meet ups and all that that people can be part of.
Interviewer,And that's often a great opportunity to get to meet other people.
Vitalik,"There's a lot of materials online, although generally I and it's much more big fan of hands on learning."
Interviewer,"So we're kind of learning by doing instead of learning, by taking in information."
Vitalik,"And so, you know, I highly recommend, like just trying to build one application for a lot of people."
Interviewer,Otherwise there's just a lot of different communities and kids.
Vitalik,You have to just like go in and start taking part in those.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"For those of you who are curious, I think Photonics Blog has spawned quite a few of the things in the Ethereum ecosystem, like I think it was one of your musings that led to the creation of unit swap."
Interviewer,"And you'd recently you've been talking about roll ups and social wallets and in all kinds of other things that we built on top, although maybe this is the first year where I feel like the community is outpacing your ideas with niftiest and with some of the games that are coming up on top of ethe and so on."
Vitalik,It does seem like that there's a lot of innovation going on.
Interviewer,It's hard to keep up.
Vitalik,"It's very, very hard to keep up to date."
Interviewer,"That's a good thing for those of you also looking for what's next down the rabbit hole, briefly mentioned zero knowledge proofs."
Vitalik,"I would say that, you know, the beginning of the rabbit hole, the entrance is Bitcoin."
Interviewer,Then you go a little further down.
Vitalik,"You find if but then when you find Zuoren proofs, that's the big mind blowing moment when you realize just what crypto is capable of and there are analogs for what crypto can do that almost cannot be done in the real world."
Interviewer,"It's sort of like when you go into physics and when you encounter quantum mechanics, it sort of makes you rethink that."
Vitalik,"No, not everything necessarily maps onto exactly how I observe it."
Interviewer,"The same way when you get to zero knowledge proofs, you realize that the levels of creativity in crypto that enables are greater than what we might have had pre crypto."
Vitalik,So that's also an interesting space to kind of learn about.
Interviewer,And I think zero knowledge proofs have probably been incorporated into an emergency theorem system ecosystem even more than we expected.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,Because a lot of people call it moon math.
Vitalik,"Early on, it was considered too hard to be practical, but people have been chipping away at it."
Interviewer,"Yeah, not in the moon."
Vitalik,"Math is definitely significantly less money than it was even one or two years ago, like even snarks."
Interviewer,"Another term for this, as your knowledge proofs have just become considerably simpler, sometime around one and a half years ago, Amazon even tried to make another post."
Vitalik,One of my most recent ones I never thought I'd see or I tried to talk about how roughly how he snarks work.
Interviewer,"I actually feel like I need an explanation that at least the high school version of myself would have understood, which is like it's still not perfect, but it's significantly more understandable than any of the previous ones have been."
Vitalik,So I feel like the ideas are definitely trickling down.
Interviewer,"Oh, so I do have another answer to the question of like, what things are you thinking about that other people are not thinking about yet? I think this is kind of taking a kind of cultural and social context so seriously, which sounds obvious."
Vitalik,"But in some ways it really isn't like even within the crypto space, I feel like a lot of people in their models of, you know, is Bitcoin going to beat governments or are these things going to be censorship resistance?."
Interviewer,"They tend to look at it purely from a technical point of view, and they basically are kind of implicitly assuming that, you know, governments are going to try as hard as they can into the crypto space, is going to try as hard as it can."
Vitalik,"And it'll be a battle and one side and, you know, that person's preferred side is going to win."
Interviewer,But the reality is that governments are not trying as hard as they can.
Vitalik,And a big part of the reason why is that government is not even so much an entity as it is a battlefield.
Interviewer,Right.
Vitalik,"And like, what are the soldiers fighting on the battlefield? A lot of it is just their cultural movements and a lot of the success of cryptocurrency."
Interviewer,"And what I think it really has to do with the way that they have kind of interplay with a lot of the important cultural trends over the last ten years like this, including things like people's distrust of financial institutions after 2008."
Vitalik,I think people's distrust of centralized tech companies after 2020 is also going to play a big part.
Interviewer,"Also, just another fascinating thing, I think is even one thing that surprised me is how cryptocurrency managed to appeal to a lot of people who would not normally think of themselves as libertarians."
Vitalik,And that's something that I think it ends up even blindsiding a lot of people.
Interviewer,And the reason why that happens has to do with kind of very deep and specific aspects of how people think instead of how people think ideologically.
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,"Like a lot of people think of like, say, authoritarians, for example, as just people who hate freedom and want to restrict things."
Vitalik,But the reality is there's lots of people who are in favor of very specific restrictions or even in favor of restrictions that benefit their own team.
Interviewer,"But there's just this is very easily flipped to being very pro freedom when it's their own team that's being threatened or even when you just kind of take things out of the cultural context of, you know, what should the governments do? And into the cultural context of what, you know, like how should technology work."
Vitalik,So there's a lot of these kind of very subtle effects that determine whether bloodstains and some of the ideals behind watchman's kind of succeed and failed and these kind of very subtle properties of how humans can even how humans interact with each other are extremely important in a lot of ways.
Interviewer,"And the reason why they are important to us, they just determine the effectiveness with which people can coordinate, like humans are naturally very attuned to all kinds of social trends, that humans have a lot of motivations that have to do directly with, you know, what position they have within a kind of social trends and context that are made up by other people."
Vitalik,"And this is just a space that these, you know, watching in cryptocurrency space is going to navigate."
Interviewer,"Well, if it navigates it poorly, then I think fortunes will be stalked by governments or they won't be stopped entirely."
Vitalik,But the amount of usage can easily be more than 90 percent lower than it otherwise would be.
Interviewer,"But on the other hand, if supply chains can, you know, successfully show to a kind of large enough coalitions that this is a valuable and this is a good thing for the world, then they can be very successful."
Vitalik,"And like, this is just something that, you know, the space needs to have a better understanding of and take seriously."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I think there's a lot of good points you just made."
Vitalik,What I like is that government is not an entity or enemy on the battlefield.
Interviewer,It may just be the battlefield that all of these factors can kind of win simultaneously.
Vitalik,"I think you made this point in your blog in one place where you said that in twenty twenty, you know, big government, one big social media, one big centralized applications, one, but decentralized also one."
Interviewer,So you can have multiple winners.
Vitalik,These are nicely either or.
Interviewer,"You've also made an argument in one of your blog posts, which is all."
Vitalik,"Beyond the scope of this podcast, but I think it's worth digging into for people interested in game theory, where you basically point out that a lot of the toy models that we consider when we were evaluating how these things will end up have a so-called Nash equilibrium, they have a solution in game theory because a lot of individuals are making decisions independently, but because majority coalitions rule and people can collude or they can form coalitions, that you end up in these unstable cycles where you have a majority win one round and then the definition of the majority reshuffles and then they win the next round."
Interviewer,"And so we see this in politics where it seems like, OK, now the Democrats are in charge forever and oops, no, now the Republicans are in charge forever."
Vitalik,"And whoops, no."
Interviewer,Now the Democrats are in charge forever again.
Vitalik,And suddenly underneath what's going on is the definition of Democrat and Republican is unstable.
Interviewer,They're just coalitions that are being formed and reformed as needed.
Vitalik,"So, yeah, these are lots of great thought provoking points."
Interviewer,I'd really love to touch base with a vitriolic who's 37 know ripe old age of thirty seven out of this thousand year Methuselah lifespan.
Vitalik,"And you've got so nivel, I don't know if you have questions remaining."
Interviewer,"So I really just have one question, and that is the curiosity of mine."
Vitalik,It's related to language learning.
Interviewer,So you have studied quite a few languages.
Vitalik,"I looked at a clip of you answering questions in a Q&A at some point, I don't know the year in Mandarin."
Interviewer,And I was very impressed.
Vitalik,I went to two universities in China and Nayoung doing Zhang the Hulkower.
Interviewer,"So I wanted to ask if you could give advice now, having tested many things using many approaches for someone who wants to learn Mandarin, what would your current recommendations be to them? Sure."
Vitalik,"So for any language, my usual approach is I think at the beginning, like you do need some kind of explicit program."
Interviewer,So like one thing that I've used is the papers over podcasts.
Vitalik,So that's where you are.
Interviewer,"So it's just a series of these 90 minutes or 90, 30 minute podcasts or twenty seven minutes or about two days in total that you'll listen to one of them every day."
Vitalik,"And they just they teach you the language from nothing up to, you know, some very basic level over the course of these 90 episodes."
Interviewer,"So you start from that, but that even after that, you don't have nearly enough to understand anything from there."
Vitalik,Sometimes you can find other podcasts like and eventually you graduate to just like regular podcasts in that language.
Interviewer,So things that are not even optimized for language learning.
Vitalik,"Well, like at the beginning, you do want to find like resources that are optimized for learning flashcard apps for Chinese, specifically for memorizing the characters or at least, you know, the first, you know, 500 or a thousand or so."
Interviewer,And there's plenty of flashcard apps are all about equally good.
Vitalik,And then once you kind of get past some levels and you get to a level where the best way to get even better is to just talk to people.
Interviewer,"Another kind of task that works somewhat at the beginning actually is like if you just go into a city and you just like start like reading various signs on the street and you try your best and just understand what you know, what they mean."
Vitalik,"If you see aware that you don't understand, you look it up like that's often useful."
Interviewer,I also use Duolingo as well.
Vitalik,It's been helpful in some cases.
Interviewer,So it's just like a combination of these techniques.
Vitalik,"And you have to when you start, it's difficult."
Interviewer,"And then when you get past some points, you get to a point where you can just kind of level up just from talking to people from their."
Vitalik,"Yeah, great advice, and I'll just add to that that Google Translate with image translation can be a incredible savior in lands where you don't understand the orthography."
Interviewer,"So in Japan, my brother doesn't speak Japanese, but we travel there and he was able to more or less accurately translate country that hunts the Chinese characters using Google Translate."
Vitalik,It was remarkably accurate.
Interviewer,It's improved a lot.
Vitalik,"And as I understand it, you know, another thing that you've done is, is watching."
Interviewer,"Now, I'd like to clarify here, is it watching films in other languages or is it watching English language films with subtitles in your target language, which is also something I've done."
Vitalik,"It is watching films in other languages, sometimes with subtitles in English."
Interviewer,Got it.
Vitalik,"Thank you, Narval."
Interviewer,Would you like to to to wrap up.
Vitalik,"No, thank you."
Interviewer,Thank you for that.
Vitalik,"It's really been an honor, I think, along with Nick Serbo and Hal Finney and Wadeye and a few other very influential people in Zucco and so on."
Interviewer,You've just been incredibly influential in the development of block chains.
Vitalik,"And I believe that block chains are the third wave of the Internet after the Web and mobile, and they're quite fundamental to how the Internet does and will operate in the future."
Interviewer,"You're probably the youngest one of that group, so you're going to be involved in it for hopefully a very long time and it's going to change computing as we know it."
Vitalik,I'm betting on it.
Interviewer,I know many people are.
Vitalik,And so thanks for your work and thanks for taking the time to help bring this to a broader audience.
Interviewer,"Know, I think I'm not even the youngest already."
Vitalik,Like are you hiding from Younus lobbies even younger than I am.
Interviewer,"And that, you know, the U.S."
Vitalik,Treasury has more funds in Indonesia and the U.S.
Interviewer,Treasury.
Vitalik,"So, you know, this revolution is fast, man."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"When I was first starting out my first company, I remember I was twenty five and CEO and company was valued highly."
Interviewer,"And the CEO of the company, he was in his mid thirties, he said, he said so you're used to being the smartest young guy in the room."
Vitalik,Right.
Interviewer,Just wait till you get old.
Vitalik,And here we are.
Interviewer,Yes.
Vitalik,"Thank you, gentlemen."
Interviewer,Thank you.
Vitalik,"Oh hey guys, this is Tim again."
Interviewer,Just a few more things before you take off.
Vitalik,"Number one, this is five bullet Friday."
Interviewer,Do you want to get a short email from me? And would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little morsel of fun before the weekend and five? Black Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering over the week that could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.
Vitalik,It could include gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up into the world of the esoteric as I do.
Interviewer,"It could include favorite articles that I have read and that I've shared with my close friends, for instance."
Vitalik,And it's very short.
Interviewer,It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.
Vitalik,"So if you want to receive that, check it out."
Interviewer,Just go to four hour work week dotcom.
Vitalik,That's four hour work week dot com all spelled out.
Interviewer,And just drop in your email and you will get the very next word.
Vitalik,"And if you sign up, I hope you enjoyed this episode is brought to you by p p q you e in their brand new supplement, Daily Immune Vitamin C optimized for absorption, Americans are arguably famous for having the world's most expensive Europe."
Interviewer,So are you absorbing your vitamin C or just peeing it out? Studies have shown that you might absorb less than 50 percent of vitamin C when you consume amounts over 1000 milligrams.
Vitalik,Also a gram.
Interviewer,"I think Peak's daily immune is maximized for absorption with liposomal encapsulation technology like bazooms helped deliver vitamin C to exactly where you need it if your cells, not just your bladder."
Vitalik,"And I've been using their packets now for a few weeks and gone through a number of boxes and I typically take one to two per day, as I would say, maintenance support dose."
Interviewer,And I'll take more than that if I feel any type of cold coming on or any symptoms there of peaks.
Vitalik,Unique formula supports healthy immune system and immune features.
Interviewer,A Bufford non acid form of vitamin C this gentle on your stomach.
Vitalik,It is a powerful and absorbing vitamin C that fits in your pocket from tastes great.
Interviewer,So I will often take a handful.
Vitalik,These just stick them in a jeans pocket for the day and then every few hours open up a packet.
Interviewer,"Plus it contains just seven ingredients, no preservatives, fine sugar or additives."
Vitalik,All you need to do is open and squeeze it into your mouth.
Interviewer,No glass of water or food to eat it.
Vitalik,"Personally, I like to have a small chaser of water for carbonated water, but you don't need it."
Interviewer,You can do it on the line.
Vitalik,It's so easy and tastes so good.
Interviewer,Think black is European elderberries.
Vitalik,That is any flavor I've been consuming.
Interviewer,You might choose to take it once or twice a day or more as I do.
Vitalik,There's a reason Peake's products have more than fifteen thousand five star reviews.
Interviewer,People are very happy with their products.
Vitalik,Try it for yourself.
Interviewer,Risk free with their thirty day satisfaction guarantee you either love it.
Vitalik,Or you get your money back to go to t dot com.
Interviewer,"Tim, that's pick, you eat a dot com tim and use code Tim Jim check to get five percent off of your first quarter plus free shipping when you purchase a bundle."
Vitalik,That's peak T one more time Kikue you eat tda dot com slash tim he's kotin for five percent off plus free shipping for about.
Interviewer,"This episode is brought to you by, but I have to their guns and they are worth their weight in gold."
Vitalik,I've been using them every single day.
Interviewer,"Whether you're an elite athlete or just a regular person trying to get through your day, muscle pain and muscle tension are real things."
Vitalik,That's why I use the Thoroughgood.
Interviewer,I use it at night.
Vitalik,I use it after workouts.
Interviewer,It is a handheld percussive therapy device that releases your deepest muscle tension.
Vitalik,"So, for instance, at night I might use it on the bottom of my feet."
Interviewer,It's helped with my plantar fasciitis.
Vitalik,I will have my girlfriend use it up and down the middle of my back and I'll use it on her.
Interviewer,It's an easy way for us to actually trade massages in effect.
Vitalik,"And you can think of it, in fact, as massage reinvented on some level, helps with performance, helps with recovery, helps with just getting your back to feel better before bed, after you've been sitting for way too many hours."
Interviewer,I love this.
Vitalik,And the all new Gen Fourth Ergun has a proprietary brushless motor that is surprisingly quiet.
Interviewer,It's easy to use and about as quiet as an electric toothbrush.
Vitalik,It's pretty astonishing.
Interviewer,"And you really have to feel that their guns signature power, amplitude and effectiveness to believe it."
Vitalik,"It's one of my favorite gadgets in my house at this point, so I encourage you to check it out."
Interviewer,Try there again.
Vitalik,That's Sarah t h e r ague and try third on risk free for 30 days.
Interviewer,There's no substitute for the Gen 4th Ergun with an old screen.
Vitalik,That's OLED.
Interviewer,"For those wondering that's organic light emitting, diode screen personalized, they're going to have an incredible combination of quiet and power."
Vitalik,"So go to therapy dotcom Tim right now and get your gen fourth Ergun today, or you can watch the videos on the site and show you all sorts of different ways to use it."
Interviewer,A lot of runner friends of mine use them on their I.T.
Vitalik,bands after long runs.
Interviewer,There are a million ways to use it.
Vitalik,And the Gen 4th Dragons start at just one hundred and ninety nine dollars.
Interviewer,"I said I have two, I have the Prime and I also have the pro, which is like the super Cadillac version."
Vitalik,My girlfriend loves these soft attachments on that.
Interviewer,So check it out.
Vitalik,"No, I couldn't imagine it. The Ethereum community has grown very quickly. When I started the project in 2013, I imagined I would dedicate a year or two to it before going back to university. But Ethereum has become a very big project. I remember the first Devcon in Berlin in 2014, where there were only about 50 of us."
Interviewer,These events are an excellent opportunity to meet the teams of the projects which make Ethereum. What is your involvement with them?
Vitalik,"I talk with many teams, especially those who are attending this conference "
Interviewer,You took the stage at the EthCC to push for a new dynamic for Ethereum in the coming months. On which themes should the ecosystem focus?
Vitalik,"I think it's time to go beyond financial applications. There are many DeFi projects on Ethereum, but we can also move forward on other projects"
Interviewer,"This Thursday, August 5, gives the start of the EIP-1559. How do you feel about its implementation?"
Vitalik,I am very optimistic. It's a project we've been working on for 4 years with a large team. It's a very important thing for the ecosystem.
Interviewer,How do you answer the critics of Ethereum who accuse it of being too centralized today? Could this centralization be dangerous in a world where Ethereum 2.0 will become the standard?
Vitalik,"I don't think this is a major issue if the nodes are used by the users themselves. But it could become a problem if a lot of validators use Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. We have thought about this issue; if a validator is the only one to have a problem, it will lose few ethers. But if that validator has a problem at the same time as many others, they will lose more ethers."
Interviewer,"Welcome to Rationally Speaking, the podcast where we explore the borderlands between reason and nonsense. I'm your host, Julia Galef, and today's guest is Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, an open source blockchain platform, and its corresponding currency Ether, which is the second biggest cryptocurrency in the world after Bitcoin. Vitalik came up with Ethereum eight years ago, when he was 19, and the year before that he co-founded Bitcoin Magazine, the oldest publication devoted to cryptocurrencies. But the reason I started following Vitalik a few years ago, and reading his blog is because he's also a really sharp and insightful thinker about politics, economics, rationality, how to improve the world. And even though I'm not that into crypto myself, I came to really enjoy reading Vitalik's public communications as a leader of Ethereum because as we talk about in our conversation I find his leadership style refreshingly nuanced and intellectually honest. So that is one of a wide range of things we talk about in this episode and I hope you enjoy it! Here is my conversation with Vitalik Buterin."
Vitalik,"Sure. This last election, I've been following the prediction markets pretty closely, since around the start of September or so. And even before that, on and off, but from September really intently. And the thing that immediately struck me is just this divergence between the percent chance that Trump will win, according to basically all of the smart people that I follow on the Internet and on Twitter, versus the number that the prediction markets gave me. And I had some different kind of ideas in my head about what that difference could be. It could be the prediction markets being wrong. It could be the experts being wrong. It could be people just underestimating a 20% probability that Trump kind of wins the election, but does so using some completely unfair trick, involving the Supreme Court or whatever. So this was a big mystery for me at the beginning, and I had all these different theories. But then my surprise really increased drastically after the actual election. After the election, within a couple of days the mainstream media outlets declared Biden to be the winner. Some foreign governments started congratulating him. But on the markets, the price that Biden would win was still only about 85 cents. So about an 85% chance that Biden would win and the 15% was not ""other."" The 15% was explicitly Trump."
Interviewer,"Right, right, and it also didn't budge very much in response to things."
Vitalik,"Yep, exactly. I think the 15% chance did seem maybe kind of reasonable for about the first week or so. But then Trump made a challenge; the challenge got rejected. Trump made another challenge; the challenge got rejected. And there were just all of these rejections, all of these smoking guns that people on the side optimistic about Trump kept predicting, that just never ended up actually happening. And eventually got rejected by the Supreme Court. And just after weeks of this, the price just, it stayed at 15 cents. And you know, what the heck is going on here? So yeah, this was of course when I started really taking the plunge, and basically just looking at this as an opportunity to kind of test out the prediction markets and to try kind of betting against Trump myself."
Interviewer,"And could you actually take a step back for a moment and explain why it would be surprising if prediction markets were just really bad at giving the right answer? Like, really systematically biased in one direction. Why would that be surprising?"
Vitalik,"The usual argument here is basically like:If the price is wrong, then anyone who thinks the price is wrong could come in and profitably participate. If you think the chance that Trump is going to win is, say, like 40%, but the market says it's 60%, then you can go in and you can basically buy tokens that, from your point of view, give you a 60% chance of getting a dollar at a price of 0.4 which is a very good deal. So the surprise just comes in the form that you have people who are clearly certain that the chance that Biden is going to win is really high, so why aren't they taking this offer?"
Interviewer,"Right. And what was your conclusion, after placing some bets yourself and looking into it?"
Vitalik,"Placing the bets on the markets definitely turned out to be tricky in a bunch of subtle ways. So, people have already talked about this in response to some of the more traditional kind of non-crypto prediction markets, in terms of PredictIt and things like that. But there were very specific explanations that had to do with very specific details of PredictIt. For example, people criticize the $850 per person limit a lot. Because the theory would be if there is someone who is very smart, is an expert at predicting, and has the right idea of the probability, and they want to make some money on the markets well, they could, but they'd only be able to put in 850 dollars. And so they would have a very hard time kind of counteracting all of these overoptimistic voices that were betting in his favor. But crypto markets don't."
Interviewer,"About PredictIt in particular, was there also a limit on how many people could bet on a particular question, or was it just a limit on how much money each particular person could bet?"
Vitalik,"I don't recall seeing a limit on how many people could bet. I remember there was a per-person limit, and I also remember some of the markets had very high fees. If there's a withdrawal fee of 5%, there's no way at all to profitably push a price above 95 cents for anything."
Interviewer,"Right, so all of these artificial constraints which I think are legal in nature, right? Like the US has laws saying you have to limit... yeah, so all these artificial constraints limit the extent to which, I guess, the smart money can come in and correct the dumb money. To put it plainly, yeah."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"You were about to say, the crypto markets, though, don't have these legal constraints."
Vitalik,"Right. The crypto markets, the fees are low. Anyone can come in, anyone can participate, anyone can bet as much as they want. So the fact that the prices even on the crypto markets were so far off from what the actual probability seems to be, that was surprising."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Vitalik,"Yeah, like if there was some market inefficiency that was specific to PredictIt, and some of these more legal constraints, they should not appear on Augur and Omen and so forth. But they did, and the prices were the same. This is where some of my own adventures came into play and really helped to sort of flesh out my own picture of what was going on. I ended up actually putting about $300,000 into buying No Trump tokens, and I bought them at an average price of around 85 cents."
Interviewer,"They pay out for a dollar if Trump lost, and you paid 85 cents to buy them. So it's a return of 15 cents, if."
Vitalik,"Exactly. And it seemed like a very good deal, right? But then in the process of buying, and in the process of holding these tokens for a couple of months, I did come to realize what were some of the reasons why not many other people were following me through the same process. One of them for example is just capital constraints, right? In order for me to win 50,000 dollars, I had to put in 300,000 dollars. And in order for someone on the Trump side to cancel me out, they only had to put in 50,000 dollars. Just putting money into things is not free, because putting money into things has opportunity costs."
Interviewer,"It's kind of an asymmetry against the people who are betting on the common wisdom, essentially. Because to make a profit because the odds are already in your favor, if you think they're not in your favor enough, you have to put in a lot of money to get a return on that. Compared to the people who are betting against the common wisdom."
Vitalik,Yep.
Interviewer,"Do you think that that is... Maybe I'm getting ahead of ourselves a bit, but do you think that is the main explanation for why prediction markets have seemed to be so reliably tilted in Trump's favor? Or is it something about, like... I could imagine other explanations. Like, maybe the Trump fans are just especially motivated to bet on him as a way to show support, or something like that."
Vitalik,"I feel like it's a couple of different effects coming together at the same time. First of all, the Trump fans were definitely motivated."
Interviewer,When was this? Was this during the primaries or was it after he was already eliminated?
Vitalik,"No, fortunately, it was not after he was eliminated. It was still during the primaries."
Interviewer,"So I can cling to some shreds of hope in prediction markets, then!"
Vitalik,"Right, exactly."
Interviewer,Is that a sufficient explanation for what we saw?
Vitalik,"I think so, yeah. It's a combination of capital constraints and just technical difficulty. Because, the other thing I talked about in my post is how within the crypto ecosystem I didn't have any dollars, I only had ETH. And I wanted to keep my ETH because I didn't want to miss out on the possibility of the price of ETH going up. And so I had to go into another contraption that locked up my ETH into a contract and let me borrow some DAI, which are crypto dollars, and then convert them, and then convert them back. And so there was this long kind of chain of gadgets that I had to walk through. And the ability to walk through those gadgets and do it all correctly is definitely just technically not in a lot of people's reach So I feel like, yeah, the capital issues and just the technical difficulties kind of compounded each other."
Interviewer,"I guess I'm wondering what you think is the right solution going forward, given that there are these sort of fundamental frictions involved in prediction markets that hinder their accuracy."
Vitalik,"I feel like we should just continue with all the experiments. I think Metaculus is great. I think the crypto prediction markets are great. I have a feeling that some of these systems are just naturally going to get better on their own over time. One other issue I think is just that people have this aversion to doing weird, new things. And especially weird, new things that require them to stick a whole bunch of money in. And so, as prediction markets become less weird and new, more people from the outside will be willing to participate. Existing participants who have a history of being accurate would have a larger share of the pool in the future rounds, and the system would kind of warm and get better over time."
Interviewer,"I guess it seemed in your post like you were maybe conflating these kinds of psychological features of the human brain where we just don't do things that are knowably good for our goals... like, we procrastinate, or we don't do even basic research on the average salary in the career we're going into, before we embark on that career path. Things like that. There's plenty of examples, in my opinion, of humans just not being very strategic...."
Vitalik,"No, that's a really good point, actually. There is definitely a difference between just seeing that the way the mainstream world does things, and the way that your own direct, explicit thinking leads you are different, and then just admitting that, yeah, your thinking is probably wrong... versus thinking that your thinking is probably right, but still not doing anything about it."
Interviewer,"Right, exactly."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no, that's ... yeah, I agree. I definitely did not make that distinction and I probably should have. If I had to guess now which one of those that would be, I would probably say some of both."
Interviewer,"You know, this question of the efficient market hypothesis and how much to rely on it what it reminds me of is a debate in the rationalist community a couple years ago about whether we as a community should have been better at recognizing early on that bitcoin was worth investing in."
Vitalik,"It's actually kind of funny that you bring up rationalism, because I remember even on 2014 there was this thread on, I think, LessWrong, where I just made a post... I think if you dig hard enough you can find this, where I just said, Hey guys, bitcoin has at least a five percent chance of taking over a significant portion of gold market share, and so therefore its expected value is somewhere in the tens of thousands of dollars, and right now it's a few hundred, so this is why ...."
Interviewer,"I did not know you posted that! I knew Gwern did, and maybe someone else. I didn't know that you were on there."
Vitalik,"I'm not going to derail our time and look for that post right now, but I'll look for it after."
Interviewer,"I'll find it and link to it, yeah. So you do think, I guess then, that this was a knowably... that this was a case which a reasonable outsider should've been able to tell was an exception to the efficient market hypothesis?"
Vitalik,"I would say so. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are very interesting, because buying bitcoin in the 2010s is like buying Google shares in 1998, except all along throughout the entire decade you have people telling you that ""Buying bitcoin right now is like buying Google shares in 1998.""."
Interviewer,"But like, you still have to be able to say why this is actually a case where buying bitcoin is like buying Google shares in 1998...."
Vitalik,"Right, exactly."
Interviewer,"... as opposed to all the other cases where someone is claiming, Oh, you should buy this penny stock or whatever, it's like buying Google in 1998. How is an outsider supposed to know that this is a case where it's actually true?"
Vitalik,"Right. I think the argument that I made, either in my post or just around that time, was just like:If you just examine the class of new and interesting things that are arising, then there's a fairly small number of members, and cryptocurrency was one of them. And in terms of just market share of interestingness, or kind of potential future importance, it felt like cryptocurrency was already at a couple of percent, but its market share in terms of monetary value was like 0.00-something percent."
Interviewer,"Wait, what's the unit here, of interestingness?"
Vitalik,I don't know how to define this....
Interviewer,"Okay, you're just saying the comparison of scale it's an order of magnitude more interesting than it is valued, yeah."
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Okay, and you don't think... Yeah. I guess I feel like ""interesting"" is doing a lot of work here."
Vitalik,"I agree. I remember when I made this argument, I think it was on the LessWrong thread, there were people accusing me of playing reference class tennis."
Interviewer,"Yeah, so do you think that interestingness is... Let's say, take someone who doesn't have your particular taste for interestingness; is there an outside-view kind of way they could get to the same endpoint? Like, by saying, If such-and-such kinds of people find this thing interesting, then that should be a really good sign? That it's not necessarily guaranteed, or anywhere close to it, but it's risen above the threshold of worth investing a little bit of money in, or something?"
Vitalik,"I think I was thinking of the class of things that tech people are excited about, in general."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, are there any other things in that class? I'm just trying to think of other examples to test this out."
Vitalik,"Right. What was there? There's artificial intelligence, virtual reality... what other things would people get excited about? Selfdriving cars, that's a part of artificial intelligence. Yeah, it felt like, I."
Interviewer,"So it is a mixed bag in terms of how... well, it seems like a mixed bag anyway, in terms of how well they pay out."
Vitalik,I agree.
Interviewer,"But which is fine. Like if you choose over the course of your life 100 things to invest a little money in, and two of those things become big, then as a whole that set of investment decisions seems pretty great. So maybe it's fine that it's as mixed as it is."
Vitalik,Hmm.
Interviewer,"Also, to be clear, I should say there are two separate criticisms you could make, or that were made, of people in the rationalist community who had heard of bitcoin and failed to invest in it. There's the epistemic criticism and there's the instrumental criticism. We've been talking about the epistemic criticism, of people who thought it wasn't worth investing in and therefore didn't invest."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no, I think that's fair. And yeah, I mean, all of these events definitely convinced me that the world loses a lot just because there's so many people that aren't willing to just take that final leap from, ""The math says that it makes sense"" to actually internalizing that and doing something out of it."
Interviewer,"Let's talk about another one of your recent blog posts. This was on concave versus convex dispositions, which... I'm a sucker for classification systems that point out some underappreciated axis along which people vary. And even more so if that axis is about differences in people's thinking style, or world view, so I'm excited to talk about this. Could you just briefly explain what is the concave versus convex distinction?"
Vitalik,"Sure. The distinction is basically that if there's a trade off between option A and option B where option A has some advantages and option B has other advantages, basically how do you view the idea of going to either one of those extremes, versus the idea of doing something in the middle?"
Interviewer,"And that could be defined in a bunch of different ways, right? Like the nutrition value of your diet, or the animal welfare benefits of your diet."
Vitalik,"Or how much you enjoy it. All of it, you know. Yeah, and so the two shapes that that graph could have one is this kind of U-shape, where it's kind of better on the edges and worse in the middle. Now, it could still be much better on one edge versus the other edge, but you know, the middle is just not a good path to take regardless. And in math we call those convex functions, right? For example, y = x^2 is a convex function. It's sloping upwards. And then the other shape the graph could take is the lowercase-N shape, right? And this is what we call concave. The square root would be a concave function. And so the general mathematical way of thinking about this is if you have A and B, and you had to choose between a compromise between A and B or a coin flip between A and B, would you take the compromise or the coin flip?"
Interviewer,"Oh, I actually didn't realize I think I thought you were saying that the convex person has a strong preference for A over B, and so they wouldn't necessarily go for the coin flip, they would... ok, go on."
Vitalik,"Yeah. Like, basically, the convex world... it is a very kind of second order thing. Actually, it reminds me a bit of that hilariously funny post from Slate Star Codex, In the balance, where he just goes through that kind of series of gods... where you start with order versus chaos, and then do you pick the extremes or do you pick the middle? And then you kind of go down the hierarchy from there. This is very second level. It's, Do you take the edges or do you take the middle? And yeah, I go through some examples of things that people with a more concave mindset would say, things that people with a more convex mindset would say, even kind of institutional arrangements that are more concave or more convex. Some situations where being more concave or more convex makes sense."
Interviewer,"Could you give an example of a time when the convex approach seems to be the best? That might be... Well, maybe it's my concave bias talking, but I was going to say that that might be less intuitive to everyone."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no, it's a good point, and I did give a couple of examples in the post. One example I gave is just going to war, because when you're in a war, generally, you either want to concentrate your soldiers and invade on location A, or you want to concentrate your soldiers and invade at location B, right? And if you just do both at the same time, then, well, your opponent is going to go off on one side, pick off your soldiers there, then go off on the other side, pick off your soldiers there, and you lose."
Interviewer,"Got it, so it's sort of situations where you fully commit to one thing rather than halfheartedly committing to a bunch of things."
Vitalik,Right. And even the fact that you are fully committed to one thing is perhaps even more important than which thing you commit to.
Interviewer,"As someone who took only two thirds of her course of antibiotics for strep throat, at one point in college, I can attest to the value of the 100% or nothing approach."
Vitalik,"Yes, indeed. Yeah, no, so the other kind of, like the one piece of political commentary I gave there is that a lot of the political regimes that did not fare too well with the coronavirus, at least during the first year, were regimes that were kind of designed around compromise and designed around making decisions that don't kind of go against the wishes of either side too badly. And you know, I also definitely have the kind of concave bias and so I definitely think that that kind of thing is generally a really good thing to have but in the case of the virus, it wasn't."
Interviewer,"You know, one thing I was going to ask you about the convex versus concave distinction which I now think is probably the wrong question, but I was going to ask whether this is just kind of a subset of nuanced thinkers versus black and white thinkers. But that was the question that formed in my mind when I still thought that convex thinkers were the people who were like, ""100% this view is the right view,"" or ""100% this policy is the right policy,"" and no compromise is acceptable. That's my sort of archetype in my mind of a black and white thinker. But actually, the thing you're describing, of someone who says, Whichever one we do, let's fully commit to it, and I'm less particular about which one it is than that we fully commit to one thing... I guess I'm less confident that that is an archetype. Is that a type of person you are familiar with?"
Vitalik,You're definitely right that that's not as much of an archetype.
Interviewer,"It can still be a way of thinking, though."
Vitalik,"Right, exactly. I think that in practice, especially the convex people that I'm criticizing, they tend to be people who do also have an idea about whether option A or option B is better, and they have a strong idea of whether option A or option B is better, and so in their mind it's basically pure option B and everything except for that is irredeemable. Whereas if you take a concave person, even if they have a very, very strong view about, say, option B being better than option A, they'll be willing to consider 90% or 95% solutions. Yeah."
Interviewer,"You mentioned in your post that you see the Ethereum community as being more concave, and the bitcoin community as thinking in a more convex way. Why do you think that is? Is it something intrinsic to Ethereum versus bitcoin? Or is it more about the personalities of the founding leaders, or what?"
Vitalik,"There's definitely psychological things that are attractive about, say, bitcoin, intrinsically, to certain kinds of people. I think bitcoin is institutionally convex in some ways. On the block size debate, it took the very, very left side of, We should minimize block size in order to maximize the ability to read the chain. And if it takes like $500 to write through the chain as a consequence, we just have to live with that, and everyone can just use some kind of second layer system."
Interviewer,"Oh, interesting."
Vitalik,"Yeah, like even in 2014, the aspects of bitcoin culture that were kind of extreme in that direction, they already existed. And I do feel like it could just have been in part my personality, and in part there were a lot of people who were kind of floating around crypto at the time that were ready to hear the message, but that wanted something that's more moderate."
Interviewer,More nuanced?
Vitalik,Yeah.
Interviewer,"I know I've said this to you before, but I really do admire how as a leader you hold yourself to an unusually high standard of nuance, and just intellectual honesty in general. You talk about your different levels of uncertainty in things. You don't pretend that your chosen policies have no trade-offs. You talk about things you think you were wrong about, and so on. And this is very different from what most leaders do, not just in the crypto space, but in general."
Vitalik,"I think part of it is definitely that, in addition to a crypto person."
Interviewer,"And how does the intellectual honesty tie into that goal, the kind of higher vision that isn't just about profit?"
Vitalik,I think part of it is a matter of what kinds of people you attract.
Interviewer,"And have there been downsides as well to the intellectually honest approach? I know I've seen some media outlets seize onto times you've said, Well, I'm less than 100% confident on such and such, and the headline will be like, Vitalik admits he has no confidence in Ethereum, or whatever."
Vitalik,This definitely happens.
Interviewer,"Well, so, A, how big of a deal is that? Is it just an annoyance that you roll your eyes at, or is it actually a serious downside that just doesn't fully outweigh all the benefits and the personal conviction reasons for sticking to intellectual honesty? Yeah, I guess question A is how big of a deal are downsides like that, and question B is are there any other downsides? Do you feel like it makes you a less effective leader in any ways?"
Vitalik,"No, I think those downsides definitely exist. For someone who wants to write a hit piece on the Ethereum community, there's plenty of things to quote mine. But on the other hand, despite the easy ability to write a hit piece on the Ethereum community, not many people have done it."
Interviewer,"It's true, yeah."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no, I feel like there's subtle things about having a kind of friendly approach that do rub off on people."
Interviewer,"Yeah. I've also trawled through some of the comment threads on Reddit or Twitter when you've said something, like, cautioned people at the peak of crypto mania in what was it, 2016? 2017?"
Vitalik,2017.
Interviewer,"2017, yeah, like when you cautioned people, Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's still very volatile. It's still overvalued. Here's why we shouldn't consider ourselves to have won... There have been a number of threads like that, where you've said something quite nuanced, or sort of cautioning against hype or against cheerleading."
Vitalik,"I think that's definitely true in a lot of communities. One thing that is hard sometimes is cultural translation. Things that I say get translated into Chinese, for example, and when things get translated into Chinese they can easily lose nuance."
Interviewer,Oh. Any examples come to mind?
Vitalik,"Trying to think... There was definitely that one time that I said something like, It is possible that the 2017 bubble was the last really huge one, and this got into the various Chinese chat groups."
Interviewer,"Yeah, live and learn."
Vitalik,"Yeah, exactly."
Interviewer,"One thing I've been curious about, as you know, because I've mentioned this to you before, is this disagreement over whether being intellectually honest expressing uncertainty, being nuanced, and so on whether that has downsides in terms of whether people look up to you, and trust you, and consider you a strong leader."
Vitalik,"There's definitely people who want to kind of feel hope and who react negatively to messages that go against that, even in the short term. I think a big part of it actually is this kind of short-term versus long-term thing. It's very easy to make a message that riles people up, and makes people happy for short periods of time, but then you end up having to pay for it over the next year or so."
Interviewer,"Yeah. That absolutely rings true to me and matches a bunch of other data I've seen. And also I have another theory about what's going on here with this disagreement, and I want to run it by you and see what you think."
Vitalik,I could see something like that being true....
Interviewer,"Like, yeah, I was just going to say for example, Jeff Bezos and."
Vitalik,"Yeah, no, well, Elon actually even went even further. At one point, he literally said he thought the Tesla stock price is too high."
Interviewer,"Actually, Elon is a great example, because someone I forget who it was, it was someone who had worked with Elon who said about Elon, this was a quote that got spread around a lot, it was something like, What makes Elon such a success is that he literally cannot conceive of failing. And Elon has explicitly said the opposite of this many times! Like, he said that he expected the most likely outcome for both Tesla and SpaceX was failure. He just thought that it was high expected value, and so it was worth a shot. He says this explicitly, but it doesn't stick in people's mind, because he's just socially a very confident person. Or, ""socially"" is not quite the right word for it, but in his actions and the risks that he takes, and what he goes out and does, and just his self-assurance that he knows what he's doing. It's very clear that's what sticks."
Vitalik,He gives the impression of just being a leader that it feels good to get behind.
Interviewer,"Right, right, and so then they parse that as, He is 100% confident that he's going to succeed, which is not actually true."
Vitalik,"Right. Like, I think saying that you're 100% confident is definitely one way of getting that effect, but there's definitely other ways of getting that effect. There's aspects of your personality that you can kind of show. There's even countersignaling. This is one of the kind of fun things that I do on Twitter sometimes."
Interviewer,"I think the phrase, an alpha move, as the cool people say, is another good example of countersignaling."
Vitalik,Yes.
Interviewer,"You know, relatedly, I think it's worth pointing out that expressing uncertainty does not always mean you express low confidence in everything, which I think is a common misconception. You can be perfectly calibrated and still sometimes express very high confidence. You just want to be, really, pretty sure you're right in those cases."
Vitalik,"Yeah, Eliezer talks about this a lot, right? He says if the ... what was the statement? It was something like, If the risk is small, the way opposes your fear. If the risk is great, the way opposes your calm. Something like that. Like, you know, there's nothing inherently virtuous about being unconfident and there's nothing inherently virtuous about being confident. Calibration, is all about being the right one in the right circumstance."
Interviewer,"Right. By the way, do you understand why it wasn't as obvious to some other people that Craig Wright was lying about being Satoshi? Like, Gavin Andresen, was it?"
Vitalik,Mm-hmm.
Interviewer,"Yeah, Gavin Andresen, the guy who vouched for Craig Wright. Do you understand why he disagreed with you, and why the things that were obvious to you about the flaws in Craig Wright's case, why were those not obvious to him?"
Vitalik,"My understanding of the backstory is that Craig actually reached out to Gavin in person and did some trick in person where he showed that he could verify the signature. And of course in reality that's an incredibly insecure way of convincing yourself of having some identity. Because there's just so many ways that you can hack into a laptop when you have physical control over it, basically, and so."
Interviewer,"But like, presumably Gavin knew that?"
Vitalik,"Right, he knew that. So I think part of it is still just a big question mark. Part of it, in terms of just the broader community, is that I interpret."
Interviewer,"Was this like his, Build a wall?"
Vitalik,"Yes, exactly. It's like the equivalent of Hillary Clinton is Satan, and Barack Obama, clearly something's wrong with his birth certificate, and so on and so forth. Except the equivalence of that in this segment of cyber land."
Interviewer,"So your take is that there was some amount of wishful thinking or motivated reasoning in... Like ""He has to be trustworthy, because if he wasn't, then these things that he said that I really want to be true would then be undermined.""."
Vitalik,"I think here, I might have to be the one to distinguish between the epistemic side and the irrational side. Part of it might be that Craig Wright seems more trustworthy, and I think part of it is more like, ""I don't really care whether or not Craig Wright is Satoshi, I just care that he is saying the things I like and that he's hurting the people I hate.""."
Interviewer,"Ah, I see, I like that parallel. Interesting. Switching gears, maybe now is a good time to segue into talking about effective altruism. I'm curious about your take on some of the main objections... Well, let me back up:Your approach to improving the world seems to overlap quite a bit with the effective altruist approach. You've talked about donating to life extension research. I happen to know you've also donated to global poverty charities recommended by Give Well. And you donate to AI safety organizations, right?"
Vitalik,"I have, yeah, I gave over $1 million to MIRI."
Interviewer,"Oh yeah. Anything else on your list of main cause areas to which you donate, that I'm missing?"
Vitalik,"I think those are the top three. Global poverty and anti-disease stuff is one, life extension is the second, and existential risk is the third."
Interviewer,"Great. I just want to throw a few objections at you, and see what you think."
Vitalik,"I think my critique of those kinds of arguments is that once you get to things that are very causally distant, like if you have no reason to expect the second or third order effects to be negative instead of positive, then it's probably better to just act like they don't exist. It is possible that if you give someone money, then it'll reduce the motivation that they have, and it'll drive them away from doing some other thing that could've really helped their community. But it's also possible that if you give someone money, then they'll be."
Interviewer,"I guess the cluelessness objection has more force if you were never that enthusiastic about effective altruism or trying to help the world in the first place, and it was sort of... you were choosing between trying to be an effective altruist, or just doing whatever else you wanted to do anyway, that benefits you or other things in the short term."
Vitalik,I think that's a good way to summarize it.
Interviewer,"Cool. You mentioned Glen Weyl earlier; he's been pretty critical of the whole effective altruist, rationalist cluster, both the people and also the ideas. And I'm curious for your take on his critiques."
Vitalik,"Yeah. And I think first of all, I think there's a lot of ways in which it overshoots the mark, even pretty much immediately."
Interviewer,"I think that's really well-put, and I hadn't framed the ideas in my head that way yet."
Vitalik,I think one counter-argument might be something like Facebook.
Interviewer,And we allow corporations. Yeah.
Vitalik,"Exactly, like there's lots of corporations. Like, basically at worst, effective altruism could increase the number of dangerous things in that class from, what, 40 to 41? But the best case is if we can reduce the possibility humanity blows up entirely in the next century from 10% to 8%. And that just massively outweighs it."
Interviewer,"You did a great job giving each argument and the counter-argument to that argument by yourself. I don't know, I'm probably not as good at steel manning that argument as I should be, just because... I don't know. I get frustrated sometimes in these conversations, when it feels almost... not disingenuous, but it feels like... if people had any particular examples to point to, of effective altruism causing harm, or the EA kind of approach to improving the world causing harm, then I'd be much more sympathetic to the concerns. But it often feels just a bit like something pulled out of the air to object to us. But I would say that, wouldn't I? I don't know."
Vitalik,"I think one criticism of EA that I have heard and I will just say right off the bat that even when I mentioned this to Robert Wiblin, he replied, Well, actually there's lots of EAs that are taking this seriously and trying to improve the EA movement is that EA tends to focus on improving the world by throwing money at things. But a lot of the most effective ways to improve the world don't necessarily come from philanthropists throwing money at things, they come from institutional change. One of example of this is, you could have myself and hundreds of people like myself be convinced to throw half our money into life extension research, or we could just talk to a couple of people in DARPA and the Senate and Congress and possibly some EU bodies, possibly some Chinese bodies, and just get $50 billion of government funding at the problem. Wouldn't the second approach be much more efficient than the first? On the other hand though, I think just to go back to this, to make the argument."
Interviewer,"You don't even need me here at all, you can just do both sides of the conversation! No, it's great, go on."
Vitalik,"The way that I would counter-argue is that I think if rationalists were trying to dip their toes in and change policy, and have DARPA direct $30 billion to things that they consider important, the amount of hate that they get would just be ten times bigger."
Interviewer,"That is another reason I kind of grit my teeth at this objection, is that it feels like we're being put in a bind sometimes, with objections that fully fill the space of possible things we could do."
Vitalik,"Yeah, it's like ""Rationalists aren't trying to think about the importance of changing the world through better social structure enough,"" and then ""Wait, there are rationalists and they are in institutions that are important to social structure, and they're socially adjacent to some terrible people!""."
Interviewer,"I feel validated. I wanted to ask you about life extension in particular. So, there's two common objections I hear to radical life extension, which I'm sure you've heard as well, and I'm just curious how you react to them. The first is that if people start living to be hundreds of years old, then the Earth will be overpopulated, and that's bad."
Vitalik,"I think there are different levels at which you can respond to this. I think first of all, one really important thing to keep in mind is that there is often this bias where people just immediately go to worrying about subtle second order things, without even realizing the fact that the first order consequence is just really, really good, and it's so massive in importance that even if the all the second order stuff was as bad as it could possibly be, it would still not be bad enough."
Interviewer,Do you think that that bias is caused by just reflexive contrarianism? Is it caused by a desire to be clever?
Vitalik,"I think it's some of both. Also, I think humans have this bias where they care more about negative consequences that result from social structure than negative consequences that result in the world. Like, one example of a moral frame that just makes this really obvious is:."
Interviewer,"Well, I'll just add that I think for a lot of people making this kind of argument, they wouldn't actually agree that all these people dying is a terrible thing."
Vitalik,"The fascinating thing is how inconsistent our beliefs are about that. In hospitals, people often spend huge amounts of money and resources prolonging their own lives or their parents' lives even by a couple of weeks. Even in contexts where really that's not worth it, and all you're doing is just spending an amount of money that's worth years worth of vacations for the child, and instead you're giving it to just give the parent an extra four weeks of existence that's basically stuck to a hospital bed, and is not even very pleasant. You can't really take people's opinions at face value, because just depending on how you ask the question, you do get these wildly different answers. I think ultimately, people do love life, and once you move the problem from far mode to near mode, that just becomes really obvious. That's the first thing."
Interviewer,"I derailed you, yeah, go on."
Vitalik,"I did want to talk about social consequences, because I think it's an excellent example of, actually, going back to the conversation we had about effective altruism, and ""Might there be bad consequences if you give people more money?"" like, sure, if you have a lawyer and you give him an hour with the task of coming up with as many bad things as possible that could happen if you give money to poor villagers in Kenya, they'll come up with a lot of reasons. And their case might even look compelling to some people. But then if you come up with a lawyer and give them the task of, Let's generate positive second order consequences from giving money to people in Kenya, then their document is going to be even more impressive. I actually think that with aging, it's very similar. To give some examples"
Interviewer,"Illegible in the sense that they can't just write down what they know, and pass it on before they die?"
Vitalik,"Exactly, yeah. There's things that you can get by actually talking to someone who, say, lived through World War Two, for example, that you can't get just from reading a book about it. I think another example would be:social systems would be much easier without the need to worry about aging populations, with a smaller portion of the population just needing active support from the government. The political system would have fewer things that it needs to focus on, and that could allow it to a better job at the remaining things it does focus on. You could make a long list of these things. And I actually think, on the whole, a society with 800-year-olds to balance out the eightyear-olds and the 80-year-olds is going to be a good one."
Interviewer,"And do you worry at all about the overpopulation aspect, or is that part of what you were."
Vitalik,"Yes by yes, I mean sorry, I forgot the question. I don't mean I'm worried."
Interviewer,"Right, yeah."
Vitalik,"I don't think so, because I think humanity is great at improving the efficiency of its food production when it needs to. First of all, you have to remember that for the next century, humanity's main crisis is not overpopulation, it's underpopulation. The charts show that basically everyone except for Africa is going to see their populations go down by 2100. So if, thanks to life extension technology, instead of nine billion people, we have like 15 billion people in 2100, we can handle that. Then can we go from 15 billion people to even more billions of people? I think we can, and I feel like if we could solve a problem as difficult as fixing aging, then we can definitely find more efficient ways to feed and house everyone. If eventually we have to spread out to multiple planets, then we could do that, and that's great, that's lots of people's dream all along anyway."
Interviewer,"Cool. On that note, maybe I will finally let you go, since we've been talking for almost two hours. Vitalik, it's been such a pleasure talking to you! I'm so glad we finally got to connect and I got you to come on the show."
Vitalik,"Yeah, it's been great to finally chat, Julia."
Interviewer,"Hello. I'm here today with Vitalik Buterin, who is founder and chief scientist at Ethereum. I'd like to start with what I call the Vitalik Buterin production function that is, how you get things done."
Vitalik,"I guess it involves a combination of things. Some of it is reading what various economists on the internet say. Some of it is reading papers. Sometimes, if I want to dig into some topic more deeply, I end up reading books, like I read one on urban transportation economics a while back."
Interviewer,"If you think about economics what you've taught yourself what do you think of as the central ideas relevant for cryptoeconomics, which is a term I think you coined?"
Vitalik,"I would say that cryptoeconomics, first of all, is economics. It's not like we're inventing some completely different parallel society with a different parallel economy and different rules, but it is economics specialized to a particular set of circumstances. Then you have to ask yourself, ""Well, what describes those circumstances?"" There are a few major parts to that answer."
Interviewer,What's the contribution or understanding you wish economics could give you that it hasn't given you yet? What problem do you want it to solve for you?
Vitalik,"I think that once you start getting into the weeds, and you try to move beyond very simple things like proof of work, the simplest versions of proof of stake, and the tricks that we've known about since 2009 or 2013, then you get into this situation where you realize the kinds of problems that you run into when you try to incentivize behavior."
Interviewer,"If you had to explain blockchain to a very smart person from 40 years ago, who knew computers but had no idea of crypto, what would be the best short explanation you could give them, basically, for what you do?"
Vitalik,"Sure. One of the analogies I keep going back to is this idea of a ""world computer."" The idea, basically, is that a blockchain, as a whole, functions like a computer. It has a hard drive, and on that hard drive, it stores what all the accounts are."
Interviewer,"the guarantee that the computer will run in the way that you expect it to run, and that a few people can't make that guarantee fail by going out of business, getting hacked, dying, having their company go bankrupt, deciding to be evil one day, deciding they have some monopolistic interest to start acting differently one day, and all of those different issues."
Vitalik,"I did write that blog post a couple of months back, and I think this might be one of those things that you referred to, where I talk about this, and of signaling theory, equilibrium of cryptocurrency."
Interviewer,"Don't people trust ether and Ethereum in part because they trust you? In a sense, there's this Russian tradition of holy men who come along Dostoyevsky's Alyosha, Prince Myshkin like a non-evil Rasputin."
Vitalik,"I know people have different theories about the kind of influence that I myself have. I think part of it is that, at least I feel like, the innovation in the crypto space isn't just technological innovation or political innovation."
Interviewer,"If we think of Thomas Schelling's notion of a focal point, something that people coordinate upon and come to accept as somehow centrally important, doesn't that mean centralization always reemerges?"
Vitalik,"I wrote this blog post a couple of years ago where I talk about different kinds of decentralization. One I talk about is architectural decentralization, which is basically the difference between a system being based on one computer and, say, a system being based on lots of computers and being fault tolerant."
Interviewer,there's no one who really has the ability to practically regulate new words into and out of existence.
Vitalik,"No. Company is not necessarily the right emphasis, once again. It goes back to my point about cultural innovation. Ultimately, there are different circles in the Ethereum community, some overlapping, some not, and there's different ideas of what it means to be Ethereum."
Interviewer,"While building Ethereum, you've also taught yourself French, German, and Chinese without having lived in those countries. On YouTube, I've even seen you answering questions in Chinese about the blockchain to a Chinese audience. How did you teach yourself such good Chinese?"
Vitalik,"First of all, as I said on Reddit, I definitely did not learn Chinese, and especially not Cantonese, in three months on a mobile app. That's stuff that people come up with about me."
Interviewer,"My colleague Robin Hanson has promoted the idea of prediction markets, or betting on ideas. Why are there, right now, so few prediction markets? You can bet on the outcome of an election. There's plenty of sports betting, but they seem quite thin when it comes to actual economic events."
Vitalik,"I know that on the centralized side, the traditional prediction market side, there's a lot of regulatory issues that make it more difficult to set one up."
Interviewer,"As for frictionless trading, let's take what's called the Oracle problem. As you well know, you can have smart contracts on Ethereum, but those are closest to frictionless when everything is within the system."
Vitalik,"It depends what specific thing you're trying to do frictionlessly. For example, moving ether from one account to another is absolutely frictionless. Converting ether into fiat currency is absolutely not frictionless."
Interviewer,"But determining how or why someone should be paid, someone has to rule that, right?"
Vitalik,"Here's one example. There's a system called MakerDAO, which is basically a decentralized currency that has a more active monetary policy that attempts to keep its price as close as possible to one dollar."
Interviewer,"As Ethereum and perhaps other groups move from proof of work to proof of stake or some kind of intermediate weighted average solution, to what extent will this require more institutional trust in Ethereum or the other intermediaries, and will that be centralizing?"
Vitalik,"I would actually expect that, on net, it would require less institutional trust. Part of this is just because a lot of people don't realize the sheer level of centralization in proof of work already."
Interviewer,What's the biggest tech or engineering breakthrough you feel you need to realize the full vision that you started with?
Vitalik,"I think scalability is a huge one. Ethereum blockchain's capacity right now is about 15 transactions a second. If you even consider something like putting all of the Uber rides on the blockchain, that's 12 transactions per second already."
Interviewer,What change in the legal or regulatory environment would help the most to realize this vision?
Vitalik,"I don't really think that there are many legal or regulatory changes that can help, at least on the technological development side, because ultimately the US already has all of these code-is-free-speech precedents, and most other countries, even those without significant free speech protections, are still willing to follow along in principle."
Interviewer,What's the best theory out there for valuing a given crypto asset? It doesn't have to be ether. If there's a new crypto asset that comes along let's say it's cleared some minimum threshold of interest what theoretical apparatus from economics or elsewhere should we apply?
Vitalik,"I've thought about this a lot, and I'm still not sure what the best answer is because ultimately it depends a lot on the way the cryptocurrency goes."
Interviewer,"What do you think of the portfolio competition with gold theory? If you measure the total stock of gold out there, and then you conclude don't ask me how ""Well, people will want to shift 5 percent of that into crypto assets."" And you figure out the value of that."
Vitalik,"No, that's definitely something that I've considered as well, and that's part of what I mean when I talk about the store-of-value model."
Interviewer,"In most of these sessions, we have a segment in the middle called overrated versus underrated. Are you game for doing this? Feel free to pass."
Vitalik,Sure.
Interviewer,"Advertising, overrated or underrated?"
Vitalik,"I'm going to guess my answer to a lot of these is going to be roughly correctionally rated, but in a different way from how other people expect."
Interviewer,Travel as a method of learning?
Vitalik,Definitely I would say still underrated.
Interviewer,What's the thing one gets from travel that a lot of other people don't grasp?
Vitalik,"First of all, it depends what kind of travel. I think going to Beijing and seeing the Summer Palace, and then going to Tokyo and seeing some shrine and whatever, is basically useless because you don't really get more than you would get by going to Wikipedia."
Interviewer,What's your favorite part of China to visit?
Vitalik,"As far as cities go, I like Shanghai. I have mixed feelings about Shenzhen. There's definitely innovativeness, but then there's definitely also all of this ""Let's make 500 shopping malls"" culture."
Interviewer,"To me, it's boring Shenzhen. I prefer almost anywhere else in China."
Vitalik,"Right, right. Let's see. Beijing is kind of growing more on me over time, I guess."
Interviewer,"How about Zug, Switzerland? Forget about crypto, just as a city, underrated or overrated?"
Vitalik,"It depends for what purpose. For example, I used to spend a lot of time in Zug, but now I spend much less time. Part of that is that I do think it's overrated as a place to live."
Interviewer,The Disney Star Wars movies?
Vitalik,"The most recent one, Episode VIII, is underrated. I would say the thing that I liked about Episode VIII is that it seems to have a certain kind of realism that was lacking in some of the previous ones."
Interviewer,"If you could go back into the distant past for a year, a time and place of your choosing, you have the linguistic skills and immunity against disease to the extent you need it, maybe some money in your pocket, where would you pick to satisfy your own curiosity?"
Vitalik,"Where would I pick? To do what? To spend a year there, or . . . ?"
Interviewer,"Spend a year as a ""tourist."" You could pick ancient Athens or preconquest Mexico or medieval Russia. It's a kind of social science fiction, right?"
Vitalik,"Yeah, totally. Let's see. Possibly first year of World War II obviously, one of those areas that's close to it but still reasonably safe from it."
Interviewer,What kind of social delusion or irrationality do you think should be more prevalent?
Vitalik,"That's a very interesting one. In modern times, possibly a belief in progress."
Interviewer,"You think more people should believe in that, even though it may not be true?"
Vitalik,"Even though it's true in a complicated way. It's true sometimes in complicated ways, and parts of it are definitely false in a bunch of situations."
Interviewer,Is there a word in Russian you use when you think or talk that has no obvious English equivalent?
Vitalik,I don't think so.
Interviewer,So you pretty much think mainly in English at this point?
Vitalik,"I'd say so, yeah."
Interviewer,"The geography of tech innovation. So many things are crowded into San Francisco, Silicon Valley. Rents are very high. Crypto has not really been the same, but what do you think the geography of tech innovation will look like 20 or 30 years from now?"
Vitalik,"First of all, I think that it's definitely not possible for it to concentrate more just because the rents are too damn high. haha."
Interviewer,And you're from Europe.
Vitalik,"Yes, Russia, the eastern edge of Europe, sure."
Interviewer,"How will quantum computing matter, if at all, for crypto assets?"
Vitalik,"Oh, it absolutely matters because quantum computing will make a lot of cryptography that's used in modern times just not work any more. Digital signature algorithms won't work any more. Public key encryption won't work any more. Zero-knowledge proof SNARKs won't work any more."
Interviewer,Is P equal to NP?
Vitalik,"I would bet 90 percent, no."
Interviewer,That's my guess as well.
Vitalik,I definitely don't believe in the theory that says you can go back in time but somehow the forces of fate ensure that whatever you cause to happen ends up turning into whatever is the modern world. That just seems computation theoretically incredibly implausible.
Interviewer,"The fees of the financial sector seem stuck at around 2 percent of GDP for a remarkably long period of time. And this is across an era where many other costs, even in percentage terms, have come down."
Vitalik,"It could be that these are constants that have to do with rent extraction rather than with any particular features of the technology. For example, when I was at this economics and computation conference in Ithaca, there was this presentation on high-frequency trading."
Interviewer,"Why are there bid-ask spreads at all, and is it possible to get rid of them without putting them somewhere else, such as into mining costs?"
Vitalik,"Ultimately, bid-ask spreads have to exist, and for a couple of reasons."
Interviewer,"By the way, if we're asking, ""What could economics teach us that would help us more?"" I would think a better theory of bid-ask spreads is one of the big gaps."
Vitalik,Absolutely.
Interviewer,"Because even sunshine trading, where you would think the information asymmetry would be away, there's still a bid-ask spread. It may be lower, but not as much lower as you might have thought."
Vitalik,"I can't say I'm an expert on cost disease topics, though if I had to blab from my knowledge of economics and personal experience, both with North America and places like Asia that have less of them first of all, it definitely is the case that places that seem to not have cost disease have more of a ""just get things done"" culture."
Interviewer,"Vitalik, it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much."
Vitalik,Thank you.
