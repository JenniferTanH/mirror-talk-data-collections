this week on Moyers & Company Neil

deGrasse Tyson on the new cosmos and our

dark universe science is a is an

enterprise that should be cherished as

an activity of the free human mind

because it transforms who we are how we

live and it gives us an understanding of

our place in the universe funding is

we're your retirement company

welcome it's been almost 35 years since

PBS premiered one of his most successful

series of all time Carl Sagan's Cosmos

many of you may remember as I do is

elegant exposition of the universe

some part of our being knows this is

where we came we long to return

and we can because the cosmos is also

within us we're made of starstuff we are

away of a cosmos to know itself over 600

million people in more than 60 countries

have now watched cosmos but in the

decades since the universe has kept

moving literally moving in every

direction and so has science and that's

why cosmos is returning this spring this

time on National Geographic Channel and

Fox TV it's time to get going again our

guide is the astrophysicist Neil

deGrasse Tyson America's most popular

scientist the unabashed defender of

knowledge of a superstition and clearly

the rightful heir to Carl Sagan's

curiosity and charisma

so fasten your seatbelt for a whole new

interstellar journey through tens of

millions of years and hundreds of

millions of miles to the farthest

reaches of outer space

Neil deGrasse Tyson is the Frederick P

Rose director of the Hayden Planetarium

at the American Museum of Natural

History here in New York where he

narrates a breathtaking new show titled

dark universe I took my 12 year-old

grandson to see it over the holidays and

we were mesmerized imagine trillions of

stars a hundred billion galaxies and

light traveling a hundred million years

before reaching us here on earth

that very planetarium by the way is

where Neil deGrasse Tyson a kid from the

Bronx aged nine first felt the universe

subpoena him to become a scientist in

thrall to the night sky

he's written 10 books including this

memoir the sky is not the limit and this

his most recent space chronicles facing

the ultimate frontier oh yes I almost

forgot

People magazine once voted him the

sexiest astrophysicist alive welcome

that was a few years ago absolutely you

only got it one I know don't want no

bragging rights right but you clearly

got more of the star stuff that Carl

Sagan said we're all made of you just

got more of it than we did well yeah

I've been touched by the Stars more

frequently than others but you were just

nine nine nine years old a really trip

my parents we were all native New

Yorkers and my parents knew well the

value of all of the cultural

institutions of New York City we went

every weekend to one or another of these

institutions of not the zoo the art

museum that many art museums the Hall of

Science and a first visit to the Hayden

Planetarium for me by the way I would

ultimately go as a school trip but for

family I go there and I sit back and I'm

certain I'd love the word you said I was

subpoenaed by the universe I think I I

had no choice in the matter I think the

universe called me because when the

lights dimmed and the stars came out

when I was nine I'd never seen a sky

like that in my life and you met Carl

Sagan at 17 when you headed to the

Cornell yeah well so I applied to

colleges knowing full well that I was

interested in the universe

my application to Cornell unknown to me

was forwarded to Carl Sagan he was a

professor of astronomy there and I was

deciding what college to go to he sent

me a personal letter man I'm just the

seventh he was already been on The

Tonight Show and had best-selling book

there's a personal letter said I

understand you're considering Cornell

and you're like the universe as do I so

why don't you come by I can give you a

tour to help you decide whether this is

where you'll ultimately attend so I went

up there he met me outside the Astronomy

building and it gave me a tour of the

lab one of my favorite memories is he

reaches back didn't even look just reach

back pulled out one of the books that he

wrote assigned it to me and I said that

is awesome and I said to myself if I'm

ever in a position of influence the way

he is then I will surely interact with

students the way he has interacted with

me as a priority do you remember seeing

cosmos when it first aired yeah but I

was by then I was in graduate school so

it was it didn't influence me the way it

influenced others because I was already

established but what it did tell me was

that there was an appetite out there for

for science if it's delivered in a way

that's compelling and that's warm

that's compassionate that is as though

the person who is bringing the science

to you is sitting next to you on the

living-room couch and I thought that

that bedside manner is something that

more science expositors should be doing

and I've used it kind of as a model for

me going forward so what are we going to

learn about the universe um your cosmos

that Carl Sagan couldn't have known

about let me put it this way if Sagan

were around to see your series what

would he learn about the universe that

was unknowable thirty-some I'd use it

yes so that's a good question so you

need to think of cosmos not as a

documentary about science by the way

since then there have been many

documentaries about science and it's

quite a fertile way of delivering the

viewer to the frontier or bringing the

frontier to the viewer so that's not the

issue here because we all remember

cosmos and so many of these other

documentaries maybe live their moment

but then they fade

why did cosmos not fade it's not because

it brought you the latest science

although it also did that it's because

it displayed for you why science matters

why science is is a is an enterprise

that should be cherished as an activity

of the free human mind because it

transforms who we are how we live and it

gives us an understanding of our place

in the universe and it's these these

it's it's these states of mind that you

carry with you for the rest of your life

so in the new cosmos that we are

continuing this voyage we're continuing

this epic exploration of our place in

the universe we have other stories to

tell beyond the ones that went on back

then yes right now we we are steeped in

the ignorance of dark matter and dark

energy and at the time of the original

series there were no known planets

outside of those orbiting the Sun we

suspected they were there but right now

we're rising through a thousand planets

happily orbiting stars that are not the

Sun so these are not that's not simply

new science it's new vistas of thought

and imagination that place in the

universe you talk about as you know

scares some people

someone wants to-- Sagan that they

didn't like astronomy because it made

them feel small and insignificant in

comparison with the grandeur of the

universe it clearly didn't affect you

that way

well it depends on what your ego is

going into the conversation if your ego

starts out I am important I am big I'm

special you're in for some

disappointments when you look around it

what we've discovered about the universe

no you're not big no you're not you're

small in time and in space and you're if

you have this frail vessel called the

human body it's limited on earth if you

have no ego

if you just want to explore the world

look what happens here's the

conversation goes differently you learn

oh the molecules and the atoms of those

molecules in my body are traceable to

stars across the galaxy that have lived

their lives manufactured these elements

exploded them in to the universe from

which new generations of star systems

were formed so I look up at the night

sky

I don't feel small I feel large I feel

connected to the universe it's not just

we here on earth and that's there we are

we are one and that that link for me is

one of the most profound discoveries of

modern astrophysics and if that that

should not make you feel small that

should make you feel large at your

planetarium show which I went to the

other day just over the holidays it did

feel small sitting there looking up at a

hundred million light years coming at us

but I also felt significant the very

fact that my grandson and I are here in

this universe together is not

insignificant not only that it's the

human mind applying known laws of

physics to the universe allows us to

even come with an understanding of

what's going on out there have we

figured out our galaxy so yes and no all

right so the yes part is we've got some

laws of gravity and optics in motion and

and yeah we can use our knowledge of

physics and our knowledge of the

frontier of science to land us probe on

Mars within a few meters of the target

spot this is tens of millions of miles

away right there is no golf shot it's

not accurate all right not even a

hole-in-one is as accurate as what this

this shot is so what we do know that has

been tested works and that's quite a

state of empowerment but there's a

saying where as your area of knowledge

grows so too

does your perimeter of ignorance hmm

because this is the boundary between

what you know and what you do not know

outside of that area so we didn't even

know too

ask why is the universe accelerating

against the efforts of gravity until we

made the measurement that it was so so

before 1998 we couldn't even ask the

question we didn't even know to ask the

question so so there's no sign that

everything will ever be fully known

because this moving frontier continues

to bring us more questions so can we

measure how ignorant we are perhaps we

know that what we do know about the

universe comprises four percent of

everything that drives it 96 percent of

what's driving this universe in the form

of dark matter and dark energy we have

no idea well how do you know that it's

4% because you haven't been able to have

you to measure what we don't know know

so that so that's a really cool question

in science in astrophysics in particular

in all Sciences you have the capacity to

measure something even if you don't know

what it is yeah so well so for example

you could measure the fact that

something is falling to the ground

but not know what it is or what's

causing it or why but you can measure it

you can measure the Sun moving across

the sky build calendars based on that

and not even know that earth goes around

the Sun you can and once you find out

earth goes around the Sun that flips

your point of view but it doesn't

invalidate the concept of a year you can

make all manner of measurements and not

know what's causing it we measure this

thing we're calling dark matter we

measure this phenomenon dark energy

that's forcing the universe to

accelerate when you add up what we know

with those two things about which we

don't know what's driving it we only

know 4% of what's driving so that's

humbling

that's humble the humblest person in

this world is the astrophysicist because

we fit we are face to face with our

ignorance every single day but here's

what puzzles me among other things about

you astrophysicists I mean the

magnetized where you say you asked your

physicist yeah you guys yeah you guys

you're dealing as well as I saw in your

planetarium show you're dealing with

true

the stars a hundred million or more

galaxies how do you even imagine how do

you comprehend how do you get your mind

around to use the cliche numbers of such

magnet we start early and I was I was on

yeah you guys start start and really

think big early in fact calculus as a

branch of mathematics embraces the

infinite you use some an infinite series

of numbers or expressions you start

thinking about large things early and or

a large enumeration of objects early the

way I like to think of it as you can you

can give analogies so one of my

favorites you remember when McDonald's

actually kept counting how many memories

they sold like the national game exactly

there that's and they had an interesting

sort of the own version of a y2k problem

because when they got to 99 there was

not a slot for a third for a third place

so there was no room enough to put 1 0 0

so many of them just got stuck at 99

billion so I did the calculation for 100

billion hamburgers if you have if you

lay the man to end you could go around

the earth like 32 times around the earth

and 10 and then with what's left over

after you've done that you can stack

them to the moon and back with your

hundred billion hamburgers and that's

about how many stars there are in the

universe how much pepto-bismol would you

need the other thought didn't do the

pepto-bismol calculus so it's fun to

think of large numbers in these other

contexts and of course there are numbers

larger than anything that's enumerate

able in the universe the number of

Google back when Google was only a

number not also a corporation Google is

a one followed by a hundred zeros that

numbers larger than the account of

particles in the observable universe so

there's nothing in the universe that you

can count that will add up to a Google

so so what I did is a kid you just have

fun with numbers and so when big numbers

show up in the universe is that yeah

give me more and what worries me is that

when the debt goes to a trillion dollars

or possibly a quadrillion dollars the

National

that happens never quadrillion but when

it gets there

do people really know how big that is I

don't think they don't so we're

handicapped by not knowing not being

able to think creatively about how large

these numbers are I think you make me

realize what I was experiencing there in

the planetarium when you started you

said we're not going to focus on what we

can see stars and planets moons and

nebulae we're going to focus on what we

can't see and it was it is dark matter

that's the audacity of the show I don't

know any other show that said we're

going to make as the topic as the

central theme something about which we

know hardly anything and that was was

not only a scripting challenge the the

writer here was Timothy Ferriss a fan of

his work from way back and so there's a

scripting challenged as a visualization

challenge our director of astral

visualization which is a really cool

title if you ever want what I think is

Carter M art these are people that he's

a scientifically literate artist

visualizer and so you bring this and

others who you bring this talent

together you say here's something we

don't know what it is but it affects

other things let's see how the rest of

what we know can proxy for that which we

do not know I mean this is how we know a

black hole is out there just see a black

hole but you see what effect a black

hole has and every weeks have it on its

environment so dark things have a way of

manifesting themselves dark money as

well a dark energy dark matter how do

they differ well unfortunately they have

similar sounding names and since we

don't really don't know what either of

them is H I don't think we should have

named them that we should have given

them fake names until we understood I

thought I've been voting for like Fred

and Wilma that's something that doesn't

give you any cosmic bias all right so I

can tell you simply what dark matter is

but don't think of it as matter I don't

wanna I'm a I'll connect this tape I

don't we don't know what it is so I

don't even want to use those two words

if anything it's dark gravity because we

look in the universe and we see the

effects of gravity and let's see let's

add up all the stars and galaxies and

and planets and comets and black holes

everything we know about to account for

this gravity that we see we count for

1/6 of the forces of gravity we see in

the universe there is no known objects

accounting for most of the effect of

gravity in the universe something is

making stuff move that is not anything

we have ever touched and that's

something you call for lack of a better

term dark matter but that even implies

this matter what it truly is as dark

gravity boom

that's a problem has been around since

the 1930s it's the longest standing

unsolved problem in astrophysics so now

dark energy we look out in the universe

and we expect to see the universe we're

in our universe is expanding we've known

this since Hubble the man level there

was a man called Hubble before he came

before he became a telescope yeah back

in the 1920s and Edwin Hubble he

discovered not only that our galaxy is

one of many he discovered the galaxies

are scattering apart from one another

this was the expanding universe in 1929

so when you reveal this you say okay if

we've been doing this for a while

all those gravities all those galaxies

are going to feel each other and they're

going to ultimately want to slow us down

in this expansion so you go out to

measure that and that act led to a

measurement that no-one believed that

initially that the universe is

accelerating it's not slowing down it's

speeding up these measurements were made

back in the 1980 back in the 1990s a

Nobel Prize has now been awarded for

this discovery just recently a couple of

years ago the discovery papers were in

1998 so we don't know it's got some

mysterious pressure in the vacuum of

space acting opposite the force of

gravity we don't know what it is but we

can measure its effect so it you measure

it by measuring the its impact on

something else precisely so it impact on

the 4% that we can measure so it's the

pressure that's expanding the

something I use the word pressure I

something is make is making the universe

accelerate again we know why we got said

we had a big bang Big Bang put

everything into motion I'm good with

that

we're good it's like me tossing a ball

up into the air it's moving upward even

though it's slowing down okay

gravity is slowing down that upward

motion we expected gravity to be slowing

down the expanding universe the opposite

is happening we don't know what's

causing what is the practical difference

it makes whether or not we find out what

dark matter and dark energy are if you

were around in 1920 maybe you would have

been saying what's the practical

difference of measured or measuring the

behavior of atomic nuclei or atoms them

so we can't see atoms why do I care this

is just wood this is a wood table I'm at

a leather chair I'm good to go

the why D why are you investing so much

energy so much so much brain energy I'm

understanding what's in the middle of an

atom that seems like a waste of this

brilliance in the 1920s in addition to

discovering we're not the only galaxies

in the universe and that the universe is

expanding

that's a watershed decade because in

that decade quantum physics was

discovered and perhaps if you were

around asking me that similar question

then you to question the whole

enterprise yet today a third of the a

third of the GDP of the world is

generated on the on the creation storage

and retrieval of information and the

entire IT revolution cannot exist

without it understanding what's going on

inside the atom it is a quantum physics

phenomena so you ask me a what of what I

have no idea what value is come back in

50 years we'll have this conversation

and I'll put you pull up the tape and

look I will show you asking me of what

value is the knowledge of how that works

one thing I took away from your

planetarium show is that dark energy as

you just said is responsible for the

increasing rate at which the universe is

pulling itself apart right yes so I'd

rather word that differently I would say

the universe is a

is accelerating we call that dark energy

so you're saying dark energy is

responsible for that there's something

whatever it is we call it dark energy

that's what that's our placeholder term

to describe what we observe the

acceleration of the universe well I'm

glad you explained that because by the

way this there's no nothis nope nothing

known will stop this so there's been

some concern that maybe space does not

have the flexibility necessary to allow

such rapid expansion and might space

care in some way previously unimaginable

does that even mean but it does the

question even have validity you mean the

House of Representatives cannot pass an

act that will stop as they would like to

know seriously I was going to ask you

because if the universe that term if you

if that phrase if the universe is

pulling itself apart does it ultimately

disintegrate does it ultimately collapse

oh there's no there's no evidence to say

that we will ever recycle ourselves

we're all evidence points we're in a

one-way trip to oblivion but so the

universe expands the temperature of the

universe drops all stell all stars

eventually will run out of fuel so the

stars one by one in the night sky will

turn off and in the extremely distant

future quadrillion years into the future

there will be no light coming to us in

the day or night sky and because all

stars would have died and all gas clouds

would have made stars that would have

was going to make them and there be no

more new stars created and so that the

universe will end not with a bang but

with a whimper and not in fire but in

ice there were two strange sequences in

your planetarium show and I managed to

go online and look at it you become a

dark matter junkie here you got it going

on you need more ice anymore so let's

talk about the scene of dark matter from

your show at the planet

so what's going on here is you're

viewing the structure of the large-scale

universe and what we've represented here

are dark areas that themselves have more

gravitational attraction than the light

areas so the light areas are drawing

themselves to the dark areas and so you

what happens is as this happens over the

eons structure begins to manifest in the

universe and you see this this WebWork

and it looks almost organic or that

looks like a some kind of neurosynaptic

map the formation and collection of

matter in the universe follows the laws

of physics and when you add in the dark

matter

this this extra gravity it turns the

universe into the universe that we see

that's why we know the dark matter is

wheel we don't know what it is but we

know it's there because we can't make

the universe as we see it unless we put

this extra gravity into our simulations

to match the gravity that we see so you

know it's something it's some thing and

there's some exotic ideas for it by the

way particle physicists are convinced

that it might be an exotic particle that

doesn't interact with us doesn't

interact with our light with our

telescopes but that it has gravity so

these particles are doing their own

thing

invisible to us but otherwise attracting

our matter into their nucleating us

among them so but of course a particle

physicist would think that the solution

is a particle if you're hammer all your

problems look like nails but one of the

more intriguing accounts I've heard is

if you have multiple universes it turns

out gravity can spill out of one

universe and be felt by another and if

we have another universe adjacent to

ours it could be that these sites where

we see extra gravity is ordinary gravity

in a parallel universe

and here we are looking at it

mysteriously like what is this it's like

the blind man touching the elephant I

don't

what this whole thing is but here I can

describe this part of it and it's kind

of textured and it's no no no no this

guide it's it's smooth and hard and you

know you can't see the whole elephant

maybe the elephant is ordinary gravity

in another universe and we're feeling it

and we're making stuff up just to

account for it you think that could be

another universe I don't see why not

because back when we thought earth was

alone in the universe we learned that

there are other planets that the earth

is just a planet one of many and well

the Sun is surely special no Sun is one

of a hundred billion others in the

galaxy the Milky Way no the galaxy is

one of 100 billion galaxies about the

universe we have philosophical precedent

to suggest that why should nature make

anything in one's okay everything else

we ever thought was unique or special

and we found more of them so so

philosophically it's not unsettling to

imagine more than one universe we also

have good theoretical grounds for

suggesting the existence of a multiverse

where our universe is just one of some

countless number of other universes

coming in and out of existence with

slightly different laws of physics

within them so that makes it a little

dangerous because we are held together

evolved in a universe where we work to

work where we work physically if you

want to visit another universe I would

like you know send something else ahead

of you so explain this to me why is it I

felt more satisfied watching the

planetarium show and as I'm sure we will

watching the new cosmos then I do

personally from science fiction I mean I

came away with a sense of really having

experienced something authentic at the

planetary that's a great question by the

way there are many science fiction fans

who also embrace the science reality and

people who are fans of fantasy and and

superheroes and science fiction and all

the store the storytelling that goes on

on the frontier essentially everyone

there knows the difference between that

frontier and the real science that comes

out and they will judge the storytelling

based on how much science had got right

before it starts inventing

what the frontier of imagination would

bring if you violate a known law of

physics that's lesser science fiction

than the ones where you get all your

physics right now take me now give me

the warp drive now give me that the

transporter take me beyond what we know

so so but to your point I'm I think

maybe it's the same effect as if you

tore the Air and Space Museum in

Washington which has the history of a

flight including Space Flight that we

could have made in exactly Museum people

could have made an exact replica of the

Apollo 11 command module that went to

the moon and then we'd say here's an

exact replica so that's a ok but if a

NASA this actual thing went to the moon

intellectually that means something

different to you you're I see exactly

the same you can make a replica perfect

well that looks exactly with with all

the blemishes and all the heat shield

damage you could do that but if you know

it's the real thing

the meaning is magnified and so yes you

go to our space show it is the real

science and it is captivating you the

way we'd only perhaps had thought

science fiction could the saw station

came first in a way in terms of popular

attained in some cases but I am a fan of

JBS Haldane once said I'm paraphrasing

you said the universe is not only

stranger than we have imagined it's

perhaps stranger than we can imagine and

when when you realize that I are you

understand why some people don't need to

read the science fiction because black

holes flaying stars and orbit around

them pot and planets that have life

forms on dreamt of on earth this is

we're speaking real stuff here maybe

that's as seductive as the imagination

of someone standing on the frontier one

thing I took away from your

show is that dark energy is the

increasing rate at which the universe is

pulling itself apart

so how does it happen that we don't

experience this expanding of the

universe as we walk down the street or

sit here in this building because you

live 80 years instead of billions if you

live billions of years oh yeah this

would be hey check out look what I

notice yeah I think about things you

miss because of how short our time on

earth is a the best example I can give

is when you walk around say oh there's a

nice puffy cloud you don't stare at it

for an hour you just notice it right if

you do a time-lapse of the cloud

especially cumulus clouds they are

roiling gurgling boiling places of

condensed water vapor they are alive yet

when you walk down the street you think

it's just sitting there

peaceful and calm if it's just a simple

cloud so even something that does change

in your lifetime you don't think of as

an actively roiling place the cloud so

imagine longer imagine mountain building

on earth imagine watching the Hawaiian

Islands pop up or come up Majan watching

Ice Ages come and go imagine watching

species of life rise up the dinosaurs

and then an asteroid comes they go

extinct essentially overnight on the in

the fossil record that's a whole other

way to see the world and it's the task

of the geologists the astrophysicist to

think about how that works

fortunately we have computers that can

speed up time I'll give you a great

example we used to have catalogs of

galaxies but that's a really messed-up

looking galaxy there let's make a

catalog of irregular galaxies so we have

a catalog of beautiful galaxies and

irregular galaxies and then people came

up with theories how does a galaxy

become irregular

no one knew and so we realize galaxies

collide galaxies feel each other's local

gravity collide and it's a train wreck

and half the irregular galaxies are

train wrecked galaxies there's a famous

astronomer Gerard a vocal er who said a

wrecked Lexus it's still Alexis it just

happened to be in a car accident so so

we would learn now how do you get to

know the galaxies collide you you put in

the forces of gravity on a computer run

the simulation and watch it unfold and

there you can recreate the havoc that

you see in the universe on hundred

million year timescales so when a child

sings are used to saying I don't think

they do anymore twinkle twinkle little

star how I wonder what you are it's not

twinkling something powerful dramatic

and dynamic is happening to it all right

well yes and we call that twenty coin

yes so yeah there's starlight coming

billions of millions of light years

what depends F is ago the hundreds of

thousands of light years across space

and it's a perfect point of light as it

hits our atmosphere turbulence in the

atmosphere jiggle the image and it

renders the star a twinkling and by the

way planets are brighter than stars

typically like Jupiter and Venus Venus

has been in the evening skies lately and

if you go twinkle twinkle little star

how I wonder what you are and you want

you want to wish upon the star most

people are wishing on planets that's why

there is no coach the planets are the

first stars to come out at night

don't you sometimes feel sad about

breaking all these myths apart terrible

no because I think it's some myths or

deserve to be broken apart out of

respect for the human intellect that

know when you're riding on the ground

and froth is coming out of your mouth

you having an epileptic seizure you have

not been invaded by the devil we got

this one figured out okay I mean

discovery moves on so I I don't mind the

power of myth and magic and but take it

to the next frontier and apply it there

don't apply it in places where we've

long passed

what we already know what's going on I

came out of the planetarium and that

evening I set thinking about what you

said in the show about you acknowledge

the Big Bang and you and I remember that

Hubble rewound the process

mathematically correct me if I'm wrong

and calculated that everything matter

space energy even time itself actually

had a beginning so turns out that was

not Hubble although Hubble had the data

that enabled the calculation the person

who did that was a Belgian priest George

Lemaitre he's a priest physicist

physicist priest okay what a cool thing

to have on your car you got everything

you got people coming and going with

that but he calculated what the

implications of Einstein's general

relativity which was the new theory of

gravity would be with Hubble's expanding

universe and he says the whole universe

may have begun in a singular point in

the past and thus the Big Bang as a

phrase was used pejoratively of this

idea but it's stuck well the astronomer

Robert Jastrow described it like the

explosion of a cosmic hydrogen bomb not

the explosion of a cosmic hajima but

like the explosion of a cosmic hydrogen

bomb yes so there you're stuck with the

analogy of the biggest explosion you

know using that to describe something

that's even bigger which is hard to do

right I mean not to get morbid on you

but I was four blocks from the collapse

of the World Trade Center towers I lived

downtown and I was trying to describe to

others

the sound of the collapse of 107 story

building and it is not like anything

else so I can say well imagine two

trains colliding but how many of us even

have heard or seen that whatever that is

it's more than that so you're stuck if

the biggest explosion we've made is a

hydrogen bomb then any say it's a cosmic

hydrogen bomb

it is it is ah I think saying it's a

awesome hydrogen bomb cheapens the event

yeah it's way begin yeah incredible

flash of energy and life and matter and

yeah all this holy above do you give

people who make this case that that was

the beginning and that they had to be

something that provoked the beginning do

you give them an a at least for trying

to reconcile faith and reason I'm I

don't think they're reconcilable what do

you mean well well so let me say that

differently all efforts that have been

invested by brilliant people of the past

have failed at that exercise it just

fail and so I don't I don't the track

record is so poor that going forward I

have essentially zero confidence near

zero confidence that there will be

fruitful things to emerge from the

effort to reconcile so for example if

you if you knew nothing about science

and you read say the Bible the Old

Testament which in Genesis is an account

of nature that's that's what that is and

I said to you give me your description

of the natural world based only on this

you would say the world was created in

six days and that stars are just little

points of light much lesser than the Sun

and in fact they can fall out of the sky

right because that's what happens during

during the revelation you're one of the

signs that the Second Coming is that the

stars will fall out of the sky and land

on earth so it's even right that means

you don't know what those things are you

have no concept of what the actual

universe is so everybody who tried to

make proclamations about the physical

universe based on Bible passages got the

wrong answer so what happened was when

science discovers things and you want to

stay religious or you want to continue

to believe that the Bible is on airing

what you would do is you would say well

let me go back to the Bible and

reinterpret it then you say things like

oh they didn't really mean that

literally they meant that figuratively

so this whole sort of reinterpretation

of the fig house

figurative the poetic passages of the

Bible are came after science showed that

this is not how things unfolded and so

the educated religious people are

perfectly fine with that

it's the fundamentalist who want to say

that the Bible is the literally literal

truth of God that and want to see the

Bible as a science textbook who are

knocking on the science doors of the

school's trying to put that content in

the center enlightened religious people

are not behaving that way they're saying

it science is cool we're good with that

and use the Bible for to get your

spiritual enlightenment and your

emotional fulfillment I have known

serious religious people not

fundamentalist who were scared when Carl

Sagan opened his series with the words

the cosmos is all that is or ever was or

ever will be

they've been that's scared that because

they interpret that to me then if this

is it there's nothing else no God and no

life after for religious people many

people say well God is within you or God

there ways that people have shaped this

rather than God is an old gray bearded

man in the clouds so if God is within

you what

I'm sure Carl would say in you in your

mind in your mind and we can measure

their neurosynaptic firings when you

have a religious experience we can tell

you where that's happening when it's

happening what you're feeling like at

the time so your mind of course is still

within the cosmos but do you have any

sympathy for people who seem to feel

only feel safe in the vastness of the

universe you described in your show if

they can infer a personal God who makes

it more hospitable to them and cares for

them in this of what we tell ourselves

is a free country which means you should

have freedom of thought it I don't care

what you think I just don't go think

whatever you want

go ahead think

there's one gods two gods ten gods or no

gods that is what it means to live in a

free country the problem arises is if

you have a religious philosophy that is

not based in objective realities that

you then want to put in the science

classroom then I'm going to stand there

and say no I'm not going to allow you in

the science classroom I'm not telling

you what to think I'm just telling you

in the science class you're not doing

science this is not science

keep it out that's where I that's when I

stand up otherwise go ahead I'm not

telling you how to think I think you

must realize that some people are going

to go to your show at the planetarium

and they're going to say aha those

scientists have discovered God because

God dark matter is what holds this

universe together so is that a question

it's a statement you know you know

they're going to say so the history of

discovery particularly cosmic discovery

but discovery in general scientific

discovery is one where at any given

moment there's a frontier and there

tends to be an urge for people

especially religious people to assert

that across that boundary into the

unknown lies the handiwork of God this

shows up a lot Newton even said it he

had his laws of gravity in motion and he

was explaining the moon and the plant he

was there he doesn't mention God for any

of that and then he gets to the limits

of what his equations can calculate so I

don't can't quite figure this out maybe

God steps in and makes it right every

now and then that's that's where he

invoked God and did and Ptolemy he he

bet on the wrong horse but he was a

brilliant guy he formulated the

geocentric universe with earth in the

middle this is where we got epicycles

and all these all this tamasha nations

of the heaven

there was still a mystery to him he

looked up and uttered the following

words when I trace at my pleasure the

windings to and fro of the heavenly

bodies these are the planets going

through retrograde and back the

mysteries are there when i trace it my

pleasure the windings to and fro of the

heavenly bodies i no longer touch earth

with my feet i stand in the presence of

Zeus himself and take my fill of

ambrosia

what he did was invoked Eitan invoke

Zeus to account for the rock that he's

standing on or the air he's breathing it

was this point of mystery and in gets

invoked God this over time has been

described by philosophers as the God of

the gaps if if that's how you if that's

where you're going to put your God in

this world then God is an ever receding

pocket of scientific ignorance if that's

how you're going to invoke God if God is

the mystery of the universe these

mysteries which we're tackling these

mysteries one by one if you're going to

stay religious at the end of the

conversation God has to be more to you

than just where science has yet to tread

so to the person who says maybe dark

matter is God if the only reason why

you're saying is because it's a mystery

then get ready to have that undone

welcome for two weeks now the

astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and I

have been soaring to the outer edges of

the universe in pursuit of dark energy

we expected gravity to be slowing down

the expanding universe the opposite is

happening we don't know what's causing

and Dark Matter we account for 1/6 of

the forces of gravity we see in the

universe there is no known objects

accounting for most of the effective

gravity in the universe something is

making stuff move that is not anything

we have ever touched up there heavenly

bodies collide creating spectacular

displays a fire in life but down here

the collision of science and religion in

the rough and tumble of democracy

create its own fireworks which brings me

to the controversy Neil deGrasse Tyson

triggered in the blogosphere when he

said this to me in one of our earlier

episodes the problem arises is if you

have a religious philosophy that is not

based in objective realities that you

then want to put in the science

classroom then I'm going to stand there

and say no I'm not going to allow you in

the science classroom the proverbial

alien from outer space must be

scratching his bug-eyed head over that

one in 21st century America why should

our most noted astrophysicist have to

defend the science classroom against the

intrusion of religion two reasons over

the past few years the number of

Americans who questioned the science of

evolution has gone up look at this

Gallup poll 46 percent of the country

embraces the notion that God created

human beings pretty much in their

present form at one time within the last

10,000 years perhaps less surprising a

Pew Research survey found that almost

two-thirds of white evangelical

Protestants the bedrock of the

Republican Party reject altogether the

idea that humans have evolved so while

acceptance of evolution has increased

among Democrats to 67% among Republicans

it's fallen to 43% that's a huge

partisan divide something else is

happening too and no one is certain

exactly why our Secretary of Education

Arne Duncan calls it educational

stagnation consider this Pisa test tests

that measure critical thinking in

science math and reading among high

school students in different countries

show that our students aren't doing so

well in math students in 33 other

countries including Ireland Poland

Latvia of the United Kingdom and the

Czech Republic did better than American

students in science students in 24

countries including Poland Ireland and

the Czech Republic were ahead of ours

and in reading our best subject kids in

21 countries outdid the American

the hard truth as secretary Duncan is

that the United States is not among the

top performing comparable countries in

any subject tested by Pisa that's bad

news for our students and the country

all fodder from our last round with Neil

deGrasse Tyson he's the director of the

Hayden Planetarium at New York's

American Museum of Natural History

he's also the narrator of a mesmerizing

new show at the planetarium called dark

universe and this spring he'll appear as

the host of a remake of the classic PBS

series cosmos you can see it on the

National Geographic Channel and Fox TV

welcome thank you

let's talk politics for a moment go for

it all right according to the Pew

Research Center back in 2009 a

comfortable majority of Republicans

accepted human evolution as a fact but

now a plurality rejects it so I asked

you politics can trump science can it

well in a free elective democracy of

course you vote who you want on your

school board there is no provision in

the Constitution for the government to

establish what's taught in schools

that's all relegated to the States hence

we speak spanked state to state about

what's in their science textbook versus

another and so that's the country we've

all sort of bought into if you will were

born into I think it's a self-correcting

phenomenon nobody wants to die okay so

we all care about health but above all

else among the Republicans I know

especially Republicans nobody wants to

die poor okay

so educated Republicans know the value

of innovations in science and technology

for the thriving of an economy and

business and an industry they know this

if you put something that is not science

in a science classroom pass it off as

science then you are undermining an

entire enterprise that was responsible

for creating the wealth that we have

come to take

for granted in this country so we're

already fading economically if this cat

trend continues some Republican is going

to wake up and say look guys we've got

to split these two we have to otherwise

we will doom ourselves to poverty and so

I see it as a self cry don't know when

it's little happen but they they know so

what do you think's at stake what let's

just say for Demong what is he oh no

it's not the democracy will still be

here it's it's a matter of we're just

voting into office people who don't

understand how to make how money gets

generated in you know since the

Industrial Revolution and before we have

known the value of innovation in science

and technology and its impact on an

economy if that begins to go away it's a

different country we'll still call

ourselves America but we won't leave the

world economically and that's a choice

we are making as an elective democracy

how do you explain that no present-day

scientists present company excepted is a

household name the way Thomas Edison or

Einstein were what does that suggest you

if I had to pick I'd rather they were

scientific scientifically literate and

didn't know the name of any scientist

because that matter is much more it

matters much more that you understand

what it means to pull oil out of the

ground or the energy content of oil

versus win versus son versus that

matters it matters that you know that an

asteroid has our name on it and how it

might strike us and how we might deflect

it that that matters it matters what is

happening to your health this requires a

level of base level of science literacy

that I don't think we've achieved yet

you have not fully expressed your power

as a voter until you have a scientific

literacy in topics that matter for

future political issues and that

scientific literacy spares you

tomfoolery from charlatans

yes exactly a science literacy is is an

inoculation against against

sharleen's who would exploit your

ignorance of scientific law

to take your money from you or your

opportunity from you so the world does

respond in and follow known laws of

physics and chemistry and biology we

understand that so uh yeah I mean so

cosmos when it comes out again we're not

beating you over the head I'm not saying

here to learn this or else it's an

offering it's like it's like here it is

and here's why it matters here's why

your life can be transformed just by

having some understanding of this and I

not then and then I go home and speaking

of scientific literacy I brought along

some disturbing statistics as you know

American students are performing poorly

on international tests for math and

science in science we came in just a

head of Russia and on a similar level as

Italy not being Portugal in math fewer

the nine percent of our students scored

advanced compared to a whopping 55% in

Shanghai forty percent in Singapore and

more than 16 percent in Canada

welcome to the new world yeah I mean

okay there's that fact that you just

read now look at the rising economies in

the world the rising and falling

economies it's going to track those

numbers the beginning of the end of what

we thought of as America as I grew up in

an America that had as a priority

leading the world in every metric you

can assemble for yourself so that's this

other writing on the wall now hasn't it

happened sooner because a lot of these

numbers have been around for decades I

have a hypothesis I need to do the

experiment but it's not good enough to

only be smart at something or to score

high on an exam at some point you have

to step away from the exam and say I

have a new thought and no one has had

before and it's not a thought that you

told me to regurgitate on this exam that

you just wrote because there's a thought

that no one has had before

and how do you get those thoughts you

get those in and in irreverent cultures

possibly that has delayed our collapse

because it is out of the environment of

not regurgitating what someone else has

learned in their lifetime that allows

you to make a discovery that no one else

was made before you think there are too

many tests we give kids to any tests I

think there's an emphasis on what the

meaning of the test is I test people

it's a way to find out what you know but

don't then say if you don't know this

there for the rest of your life is

screwed no no because go fine people are

successful in this world fine you know

talk-show hosts and comedians and

novelists and attorneys and go get the

politicians put them in a room say how

many ear got straight A's throughout

school none of them are going to raise

their hands by we throw in inventors

throw in all these people none of them

are going to raise their hand okay so a

Bill Gates dropped out of college a

Michael Dell dropped out of college

those people are not the success of

those people is not measured by how they

performed on the exam that you wrote as

professor because they're they're

thinking in ways that you have yet to

think because they're inventing tomorrow

the only way you can invent tomorrow is

if you break out of the enclosure that

the school system is provided for you by

the exams written by people who are

trained in another generation there's

something else too isn't it I mean some

people say this educational stagnation

that we are experiencing it's because we

have one of the highest child poverty

rates in the developed world they point

to the fact that high poverty schools in

America posted dismal scores on these

tests whereas wealthy schools did very

well in fact students in the wealthiest

school scored so highly that if they

were treated as a separate jurisdiction

they would have placed second only to

Shanghai in science and reading and

would have ranked 6th in the world in

math so inequality matters yes that you

yeah and your point is that's always

good but by the way my father was active

in the civil rights movement in the

1960s and a lot of my cultural awareness

and sensitivities as I'm floating in the

universe were anchored by just that kind

of awareness the inequality of the

unequal distribution of wealth but

that's almost fundamental to a

capitalist system but you what you don't

want to have happen is to have unequal

access ok people will sort themselves

out by who works harder and the rest of

this I got that I even embrace that but

if everyone does not have equal access

you are not getting the best people your

country will falter and that's where any

qualms because I have disenfranchised a

whole community of people that might

have been contributing but no because

they never even saw the light of day so

the light of the intellectual day so

yeah that's bad and it is not the sign

of a healthy democracy it's not even a

sign of a healthy capitalist democracy

being at the top of your game

intellectually philosophically

politically is not a forever thing I've

read history I look at countries that

rise up and contribute mightily to

eradicating ignorance and to making

discoveries about our place in the

universe and then by change of force by

change of vision by change of by

short-sighted leadership the entire

operation collapses look at this this

lawn a thousand years ago Baghdad was

the center of the intellectual it was

the intellectual capital of the world

while Europe they were disemboweling

heretics ok that's weird that's why our

numerals are called Arabic numerals

because they pioneered the use of these

numerals and invented algebra itself an

Arabic word an algorithm two-thirds of

the stars in the night sky have Arabic

names how does that happen because they

had navigating devices astrolabes that

culture of discovery ended and has not

arisen since

I look at America post-war 20th century

America and say we were at the top of

our game investing in science and

engineering and education and yeah we

had our inequalities we had our problems

but as culturally as a nation we had our

vision statement we were thinking about

our future

we're thinking about the now we were

thinking about the tomorrow that's what

the World's Fair was inventing a

tomorrow that doesn't yet exist today

when that's how you think about your

country and run your country you have

policy that points in that direction

innovative inventive creative policy

that takes you from the present into the

future without it you live in the

present and the rest of the world passes

you by you might as well physically been

moving backwards because that's what you

look like to the rest of the world so as

a scientist I don't care who does the

work next if it's not America I want to

see good scientific results no matter

where they're done but as an American I

feel it I feel the fading of our luster

the fading of our vision statement as a

nation I saw a quote recently by the

physicist Jonathan Hubner who says

humans are running out of world-changing

inventions he says quote I think the

major branches of discovery are behind

us

do you agree of course not oh my gosh

that is wit put I would say this to the

man's face there you can't be more

that's let me be plain

previous statements such as that made by

physicists of the past have proven to be

extremely short-sighted

how's that for polite okay so there's a

physicist

one of these Nobel prize-winning

physicist at the in the 1800s going into

the 1900s the turn of that century we

were at the top of classical physics

Newton's laws were working electricity

was understood this we had the power of

knowledge of the laws of nature and they

said but the couple of things there's

still some unknowns but that's just a

matter of getting an extra decimal place

in the measurement but new ID we're done

we're done here just a few clouds on the

horizon we're good to go

don't be don't become a physicist

there's nothing left to discover and

what would happen in the next 20 years

relativity would be discovered special

relativity and general relativity the

expanding universe quantum physics all

of classical physics would be turned on

its ear because of the discoveries in

the very two or three decades to follow

the uttering of that statement so of

course you can't see the future that's

kind of what it means to not be in the

future

half of my library are old books because

I like seeing how people thought about

their world at their time so that I

don't get big-headed about something we

just discovered and I can be humble

about where we might go next because you

can see who got stuff right and most of

the people who got stuff wrong what is

the toughest question you would like to

answer before you die oh I hate to sound

cliche about this but my favorite

questions are the ones dare I use the

word yet to be divined because there's a

discovery yet to take place that will

bring that question into the center of

the table I live for those questions so

that means I can't tell you what they

are because they derive from something

yet to be discovered and dark matter in

for example if we discover what dark

matter is there's going to be some

question about dark matter that will

rise up out of the

out of the the ground and say I never

even thought to ask that question in

1920 no one thought to ask how fast is

the universe accelerating okay how fast

is the universe expanding because no one

thought the universe was expanding at

all you can't ask questions about the

movement of a universe that you don't

even know is in motion

you can't ask questions about other

galaxies if you don't even know there

are other galaxies so on my deathbed I

will relish and all the questions that

came up then ever that I never thought

to ask because it was the discoveries of

the future that enabled them Neil

deGrasse Tyson thank you for being with

me that has been great to be here thank

you

you

the battle never ends and the choices we

make in democracy often pit religious or

partisan beliefs against scientific

evidence that contradicts them and

beliefs can be stubborn hard to give up

they even determine which facts we

choose to accept partisans especially

and who among us is not sometimes a

partisan will twist the facts to fit

their preconceived notions so when

people do stupid things journalists and

politicians included cherished beliefs

are often driving them sometimes right

over the cliff as people in recovery say

denial is not just the name of a river

in Egypt and that's what makes it

dangerous right now too powerful belief

systems have converged to counter facts

staring us right in the face

just as the number of Americans who

questioned the science of evolution has

gone up so too has the number who did

not that global warming is happening and

that human activity is causing this at a

time when the global scientific

community is more certain than ever that

you and I and everyone else are helping

to turn up the heat and seal our fate

and here's the scary political reality

on both fronts evolution and climate

change radical right Republicans have

made denial a litmus test you can see it

embodied in this man Paul Brown

Republican congressman from Georgia and

a physician with strong religious

beliefs I've come to understand all this

stuff I was taught about evolution in

rheology Big Bang Theory all that is

lies straight from the

and it's wise to try to keep me and all

the folks who are taught out from

understanding that they need a Savior

you see there are a lot of scientific

data that I found out as a scientist

they actually showed that this is really

a young earth I don't believe that

Earth's but about 9,000 years old I

believe it was created 6 days as we know

that's what the Bible says and when he

took on the science of global warming

his fellow Republicans in the House of

Representatives enthusiastically

applauded now we hear all the time about

global warming actually we've had a

flatline temperatures globally for the

last eight years scientists all over

this world say that the idea of

human-induced global climate change is

one of the greatest hoaxes perpetrated

out of the scientific community it is a

hoax not true simply not true up to a

point we might agree that representative

Browns personal beliefs are his own

business even when he is telling the

extremest John Birch Society that this

entire concept of manmade global warming

is a conspiracy - and I'm quoting

destroy America but remember this man is
