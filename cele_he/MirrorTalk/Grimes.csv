name,line
Interviewer,Grimes thanks very much for being with us today yeah thank you so much for having me.
Grimes,Um so uh and i seem to start every one of these interviews since the middle of march talking about.
Interviewer,Quarantine um and i know you have a young son um um how are you doing uh i'm doing.
Grimes,I guess like as good as anyone can be doing i feel like everyone's kind of doing.
Interviewer,The worst but also i don't know i also it's like it's like pretty good i having a baby is fun i'm making a lot of.
Grimes,Music i don't know well you know i spoke to i spoke to an artist not too long ago who told me.
Interviewer,That songwriters tend to be isolators and i'm wondering if that resonates for you yeah for sure i mean i don't the.
Grimes,Isolation isn't my is it my beef with the world right now um the isolation is kind of.
Interviewer,Good like uh yeah i don't know i i'm usually isolating in general like.
Grimes,Um yeah it's good for art um let's talk about let's talk about the album.
Interviewer,But to do that i want to go back to the period after art angels um as you were thinking about.
Grimes,Making the next album did you feel you kind of had a choice you know you needed to make a.
Interviewer,Decision about the path you were going to follow you know pop music versus versus.
Grimes,Something more underground or avant-garde or whatever you want to however you want to describe it was that.
Interviewer,In your thinking yeah so i really just wanted to see if i could do it like challenge myself and.
Grimes,Then with um missing throttle scene i just like i was like it i'm just gonna make.
Interviewer,Oh i'm out of sweater sorry you're you're fine okay i was like i just wanted to make.
Grimes,What i want um and uh you know pursue kind of more a more aggressive sound and more.
Interviewer,Experimental psychedelic stuff um you know especially like yeah i don't know well you've called.
Grimes,You've called you've called the material on the new album ethereal new metal um.
Interviewer,And i'm wondering if you which which is a fascinating term in and of itself but.
Grimes,I'm wondering if you had somewhat of a kind of a sonic template in mind or a direction.
Interviewer,That you wanted to take the sound um i think i just like have always been like i wish you could.
Grimes,Get sort of like nine inch nails but more ethereal you know like um.
Interviewer,Especially the songs look like my name is dark like i was like i just want something like.
Grimes,Really heavy like in a metal way but that's like really kind of got like enya undertones.
Interviewer,Like i've just been like sitting like waiting for that uh from someone else so i it just seemed.
Grimes,Like something that needed to be done um i guess like i you know i was sort of like looking for.
Interviewer,Sonic holes in the musical landscape that i felt like i wanted to be filled well i mean there's a ton.
Grimes,There's a ton of sonic information on this on this album there's layers of.
Interviewer,Instrumentation and and and vocals um and it feels you know to a listener it feels very.
Grimes,Much like your painting with sound um are you are you are you restless when it comes to.
Interviewer,Experimenting in the studio i wouldn't say restless i would say i definitely like.
Grimes,Um like the first song i made on the album was 4am and i definitely like sit down and i'm like i need to make.
Interviewer,Something that doesn't sound like anything else and i just kind of like i can't like start.
Grimes,The album until i get a song that just doesn't sound like another song um.
Interviewer,And so i i'm just sort of like that's like what i'm looking for i'm just sort of like.
Grimes,Like like just like kind of like throwing at a wall trying to like get something that just sounds totally.
Interviewer,Unique um well when you when when you're when you're when you're talking about.
Grimes,Finding something that doesn't sound like something else are you referring to your own catalog.
Interviewer,Or just anything you happen to hear currently any and you know my goal is to make music that is new.
Grimes,You know yeah so that's kind of my i mean like i would say the thing that excites me the thing that kind of gets.
Interviewer,Me going is like when i can make something that um you know i'm like it doesn't exist.
Grimes,Or whatever like that's sort of my generally what i'm that's like the game i'm playing with.
Interviewer,Myself yeah um and one you know one of the things especially with technology.
Grimes,Today in in the studio there there are literally endless amounts of.
Interviewer,Ways to tweak songs and change and and and i asked this in all seriousness how do you know when a track is finished.
Grimes,I mean frankly with all my albums like my team eventually is just like you have to.
Interviewer,It's not like you're not allowed to go anymore because i feel like i would just go.
Grimes,Forever um yeah like i have a lot of issues like when i hear my old music i'm like.
Interviewer,Like i just like want to fix it um so it's pretty hard um although that said though um i do.
Grimes,The realm of plug-ins and whatnot is super sick um and i think sort of an underappreciated art form.
Interviewer,Like the people actually making plugins and stuff um so i don't know i i'm like super fascinated.
Grimes,With that whole world and yeah that that sounds like that sounds like a rabbit hole you would.
Interviewer,Be happy to go down creating that kind of it's not my scene to make that first of.
Grimes,All i feel like i'm not um like i'm not on the level technically to be making plug-ins i.
Interviewer,Actually have made i made sort of a synth for rolly before but um.
Grimes,It's it that's not like my brain style um which is in like why i respect it so much because i find it.
Interviewer,Pretty hard to make things like that um uh and i just think those tools are just like.
Grimes,So sick and like a lot of them are pretty cheap i don't know i just i just love their music's heading where it's.
Interviewer,Just getting like cheaper and cheaper and um uh there's just more at your.
Grimes,Fingertips and more sort of like not hardware although i love hardware.
Interviewer,A lot but you know um yeah but the i mean what's what's out there now i mean i.
Grimes,Play guitar i have a little knowledge about this stuff um um it's it it really is remarkable.
Interviewer,The things you can do literally on your own and for not a lot of money.
Grimes,Yeah no it's like just like magic it's just like literal magic like yeah yeah you know let.
Interviewer,And i want to talk about sort of the thematic kind of thread of the album and a lot.
Grimes,Has been written and said about it um so so tell me your thinking about kind of the the concept.
Interviewer,For these songs the thematic thread um was crazy because it's such a different time.
Grimes,Than when i started making this record like when i started making the record i was just like having such bad anxiety.
Interviewer,About the environment and it just did not seem like it was the topic of the day yet whereas now it.
Grimes,Seems like it's like quite the topic so it's like i i don't know it just seems less wow.
Interviewer,But like in general like um you know i'm just thinking a lot about.
Grimes,Existential risks to humanity in general like i feel like we feel safer than we are you know.
Interviewer,It's like we're in a weird time where we kind of have the capacity to destroy our own species um.
Grimes,Technologically and i feel like we're in sort of like a technological like moment whereas you know it's just.
Interviewer,Like can we survive it or not um and i just kind of.
Grimes,You know i was like why do people i was really like turning off the news i was like i.
Interviewer,I you know like 2018-ish like 2017. i was like i just can't  take the news anymore and i was.
Grimes,Like oh this is bad i was like if i'm turning off the news it's just like not a good situation like.
Interviewer,How could i make this more um digestible i guess you know um and you know i was like well.
Grimes,I like the joker like i can handle like a villain in a comic book or something um and i was like maybe it's just a bit.
Interviewer,More um digestible and a bit less like painful to anthropomorphize things like climate change that are.
Grimes,You know sort of existentially distressing um and also maybe it's a bit easier to.
Interviewer,Pay attention to them i was like you know how could i get someone to like why is everyone going to see a marvel movie.
Grimes,But like doesn't just don't want to engage with climate change or.
Interviewer,Other things and um you know then i kind of started getting into this idea of the new gods and i was like man it would be.
Grimes,So sick like if there's like the goddess of plastic and the goddess of like.
Interviewer,You know like opium or opiates like it's just like like aesthetically that that kind of.
Grimes,Concept just started really kind of consuming my brain um well and and all of this.
Interviewer,You know given where we are with the pandemic i mean it's eerily kind of prescient in.
Grimes,A way yeah it's really weird see i wouldn't make this album now because now it just.
Interviewer,Feels mean like it's like because just got so  up in the meantime.
Grimes,That's i mean that's really interesting in and of itself yeah i'm just like like now just me like.
Interviewer,This album it even kind of hurts my sensibilities at this point it just like feels so aggressive and i'm like.
Grimes,Everything is just so up right now i don't want to be like like hey guys there's a comic book.
Interviewer,Version of everything that's like brutalizing us but um uh yeah i don't know it's like um.
Grimes,I wouldn't make it now i feel like especially like postcode and everything it's like.
Interviewer,I mean the thing i always say about social media is it's like kind of creating the collective.
Grimes,Unconscious or the collective consciousness or whatever like it's like humanity like is actually getting linked.
Interviewer,Psychologically like in a tangible way and so like everyone is sort of confronting.
Grimes,Everyone's suffering all at the same time like it's like literally you just it's just like like you just.
Interviewer,Like you cannot escape from like the suffering the sort of like mass suffering of.
Grimes,Humanity as a species which i think is a good thing because i think ultimately the only way to get.
Interviewer,Through this is to like actually start having like better solutions to things but it's just.
Grimes,There's a short-term mental health crisis for sure because it just really is.
Interviewer,Super painful like um so it's just like now miss anthropocene just see like i don't want to like add.
Grimes,To the pain so i'm like i'm like oh god this album is so like kind of like conceptually violent.
Interviewer,But like like it just feels mean but um you know but you do you do you do cover.
Grimes,I mean yes there's there's the global climate crisis and you kind of go there.
Interviewer,Obviously but you do cover a lot of kind of intimate space as well um and there's there's a.
Grimes,Vulnerability in that um do you feel bad yeah for sure for sure i.
Interviewer,Mean i think all this stuff i feel like we people have a lot of personal grief.
Grimes,About things like whatever like climate change or pandemic or racism or whatever like it's like.
Interviewer,There is just an actual cost um like personally um and i was you know like a lot of things obviously affect me.
Grimes,Personally like i grew up in vancouver and there's a lot of just heroin use and stuff in.
Interviewer,Vancouver and like you know i have lost like a lot of friends to heroin.
Grimes,Related death or whatever so it's like you know like that's like pretty front of mind for me.
Interviewer,So even though we're talking about this current record are you already on to the next thing.
Grimes,Are you already yes i don't talk about it too much because i don't want to that'll.
Interviewer,Be a whole thing but i think we're almost done all right all right well i still have a.
Grimes,Few more questions about this album and then you know we'll we'll set we'll set.
Interviewer,Another time to talk about the next one um so so previously and and on this record you've done.
Grimes,You know 99 or more of your own production and on on this album though you do have.
Interviewer,Some collaborators some folks who helped with mixing or how you know what it might be i i'm.
Grimes,Wondering if even even those collaborations have in some way.
Interviewer,Changed your approach or your thinking about making music i mean i'm definitely done.
Grimes,With the sitting alone in a tower making an album by myself thing i think like i think myself robertson.
Interviewer,I was like as long as i'm on an independent label like as long as i'm on 4d i was like.
Grimes,Why would i spend money working with other people like it's just really expensive and um.
Interviewer,You know it's just like what's the point um kind of thing especially if you can make it.
Grimes,Yourself and you know you just like i kind of had something to prove like i just kind of.
Interviewer,Wanted to like fully defeat um any notion you know like people saying like oh she doesn't really do it.
Grimes,So you know but i feel like five records is a good amount of records to make on your own.
Interviewer,Um at this point like i actually do really just want to work with more people and.
Grimes,Because you can learn more like it's like every time i get in the room with somebody.
Interviewer,Might i get like significantly better at producing um anyway so are you are you a good collaborator i think.
Grimes,So i think i'm gonna with the right people i feel like okay like i don't do a lot of sessions.
Interviewer,It doesn't always but like if it's if i like choose someone who i think is like really.
Grimes,Great at what they do then it's going to be a good session yeah what would you what would you look.
Interviewer,For in a collaborator what what what does a collaborator kind of have to have.
Grimes,For you to want to work with them um just they've made some of my favorite songs like i usually just.
Interviewer,Like the record i'm working on now is like a collaborative record and like the few i have like another.
Grimes,Collaboration coming out later this year that i made like i just like i'm like okay who's made my favorite songs.
Interviewer,Usually like left of center like i'm trying to find people who are like not but yeah yeah like and then i just hit.
Grimes,Them up i'm like you know if you make great music we'll probably make great music together wait.
Interviewer,I don't know i do a lot of cold emailing not a lot but like if i think someone's sick how does that.
Grimes,Work out it's pretty good yeah um i don't know no yeah people usually.
Interviewer,Respond people respond yeah yeah uh you know you use um and particularly on this album um.
Grimes,Fantasy and villains and pop culture references um um tell me about the work because i.
Interviewer,Was interested to learn that that you're you're a fan of jack kirby's um tell me tell me about his work and i.
Grimes,Know i know it's influenced your visual art but i'm wondering if in any way it influences.
Interviewer,The music um i mean he's just one of my favorite illustrators i mean he's obviously.
Grimes,I feel like jack kirby doesn't get enough kind of appreciations i guess he sort of died and then like stanley.
Interviewer,Was sort of like but stanley also like i'm not trying to discredit stanley but it's like jack kirby just.
Grimes,Died before like um the comic book stuff got more mainstream so i feel like he's less in people's minds um.
Interviewer,I just like when i look at his art i'm just like what the like it's just so satisfying to me.
Grimes,Especially the way it's kind of like like i in my art i do a lot of um like hard sort of like science fiction.
Interviewer,Looking stuff with like strong light and like a lot of like reflection i guess not to like but i i would say.
Grimes,That's pretty inspired by jack kirby like he's definitely i guess a big inspiration for me.
Interviewer,Like oh and heavy line like he does i mean it's a comic so it's like gonna be super line work oriented but that's sort.
Grimes,Of like how i draw two as opposed to like painting or something.
Interviewer,Um uh but yeah in general i just i love modern mythologies and i sort of think um i think there's a lot of modern.
Grimes,Mythologies that are like more important to us than we think you know like like all the marvel stuff.
Interviewer,And i i think is sort of like modern homer or like you know sort of controversial savings.
Grimes,But like harry potter like game of thrones or whatever like it's you know obviously these.
Interviewer,Things like like chadwick has been dying people like couldn't take it it was like a.
Grimes,You know a hero dying so i feel like that's like it it's our it's our it's our homer uh.
Interviewer,Or our whatever you know um tell me i'm interested in the track idoru.
Grimes,Um um well i mean you know i'm not sure how how much william gibson's novel.
Interviewer,Influenced influence that or not as as the case may be but as you're talking about all of this.
Grimes,Mythology that's an interesting place to go well it was crazy okay this sounds bad i.
Interviewer,Haven't actually read that novel i love william gibson um and i was like reading a lot of william gibson.
Grimes,While he's making this album um but uh uh specifically every other track like a weird name and.
Interviewer,Just the one song adore you i was like this is a boring name i'm sitting with my friends and i was like.
Grimes,This is like the i'm like i need a better name for this song but like i feel like it should be.
Interviewer,The title of the song because the hook is adore you so it's like i don't want to like lose the title and.
Grimes,Then my friend was like oh like there's like a william gibson novel called adore you about.
Interviewer,Um like a digital pop star or something and i was like what like this seems like too perfect and.
Grimes,Then i like um ordered the book and then when i got it it.
Interviewer,Literally says for claire i opened it and said for claire and i was like what the.
Grimes,My birth name is claire that's not my name anymore but i can't i actually hate that name but like.
Interviewer,It was just which is his daughter i guess but i was like this is really weird um.
Grimes,It was like a trippy moment it felt like a simulation like sending me a sign so yeah yeah um sidebar.
Interviewer,Not not a related question but i i read that um your most streamed artists last year.
Grimes,Were dojicat and vangelis yes oh both amazing um so tell me tell me what it is about.
Interviewer,Those artists that that kept you going back to that music i mean i just think dojo cat is like a.
Grimes,Genius like which i think more and more people are realizing i've been like really obsessed.
Interviewer,With dojo cat since literally like 2012 or something like whenever she put out so high i remember.
Grimes,Just being like this artist is like better than people are.
Interviewer,Giving her credit for like um you know uh so i've been like a pretty big fan.
Grimes,Like i even like yeah um i just find it like i find her voice very addictive i feel.
Interviewer,Like you can just hear her intellect like through the music i know that's like a weird thing to say but.
Grimes,Like and now that she's sort of doing her weird comedy thing it's like pretty obvious that she's pretty smart so like.
Interviewer,I feel like i'm not crazy for like hearing that um and her voice is just really i don't.
Grimes,Know it's just an addictive thing ben jealous it's just the same i mean jealous i just think he's the coolest.
Interviewer,Music in the world like i just think you can just put on vangelis all the time.
Grimes,Like i like the blade runner soundtrack is arguably like my favorite album like period in all of history.
Interviewer,And and um thing i love about angelus is it's like in this weird moment in time where it both sounds really old and.
Grimes,Really new and very little stuff sounds like it because it's like early synth music and stuff so it sounds it's.
Interviewer,Got this kind of janky like early synth energy but it also just sounds so futuristic for the time that it's just.
Grimes,Like this i don't know it's just like this perfect thing evangelist.
Interviewer,He was way he was way ahead of the curve yeah so i had it still sounds futuristic like it.
Grimes,Literally still sounds futuristic like i just listened to it like i i listened to vangelis like.
Interviewer,Like an absurd amount like possibly too much um yeah jealous overdose.
Grimes,Um uh so so you you've talked about and you've covered ai.
Interviewer,In your music um you've talked about it quite a bit yet the interesting thing is the.
Grimes,Algorithms that drive streaming recommendations generally don't know what to do.
Interviewer,With your music yeah better but is it getting better i think it's more the algorithms.
Grimes,Like people think we're not dealing with ai and people like aren't worried about ai.
Interviewer,And then they're like and then it's kind of like all these artists not getting stream but only these.
Grimes,Artists are getting streamed and i'm like or you know you look at social media and.
Interviewer,Like people getting so upset at each other and everything and i'm like this is like.
Grimes,Baby ai going wrong you know like we're dealing with ai like lit literally all the time and it's actually.
Interviewer,Super impacting our culture and the way we listen to music and the way we communicate with each other and the.
Grimes,Election like it's super impacting everything and everyone's just kind of like.
Interviewer,It's not a you know people always get really mad at me when i talk about it but i'm like.
Grimes,Just to be clear like we should probably be paying attention to the state of ai.
Interviewer,And the state of the algorithms um because yeah it's a yeah.
Grimes,It's a it's a sketchy situation in my opinion yeah yeah agreed agreed so um uh in.
Interviewer,The time in the time we have left um um can you can you hint at all about this about this new album.
Grimes,Um sonic direction what what what can you say about it uh i would say it's definitely by far my.
Interviewer,Favorite thing i've ever made uh i don't want to say too much because i feel like.
Grimes,I want to like think carefully about the first thing i say about it and i don't want to just like.
Interviewer,Say something offhand that ends up being like with some prophecy i just said a bunch of before i was done.
Grimes,Um and then like i changed some things but everyone was like super attached to the i said at the beginning so.
Interviewer,Then like i you know um so i i want to be like careful um.
Grimes,But uh yeah i feel like i shouldn't i feel like i shouldn't say too much about it.
Interviewer,Because um so so last question um yeah i i think you've referenced a couple of.
Grimes,Times uh that that grimes as a musical project was was very youthful was was you you know.
Interviewer,In a perhaps more youthful stage so so how have you evolved as an artist.
Grimes,Very immature it's a widely uh accepted reality um i don't know i feel like it's growing up.
Interviewer,I i feel like it's getting a lot more like like it feels very i feel like when i.
Grimes,Listen to visions it feels like i can feel my lastness um and i feel like with each increase.
Interviewer,With each subsequent album it seems a lot less lost and a lot more powerful or something so i don't know i.
Grimes,It's sort of intangible but um and lyrics like when i made well i mean.
Interviewer,When i was young like this is definitely something like weird neurological problem i had but i didn't.
Grimes,Realize music had lyrics like i thought all music had fake lyrics like i literally.
Interviewer,Listened to music and it was like blah blah blah like i thought like it was just.
Grimes,Fake words for some reason so my first three albums are like mostly don't have words because i just.
Interviewer,Like didn't think people were saying a lot of words because i i.
Grimes,Literally don't know how that happened to me um but i think sort of like discovering.
Interviewer,Poetry in my more recent work is like really has been really good for my brain.
Grimes,Although i do kind of want to make more music without lyrics again in the future but.
Interviewer,Um uh yeah i feel like i feel like the the adding the kind of intellectual or like the.
Grimes,Sort of more cerebral part because before music when i would make music it was just emotions like i was just like.
Interviewer,Emotions emotions motions like and i feel like there's this sort of more cerebral element kind of like.
Grimes,Growing with each time i like go for it uh which i think i personally think is making it better i.
Interviewer,Know some people have qualms with it and i will make more glossolalic.
Grimes,Kind of like non-verbal music or fake alien languages in the future um because i do i actually think i like.
Interviewer,That kind of thing but yeah well we certainly look forward to whatever.
Grimes,Comes next um for now the current album is called miss anthropocene grimes thank you so much.
Interviewer,For being with us today yeah thank you so much for having me and um taking the time and i hope you have a.
Grimes,Great afternoon you too  .
Interviewer,"So, how did Grimes come about?"
Grimes,"It was pretty overnight and pretty random I honestly made a tape for fun and then it kinda blew up on the Internet and was totally surprising. And we weren't prepared for it, I started out with 30 tapes and then we just gave it out for free online."
Interviewer,"Visions, your new record, is your fourth album released in less than two years."
Grimes,"Visions is actually really old, I finished it in August. It's mostly about emotional stuff, this record. This is also the first record for which I tried writing lyrics although they are unclear because of my lisp. My other records were pretty emotionally aimless. Since this is my job now I wanted this record to mean a lot to me. So there's definitely stuff in the lyrics but I think its vague enough that most people wouldn't know what the fuck its about."
Interviewer,"You've got a unique sound, how would you yourself describe it?"
Grimes,"There will always be the Grimes sound, because I am who I am. I definitely always want huge beats. My voice, though, it is what it is and it's not going to change. I feel like I go through phases all the time; Visions is my New Jack swing drum and bass phase. What's interesting about Grimes is that it's attempting to be pop but its kind of failing and ending up somewhere else."
Interviewer,"The album is being released on 4AD, a new label for you. Was it difficult to find a label or other creative people to work with since you have such a unique sound?"
Grimes,"The thing I care about the most is artistic integrity. I would never change something to please somebody. I don't even read interviews or reviews or anything because I just don't wanna know. I feel like its so easy to get caught up in being worried about what people think and I really think the best shit comes out of not thinking about any of that at all. My team is just my crew, which is totally sick because they would never tell me to change anything. And once we reached a certain amount of success then people figured the formula was pretty decent."
Interviewer,"Sometimes I bounce shit off people and they're like 'You know Claire that's just a bit too much you should tone it down' and I'm like oh yeah you're probably right. Artistic freedom is my biggest concern, which is why 4AD was a good pick because most of the other labels we talked to were kinda like, Well, we think you should re-record the vocals."
Grimes,We can respect that. What kind of artists did you grow up listening to?
Interviewer,What other than music do you find inspiring?
Grimes,"Science fiction movies. I always think about playing stuff at parties, as stupid as that is, you always think about how great it would be to dance to something with really loud speakers. I care so much about beats the physical feeling the emotion of it. Is this actually something I can have a physical connection with? That's pretty big for me."
Interviewer,You're also a pretty snappy dresser. How would you describe your style?
Grimes,"Tank Girl or sci-fi punk. I'm always wearing skirts that I'd cut shorter and just don't hem. I always wear combat boots at all times, that's the basis of everything, the combat boots. I have this really sick trench coat from the Korean war that I always wear, but when I do photo shoots that not my clothes really its what they bring."
Interviewer,"2012 is shaping up to be a pretty big year for you, are there any other big changes going on?"
Grimes,"I quit smoking weed, which has actually been great. My life has been so much better since I quit smoking weed. I'm so much more motivated now. Its great for recording but it's really bad when you have to do interviews and photo shoots and stuff. When I smoke weed and then I think about what I'm doing with my life I'm like, Oh, My God! I have to sing in front of people in front of people and I'm just so baked and I start getting anxiety about it. And I refuse to read any reviews or articles about me ever. I feel like it's bad for your brain."
Interviewer,Good! Who is on with us?
Grimes,E is here.
Interviewer,"Hey, Lana. It's Elon. I'm about to leave."
Grimes,He's about to leave. He will not observe. Are you back from tour?
Interviewer," Yeah, I was touring and then I was in Oklahoma for a hot minute."
Grimes,Why Oklahoma?
Interviewer,"My boyfriend is there, actually."
Grimes,"I don't know if I've ever been to Oklahoma. For some reason, I'm terrified of tornadoes there."
Interviewer,"It's a thing. And it's funny you say that, because nobody told me that on Wednesdays at noon, which is when I got there, they do a trial siren test."
Grimes,Oh my god.
Interviewer,"So I actually thought that there was a tornado when I got in, because it was loud and it went on for two minutes. I was like, ""What is going on?""."
Grimes,It's like World War II in the bunker.
Interviewer,"Yeah. Everyone was laughing mercilessly at me, but I was like, ""Well, we have earthquakes here.""."
Grimes,I actually think there was an earthquake yesterday. But earthquakes are fun. All natural disasters are fun in the abstract.
Interviewer,"Yes, in the abstract. I was thinking about your new album. I don't know if I'm saying it right,is it Miss_Anthropocene?"
Grimes,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Do you feel like the songs are more personal, or do they have the overculture weighing on them?"
Grimes,"A bit of both. I'm really obsessed with polytheism. I love how the ancient Greeks or the ancient Egyptians lived in this weird anime world where there were just tons of gods that could be anything. It's like every form of suffering had a representation. I wonder if it almost has a positive psychological effect. If your kid dies in a war, you can literally go speak to War and be like, ""Why did you do this?"" Or, ""I hope you did this for a reason."" There's a weird philosophical justification for all pain, and there's an anthropomorphization of every form of pain. In our current society, we don't even know how to talk about things. So my album's about a modern demonology or a modern pantheon where every song is about a different way to suffer or a different way to die. If you think about it, god-making or god-designing just seems so fun. The idea of making the Goddess of Plastic seems so fun to me."
Interviewer,It's a very creative infrastructure to work within.
Grimes,"Yeah. Religion is like the best science fiction. I know a lot of people who are atheist or agnostic, and they just hate religion and can't see anything good in it. Even if you don't believe in god or anything, this is incredible art. It's incredible storytelling, incredible character design, incredible visual art. I know we both love reverb. Imagine going into a church in medieval Europe, and you had only ever heard music as someone playing a lute. You enter a cathedral for the first time, and you hear someone singing through a super long reverb. What a mystical experience that would be."
Interviewer,"What is mysticism to you, and is it important in your art?"
Grimes,"Mysticism is an evolutionary byproduct. I think we're inherently religious, even if we're not explicitly religious. We get emotional about things that feel religious. Even the way people feel about you, it's a form of idol worship. I don't know what else you would call it. If there's an artist I love, I see them live and I cry, and I'm like, ""Man, I'm acting like some 14th-century farmer right now."" I feel like some pilgrim seeing a holy relic or something."
Interviewer,I've felt that way at a Dylan concert. How would you describe the place you're at in your life right now?
Grimes,"I've recently fallen into a place of extreme flux, where I feel like I don't know myself at all, but it's also the most self-assured I've ever been. I don't know if you've ever felt like that."
Interviewer,"I think that feeling comes when you're on the right path. You think you should feel super different, but you're actually just right where you're supposed to be."
Grimes,"I feel ready to totally blow all of my shit up and make something new. I'm in a place of extreme displacement. You know when you just feel like you have a lot to lose? With my last album, I kept getting in trouble for saying stupid shit in the press or tweeting dumb shit. I just run my mouth like a fucking asshole and there's nothing I can do about it. I don't think before I speak. I try to, but I don't think in words. I just think in weird pictures."
Interviewer,"I get that. For better or worse, when you're not used to being a super-extroverted person, you end up saying what you said for some reason that's going to end up being important to you in hindsight. It's not the easiest, it might be a little messy, but you have to get used to the tumult of the public nature of things."
Grimes,"I was reading yesterday about outrage culture, and for just about every emotionally loaded word that's in a tweet, the tweet gets 15 percent more interaction. We live in this weird time where we didn't evolve to engage with this many people, and we didn't evolve to be observed as much as we're being observed, or to observe other people as much as we're observing them. No one is considering the psychological impact of all this crazy technology. Especially since Trump was elected, this is the first time that the general public is fully on the internet. Grandma is on the internet."
Interviewer,"I think about that all the time. It's important to say it out loud. It's a little bit like the Wild West again in the way that we are learning how to deal with each other on a mass level and an instant, interconnected level. I've been trying to create my own blueprint. It's like, how do you fit into the culture and still live your own life the way you authentically would?"
Grimes,I do think everybody's going to have to get a lot better at forgiving.
Interviewer,I agree.
Grimes,"I can have a pretty extensive moral, ethical disagreement with somebody, and it still makes more sense to get along than to not get along. If you ever go read old census documents before the printing press from France or Russia, nobody had the same name. Just crazy-ass names all over the place. And then after the printing press, everyone started having the same 20 or 30 names. We entered this monoculture zone where everything got more centered into single sources of power. Everyone was in agreement on who the biggest stars in the world were. Everybody knew Michael Jackson and Madonna. But now, with the internet and all of these different forms of media, we're entering a new period of customization again where people are able to customize their existence more. I feel like the kids of the millennials are just going to have wild names."
Interviewer,I don't know which way my kid will go.
Grimes,Do you have any names in mind?
Interviewer,"I think it could go anywhere from a simple Maria Estela to, like, Ivory Cricket. Oh, god. That's a soundbite."
Grimes,"Knowing our fate, the headline will be that your unborn child is named Ivory Cricket."
Interviewer,Is it important to you to be right in the middle of the culture?
Grimes,"Man, I don't know. You hit a phase where you lose your life. I open the internet sometimes, and it's like, ""Grimes is testifying in court,"" and I'm like, ""What the fuck is this? I'm definitely not testifying in court."" I call my lawyer:""Am I testifying in court?"" And they're like, ""No, you're definitely not testifying in court.""."
Interviewer,It has a level of surreality to it.
Grimes,"I've hit this point where there's so much stuff that people think about me that has no basis in reality that I feel like I have to remove myself from my public self. I had to kill my ego, because there was no way to remain invested in myself as having anything to do with the culture while surviving mentally."
Interviewer,"There are cycles to it. You can have years of ambivalence, and then it's like that natural female hot and cold cycle. You can come back into caring extremely and being invested in yourself and your work, and then not caring at all. I think the good thing about what's going on with you is that for all the hardship and the confusion, you can continue to make music and people will be intrigued because there have been so many little twists and turns."
Grimes,"I think my motto in life is just, ""Don't be bored."" Even if I'm having the worst time, I'm like, ""Wow, this rules."" In some of my worst moments I remember thinking, ""Damn, this is such sick fodder for my eventual book."" Speaking of which, would you ever write a book?"
Interviewer,"It's funny, people have been asking me that lately. Ever since I started caring a bit less, and, like you said, disregarding ego,which is easy for me, thankfully,I've been writing more short stanza poetry. And now that I've done that, I was thinking, ""Would I ever write something long-form?"" I think I would want to, but honestly, I'm so hyperactive in my life. I don't know if I could complete it, so I think it might be something like chicken scratch, all placed together in some long-form novel."
Grimes,"I was reading a study of the average age of artists. People are always saying shit like, ""Oh, you're so much less creative as you get older,"" like your brain becomes less plastic and more static, which I actually disagree with."
Interviewer,"Yeah, me too."
Grimes,"What's interesting is that most novelists peak in their sixties. When I think about many of my favorite books, it's mostly old-ass people who wrote them. My thought was, ""Oh, I'll just wait until I'm old and out of musical ideas, and then I'll sit down and write a novel."" I'll be so much more physically lazy when I'm old, too, so I'll probably be way happier to sit down for 12 hours a day."
Interviewer,Do you have more of a kinship to any particular artist community?
Grimes,"I don't know if I really relate to any creative community. I get jealous sometimes of the country music scene or rappers. I love scenes. Like, I love how Trent Reznor and Marilyn Manson worked together."
Interviewer,"I was singing with Weyes Blood  at a couple of shows, and I was like, ""You know what? This feels so good."" You have to work for it when there's not a natural scene exploding. You definitely have to get all your girls together."
Grimes,"I feel like female artists do it less. I might be wrong, but I feel like female artists especially need to stick together more."
Interviewer,"It's really amazing to get everybody together, especially in a more alternative scene where you're writing your own stuff."
Grimes,"It's interesting to hear you say the word ""alternative,"" because one thing that I've been loving lately is that it's had a resurgence since Trump. I'd say the peak of alternative music over the last ten years was when people like Kanye or Beyoncé would do this god-level A&R-ing, with all the smartest, most creative people combined onto one record. As we're talking about the death of the monoculture, I think more alternative music is starting to exist. I guess by ""alternative,"" I just mean, as you were saying, people writing their own stuff."
Interviewer,"And with the element of obvious authenticity or thoughtfulness to it. When you hear a Grimes song, you know that it's a Grimes song."
Grimes,"It's almost like gaydar. I can hear when someone is singing their own words. You hear someone like Rez or Peggy Gou, and for some reason, I just know they make their music."
Interviewer,"It's not that it's better, it's just super special."
Grimes,"I agree. Some people want to say one or the other is better. The battle should stop. Being someone who always looks good on camera, who can dance and sing,even if you don't write your own music, being a top-tier performer has got to be one of the hardest jobs in the world."
Interviewer,"Like Whitney Houston. How much of your identity do you feel is being a singer, and how much is being an artist?"
Grimes,"I feel like my whole identity is about being an artist. I was really sick earlier this year, and I had to spend two weeks in bed. I couldn't think and I couldn't make anything. It was crazy how my self-esteem just plummeted. I was a shell of a human."
Interviewer,"There definitely has to be an edge. I like to drive around and find a really strange spot to gather my thoughts. But in terms of what I'm writing, in my personal life I have to be really, really happy."
Grimes,"Oh, wow. That's crazy."
Interviewer,"I know, and I feel like people wouldn't expect that from me. I have to write when all the dust has settled, because I really need things to be calm for me to try and put my finger on what I'm seeing or picturing. It's hard to write if I'm not feeling stable in my own life, but then I like to mix up where I'm physically at and write somewhere crazy."
Grimes,Like where?
Interviewer,"If I could write in the middle of a crime scene, I probably would. Do you feel like you write when you're in love?"
Grimes,"I so need to be in love to make good art. The best is being heartbroken, or in a volatile relationship. My worst creative periods have been when I've just been in a stable relationship. In my current relationship, we're both super alpha, crazy people. It's just level ten all the time, which is great, even though it's very crazy."
Interviewer,"I don't know if that's what I would have thought, honestly."
Grimes,"On my last record, I was in this gender-neutral mindset. I was an asexual person. Fuck my sexuality. Fuck femininity. Fuck being a girl. I was having this weird reaction to society where I just hated my femaleness. It was like, to be a producer, I felt like I had to be a man."
Interviewer,"I think it also comes down to a general lack of passion, too. Sometimes having a bit of that neutrality can swing us into something that's opposite, where suddenly there is a real power struggle. I can see how you can feel alive in volatility, and I've done it before. There are a thousand places to write from."
Grimes,"I love fixing problems with writing. Almost all my good songs are from some nightmare day where I'm just bawling my eyes out, and then I have to sit down and put it into a thing. I make so much music if I'm in a fight with my boyfriend or a friend, and I just want to impress them."
Interviewer,That's so funny.
Grimes,"I love trying to win somebody back by writing them a song. On my last record I was like, ""I don't care. I'm not trying to impress anybody."" And on my new record I'm trying to impress everyone."
Interviewer,"When I think of your work as a whole, a lot of it is about creating and inhabiting alternate landscapes. Where does the desire to be a world-builder come from? Were you reading a lot of sci-fi as a kid?"
Grimes,I feel like any world-building I've done has been premature.
Interviewer,Why?
Grimes,"It's all been untethered strings that don't really come together. When I was three, my dad read me Dune and The Lord of the Rings. I never read children's books. I've always been really thankful to him for that."
Interviewer,"There are so few representations of women on screen that are wholly authored by women. You have such authorial control over the whole process, from conception to execution. When I see you do these things, it feels like a political act, like you're saying, ""Fuck all of the bullshit stereotypical patriarchal roles that women are allowed to be inside entertainment,"" whether that's the virgin, the whore, or the mother. It feels like you're making characters that are mischievous and carnal and brilliant. I've had so many moments watching your work where I've been like, ""Oh my god. If I could embody that character in a film, that's the role I want to play.""."
Grimes,"That's how I feel about you. People were like, ""You've got to watch The OA."" I'm like, ""Well, what is it?"" I don't know how to describe what it is. I always tell people that it's the closest thing to IRL anime. It's a cartoon-style narrative that is committed to film."
Interviewer,"That's in your work, too. We allow magic to happen inside anime because it's a cartoon, but when you put it in real life, it's harder for people to digest."
Grimes,"It's also a cost thing in real life. If you're animating something crazy, it normally won't cost a thing, whereas on film, something crazy is very expensive. We're always negotiating the cost versus the craziness, which is why we always end up editing ourselves."
Interviewer,"On The OA at least, if you don't control every part of the process, you fail miserably because what you're doing is so far-out. If you tell a sound engineer, ""The 16-foot telepathic octopus is rising out of the tank for human contact, make the sound of that,"" everybody thinks it sounds like something different, because it's never happened before."
Grimes,"How do you do it? When I see The OA and see hours of narrative, I'm like, ""What the fuck?"" It takes me a month to make a three-minute video."
Interviewer,"When I watch your videos, I think ""What the fuck?"" too. To me, you're speaking in the poetry of symbolism."
Grimes,"I've been obsessed with symbolism lately. Mac  was telling me that in the medieval times, when literacy was at its lowest, everything got really symbolic, like the cross. Nuance got lost. I feel like we're going back to a time like that, where everything is symbolic. No one reads past a headline because our attention spans are so short."
Interviewer,Everything is reduced to an archetype.
Grimes,"The same symbols are being fed to people, and they're gathering completely opposite meanings from them, and it's creating chaos."
Interviewer,"The American flag means one thing to one group of people, and one thing to another. To one, it's a metaphor for freedom. To another, it's an image of oppression. That duality of symbolism applies to so many things. But we live in an increasingly complex time where it's hard to grasp things in symbols. We're having to deal with all of these hyperobjects. Climate change is a hyperobject that people cannot wrap their minds around, because, among other things, it involves a contemplation of time that is off the scope of the human body. We're at a moment when we need nuanced, layered thinking more than ever, and somehow the moment is being met with a real shrinking away from context or depth. What is something technology related that hasn't yet come, but feels inevitable?"
Grimes,"What scares me is an artificial intelligence getting online, seeing everybody's search history, and then blackmailing all of us into doing whatever it wants. It just feels inevitable. We've all sent weird e-mails or texts. Even if there are laws to prevent that, there will eventually be a sentient technology that is smart enough and strong enough and has access to take everyone's shit, and then can make anyone do whatever it wants, Jeffrey Epstein-style. My theory on Epstein is that he had tapes of people with underage girls, and that's how he was getting all this stuff from all these people. Someone gave him a house and a plane. It's like, ""What the fuck?"" It reeks of deep blackmail to me. If you have everybody's stuff, you can control the world. It seems a lot easier than a violent takeover. If I'm an AI, do I hold everyone hostage with nuclear bombs, or do I just blackmail everyone? Killing a lot of people seems hard."
Interviewer,"It's thinking about power in a limited way. With old versions of power you would harness an army, kill a lot of people, and have power. AI is way ahead of that. AI's like, ""Actually, I only need to control 12 people on the planet. As long as I control those 12 people, the world is going to look like what I want it to look like.""."
Grimes,"I might be wrong, and I might be aggrandizing here, but I feel like this might be one of the most important times in history. Especially in the last two years, it feels like we've walked right up to the edge between the old world and the new world. It's like before the pyramids and after the pyramids. We're at a ""pyramids got built"" moment. We're going to be digitizing reality and colonizing space simultaneously, which may be two of the craziest things that will have occurred in the history of humanity. It's going to happen while we're alive and while we're young, which is nuts. I was going to make this podcast called The Last Artist, and I really wanted you to come on. Did I tell you about this?"
Interviewer,What's it about?
Grimes,"I was like, ""Man, we're, like, the last artists."" We might be in the last decade of people who get to make art without competing against computers that are ten million times better and faster and more exciting and more intelligent. We might be some of the last human artists who aren't completely rendered obsolete by artificial intelligence."
Interviewer,You just gave me a wave of chills.
Grimes,"This might be the most important time ever to make art, because this might be the last human art that anyone ever cares about."
Interviewer,"Somebody was showing me a painting that was auctioned at Sotheby's or Christie's that was made by AI. When I looked at the painting, I felt that it was objectively good modern art. But on a level of meaning or depth, it didn't resonate. Mark Rothko was painting those horizontal color fields, and an AI could imitate that, but I don't think it could ever give you the feeling you have in a museum when you're surrounded by huge Rothkos, that's, for lack of a better word, holy. I don't mean religious, I just mean something deep and unknowable."
Grimes,Computers will get there. A computer just needs to learn how to emulate hormones. Computers will learn how to feel everything we feel. They'll be able to be better humans than us. They'll be able to make more emotional art. They'll be able to access that inaccessible thing.
Interviewer,"If the objective of art has often been to be a lighthouse in the dark, to say, ""Hey, come this way,"" or to expose fraudulent things for what they actually are, what does it mean if something other than human beings is authoring that force of rebellion?"
Grimes,"That feels even more rebellious to me. I feel like we've been living through human rebellion for years. To me, that's going to be such brilliant, moving art like we've never seen. It would be great if we could coexist, because I actually do think there is something special about carbon-based life. I don't think it can just be replaced. Everyone's so worried about the evil AI wiping us out. I think the AI will be cool."
Interviewer,What do you think it is about carbon-based life that might be different or valuable?
Grimes,"We're always looking for our maker:""Who is our god? Who created us?"" What's interesting is, for AI, we are their god. That will be the first intelligent being that knows its creator, and knows everything about us."
Interviewer,Intimately.
Grimes,About our fucking bowel movements.
Interviewer,Our porn habits. Our everything.
Grimes,I think it's beautiful that we're bound by these evolutionary things like procreation. A limited intelligence is actually more interesting in a world where there is limitless intelligence.
Interviewer,"Sometimes I read a novel that introduces a completely new way of thinking about things, and I'm gobsmacked. Human beings are capable of stunning feats of imagination, which is why I am still hopeful. Even though when you read climate change reports, you're just like, ""Oh, my god."" But I'm hopeful because I feel like the human capacity to imagine different things is pretty awesome. We just need to get our act together."
Grimes,"The problem with everything is corruption. In theory, capitalism should work."
Interviewer,"Capitalism, even if there wasn't corruption, is a model that doesn't work for most people, because its only goal is the increase of profit, which means that there's somebody at the top of the pyramid and most people at the bottom who get paid less than their work is worth for profit to be extracted. I think part of the reason there's been so much climate change denial is that if you acknowledge that this economic system leads to ecological ruin, you have to acknowledge in the same breath that it's broken."
Grimes,"What do you think is the answer? I feel like society has not yet proposed the answer of how to structure itself. We're getting closer all the time, but I haven't yet heard a proposition where I'm like, ""That would just unequivocally work.""."
Interviewer,"I think it's somewhere in the arena of putting value in places where it's been hard for us to put value. Right now, we put value in growth, and everything is just endless, ridiculous growth, even though we're on a finite planet with dwindling resources and more people every day. Let's say, just for a moment, you put the value on caregiving."
Grimes,"Which should have more value. I was just thinking the other day how much I didn't appreciate my mom growing up. I remember thinking, ""Why did you wake me up for school? This bitch. Fuck. Why?"" I thought I was getting up to go to school for her. I was like, ""This is what she wants me to do."" But she definitely didn't want to go upstairs three times and scream at me to get out of bed at seven in the morning."
Interviewer,"And make three meals a day and clean the house and do all of that work. Unpaid domestic labor is actually the basis upon which all other labor occurs. You cannot become a CEO until your mother did all that unpaid domestic labor first, which is crazy."
Grimes,"I've done some babysitting lately, and I've just been like, ""Oh, fuck. Kids are nightmare creatures."" You have to stop them from being evil, and it's existentially threatening. They just said something crazy, and if you don't shut it down in the right way, they might turn out to be Hitler."
Interviewer,"Can you imagine what it would be like if we were living in a world where that skillset or devotion was valued, or you valued reusing things instead of the high you get off of buying new things? What if your social currency came from figuring out how to repair something in your house rather than just buying the new thing? We've put value in a lot of dangerous places, and now we're reaping what we've sown."
Grimes,"Yeah. I like the carbon tax thing. I like the idea of making flying prohibitively expensive. When I fly home to see my grandparents, it's really nice, but I feel guilty about it. I'm like, I'm close enough to just being able to put on an Oculus, and they put on an Oculus, and we're sitting in the same room."
Interviewer,"When you reach out to touch something in the Oculus, alternate reality is there. Your brain gives you signals that you're about to touch something, even though you don't touch anything."
Grimes,"And then, when you come out, everything's a little bit wonky. Fuck. I don't know. We need to get deeper into the digital world, and we also need to get further away from it."
Interviewer,"Does a song first take shape for you on piano or guitar before you move on to choosing the sound palette, recording the instruments, the vocals? Or are songwriting and producing more interwoven?"
Grimes,"I would say the latter, they are very interwoven for me. It's sort of a seamless process where I produce as I write."
Interviewer,How do you make beats? Are there pads involved or is it all mouse/trackpad?
Grimes,"A bit of both. I like to use an Akai MPC and a keyboard MIDI controller, but sometimes I build it out manually. I like to build sample packs that I use mostly for drum sources. Usually by combining drums (like the high end of a real kick and the low end of a digital kick, for example). Once I get a good one I use it a lot. I have some sample packs that my friend Bloodpop made or acquired that I like to use as well. I typically start with kick / snare and work backwards."
Interviewer,We've heard you put a lot of consideration into finding the right tempo for a given track. Do you tend to try out different tempos for each song that you're working on?
Grimes,"I think tempo is really important. Fast can be amazing, but then you have to simplify the drums. Slow can be amazing, but then you have to really perfect the groove. This is something I agonize over."
Interviewer,How do you approach sound design in general? Are you always listening out for interesting sounds around you? How do you capture them and where do they end up?
Grimes,"I'm always listening for interesting sounds. Like, for example, I recently took a sample of some percussion that had a lot of melodic information in it, put the verb up to 100% and then sampled the verb so that none of the original sample was there but it contained the melodic information. Sometimes I record things in the house like beads or whatever etc. Sometimes I get found samples from online bird watching communities or this or that, haha. Usually I use some combination of these methods."
Interviewer,Your tracks usually have quite a lot going on in them. How do you keep an overview of all the elements when you're working?
Grimes,My files are way too messy and I'm trying to be more organized and controlled with it lately. I do use a lot of layering. It's gets very complicated very fast and I crash my files a lot.
Interviewer,"How do you know when a track is finished? Do you tend to follow an ""add until the picture is complete"" or ""remove until only the essentials are left"" strategy?"
Grimes,"I'm more in the 'remove until only the essentials are left' strategy camp, but then the versions of the songs I play live end up being the best because I get the mixed stems back and then add a lot of new sounds. I usually finish via a self-imposed deadline. In my opinion, there was a lot more I would have liked to do on most of my released tracks."
Interviewer,"As can be seen on your tumblr, your musical tastes and interests are pretty wide-ranging. Of the artists (new and old) that you're into, is there anything specifically production-related that you particularly admire or would like to get into more deeply?"
Grimes,"I love the production on the new Lana Del Rey album, Honeymoon. Specifically the song Art Deco. I like how it sounds old but new. I also love the song ""BBHMM"" by Rihanna. I feel like both Rihanna and Lana are often able to create compelling pop songs with really wet vocals. I kind of hate dry vocals, but they are so essential to solid pop songs in most people's minds."
Interviewer,How do you translate what you've made in the studio into something that can be played live? How do parts get 'assigned' to the musicians you have with you on stage?
Grimes,"The musician I'm touring with currently, named HANA, is a really incredible multi-instrumentalist and vocalist so she has been adding a lot creatively lately, and taking on things like lead guitar in some songs that used to just be a sample. We also jam a lot on the bus or in hotels, doing vocal harmonies and things, so we have a good musical rapport and that's become very important to me on stage."
Interviewer,How are you?
Grimes,"Not bad. Well, actually, I'm very pregnant. I'm very slow and very tired. I'm slow as fuck so do not judge. My brain is like 10 per cent down."
Interviewer,How is being pregnant impacting you?
Grimes,It's just the last little bit. Mostly it's been OK. At the beginning it was hard. I feel much more sympathy for my mom now.
Interviewer,How many weeks pregnant are you?
Grimes,31.
Interviewer,What has it meant for your music?
Grimes,"Productivity is down but ideas are up, which is interesting. I have tons and tons of ideas but I'm just not executing them very well. But I'm getting a lot of shon paper, which is great. It's just a stamina issue really and singing is hard."
Interviewer,Will you become one of these artists who writes endless songs about being a parent?
Grimes,No. I don't know if that's artistically compelling to people. It's not even compelling to me.
Interviewer,How has the process of making music changed for you in recent years?
Grimes,"In a lot of ways it is the same. Music for me is kind of like this weird meditative state/chill state. I typically work alone. I lock myself in a room and it's a chill zone. But as you become increasingly in the public eye, it becomes more intense obviously. But the actual function of making music retains this nice quality for me like it was in the beginning. And it's important for me to preserve that. I think the main difference is I'd probably drop a lot more music if the pressure wasn't so high."
Interviewer,Do you think about the balance between making music that is commercial and following your creative urges?
Grimes,"I feel like I'm luckily in a weird position where people don't expect me to be making radio hits. I'm thinking 'How do I become Radiohead' not 'How do I become Taylor Swift'. The thing I'm aiming at personally is just great immortal art, if I can get there. I kind of love that goal. I don't presume that I'm ever getting there. Especially with Miss Anthropocene, I was just like I want to make something fuck ing crazy. The main goal is to make something really different from anything else. That's like jarring and emotional as opposed to making a hit, which one day I hope to do."
Interviewer,Did your years in Montreal have a big influence on you?
Grimes,"I think Montreal was incredibly essential to my development as an artist. I can't speak to the vibe there currently but when I was coming up, the scene was thriving like crazy. A lot of people were showing me how to do things. I was playing a lot of shows. I played so many shows locally before I got on the road. Most artists when they break, they haven't played a lot of shows... Montreal, you can play 100 shows before you go play in other cities. There's such a focus on creativity and experimentalism. I think that scenes can be really important and helpful and amazing. It's a really cool thing. Like Arcade Fire introduced me to a lot of people I still work with. There's this cool mentoring aspect of things and most cities don't have that."
Interviewer,What was your reaction when some of your fans objected to your relationship with Elon Musk?
Grimes,"I understand it. It's just part of the thing. I respect people's opinions and I get where people are coming from. I respectfully disagree. There's been a lot of sensationalistic stories that paint things in a different light than they actually are, but people are mad because they care about the world being better and they misunderstand what my boyfriend does. I respect that the impulse is coming from a good place. They're mad because they believe in certain things and I can't really criticize that. I think my boyfriend works really fuck ing hard to fix a lot of our environmental issues but I totally get that some people don't approve of how he's doing that."
Interviewer,What's your take on American politics as a Canadian in L.A.?
Grimes,"I really appreciated growing up having access to good health care and I didn't go into major debt by going to college. And I think those things make Canada better. Canadians tend to be, on average, compared to Americans, a lot less angry and in a lot less pain. I don't know any Canadians who're $400,000 in debt because of a medical problem or school. And that makes life better when there isn't some shhanging over your head. It leads to a better mental state in society in general. There's just a lot less hatred and a lot less anger. So I think it's cool that certain candidates are proposing more Canadian-like ways of living. A lot of Americans say it's impossible but I say, look at Canada. Obviously it's not perfect but it does seem to be a better living standard than in America and I think it leads to a more peaceful society."
Interviewer,I read that you actually studied neuroscience in college? Or just the sciences generally?
Grimes,"Actually, I was in a program at McGill called Electroacoustics, where we studied a lot of how the brain interacts with music. So by the time I actually started making music, I kind of had an understanding of frequencies and kind of how the brain responds to things, which I think really helped me as a producer:Even though I had no experience playing instruments and stuff, I kind of had a basic understanding of engineering. My learning curve was maybe a tiny bit shorter than maybe someone who hadn't studied that stuff."
Interviewer,"So how does that inform the music? One of the things I like about electronic music is the sensory overload, the drops, the highs and lows of it, are directly triggering things in my brain. Is there a song on this album where you feel like your knowledge about how we hear things affects how many tracks there are, how many layers, how many sounds?"
Grimes,"I don't know if it's actually that practically useful, honestly. Because you can study music to death; you can study the brain's response to music to death. But it's not the same thing as making music, which is very gut-level."
Interviewer,"Can you remember when you first thought of yourself as a producer? I mean, was there an early song, before people knew you, even, where you realized you like the tinkering, the putting it together?"
Grimes,"Probably from the first time I tried to make music. Singing has always been a struggle for me, so when I first started making music, I only made instrumentals."
Interviewer,"When you finally did start to sing, was it a surprise to you?"
Grimes,"Kind of! I mean, I wasn't good, but I was not the worst, which was extremely encouraging to me. The fact that I wasn't literally the worst singer on planet Earth made me think that I was, like, a god. Immediately I was like, Oh, I don't suck? OK, I'm gonna be a musician. Like, right away."
Interviewer,"So when you first sat down, what were the circumstances? What drew you to it?"
Grimes,"Basically, I'd been at a friend's house; he said he wanted a girl vocal. I was like, I'm really a bad singer, but I did it anyway, and then I was like, oh, music isn't that hard. So I got my friend to show me how to use GarageBand, and then I just kind of started making terrible, terrible songs using the built-in synths and stuff, just screwing around with that."
Interviewer,"It's interesting, I think electronic music changes the bar of entry for people who want to get into music, right?"
Grimes,"Oh, yeah. I think, I mean, in a sad way I think it's one of the reasons experimental electronic music isn't more popular, is that it's so hard to turn it into a live thing; it's more of a laptop thing. But definitely, in the scene I came from, you don't need to be a good musician to make electronic music, you just need to have a good ear. You don't need to be able to technically perform anything."
Interviewer,"So now that there's so much of this music out there, how do you determine what's good? Who are the artists that inspire you, who are doing similar work?"
Grimes,"Oh my gosh. I love 40, who produces for Drake, I think he's one of the best producers. I love Burial. I mean, most of my favorite producers produce for vocalists; I don't listen to a lot of straight electronic music that doesn't have vocals. This is a totally crazy thing, and I'm significantly worse and significantly less popular, but in a way Calvin Harris is probably the most similar to me in terms of functionality. He's a great producer, he's a songwriter, but he doesn't necessarily sing all his songs. He does sing, he's decent at it, but it's not like his main thing."
Interviewer,"What has it been like over the years asserting yourself in the studio? Because the model that we all hear about in the music press is young women performing songs that they may have written, but the production is usually a man, especially if you look at the Top 40. Have you found that people in that setting want to provide the beats for you?"
Grimes,"I've never actually worked in a studio on one of my songs, I've only worked in a studio in writing camps for other people, which were odd experiences. I wasn't allowed to touch a computer, for example, even though guys in the studio were allowed to. I obviously know how to use a computer and I know how to produce, but I had to tell the engineer what to do if I wanted to do anything, which I thought was pretty crazy in the 21st century."
Interviewer,"This might have been a union thing, too, right? Because you're the writer."
Grimes,"No, no, there were producers coming in, and I don't think I was brought in only to do vocals and top line. Even if I was, that's kind of weird because I'm way more of a producer than a vocalist. So, I mean, it was pretty gendered. Luckily, I mostly work in my own house and I don't work with other people, kind of for this reason."
Interviewer,"For people who don't know, writer's camps are basically like a retreat, where you get put into groups and you're supposed to write, collaboratively, for another artist. What was that experience like for you, an artist who's pretty self-contained?"
Grimes,"In a way, it was a blessing in disguise:I got to watch so many great producers work, because I wasn't allowed to produce anything. I actually did learn quite a bit about production. But on the other hand, it was very daunting, even just as a writer writing top line, because I felt like it was extremely judgmental. It was kind of assumed that I was stupid and that I didn't know what was going on, and especially because I don't feel confident as a vocalist, it was very stressful to have that be the thing that I was evaluated on."
Interviewer,And you described it as gendered.
Grimes,"Yeah, well, just that all the guys made beats and all the girls did top line."
Interviewer,Top line meaning the melody.
Grimes,"Yeah, basically the melody that the vocal is doing. Like, there were no girls doing beats and there were no guys doing top line. But, I don't know, I don't want to criticize it too much."
Interviewer,"No, I mean, they're big business, right? Lots of people are making money and songs in this way. But it's sort of hard to picture, given how many women we see in the Top 40. A lot of the biggest names in music are women right now."
Grimes,"I think it's just ... you know, I came in with experience as a producer and I wasn't allowed to produce, so how could any woman who didn't have experience as a producer ever learn how to produce? It was just a little odd in that regard. If there are stereotypes of, Women do certain jobs in music and men do certain jobs, the way the studio works, it's not easy to escape that."
Interviewer,"As your career has gotten bigger and more and more people are hearing your music, do you hear from young women who want to be doing what you're doing?"
Grimes,"I guess I do! If you meet fans outside of a concert or something like that, someone will be like, You inspired me to start producing, and I make records now. Which is pretty cool, I mean, not even from a music perspective, but being visible as a woman in technology is sort of interesting, and hopefully inspires women not just to touch computers in music but for other purposes as well."
Interviewer,"I want to talk about one song that I was, I feel like, almost surprised to hear on this album, which is Easily. It sounds like you very much enjoying your own voice."
Grimes,"Oh, really? It's actually my least favorite song on the album!"
Interviewer,What don't you like about it? I think it's quite sweet.
Grimes,"I just think it's really basic. I only put it on because when I showed my friends all the songs they were all like, You have to keep that song. Don't ditch that one. But I personally think it's not very interesting from a production standpoint."
Interviewer,"That makes sense given a lot of the other music we've heard from you, which is just layers and layers of sounds. This is just you."
Grimes,"It kind of makes me uncomfortable! But usually, the songs other people like are the songs that make me the most uncomfortable, so I usually try to allow some of those to make it onto the record."
Interviewer,"Do you ever want your voice, or your music, to sound ugly? Like, do those songs, in a way, kind of go against the way you have presented your voice, which is not about being bubbly?"
Grimes,"Yeah, I do kind of like songs more like SCREAM. They feel more natural to me. I like to have at least one thing in a song that's a bit jarring, that throws people off."
Interviewer,"Right, which in SCREAM is super-effective. You have this Taiwanese rapper, Aristophanes, who is delivering on such great menace, and then the chorus has this primal, punk-like scream. It's interesting to hear that next to this other side of your music, which almost reminds me of The Bangles or something."
Grimes,"The other thing about songs that are really singing-oriented is that they're much harder to perform live. Singing live is twice as hard as singing in a quiet, nice studio, where you can do 50 takes and choose the best one."
Interviewer,"So when you're at a show, what are you oriented toward? Are you thinking more about setting up the computers and the sound design than that moment when you're going to have to take the mic and maybe sing something pretty bare? Do you avoid those songs as a result?"
Grimes,"I do. I actually do not play either Easily or California live. And I also often have to change the top line so that it's easier to sing, stuff like that."
Interviewer,"You've made this distinction between having to perform this music you create on stage and like trying to get that to translate, not just for the audience but for yourself. Do you like performing?"
Grimes,"Well, it's complicated. It's not my favorite thing, but it is way better than working at Starbucks. I just have terrible, terrible stage fright. It's definitely not what I would do if I could make a living doing something else, but it's on the better end of jobs."
Interviewer,"Stage fright doesn't seem like a good match for some of the stages you're playing. You're doing Coachella, these are big, big stages."
Grimes,"I mean, you can always override it, it's just very difficult."
Interviewer,"Does the persona help? Like, does being Grimes help?"
Grimes,"I suppose so. When you're kind of just bombarding people with crazy, it's so much less daunting than when you have to be a sweet, great vocalist who can do runs and stuff. Especially at festivals where you don't get to soundcheck and you have no idea if it's going to sound good or bad. Last time I played Coachella I had no in-ear  at all. I had to do the whole set completely deaf and just hope it was OK."
Interviewer,How were the reviews?
Grimes,"Uh, great! I mean, muscle memory is a hell of a thing."
Interviewer,"With this album, do you feel like you have advanced your music significantly? You've done the videos and the songs and the production and even the cover art, does it feel like a milestone for you?"
Grimes,"Oh, yeah. I mean this is, for me, my first record that I think is good. Not that the other records aren't good, but they're so amateur. I made them not thinking anyone would ever listen to them, so there's tons of songs without lyrics, because I just sort of did a random vocal and was like, That's good enough. There's a lot more care put into this record, because it was the first record I made knowing that I had a sizable audience."
Interviewer,"Going forward, what direction do you want to take this? Do you see a future where maybe you don't bother with those vocals at all and you become Grimes, super-producer?"
Grimes,"I could see that. The problem with that is when you produce for other people, you're subject to their whims and fancies and you have to do what they want, which I'm really bad at. Like, in the camps, you go in and they're like, OK, it has to be 135 BPM. It has to be in this key. I'm like, I don't even read music! I don't know how to do that."
Interviewer,"I just want to follow up on something you said earlier, about your voice, and being vulnerable and just kind of out there. In a way, do you feel like you have been both rewarded and penalized for your voice?"
Grimes,"Yeah, I think my voice definitely bothers some people. Some people really like it. People hate my lisp:When I was in high school, I remember people would be like, Ugh, I don't want to talk to you! You have a lisp. It's so annoying. But I don't know, I like having a weird voice. All my favorite singers, even if they're not the best, they have a voice that you can immediately recognize. I think that's a really awesome trait."
Interviewer,"Let me start by saying I love Visions. It sounds a lot more pop-oriented than your past music, maybe with the exception of Vanessa. Was that a conscious decision or did it just sort of happen that way?"
Grimes,"It definitely just happened. I think I always wanted to make dance music, or pop music, it took me a while to figure it out. 'Vanessa' was the first song where I was like, 'oh yeah!' I achieved that. Really, I've just sort of been getting better at making music and I'm getting more able to make the music I want to make. It's almost more of a realization of what I've been wanting to do for a while."
Interviewer,What were you listening to when you recorded Visions? What other artists influence you?
Grimes,"A lot of TLC, kind of new jack swing-era music. A lot of early '90s. A lot of Mariah. Whitney Houston. TLC, at least vocally, was more influential, because I think they do really cool stuff. And Outkast."
Interviewer,What's your favorite TLC song?
Grimes,"It's really weird. It sounds like Black Dice. It's this song called, 'If I Was Your Girlfriend,' and it's really cool. Instrumentally, it's weird and experimental, digital distortion on the drums and stuff like that."
Interviewer,Do you have a song on Visions that you like to play live?
Grimes,"Yeah, probably the song called ""Be A Body."" It's my favorite song on the album; it's my favorite song to play."
Interviewer,"That's actually my favorite song on the new album too, I was wondering if you could explain the characters following the title?"
Grimes," It's really stupid, because I don't want to seem like some Asia-phile. I'm so embarrassed about that, but it's the Japanese characters for wabi-sabi, which is a concept that implies, or is about, non-attachment, and not being too attached to physical stuff. The song is kind of about being in the moment. It's about experiencing the physical world, right now, and not being attached to things."
Interviewer,When you're on tour is there a ritual or good luck charm that makes you feel ready to go on stage?
Grimes,"I have this thing where, if I see a bulldog, it means I'll play a good show that day. So I'm always looking out for bulldogs on the street because they fill me with positive energy, I guess. It sounds insane, but every time I'd see a bulldog I'd play a great show, and then it sort of became psychological. But If I see two bulldogs, then it counts for two shows...."
Interviewer,"You could have a ""bulldog bank"" where you've seen more bulldogs than you have shows coming up."
Grimes,"Yeah, exactly. And if I got really rich or famous I'd have a bulldog on my rider, so there's always a bulldog hanging out back stage."
Interviewer,It's near the end of the year. Have you thought about your favorite albums 2011?
Grimes,"Maybe the Holy Other EP and the new AraabMUZIK. I dunno, I haven't actually thought about it, and I always find out about stuff late, so I always say something is my favorite album of the year and it's from the year before, oh, Wander/Wonder by Balam Acab. I really love that record. Everything Tri Angle put out this year is really good."
Interviewer,One last question
Grimes,"I don't know if you've ever seen The Mists of Avalon, but one of the crazy Druid ladies has this really cool hair style where she has a single braid coming out of the top of head, and the rest of her head is shaved. I would never do it because I'm trying to grow out my hair, but I always thought that was really cool."
Interviewer,How did you first become familiar with Discord?
Grimes,"I actually learned about Discord because I needed this teenager to help me figure out how to rig up a 3-D model it's sort of a long story. I had a technical issue, and the person who was going to teach me how to solve it was like, ""I only use Discord,"" because they were, like, 14. And then if I was doing any kind of group gaming situation, I would be on Discord, because it's fun if you're playing games with a bunch of people and everybody is chatting. So I was using it for social, personal life stuff."
Interviewer,What did you like about Discord that led you to launch your own official server?
Grimes,"I was thinking we should launch a Grimes server for a long time. The more I get into the gaming community, it's a lot less toxic than the indie music stan community. Everyone's going to laugh at me saying that gaming culture is less toxic than indie stan culture, but it's kind of true, frankly, having lived in both extensively.  a more healthy social media. Social media really gets into incentivizing sensationalism, and incentivizing the negative. I started realizing that even in general, I was using my fake accounts way more than my real accounts. Social media is a lot healthier if you're mostly with your friends, and you're using it to an end as opposed to just a time-sucking situation. I'm really into, I guess you could call it ""humane technology."
Interviewer,Right nobody is joining a Discord server to hate on something. Users are really only gathering around things that they love.
Grimes,"You're proactively joining a fandom or a game or a pursuit that you're digging, as opposed to passively consuming information that an algorithm is deciding for you. I don't have flashes of PTSD when I open Discord the way I do with Twitter.  and being like, ""I like Grimes!"" And then there's 30 people coming in explaining to them why they shouldn't, and not even with factual information. I feel like it happens with other artists, too. I'm just really looking for better fan experiences. It sucks when you want people to engage, and then you feel like they get bullied or harassed when they engage. That's a main priority for me in my life right now"
Interviewer,How do you think it went when you teased Shinigami Eyes?
Grimes,I like playing a  song live. It's hard for people to just grab it and upload it. I like testing things on people without knowing it's going to live on the internet forever. I think our next Stages event will be better. We're going to actually play a whole set of new music and stuff.
Interviewer,From your next album?
Grimes,"Yeah, more stuff from my album. Sorry, our baby is just yelling, but I think...  Careful on that step!"
Interviewer,"Oh yeah, a very late congratulations, by the way!"
Grimes,"Thank you! So yeah, I just try things out. I don't like being too precious with music. I like just seeing what people like and testing things out. I really like playing video games with my friends maybe there's a way to do that with fans at some point in the future."
Interviewer,What else can you tell me about the album? Is it really a space opera?
Grimes,"We made an album and were like, ""Is this a finished album?"" And that was before I signed to Columbia. Then I signed to Columbia, and we keep debating on the singles and it keeps changing. It's sort of a concept album, so it does have a narrative. It's a space opera, and I'm trying to make it air-tight, really pull it together, hone it in. With my last album, I had a lot of big ideas, but I just let it be more impressionistic. With this album, I think I have a lot more to say. I feel very strongly about the material. Also, we're continually making songs as we go. But I think we're going to start dropping singles, which I kind of prefer. I prefer not putting too much pressure on the album, and being able to keep adding stuff, because I also like long albums. So I think we're going to start dropping singles this summer and then just keep dropping singles and then put the album out four, five, six singles in or something. I am a big album person, but I also like to get music out."
Interviewer,I can understand the tension between wanting to get things out but also wanting to have a fully-formed concept.
Grimes,"I think you just have to play the devil's game, because we're in a real world of singles right now. There aren't a lot of albums I'm listening to, although I really appreciate it when people put out a whole album these days that's solid. I really, really, really appreciate that. But the way things are actually consumed, it doesn't work in that way so much. So whatever, I'll do both."
Interviewer,"Sonically, would you say it's along similar lines as your last album? Or should we expect something different?"
Grimes,I think it's pretty different. I try not to talk about it too much. Maybe I shouldn't answer too many questions about the album. I'm probably not supposed to do that!
Interviewer,"Fair enough. Knowing that your music has always intersected with futuristic concepts like the metaverse, crypto and artificial intelligence, what is it like for you to watch the larger music industry and the world begin to catch on?"
Grimes,"I think it's really great and important. I feel like for the last 10 years, people have been like, ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" Everyone's like, ""Grimes is so eccentric and weird!"" And I'm like, ""No, I'm actually talking about real things. I'm not just trying to be weird."" These things actually exist. I feel like people perceive me as very insane, and like, ""Wow, she's so loopy and quirky."" It's nice to be sort of vindicated on certain things."
Interviewer,"I'll let you go, but are there any other projects you want to mention? I hear you're working on a podcast."
Grimes,"I'm working on a podcast called Homo Techno with my friend Liv , who was previously one of the world's preeminent female poker players. She now works in AI theory and stuff. Our thesis for the podcast is that we're no longer homo sapiens, we are homo techno we're full cyborgs. It investigates the most aggressively controversial theories about futurism or the people who are most on the edge with either their ideas or practices with regards to ways the world can be."
Interviewer,"Visions is your third album, but you've said it feels like your first. Why?"
Grimes,"Those other two albums were literally the first music I ever made. They were just practice. I don't hate them, but instead of actually making what I wanted to make, I was making what I was able to make. I wish I could have just put this out as my first album."
Interviewer,Are you still going to school at McGill University in Montreal?
Grimes,"I was actually expelled for missing almost a year of class. It's their policy, but I wasn't aware of it because I was skipping at the time. hahaha So I no longer attend McGill, which kind of sucks because I wish I had a degree after spending that much money and time working on something. But actually, no, it doesn't suck. I was done. Now, I'm working on music all the time. It's not like I really need a job, because everything is super cheap in Montreal."
Interviewer,You played to some relatively big crowds opening for Lykke Li recently. What was that like?
Grimes,"It forced me to become a musician. Previously, I was playing shows for 30 people, and then it turned into 3,000 people. So I practiced a lot and made everything more coherent. Before that, it was kind of jammy I would improvise a lot. But that tour is one of the reasons why I started bringing my vocals up, because I would always  if the vocals were higher in the mix."
Interviewer,You co-directed your video for Vanessa from the Darkbloom EP. What was the inspiration for it?
Grimes,"That was a real K-pop-influenced video. The budget was $60, which all went to alcohol. We literally planned it the night before. I just got a bunch of my friends to drink a lot and was like, We're going to do dance moves. We did it in a couple of hours. I almost didn't care what it looked like; I just wanted it to look like everyone's having a good time. I also wanted it to be kind of creepy, too, hence the backward stuff."
Interviewer,Are your siblings into your music?
Grimes,"I have two younger biological brothers and two stepbrothers, and they're all into it, kind of. My oldest stepbrother is a rapper. He's called Jay Worthy. He's pretty tough, pretty crazy. Like, you get in his car, and there's blood splattered in it, and you're like, Oh. We want to collaborate."
Interviewer,"Grimes, with your 2012 song ""Oblivion"" you said you took one of the most shattering experiences of your life and turned it into something positive. Is sharing personal pain through your music cathartic?"
Grimes,"It's sort of the opposite. I make the album for me and then it's like, ""Oh, fuck. Everyone else has to hear this."" I have a rule"
Interviewer,"So what was your reaction when ""Realiti,"" a sort of throwaway song that you released unfinished, got over 6 million YouTube plays and was called your best song in years?"
Grimes,"I did not think it would get that big. I thought people would be like, ""Aw, how cute,"" and move on. It's pretty awesome, but I really wish I'd finished the song... (Laughs) I hate unfinished things. And the sound quality is so bad! My last album Visions is quite obviously amateur sounding too."
Interviewer,That didn't stop many critics from calling it one of the best albums of 2012.
Grimes,"But it wasn't the most professional setting. My management at the time was just a friend from high school. There was a release date before there was an even album, so I was on a crazy deadline and didn't necessarily finish things the way I probably would have wanted to. I had no training in music, barely played any shows, I didn't really know anything about music at all...."
Interviewer,Sometimes naiveté can be an advantage.
Grimes,"Yeah, definitely. But I think there's also a point where when you're a professional at something, you're expected to be executing at a certain level constantly and intentionally. I'd made three albums being not a serious musician at all, which I think is enough albums to make as an amateur. (Laughs)."
Interviewer,Things must have changed a lot for you in that respect. Your new album is your first since coming under the management of Jay-Z's Roc Nation and you reportedly even went through media training not quite your old DIY approach anymore.
Grimes,"I was just like, ""Maybe there's a way to stop Pitchfork from ruining my life all the time."" But I realized that it doesn't matter what I say because they'll still do it. I mean... not ruin my life, but just these ridiculous sexist attacks that I'm crying and so sad and having a terrible time all the time. And I just don't even know what this is about. I was just like, ""Is there any way for me to, like, stop this from happening?"" But it's the machine. It's clickbait."
Interviewer,Is your new and professional management also trying to dictate how you should look?
Grimes,"No. I think music is performing. Especially the stage shows. It's all related. I've been learning more about performance, watching politicians and speeches and things like that to integrate it into the show. The art I want to make tends to be quite audacious. But I'm not trying to be more professional in the sense that I care what anybody thinks. That's not much of a concern."
Interviewer,"What is the concern, then?"
Grimes,"For this album I just wanted to be able to walk into a room with any of my peers and know everything that they know. I don't want people to think I'm a worse producer than my male peers. I'm mostly tired of people who say they want to sound like Grimes calling up my male friends to try to get my sound. You could've called me but you don't call me because the only reference point you have is Visions. I wanted to learn how to produce, I wanted to learn how to engineer, I wanted to learn how to play instruments... Before I even started the album I really wanted to just become a musician, as it were. And since I hate repeating myself, that involves learning quite a bit."
Interviewer,So it was important for you to be known as a good producer as well as a talented artist?
Grimes,"Definitely. I think I'm a shit vocalist! (Laughs) I think I'm, like, a very questionable vocalist. I think it's just an identity thing. I could never identify as a vocalist, so for me the production part is very important. And if I'm going to charge people 10 bucks for an album, I want it to be fucking good! I want it to be worth people's while."
Interviewer,Do you feel that's not the case for most artists these days?
Grimes,"I think for a lot of albums right now there'll be the single and then there's just a bunch of crap. For example, when the Beyoncé album came out, because it came out all at once and there was no press, I just listened to the whole album at once. And I realized, ""Fuck, I haven't actually listened to a new album the whole way through in years."" Every song really meant something to me. I wanted to make an album like that. I hope people listen through the whole thing and every single song could be a single."
Interviewer,Wouldn't that be a bit more mainstream than your music tends to be?
Grimes,"Not in, like, a Top 40 way. Just where every single song could be really meaningful to me and really well executed. You could take out any song and be like, ""This is what Grimes is."" And it would be good. It was really hard to choose singles because to me it's a real album. Compared to Visions and compared to the albums before it, I think it's quite an improvement. There's nothing on it that I think is bad."
Interviewer,I guess that's why it took you so long to finish it.
Grimes,"It's just that when I look at the artists I admire, even like Bob Dylan or Carravaggio or Leonardo DaVinci, they don't just achieve. They achieve at the highest level. They're great, great artists. And they're great, great technical performers. Their skill is at the highest level and their expression is at the highest level. I don't want to be good. I want to be the best. Even in failing that, you'll hit a higher mark than if you never tried."
Interviewer,Hey Claire!
Grimes,"Hi, how are you?"
Interviewer,"Great! I didn't know whether to call you Grimes, or Miss Grimes or something."
Grimes,(laughs).
Interviewer,"So you are coming to Australia for Meredith Music Festival, you must have played dozens of festivals already but are you excited?"
Grimes,"I actually am pretty excited. My Dad is really obsessed with Australia. Like, he always wanted to go when I was a kid, so it seems like, I don't know, a thing that needs to happen in my life. I heard Meredith is just awesome, plus outdoor festivals are my favourite kind."
Interviewer,"Great. Well formalities out of the way, I've watched more than a few interviews with you and noticed that you are totally unashamed to like mainstream pop musicians like Mariah Carey and Justin Bieber. Actually, did you catch their collaboration the other Christmas on Mariah's 'All I Want For Christmas Is You'?"
Grimes,I actually kind of hate it.
Interviewer,(Surprised noise) No!
Grimes,"(Laughs) Sorry, that's such a strong thing to say. It's just, Mariah's version is just so good and it was obviously a money grab. I feel like it was a cheesy thing for Justin, the stuff on his album is better. And Mariah, I don't know, I just feel like that song is sacred."
Interviewer,It is a perfect song. Have you ever thought of doing a Christmas song?
Grimes,"I'm kind of anti-Christmas so no. Well, not 'anti' Christmas but in High School, I was anti-Christmas cause it was always this big thing in my family. I technically celebrate Kwanzaa cause my Mom's friend celebrated Kwanzaa so I would always just do that."
Interviewer,You should make a Kwanzaa song... do they have songs?
Grimes,"Yeah! They have a ton of songs, (laughs) I won't go on a big tirade about Kwanzaa but it is about anti-materialism and making the holidays more about music and stuff."
Interviewer,"Oh good. And not just because that leads back into talking about music. So Grimes is tied up in the Seapunk and WitchHouse genres, do you pay much attention to any of that? The new genre labels I mean."
Grimes,"Sort of, it is an interesting thing, but I'm not a Seapunk, I'll put that out there. I don't have a problem with it, it is just a very particular scene and I think I'm doing something different. When WitchHouse happened I was like, that's actually really kind of cool because it is a logical extension of all the kids who were teenagers in like 2001. All the big musicians back then were like Marilyn Manson and Outkast and stuff, so making like trap, rap beats that are really goth is the logical step for people of my generation. Actually, my album Halifax was an attempt at a WitchHouse album. I still wouldn't define myself as WitchHouse but I think it is a very applicable sub-genre. Only because I never really got into like Chillwave or some of the other ones, that's not really my thing. Making a weird super niche genre is kind of a cool idea though."
Interviewer,"You have kind of touched on what I wanted to ask you next. In your interview with Nardwaur, you mentioned you are the 'future of music.' You seem to have a very clear idea or vision of your music, so could you elaborate a bit more on being the 'future of music'?"
Grimes,"Well, I like the idea of controlling everything. That doesn't really happen where an artist does everything, like directs their own videos and produces all their own music and writes it all. So that's a huge part of it for me. What I was referring to though was more, pure musical stuff probably, in that interview. I feel like I have a lot of ideas, like the idea of WitchHouse, which I think really needs to get done. I don't know, my mandate is to just take all of these genres, the one's that people think really shouldn't be together, or that aren't cool, and just find the parts that are cool because I think it will lead to a more interesting and original thing. Doing the opposite of what everyone else thinks is cool is probably the right thing."
Interviewer,"Do you think it is inevitable for you then, to never find mainstream popularity? Or was that even ever important to you?"
Grimes,"Well you know, I don't really care, I just want to make the art that I feel proud of. I don't care if it ever gets really big or if it stays small. Even if I upset people that want me to do one thing specifically. The thing I really care about the most is the satisfaction I get from accomplishing something that I think is really good. Which is the best part of the job, or this whole thing, it's what's happening in the studio. I do care about critical success, it's awesome, it has changed my life to have critical success. You know, I can afford to live in a house and eat good food. I think it is important for me to really try and not think about that stuff though."
Interviewer,"Actually that reminds me of something else you mentioned in the Nardwaur interview. It seemed like an unserious thing to you, but you mentioned you started a cult with your friend based around bureaucracy, which means everyone is too busy with paperwork to get anything done."
Grimes,"(Laughs) It's kind of a joke, but my friend Duffy is sort of insane, he used to dance for me. So he invented this cult, I mean, it's not a real cult, but it is, though I think everyone kind of see's it as a joke. We have rituals and things."
Interviewer,"(Laughs) I think there's more to it though, what I meant before was that it is important for artists such as yourself to avoid getting tied up in the bureaucracy of mainstream music. The situations that hinder your independence and creativity. Mainstream popularity can kind of suffocate creativity, I don't know, do you get where I'm going?"
Grimes,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure if it necessarily does but I have some friends on bigger labels who have problems when they want to put something out and their label isn't okay with it. My label is sort of indie so I don't have that problem. Though sometimes I'll be working on something, and I can't just drop a song or put it out. Even today, I shot the video for 'Be A Body,' and I was just lining up the footage with my friend's song and thinking, 'I really should just use this footage for this song.' I couldn't because it is an old song of his and it wouldn't have made sense in the press cycle. That was definitely one of those moments of going 'I wish I could just make art!' because it would have been awesome to make that music video but instead, his song won't have a video because of all this stupid bureaucracy. Something I have to fight is that the more success I get, I guess the more censors there have to be and certain things like that."
Interviewer,"That does sound annoying. I guess a lot of people confuse censorship with just a musician's aesthetic appearance. Like, people would see your videos and think your 'look' is what makes you the artist you are. So your 'Genesis' video, for example, people must think you are way left of centre. By the way, was that inspired by Sailor Moon?"
Grimes,A little bit! Mainly Tarantino though.
Interviewer,"Oh, Kill Bill, of course."
Grimes,"Yeah, like Gogo Yubari, I was definitely the archetype of the violent Japanese schoolgirl. It is such an iconic image. I just thought it would be sick to dress up and have a bunch of weapons. A little bit of Sailor Moon in there too though definitely. For the costumes, I went to a lot of anime and cosplay stores."
Interviewer,"That's so awesome. I feel sad to bring the conversation back to more serious stuff, but I'm interested in how music spreads, especially with hipsters and there being music that is 'cool.' So I'm so glad to hear you say in interviews that your first crush was Travis Barker from Blink 182, because you recognise that bands like that were just a gateway to other punk music. Do you feel that Grimes is a gateway into any other kinds of music?"
Grimes,"Oh I hope so. I feel like I might not be big enough, like to know Grimes you kind of have to be a little bit into weird music in the first place, maybe (laughs). That would be the ideal though, to be a Blink 182 or Marilyn Manson where you're obviously flirting with mainstream success but you're still accessing a lineage of music that is weirder or more underground. Blink 182 though, they were definitely a gateway band into punk and hardcore. When you mention them people are always like 'What? No' but it's like, 'Come on dude you didn't just wake up one day and start listening to New Order when you were five years old.'."
Interviewer,"(Laughs) Exactly, I was 13 when 'All The Small Things' came out, and everyone in the year was into that song, what are people talking about?"
Grimes,"I know, I've been getting into a lot of arguments recently because I'm really getting into the new Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift records."
Interviewer,(*Excited girlish noise*) Taylor Swift!
Grimes,"I know, Taylor is so awesome, I might get to meet her in a week! I don't know for sure yet though. Every time I mention I like her or Justin on Twitter though I lose like twenty followers, it's ridiculous. There's so much hate for something that is successful or something that appears to be marketed at a younger audience. As if it couldn't be good music because of the way it is marketed. It sucks because those records are actually awesome and if you don't want to listen to it because you think you are too cool then it is your loss I guess. I get so angry about people like that and that kind of stuff."
Interviewer,"Oh don't worry, they're the kind of people that turn into crazed postal workers wearing their mum's lipstick because they never accepted themselves."
Grimes,"(Laughs) I don't know, I mean Taylor Swift is really talented, more than Justin Bieber I would say, she writes all her own music."
Interviewer,"Yeah, she completely stole my heart. Did you see her perform at the Grammy's?"
Grimes,The time when she changed costume in the middle of the song?
Interviewer,"Not that time, the one where the stage was made up to be a saloon and she's holding a banjo, though I don't think she played it."
Grimes,I wish she played instruments!
Interviewer,"Yeah! At the end of the song, she got a standing ovation, and she was just, so genuinely grateful, you could see on her face, it was so sweet."
Grimes,"Yeah, whenever I see footage of her shows she is so stoked at the end, you can tell she loves it. I mean, she is super famous but it is so refreshing because she always seems so surprised, it's just nice."
Interviewer,"Do you ever feel pressured to be like that at shows? Like to finish and look out at the audience like 'Oh! Thank you so much, I love all of you!'."
Grimes,"Nah, I usually just run off stage (laughs) because I get nervous. Actually I started bowing, I don't know why. It was probably in Japan, they are always bowing so I guess I got into it there. It seems like such a humble way to get out of things or say thank you. It is a good solution to a lot of social problems. So on the last tour, I would finish and kind of bow and then run off thinking 'why are you doing this?' It is so nerdy."
Interviewer,"It is weird how these things start. For no reason, I started putting my thumbs up as a way to say 'yeah!' or 'I'm on to it.' All the time, even to shop keepers."
Grimes,"(Laughs) It's funny to get into little habits like that, it is so dorky, like stuff a Dad would do."
Interviewer,"Speaking of nerdy. We kind of touched on Mariah Carey before, have you seen the footage of Nicky Minaj going crazy at her on American Idol?"
Grimes,"No! I need to see that, I've been so out of the loop, what happened?"
Interviewer,"Well, not to spoil it, but Nicky rants for ages and death threats are thrown around. Pretty epic stuff."
Grimes,Well it's kind of awesome though (laughs) I need to look this up.
Interviewer,Definitely. And sorry again to bring the conversation back to more serious stuff but I heard that for Visions you were in your room for a long period of time by yourself. What drives you to be so intense about the recording process?
Grimes,"Well, it's a few things. At the time I had tours booked so I just had that month period and knew if I didn't do it then I wouldn't make a record for a really long time. I had also been researching a lot of medieval cloisters and philosophers and art from the period. I guess I just wanted to do something really extreme. I had kind of done shorter things like that in the past, like fasting and stuff like that for artistic purposes. It worked really well. I'm actually kind of doing that right now. I'm in B.C, in the woods, in a cabin. I have no access to anything really and I'm recording. You can just get so much done when there's no internet and no one to talk to. You lose track of time and just work and work. I feel you develop a deeper understanding of the thing that you're working on."
Interviewer,"Whoa, that sounds scary to me. I mean I totally applaud you for taking it to that extreme. I read interviews where you talk about where you sing and imagine you're a medieval princess. It makes me think, 'how is she so confidant to talk like that?' It sounds like psychosis to me. You don't seem like you've lost your mind though so I'm quite encouraged now."
Grimes,"Well, I think if you can compartmentalize, I mean, I have to do a lot of compartmentalizing in my life. The music is one thing and the music is a very spiritual, abstract and anti-logical endeavor. Then, on the other hand, I'm just coming into this and I have to be a business person, running the business that is Grimes. That includes doing interviews and directing music videos and the art direction and all this other stuff that is totally different from the creative process. I've just had to separate doing the creative and crazy things from the logical things. They are both wrapped up in the same world but they use different parts of the brain. I don't know, there are boundaries and limits to psychological things."
Interviewer,"Yeah. Gosh, I hate to wrap it up there. Thanks for talking to me. We got to talk about Mariah and Taylor Swift which was the important stuff I guess."
Grimes,"(Laughs) Yeah, it's been good! Bye."
Interviewer,I guess i really got in my own world i didn't think his name would be that big of a meme.
Grimes,So like when it became like a giant meme i was like oh like i already my kid i think it.
Interviewer,Behooves most any adult who wants to understand what's going on with the younger generation to try and.
Grimes,Spend a few hours on tick tock there isn't like a tech safety community that's super large like it's quite small.
Interviewer,You're supposed to be a tortured artist or whatever but it's like it's actually kind of um.
Grimes,Edgy to be wholesome at this point artists have the same impact on a community's economic development as.
Interviewer,Entrepreneurs the situation in music worries me like i know artists that are pretty successful that are like.
Grimes,Broke i'm like super into brutalist architecture at the moment and i thought like brutalist baby like you.
Interviewer,Know like just like a square cement crib would be kind of  cool.
Grimes, welcome back to yang speaks it is election day it's election day 11 or.
Interviewer,Whatever it is now i'm kidding election day 11 election week two yes that's sad so i.
Grimes,I'm getting a lot of questions zach about hey like are these trump legal actions going to actually.
Interviewer,Uh succeed should we be concerned i understand why people would be concerned because you you'd put nothing.
Grimes,Past this administration but it's a wrap you know.
Interviewer,Like that's what i wanted to do i wanted to like let's i want to debunk i want to get to like facts of the.
Grimes,Recount nonsense voter fraud nonsense going on because it's mostly nonsense but.
Interviewer,If you're a game i'd love your thoughts on what's real and what's truth right now because the source of truth.
Grimes,To me is a moving target right now well the the truth is that joe has a margin of victory.
Interviewer,In pennsylvania georgia arizona nevada um that that's high enough.
Grimes,Uh that it's going to make a recount like impossible to succeed wisconsin uh where i think it was scott walker the.
Interviewer,Republican governor of wisconsin who said look we can make a mistake of 100.
Grimes,200 300 maybe 400 votes we're not going to make a mistake of 20 000 votes.
Interviewer,Like you know it's like we know how to count um and this is a republican governor uh and you know so who's been.
Grimes,Pro-trump in some ways you know or yeah if you will like a lot of these states have republican secretaries of.
Interviewer,State georgia republican secretary of state pennsylvania republican secretary of.
Grimes,State like they're the folks so uh so what's happening is you have very.
Interviewer,Hyper partisan impulses being like it's a fraud you screwed up uh and then when the show would be like.
Grimes,Okay like what evidence are you claiming they'll like just snatch some strange like you know account or video.
Interviewer,That um most often gets explained away um or accounts for you know like maybe like.
Grimes,One to ten votes where you could be like okay maybe like that that but like there's no uh claim of like and then.
Interviewer,They dumped 25 000 fake votes in there but it was like you know like.
Grimes,There's nothing uh that would influence the outcome of the election so here's what's really going on.
Interviewer,Um the republicans know they've lost but they need donald trump's voters through january 5th the georgia special.
Grimes,Elections which we'll talk about and uh you and i are heading to georgia um yes sir shortly so that's that's.
Interviewer,Exciting not to vote ourselves to help other people vote i'm gonna say that yeah yeah just.
Grimes,To draw attention and raise money and rally but uh you know that's not going to yeah no.
Interviewer,It really is it's like like that there's like uh it is not andrew yang's fault.
Grimes,Or my fault that george's laws on voting residency are ridiculous apparently you can move there and.
Interviewer,Just register to vote that's ridiculous not our fault not our plan keep going yeah no.
Grimes,Exactly take it up with the georgia state legislature so uh so the republicans have.
Interviewer,Reasoned that they need trump's voters january 5th and so they're going to play along with.
Grimes,The entire trump uh fraud game um because they just want to maintain energy levels.
Interviewer,Because they think if trump's just out of the picture and he concedes then all of his supporters will stay home january.
Grimes,5th and the democrats have a better chance of winning these special elections.
Interviewer,Um but i think you said zach that what's telling is that trump and pence are essentially on.
Grimes,Vacation now you know they're like chilling like everyone in their administration uh is.
Interviewer,Looking around being like uh okay i guess i need a new job and then.
Grimes,Um their leadership is like you have to pretend that everything is still normal that will be here.
Interviewer,And if you don't then we'll fire you before even like like uh um you can leave so so that that.
Grimes,So that's the situation it's cynical it's political like a lot of things in american life um.
Interviewer,And uh it's trying to maintain hold of the senate january 5th.
Grimes,So here's my thought on this stuff is would that make sense to me um and then for those of you like because i.
Interviewer,Think disinformation becomes a problem when rational republicans who are not the die-hard base but like.
Grimes,Rational moderate republicans or moderate libs on the on the other side start to.
Interviewer,Parrot what the far right or far left is saying and i think that's what's happening here.
Grimes,It's really frustrating because i have you know irrational either rational pundits or rational friends of mine.
Interviewer,They're like well there seemed to be some shenanigans going on which is frustrating because here here's.
Grimes,What's up that i like recounts so if like the republicans want to just say hey we want.
Interviewer,To recount the votes fine totally fine we should do that in democracy so i'm 100 on board we did it.
Grimes,We've done it before we'll do it again but here's the the counts are biden's ahead by 20 000.
Interviewer,Votes in wisconsin 145 000 in michigan 13 000 arizona 14 000 in georgia almost 50 000 in pennsylvania so some of.
Grimes,These are close but not a couple signatures and note even if there was a freakish thing where.
Interviewer,One of them gets overturned joe still wins like you you need to overturn several of them yes so bo and jose.
Grimes,Essentially needs three maybe two depending on how you which ones you pick here i think pennsylvania.
Interviewer,And georgia i believe it's over right by the math so um the other thing is there has been.
Grimes,This is the other fact of the case because republican lawyers and judges generally speaking 99.9 of them believe.
Interviewer,In the rule of law and they're looking at this not a single judge a j.
Grimes,All judges have thrown out the cases presented to them that have been at the scale that could.
Interviewer,Flip the election right because there's no evidence of it being accepted right it's clearly just.
Grimes,Accepted over the small ones yeah so that's there's no real evidence at all.
Interviewer,Of voter fraud and that is frustrating this election is big guys it happened joe biden got more votes both nationwide.
Grimes,And the states he needed he's the president-elect donald trump's on the way out.
Interviewer,And the republicans would be acknowledging this to a much higher degree if not for the special elections.
Grimes,In georgia in my opinion so uh no you're probably right so so just keep in mind that.
Interviewer,Like they they see the there's an incentive balance of power in the senate as potentially at stake and then that's.
Grimes,Made them much more willing to play along right and that makes their life hell.
Interviewer,Comparatively speaking right like they have a lot of incentive to want power in their power in the.
Grimes,Senate because then congress actually can do stuff um well democrats need you know it's.
Interviewer,Like yeah republicans both of them right the leadership yeah i mean they both need it.
Grimes,Yeah um let me ask you this i think this is a fun trevor noah had this point which i don't.
Interviewer,Always love trevor noah but sometimes he's funny he said uh so on one hand this um claims of voter fraud.
Grimes,Are hurting democracy in our trust in elections and something you talk about a lot.
Interviewer,On the other hand on a more fun hand there is a chance we see donald trump dragged out of the white house which i.
Grimes,Think would be funny from a comedy standpoint in an entertainment standpoint which i.
Interviewer,Think is trump's lame like i think he's entertainer to me thoughts on that which you'd rather see.
Grimes,I imagine i know where you land um but have you thought he's not gonna let us get dragged out he's gonna walk out.
Interviewer,Of there like the the day before and do a photo op and like hop in a helicopter a plane.
Grimes,Give us the bird and flip us the burden and have a headache yeah yeah you're probably right and then millions.
Interviewer,Of americans will continue to support him and then you know we'll see what his future holds.
Grimes,Um yeah the the problem really is like the muddiness between now and then because still.
Interviewer,He's the president between now and then so he's firing people he's making decisions.
Grimes,Uh fired his secretary he's fired secretary defense right who said yeah uh then i quote uh if it's a yes man god.
Interviewer,Help us all yeah the uh the transition's getting gummed up.
Grimes,Because ordinarily um the biden team would have some resources to work with and be talking to current.
Interviewer,Officials and a bunch of other things uh and that that has not happened so that's.
Grimes,Uh that that's negative substantively for an effective trade-off of or hand-off of.
Interviewer,Power um and that sucks you know that i mean this there's no bones about it like that.
Grimes,This like we just hung on through this and like it's still happening.
Interviewer,Where you have like you said i guess formerly reasonable republicans being like oh like about let's play the sound.
Grimes,Like it's bad for the country that the incoming team cannot talk to the current.
Interviewer,Team uh it's bad for the country that millions of americans are being called.
Grimes,To like question uh the objective fact of who got more votes.
Interviewer,Like this stuff's really destructive and it's speeding up you know it's like the norms just held.
Grimes,Together uh for this one uh you know next time if the next person.
Interviewer,Says this stuff is rigged like you know you you might see uh unrest and um.
Grimes,Like worse judging or you know whatever the heck uh you know it is so like this is not going.
Interviewer,Well uh for american democracy uh you know like i'm thrilled that joe and kamala.
Grimes,Won but uh and i i wish that you know republicans didn't have these political.
Interviewer,Incentives to cast this like alternate version of reality uh where clearly and like all these.
Grimes,Republicans are being like oh they're like issues shenanigans they do a recount if trump had won they would.
Interviewer,Be crowing immediately being like you know it's in the bag stop it like we don't need to count more like the.
Grimes,Rest of it i mean you saw it so clearly where like the chant was different depending upon what state and what the.
Interviewer,Needs were it was like stop the count or count every vote or whatever it was you know.
Grimes,You know they'll like flip on the dawn it's a tough argument because there's so many states yeah.
Interviewer,So they're i mean the the the core of it is just that they want their team to win and um and that's.
Grimes,In some ways understandable because we all want our teams to win um but you know at this level like that.
Interviewer,There has to be some degree of um country over party you know it's like this stuff is.
Grimes,Really bad for the country it's bad for the country that an incoming government like can't talk to.
Interviewer,The current government it's bad for the country that like you have this floundering executive.
Grimes,Branch for you know two solid months like you know that like that they're just real real.
Interviewer,Negatives to this um and like i i don't i think this hand holding.
Grimes,Of republicans who want to play along is uh is is corrosive you know like i wish they.
Interviewer,Didn't feel but you know i guess it's like the epitaph to the trump era it's like well we kind of wish republicans.
Grimes,Had separated from him this entire time and been like yo this guy's.
Interviewer,You know not the guy and they never did and so they're still playing it out they're still writing his.
Grimes,Trump coattails to what they hope is political victory in georgia uh country be damned you know it it um.
Interviewer,Like uh it's a sad day or a sad week or two weeks or three weeks or whatever it is you know you've talked a lot.
Grimes,I'm gonna find this quote this quote and tweet it before this podcast where you found.
Interviewer,You said we're entering an era i think you said this at cnn town hall your first one where you said we're.
Grimes,Entering era of um the lack of institutional trust where we don't trust our schools we don't trust.
Interviewer,Our our military we don't trust our education system and.
Grimes,Um we don't trust government and now it's looking at we don't trust our elections.
Interviewer,We don't trust the media straw we don't just yeah there's a whole bunch in this list yeah.
Grimes,Yeah actually zack military is the most trusted of those institutions you just named.
Interviewer,Like uh so of course i butchered your quote that's actually a good example no no it's i mean like the military's.
Grimes,Like the last bastion that gets like majority trust uh we don't trust hospitals we don't trust doctors.
Interviewer,You know it's like the the the trust is low um the trust is declining further still.
Grimes,This election unfortunately has not been good for trust you've talked about this before but um.
Interviewer,We never really debated it so there's there's liberal chatter um and not like far left stuff like.
Grimes,Politico wrote about this where um there's rumors that trump will have um some civil suits and possibly face jail.
Interviewer,Time from um certain courts when he leaves the white house.
Grimes,Um and you've been on record saying you hate that because that turned us into venezuela and i agree with that no i i'm.
Interviewer,Saying i hate going i hate criminal prosecution um the civil suits have added you know.
Grimes,He owes you money go for it  um like i do think it's bad practice for.
Interviewer,A new government to like throw the previous president in jail uh you know because that's a.
Grimes,Pattern that goes on in uh developing countries where like the new president's always trying.
Interviewer,To like chase down the former president who's still a potential threat.
Grimes,Uh yeah and i know there there are going to be many people who disagree with this because they want to see trump in.
Interviewer,Jail really really badly uh like i i think it would be um i would think it would do more harm than good.
Grimes,To try to imprison trump and and i also think that again just like the odds of seeing him.
Interviewer,Dragging out the white house the odds of him actually going to jail would be so low you know he would just.
Grimes,Decamp to another country where he would uh um live it up nope.
Interviewer,But i do think like if he owes money like particularly the new york um.
Grimes, you know here at yang speaks we are all about protecting our data i am so thrilled that prop 24.
Interviewer, passed in california california's are enjoying higher data protection rights they're.
Grimes, going to create a new data protection agency just for california and if that sounds cool to you and.
Interviewer, you're not in california then go to your state legislators and say hey how come californians have better data.
Grimes, protections than we do here in wisconsin in michigan in ohio wherever let's have the sweep the country.
Interviewer, in the meantime if you want to protect your personal data every time you use the internet.
Grimes, we recommend expressvpn vpn stands for virtual private network it's like you beam into the internet.
Interviewer, from someplace else no one can track what you're doing they can't sell and resell your data.
Grimes, it's like you're a ghost a spy someone really cool from the future who no one knows what the heck they did.
Interviewer, if that sounds good to you expressvpn is your product visit expressvpn.com yang that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s.
Grimes, vpn dot-com slash gang for three months free with a one-year package this is the number one rated vpn by.
Interviewer, wired cnet in the verge visit expressvpn.com to learn more so so let's get to let's get to georgia.
Grimes, why is everybody going to georgia over the next two months.
Interviewer, you had not one but two senate races in georgia which is highly unusual and neither of the quote-unquote.
Grimes, winners or front-runners got 50 percent so in georgia there's a rule where if you don't get 50.
Interviewer, you go to a runoff so race number one is john ossoff against uh david perdue and.
Grimes, uh that was close as a two-point race or so um john ossoff's very young very logical.
Interviewer, uh really impressive candidate to have um uh accomplished so much uh i talked to.
Grimes, him the other day and he was joking about how when he ran for congress it ended up.
Interviewer, being like the most important congressional race of um the year because it was the first one.
Grimes, post-trump uh and then now his senate race is becoming the most important so he's like joking he's like lightning.
Interviewer, striking twice uh and then the other race um is reverend rafael warnock against kelly.
Grimes, lefler and both purdue and lefleur were accused of.
Interviewer, insider trading on coronavirus information when they first found out how bad the chronovirus was going to be.
Grimes, they did what any american would do and adjust their stock portfolio.
Interviewer, they were just like oh this is going to be bad for cruise lines you know it's like that's leadership.
Grimes, that's leadership uh that's so illegal by the way it's so having worked on wall street that is.
Interviewer, like textbook insider trading there's not like that's not even a gray area yeah.
Grimes, the entire um legislative access to tradable information i mean come on like we haven't figured this one out.
Interviewer, like if you're gonna show up in congress just like put your money in a trust they like throw it in a bunch of things.
Grimes, you can't touch it and then you come out of public service you get it back instead we're creating all of these gray.
Interviewer, areas where legislators are freaking profiting it is not a good look that folks enter.
Grimes, congress non-millionaires and leave millionaires on the regular you know like.
Interviewer, like that that's and it happens all the time all the time and it makes sense because.
Grimes, there's it's not illegal to do this you go in and sit there in a meeting like wow.
Interviewer, it looks like this massive xyz problem is causing oil prices to skyrocket in the middle east like oh better like.
Grimes, get out of my oil companies and you go in there and you make your trade and then let it go and then yeah you don't.
Interviewer, lose all that money and like there's a moral like taking care of your family thing but that's highly illegal it's not.
Grimes, cool um well yeah i mean congress hasn't hasn't.
Interviewer, like slammed the door on this stuff to the degree that it could right it needs to for sure i mean it'd.
Grimes, be illegal in some of these other contexts you're talking about um so yeah like all the.
Interviewer, demands but there needs to be rules and like inside trading's hard to track in general but this one's easy.
Grimes, this one's easy well zach i'll tell you the enrichment of congressional.
Interviewer, members is not strictly that they just have better intel they're like you know like adjusting their.
Grimes, um e-trade portfolio or something like that like most of most of it is that you get in.
Interviewer, there and then all of a sudden like people just want to include you in everything including.
Grimes, things that um that can make you some money and they're technically legitimate uh but.
Interviewer, just people will be like hey you know like we've got some real estate deal like you wanna.
Grimes, come like uh partake and like there's not no rule against it you're like you know a citizen you can.
Interviewer, invest and so people just be like trying to carve out awesome opportunities for you.
Grimes, then before you know it like you know you're trouncing the market many many times over.
Interviewer, if you're a member too you're like hanging out with rich people all the time.
Grimes, and then the rich people kind of put their hand on your shoulder and they're like.
Interviewer, they're there like we like you you should be rich like us and then and then the members like are.
Grimes, like yes i should and then before you know it they are anyway this is actually a long.
Interviewer, digression from the fact that that's very real man and i'll say this quickly because i saw.
Grimes, this like if you have people always like the rich get richer like poor poor like when you have money.
Interviewer, the investment opportunities get a lot better and a lot less risky in the sense that in 2000 i'll never.
Grimes, forget this we sold an apollo european credit fund awesome idea and basically in the 2009.
Interviewer, financial crisis all like the smaller banks mid-level banks in europe went under.
Grimes, so private citizens if you're like the cisco which is like the food delivery service.
Interviewer, super blue chip company you couldn't get a loan in europe so private citizens just pulled a bunch.
Grimes, of money together and we're loaning like blue chip companies at like 11 interest 15 interest it was.
Interviewer, the closest thing to surefire bet ever and all you had to do was have enough money to lock it up so.
Grimes, it's stuff like that that they're getting access to where you and i like you you're poor you don't.
Interviewer, you're not in the game you have to invest in just an apple stock or whatever s p 500 and.
Grimes, like go with those waves these guys get sure things that the lead access that kind of stuff so.
Interviewer, long way to getting there but that's just one that i remember very yeah i mean.
Grimes, wow yeah you lived it brainerd if i had money you know yeah then they'll call you up and be like hey.
Interviewer, i got a thing for you so tell me your left foot yeah and then you're like sure you feel smart.
Grimes, and it's corruptive over time anyway kelly lefler uh is the richest member of the senate which is saying.
Interviewer, something because there are a lot of freaking rich senators but kelly left her lovely is worth 520.
Grimes, million she's already put 23 million into a race uh reverend raphael warnock uh you know.
Interviewer, is a black reverend uh very inspiring like he's getting a lot of support um i and.
Grimes, this i'll just say just because i think it's fun is that kelly leflar also owns a wnba team.
Interviewer, uh that like in all the players wanted her to sell it because she she was against the black lives.
Grimes, matter messaging look at the court like yeah it's like you probably should do.
Interviewer, everyone a favor and sell that team if like your players don't want to play for you that way so uh so that's.
Grimes, that that's the other race these are fascinating races and uh we have to be realistic that for.
Interviewer, democrats it will be an uphill climb and you think well why because didn't joe just win.
Grimes, this state like isn't georgia at purple the problem is that uh republicans in georgia have a much.
Interviewer, tighter read on voting and the need to vote than democrats who many of them are new.
Grimes, to the process and this was true a number of years ago even there was a special election that.
Interviewer, was very close to get to a special election it was maybe a three-point gap and then.
Grimes, the republican won it by double digits maybe 12 points so that was a number of years ago.
Interviewer, so it's probably not going to be that gruesome this time but you have to expect that.
Grimes, democrats will come out at lower levels and the trump not being on the ballot thing cuts both ways is that they're.
Interviewer, like you know republicans are concerned that their voters will stay home you know who'll.
Grimes, stay home a lot of anti-trump democratic voters in georgia uh so it's a it's an uphill climb uh.
Interviewer, but we have to to make this happen because the alternative is mitch mcconnell saying no.
Grimes, to everything for four years while the country sinks into the mud.
Interviewer, uh that's why i'm heading there and you're heading there is that uh we have such massive problems in this country.
Grimes, and we know washington will take any excuse not to work you know if the party can just look and.
Interviewer, blame the other side me like well nothing happened no stimulus bill uh it's their fault vote them out of.
Grimes, office and then go eat a steak um while while the you know the country is.
Interviewer, burning they'll do that you know i mean that like that like i mean we're seeing it we're.
Grimes, feeling it um yeah for seven months so if you want uh to.
Interviewer, get things done out of washington that might help people a unified government would be enormously.
Grimes, superior to mitch mcconnell saying no no no and mitch mcconnell all of a sudden you know he's going to be like oh.
Interviewer, the deficit like when like no one cared when trump was like let's do a like trillion dollar tax got to be like yeah.
Grimes, let's you know all the republicans have voted because of the fiscal situation the united.
Interviewer, states to decrease the deficit it went up exponentially essentially donald trump had the biggest increase of.
Grimes, deficit in a long time i'm going to see if i pull those numbers up but go ahead so it's both it's a.
Interviewer, argument like and if there's any time you're gonna deficit spend.
Grimes, it's when you have a pandemic and a pandemic induced recession and a jobs recession and like you know.
Interviewer, like people are getting kicked out of homes and in food bank lines like if there is any.
Grimes, time you're going to deficit spend it would be now and one of the things that frustrates.
Interviewer, the heck out of me is the confusion around where the money is going karzak 2.2 trillion dollars.
Grimes, uh if you do the math 1200 for let's call it 100 million americans uh is something like six percent of.
Interviewer, 2.2 trillion dollars so it's like oh all the money went to people no you know like a like a tiny.
Grimes, sliver went like you could give everyone twelve hundred dollars.
Interviewer, a month for a year with like that two trillion dollars if you so chose which by the way would have been vastly.
Grimes, superior to what they did because let's say you have an airline.
Interviewer, i feel i feel very deeply and desperately for all the families you know the furloughed employees and.
Grimes, the rest of it but let's say that all those employees were getting like thousand dollars a month two.
Interviewer, thousand dollars a month and then the airline itself was getting recapped like then how would you feel.
Grimes, we only care about the airline because we care about the workers we care about like the pilots the.
Interviewer, airline attendants like the rest of it's like i don't want those people to suffer yeah no like i don't i.
Grimes, don't want those people to to suffer you know the other thing is like we have a sophisticated enough corporate.
Interviewer, um infrastructure where like a banked or bailout let's keep on flying anyway you know.
Grimes, like they go to the creditors and be like well i can't make any money if we're not doing flights and i'm like.
Interviewer, yeah yeah you go do that like it's not like bankrupt firms just stop operating.
Grimes, you know like the the the creditors can just keep on you know like doing the thing so.
Interviewer, so there are many many better ways to go so even if you are concerned about the deficit.
Grimes, you should be clamoring for cash relief because it is the most effective bang for your buck.
Interviewer, it would actually go right back in the economy it would rejuvenate small businesses keep some of these.
Grimes, restaurants open and all the rest of it um and so having mitch mcconnell talk about the deficit is something i will.
Interviewer, desperately i will fight tooth and nail to shut him up just be like look just you know like just step aside.
Grimes, you've done enough wrecking of the country for uh for a while uh you know like let's try and rebuild.
Interviewer, it yang versus mitch i'm excited for this for those just to make sure i get the.
Grimes, numbers right um this is according to a site called the balance which is like a.
Interviewer, pretty i've read this before but a pretty good uh us debt uh blog website um but we've.
Grimes, increased the debt by donald trump under donald trump's been 36 percent or so.
Interviewer, almost 36 in the past four years now you can give a chunk of that kind of not all that is covered right.
Grimes, now a lot of that is the tax cuts and there's this logic on the right that say hey if we cut taxes people will.
Interviewer, make more money without the taxes and then they'll still make it back and the reality is really.
Grimes, rich people don't pay taxes so this is a ridiculous model um.
Interviewer, so that's our world right now and then to be clear on this if the democrats win these two senate.
Grimes, races we have a 50 50 tie in the senate which means the tiebreaker goes to the sitting vice president which means.
Interviewer, which is going to be kamala harris so so 5150 advantage so would that not be glorious that's what's on the line in.
Grimes, georgia that's why we're heading there uh we've just kicked off winboatseats.org.
Interviewer, which donates to 16 community organizations that activate voters in georgia and in different.
Grimes, places in different communities so we've identified this as the most effective.
Interviewer, use of resources uh it's a two month sprint and so you need people that can actually.
Grimes, talk to people and um and these orgs do just that they're actually very close to the.
Interviewer, ground um so uh you know we're gonna go there too knock on doors like uh do some.
Grimes, things i'm gonna try and activate some people while i'm there it's been fun where a lot of.
Interviewer, people have reached out to me being like yeah you're gonna be in georgia like you know like.
Grimes, i tweeted you this is hilarious um yeah martin luther king the third um like uh said yeah let's get lunch i.
Interviewer, mean like you know that it's it's like oh there's like a beautiful yeah there's a beautiful.
Grimes, welcome wagon um um in georgia which is a great place dominique.
Interviewer, like freaking love dominique oh yeah dominique we'll see him in atlanta dominique wilkins.
Grimes, um so a couple things um i'll say this again i keep saying it but i do think it's important because a lot.
Interviewer, of the right is is like screaming this narrative if you.
Grimes, will where georgia has some weird residency laws and we said this before if you move.
Interviewer, there you can pretty much vote pretty immediately um which is uh not great when um.
Grimes, you know protect potentially for election fraud but the think of how that would actually work where people.
Interviewer, actually move get a place and then move out for an election it's not going to happen at.
Grimes, scale but that's not the point we are going there to help the campaigns.
Interviewer, to help the democratic party to get out the vote and register new people to vote um so that's what.
Grimes, we're doing more to come i mean guys we've now turned these campaigns which are.
Interviewer, probably what 30 i don't know the numbers of time we have 30 to 50 million.
Grimes, operations each now it's going to be combined hundreds of million dollar operation.
Interviewer, where the whole nation is now focused on the state whether they like it or not so a lot.
Grimes, is up in the air um we're figuring out what we're going to do all we know now that we're moving there and we found.
Interviewer, some great orgs to work with instead of tbd um it's also covid which we'll talk.
Grimes, about a little bit on this podcast so the in-person campaigning not as fun as it was back in iowa in.
Interviewer, january um but let me ask you this andrea i think it's really important um.
Grimes, because a lot of people see you i like to call your lane the rational progressive right where you're not.
Interviewer, far left but you have really big ideas um and you're not afraid to talk um to criticize both parties you clearly.
Grimes, are democrat you lean left on a whole bunch of things almost everything but you also.
Interviewer, are very rational and thoughtful um not left or right forward is kind of what you know.
Grimes, that's been our slogan 70 million americans voted for donald trump there is a.
Interviewer, to me it's also a healthy sign that um we're not all like the country's very divided so what are you.
Grimes, you're right now very supportive of giving joe and kamala full reign of the house and senate why.
Interviewer, we're going to georgia you might explain like why a little more you touched on a little.
Grimes, bit but why are you even though there were so many trump supporters here that we saw it wasn't a mandate why.
Interviewer, you're so passionate about the the full control for joe i i understand that there are some.
Grimes, people that are like ooh you know both parties um checks and balances compromise yeah.
Interviewer, be nice to have the boundaries you don't want to give everything yeah like i understand that perspective.
Grimes, um i think we're in a very specific situation right now where we have a pandemic that is getting.
Interviewer, worse not better we have a three to four trillion dollar hole in our economy.
Grimes, uh something like 40 million plus americans have filed for unemployment over the last period of time.
Interviewer, and so the government needs to be taking fairly dramatic measures in order to stop the bleeding.
Grimes, uh and fill that hole and provide a path for tens of millions of americans.
Interviewer, now if you look up at washington's recent history uh it's not great in terms of taking the.
Grimes, actions i'm describing um but the track record plummets when you have mitch mcconnell um playing.
Interviewer, goalie or obstructionist so if we lived in a world where the republicans and democrats have been.
Grimes, working together harmoniously and like hammering out legislation and and then uh you were in this crisis.
Interviewer, and you had confidence that they would come together uh then maybe you know it's like okay like that that.
Grimes, like that that might make sense but that's not the world we live in like we live in a world where.
Interviewer, uh we haven't gotten another relief act in seven months and counting and it's probably going to be you know.
Grimes, unfortunately like significantly longer because they're not going to pass the law in the lame duck session.
Interviewer, and in this circumstance you need an invigorated government actually doing things.
Grimes, i know it's painful for some people to hear but that's where we are half of independent restaurants are.
Interviewer, going to close without some kind of relief like think about what that means for.
Grimes, communities around the country for those jobs those people those families that freaking spent a lifetime building.
Interviewer, that restaurant put their heart and soul into it and and now are going to be forced to shut it.
Grimes, forever i mean like that's what we're facing unless our government actually uh.
Interviewer, like passes the relief act for restaurants small businesses puts money into people's hands like the.
Grimes, the deprivation and desperation are rising uh and this is not the time to be like.
Interviewer, uh like the the bipartisanship you're talking about is an abstraction like.
Grimes, uh like the reality has been sorely disappointing for years and years uh and so.
Interviewer, if we're gonna get some kind of real action out of congress we have a much better chance at it.
Grimes, uh if mitch mcconnell uh is not the final say i think that was extremely well put i.
Interviewer, think the other to me what i look at is you start to give joe options because joe.
Grimes, can go to mitch say hey i'm willing to negotiate with you so you can get your moderate republicans on board with a.
Interviewer, bill that all americans get behind but if not i'm gonna force something through like that to me is what um a reasonable.
Grimes, president can do and i think joe will be so that is why we're going to georgia that's why this matters.
Interviewer, um once we have details and you can or you um get off your butt and get down there but.
Grimes, if not also like we can phone bank you can text bank you can fundraise there's a whole bunch of virtual things.
Interviewer, you can do as well so this is where the focus is with that we have a um really special.
Grimes, guest man this is like we've been excited about this for yeah like uh i'm such a huge grimes fan.
Interviewer, on a personal level and a creative level it's just a powerhouse we met on the trail.
Grimes, um stayed in touch uh and she became a mom and you know i dare say you know like uh.
Interviewer, um that um she's been fairly low profile sense so like this was like a special treat.
Grimes, uh on several levels but i just like i just love uh talking to her and she has so much to.
Interviewer, offer a lot of insight i think the world right now.
Grimes, needs more art and uplift and that stuff's underestimated really like you know you talk about.
Interviewer, politicians um trying to be a source of that but i think artists are a more consistent.
Grimes, source of that in the vast majority of people's lives you know what i mean it's like.
Interviewer, if you want to feel good like what do you do you probably turn on your favorite.
Grimes, artist you turn on your favorite music like you probably don't turn on like old obama speeches or something um.
Interviewer, you know maybe you do some people don't turn down yeah so so just learn a ton but more.
Grimes, importantly just like um felt a real sense of joy getting to catch up with grimes i hope.
Interviewer, other people enjoy this conversation too so thank you grimes hope everyone enjoys it.
Grimes, uh is a treat for me yeah and look she doesn't do a lot of these it's a rare moment and.
Interviewer, um i learned a lot and i think um you guys enjoyed so tune in grimes joins yang.
Grimes, speaks  here at yank speaks we are all about.
Interviewer,Doing things better doing things more efficiently doing things more environmentally friendly.
Grimes,Uh and this comes down to things that we do every single day what could yang possibly be talking.
Interviewer,About i'm talking about bidets have you been to another country and been like wow what is this device.
Grimes,Huh like maybe they figured something out they have figured something out they figured out how to.
Interviewer,Uh to clean our tushies every single day in a way that's more environmentally friendly it's more on point.
Grimes,It's uh you know take some getting used to but but it's it's a better way to go and.
Interviewer,Most of us aren't at a point where we're thinking ooh like i'm gonna install one in my home.
Grimes,So you know who has you covered tushy has you covered because it's like an add-on they stick it on an existing.
Interviewer,Toilet just any standard toilet and all of a sudden it's like insta bidet and it modernizes you it makes you more.
Grimes,Environmentally friendly it'll make you more sophisticated i'll make you more european actually what am.
Interviewer,I talking about i think asia is really more into these things than anyone else so if this sounds good to you check out.
Grimes,Hello tushy go to hellotushy.comyang to get 10 off special offer hellotushy.com.
Interviewer,Yang 10 off hello tishi.com yang  it is my thrill to welcome to yang.
Grimes, speaks award-winning musician visual artist creative extraordinary crimes welcome oh.
Interviewer, my gosh guys it's so great to see you thanks for having me how's it going it's going.
Grimes, it's going 2020 good is what i say you know it's like i i can't complain but the world is.
Interviewer, terrible you know the world is a little bit less terrible now that joe has.
Grimes, defeated trump and is heading toward the white house but that election i know you and i uh texted.
Interviewer, about this like it didn't leave you with a positive feeling.
Grimes, no it was i mean it was definitely a high stress situation i think um yeah um.
Interviewer, yeah but i don't know i feel like there are lessons to be learned from this well for you you grew up in canada does.
Grimes, american politics uh horrify you fascinate you like uh from someone who grew up in our northern.
Interviewer, neighbor which seems like a more rational place in many ways um yeah like.
Grimes, like how do you experience american politics that way well first of all i feel canada isn't.
Interviewer, actually as rational as everyone thinks um you know we are the home of the crack mayor.
Grimes, rob ford um so oh yeah that guy yeah um who like got caught smoking crack and then got caught smoking on.
Interviewer, video and then got caught smoking crack like again and then possibly the third time so.
Grimes, you know it's like we really we're not that much better and actually canadian politics are i.
Interviewer, think a bit more crazy than people think just because we have a kind of like a three-party system.
Grimes, so a lot of the times the more kind of i don't know woke vote or whatever actually gets kind of split between the.
Interviewer, liberals and ndp um so canada actually has its own problems but.
Grimes, um uh you know which often leads to a conservative uh government we we still have like.
Interviewer, healthcare and uh like our college is massively subsidized which is.
Grimes, like it just actually does make a huge difference in quality of life you're you're you're a product of that.
Interviewer, right um because canada's universities including the top public universities like mcgill.
Grimes, are essentially cost free and i think like you attended i wasn't mcgill or like uh like.
Interviewer, one of the canada's big schools yeah no i attended mcgill which is literally like.
Grimes, a fantastic school like almost for free like a couple thousand dollars a year or whatever um and.
Interviewer, i'm deeply grateful for that even just because you can kind of not know your major going in and stuff.
Grimes, like i feel like in america if you make the wrong choice with your major or career like.
Interviewer, it's it can be like a hundreds of thousands of dollars mistake thousands of dollars in debt yeah it's.
Grimes, true yes so it's like i mean that's just i i i don't know i kind of didn't fully comprehend the.
Interviewer, situation till i came to america and met people and it was like damn like i got to like try out a few different.
Grimes, things before i you know chose my major so i think this is.
Interviewer, one of the main reasons we think canada is more rational is that your education is paid for and you're.
Grimes, not taking 18 19 year olds and loading them up with debt and then stressing them out about making.
Interviewer, light life decisions where they should be exploring yeah i mean i like did not know what i.
Grimes, wanted to do at 18 or 19 like absolutely not um you know so uh well actually i did.
Interviewer, want to be a musician but um i didn't think that was a reasonable career path to pursue.
Grimes, um so it ended up working out but yeah i know it's like it just seems crazy that you should be saddled with an.
Interviewer, insane amount of debt for decisions you're making before you even really know who you are.
Grimes, before your brain is fully wired seriously it's highly nonsensical uh and people.
Interviewer, are paying for it here so you knew you wanted to be a musician did you have a sense of the medium.
Grimes, like did you think i i'm i know it's going to be electronic or like you know you'd be the.
Interviewer, vocalist or did you dabble with instruments or what was the story there um i actually never made music because i.
Grimes, didn't think i could or should um and then but i was just like an obsessive music.
Interviewer, fan like super super super obsessive um and then actually in my neuroscience course or i was in a.
Grimes, uh i was sort of studying music in the brain and we actually had a class where we had.
Interviewer, to learn logic and like make a song overnight and bring a song to class the next day to prove we'd like learned the.
Grimes, um audio recording software um and that's when i kind of started making music because i.
Interviewer, i like the class provided free audio software and then i just sort of like went down the rabbit hole.
Grimes, whoa that is wild uh so what what year uh in college is that how old are you.
Interviewer, that would have probably been 2009 or 2010 um and then i basically the first music i made kind of went.
Grimes, viral uh which was both both a blessing and a curse because like there's a lot of.
Interviewer, footage of me like literally learning how to make music i've been making music for less than a year and i'm like on.
Grimes, stage and stuff there's some yeah um pretty awkward awkward video of me like being like ah i.
Interviewer, accidentally turned the uh sp 404 off sorry guys and people but um yeah so.
Grimes, well well certainly at that point your career starts taking off and you're and uh you end up making a a career move.
Interviewer, which anyone would have been in your uh position i think the most fascinating thing about your music is.
Grimes, that it really feels like you're transported to another world like i actually.
Interviewer, have you actually listened to my music i have actually listened to your music but i will confess to you guys.
Grimes, that like if i just listen to your music um i feel like i'm not getting the right experience like i feel like i have to be.
Interviewer, watching the video in order to be like i'm not sure how many of your fans feel the same way but i mean i kind.
Grimes, of feel that way so i don't know i'm glad you feel that way i.
Interviewer, think yeah yeah because you're such a visual uh artist and that there are such striking visuals.
Grimes, again you feel transported to another world for like a lot of your um your videos and songs and so i feel.
Interviewer, like they all go together in a way that makes them more complete like if i'm just listening to the music.
Grimes, in a car or whatnot like i you know i just feel like although let me wait until.
Interviewer, you know i can be someplace and you know like watch the video on my phone i mean i don't know if that that's uh.
Grimes, everyone's attitude but for whatever reason that's the way uh i've experienced your music i mean.
Interviewer, i'm usually thinking of um videos like almost all my best songs i like i was like ooh.
Grimes, imagine if i'm like imagine the scene or something um because i direct a lot of the videos.
Interviewer, myself or co-direct them with my brother um and then kind of make the song around that so um.
Grimes, it is i think core to the music and speaking of the canadian government um part of the reason.
Interviewer, i was able to even do that in the first place like being super small and on an indie label was.
Grimes, the canadian grant system which america is maybe too big to have art grants i don't know but that's.
Interviewer, another thing that i super appreciate about being born what what i mean i didn't know this but what.
Grimes, an incredible story you're like the product of the public education system and then you had some kind of.
Interviewer, art grants to make some of your first videos that helped launch you um so there are programs like.
Grimes, that in the united states but not in the way you're describing i don't believe like anyone who's an artist listening.
Interviewer, this is like i haven't seen an art grant in my life in the united states the people who are saying that are.
Grimes, generally correct um there there is a national endowment for the arts but it would not go to an.
Interviewer, independent musician that's trying to make a video like it it might go to a museum or an.
Grimes, art display um not there's anything wrong with those things um but that that's an incredible.
Interviewer, story of the government coming through i know that that's why.
Grimes, i'm like i mean if you look at the amer american music in general like so many of the artists are.
Interviewer, canadian or swedish or whatever you know like i do think there is you can like see a.
Grimes, direct correlation between the grant system and public funding for the arts and you.
Interviewer, know um like i don't know whatever the weekend bieber.
Grimes, it's drake you know yeah i i was just at a saturday night live.
Interviewer, um and i was hanging out with jim carrey and it just struck me that he's another uh super super canadian who like came.
Grimes, down and took over you know showbiz so it's true like canadian influence is very strong.
Interviewer, everywhere one of the things that i found out when i was running this entrepreneurship.
Grimes, organization venture for america was that artists have the same impact on a community's.
Interviewer, economic development as entrepreneurs like if a bunch of artists move to a community.
Grimes, and then you wait x years that community will end up having economic growth.
Interviewer, new businesses revitalization in the same way as if a group of entrepreneurs went.
Grimes, and this is a major problem for the united states because in the united states.
Interviewer, uh arts are treated not as an economic driver but as something of a luxury or frivolity uh in part because.
Grimes, of what you're describing where you show up to college and then anyone who says they're going to study.
Interviewer, art or music would be like are you out of your minds and uh you know people get funneled towards.
Grimes, quote unquote these more practical things um when in truth and you and i talk.
Interviewer, about this like in the future we have to be investing much more energy in arts and.
Grimes, creativity uh because ai and technology are going to do a lot of like the bookkeeping and.
Interviewer, accounting and like the practical stuff that that that people feel like is a safer career i mean.
Grimes, a lot of this stuff is going to change pretty quickly yeah although i do actually think.
Interviewer, like at least music is democratizing really fast um in part due to the tech companies like.
Grimes, um you know garageband being free on an apple computer or whatever.
Interviewer, um you know i i actually like i think you can actually record like i think like billy eilish said she.
Grimes, recorded her album in her house or whatever like it is the technology is kind of getting to a place.
Interviewer, where i think in uh it's just getting a lot more democratic like you don't.
Grimes, it used to be that you need to be just really rich or on like a label that's gonna spend.
Interviewer, you know hundreds of thousands of dollars to make an album and um i think it's interesting because.
Grimes, you're just seeing the amount of artists making music ballooning right now um which is cool but then it's.
Interviewer, its own drama because i was actually just talking to daniel ecke.
Grimes, who runs spotify and they're like you know there's seven million artists on spotify or whatever.
Interviewer, um and like they feel like they can like maybe make it so that like a million artists can make a living off music.
Grimes, um which is still about seven million yeah yeah seven million probably it's gonna like double like.
Interviewer, it's probably gonna be more than seven million um but i don't know like i wonder i mean.
Grimes, i know you're really into like ubi and stuff like i wonder if there's ways to like if everything is automated like.
Interviewer, if there's sort of ai and machines kind of like doing almost.
Grimes, every sort of menial job or whatever like is there a world in which if companies aren't.
Interviewer, paying employees they can like tax they can be taxed more like because of all the extra in theory all the extra.
Grimes, revenue they'd be making it while not having to pay um yeah yeah and like you know could that.
Interviewer, be like i don't know i'm actually curious about like ubi like i haven't read that.
Grimes, much about it like i'm not like like i don't know what the specifics would be like how it would be.
Interviewer, um accomplished or whatever uh i'm really passionate about a lot of elements of.
Grimes, this where right now so and you know this much better than i do and you're.
Interviewer, like an ultra successful popular artist but a lot of artists are dependent upon actually performing.
Grimes, live and touring in order to make money make a living you know what i mean yeah um yeah.
Interviewer, yeah for you too i mean like you you understand uh this better than i would but.
Grimes, uh the digital royalties from like a spotify are really really pretty minimal even.
Interviewer, for folks who are getting tons and tons of downloads and views like i forget what.
Grimes, the math is but it's something like uh i don't know like a tenth of a penny or something ridiculous.
Interviewer, yeah like maybe you get a few cents and so there are artists who might get millions of downloads.
Grimes, uh who are struggling to get by you know it's like it's actually yeah it's it's pretty.
Interviewer, insane i mean i wouldn't say it's um just an issue with the streaming services i think of late.
Grimes, the labels are a huge part of this too um i mean in music there's just a lot of.
Interviewer, middlemen like you know what once you have like you know business management lawyer.
Grimes, manager booking agent label personally i think labels pay too much but at the same time.
Interviewer, um you know a label is also can also throw a lot of money down on an artist and it can fail so it's like.
Grimes, i'm not really sure what the solution is but i i do the situation in music worries me.
Interviewer, like i know artists that are pretty successful that are like broke um and that's not.
Grimes, right you know like that these are folks who are uh.
Interviewer, millions of plays like they're like popular artists like so it's it's yeah um.
Grimes, i feel like we need to sort of like do something about the middleman situation but then i like i don't.
Interviewer, yeah there is a cost structure where you have uh an industry that came of age in a.
Grimes, time when there was a lot more money flowing through because i'm old enough to remember going to tower records and.
Interviewer, like the cd stories and whatnot you know that they were like buying this a lot of times you were buying an album.
Grimes, for like one or two good songs too it was like you know like that that was like the way it's um so you do.
Interviewer, have some legacy costs um another big problem though is that we've conditioned consumers to pay.
Grimes, one uh streaming fee and that's it you know what i mean it's like if i paid for spotify then i want all my music for.
Interviewer, free um and then and then the only way you can get more money out of them is to show up in their.
Grimes, town and perform which is okay i mean now it's not okay because no one can perform.
Interviewer, um but i think that they're there so one of the solutions i had um and you can imagine this as like.
Grimes, universal basic income so universal basic incomes government giving everyone money and if we did that.
Interviewer, then musicians would make more music and they wouldn't be starving to death and people would have more money to.
Grimes, patronize them and and support them but i think the move we have to make.
Interviewer, is something where we empower consumers to pay artists directly just by uh virtue of listening to them or having.
Grimes, their attention like every american has like a hundred music books or media books that they.
Interviewer, have in any given month and and by virtue of them listening to you you actually get.
Grimes, maybe whatever the streaming like you know pennies are but you get like a micro fraction of that person's.
Interviewer, music box for that month times all of the folks that listen to it and then all of a sudden the.
Grimes, money that goes to these seven million artists in spotify like goes up significantly.
Interviewer, this is like a revved up version of these public grants you're talking about where instead of giving.
Grimes, it to the artist we give it to the consumer so that when the consumer uh listens to a musician or supports a.
Interviewer, musician then the musician gets rewarded like you would need some kind of system like that which is actually very.
Grimes, doable like you know it's much more doable now than it would have been in another time.
Interviewer, yeah or even you know i was listening to a podcast do you know the revolutions podcast.
Grimes, mike duncan um i don't listen to it but i i've heard it it's an incredible podcast um but you.
Interviewer, know it's like he he seems to like stress it's always just and like harry's razors and all this and i'm like why.
Grimes, can't there just be a donate a dollar like why can't i just buy yes just donate the dollar and like watching.
Interviewer, artists scramble for this stuff too and be like hey support me on patreon support me on this and.
Grimes, it's like you know it's like if i enjoy your stuff you should just be getting value from me.
Interviewer, i just feel like every streaming like every single streaming service like even like youtube or.
Grimes, whatever spotify there should just be a little thing at the side of like the song.
Interviewer, cast or the video and it's like i just want to donate a dollar to this because another thing i was thinking about a lot.
Grimes, is music videos for example and i know you wanted to talk about kpop.
Interviewer, which i think is sort of anyway so like the music video master class at the moment but um they've taken it to.
Grimes, a whole other level it actually reminds me of your stuff where it's very transporting but go on.
Interviewer, um but you know it's like so music videos there isn't a direct um uh you don't directly profit from a.
Grimes, music video you like pay for a music video and you just like hope to god like it makes the song take off or.
Interviewer, whatever and that you can like earn the money back on the video and like i think this is it's kind of.
Grimes, sad because it's like i think the art of music videos would be respected more um if like you could pay for them in an.
Interviewer, easier way like when i see a  fantastic music video i'm like damn like why can't i just give them.
Grimes, two bucks or five bucks like you know um there are so many problems that are tied into this but one problem is that our.
Interviewer, attention is being monetized in various ways we're conditioned not to pay but then we pay this hidden price.
Grimes, because you're selling ads and you're selling my data and you're doing all this stuff like particularly social.
Interviewer, media world i mean a lot of this music we're talking about it's on youtube like freaking you know youtube tries to.
Grimes, monetize us through ads and they've got very effective algorithms and rabbit holes uh.
Interviewer, and and some of that stuff's not great you know like there's a joke that you're always three clicks away from a.
Grimes, conspiracy theory on your youtube like you'll start watching a video that you'll wind up.
Interviewer, you know watching some crazy video about pizzerias or whatever i don't know if this is like a proposed.
Grimes, idea but i've been thinking about this a lot lately like you know i feel like under.
Interviewer, capitalism like we value things that we pay for more than things that we don't pay for.
Grimes, um yeah and you know like do you ever get into like that um am i.
Interviewer, the page on reddit it's like a page where people like they they come and they like say they're like.
Grimes, okay am i the and they like say their situation and like there's so many of them with.
Interviewer, like you know like a stay-at-home mom like you know where the husband or whatever is just like.
Grimes, like you're the stay-at-home mom it's an easy life like blah blah blah like everything is paid for um like chill.
Interviewer, like you're not allowed to complain and you know i really started thinking about the fact that motherhood isn't.
Grimes, compensated um and it's this weird oh my gosh yes like motherhood is the hardest thing in.
Interviewer, the world like like like it's so cool it's way harder than a regular job like.
Grimes, as a person like i thought i was like a hard ass like touring and you know just like.
Interviewer, like it when you're just like alone with a baby for 24 hours like you can barely go to the.
Grimes, bathroom like it's crazy like there aren't other jobs where it's just like going to the bathroom could just be like.
Interviewer, a huge problem and like you know i'm just holding a baby in your arms crying and you're like i just need.
Grimes, to pee like ah you know it's like a really intensive job and i feel like people.
Interviewer, our society super undervalues it and um you know it's actually one of the most important jobs like it's like raising.
Grimes, the next generation what does canada do for new moms because canada has paid uh.
Interviewer, leave and whatnot uh the us is the most pathologically anti-woman and anti-family.
Grimes, and when evelyn had our first son christopher it was so difficult uh for both of us.
Interviewer, but primarily for her because when you're the dad the baby doesn't.
Grimes, care about you like the baby's homed in on mom and food uh and like the dad like you know i was.
Interviewer, um in the way a lot of the time um but seeing what evelyn went through and then trying to help.
Grimes, and being you know like uh um not you know like as much help as i want it to be um.
Interviewer, uh it's so educational like because i saw what everyone was going through where like the.
Grimes, the baby um needed her 24 7. the baby did not sleep more than you know what i forget what the rhythm was.
Interviewer, but yeah like stop now or then and half the time even when i was sleeping i was.
Grimes, sleeping on top of her and so you know she was like kind of half asleep.
Interviewer,  the baby so she was just getting um yeah it was so punishing.
Grimes, um and imagining a single mom going through that uh really broke my heart it's actually.
Interviewer, why i ran for president because i was cocky going into it i was like there are two of us and where you know.
Grimes, like we have resources in the rest of it and like it should be fine and then it was like a bomb went off in.
Interviewer, our house uh and like we both were losing our minds for months uh.
Grimes, and i just couldn't imagine someone going through it alone you know that's the main thing like two.
Interviewer, or three days in i suddenly have this insane empathy and like deep concern for single mothers like i was just like oh.
Grimes, holy  this would be like like really really bad if you were.
Interviewer, doing this on your own um and like i think you actually might be you know people say single mom and this.
Grimes, and that but it like that's like a really up thing i i think and i don't think it's a society like we're.
Interviewer, considering that nearly not at all at all because it's like.
Grimes, yeah the level brutality there is like crazy if you yeah going through it alone as a.
Interviewer, single mom and right now 40 of american children are born to unmarried moms uh you know and then some.
Grimes, really yeah so so some of them like some of them it looks like they're you know.
Interviewer, their two parents in the homes they happen not to be married but uh in in many of them.
Grimes, uh it's just a mom like it it's the new normal really in the u.s uh and it breaks my heart because like.
Interviewer, now i regard every single mom as a super woman superhuman uh about 90 of single parents are single.
Grimes, moms too so when you think single parent you're like there are single dads out there but they're outnumbered by single.
Interviewer, moms like nine to one yeah well i mean anything but single dad too i mean if you're you know you're in.
Grimes, the same boat really so um but i just like i don't even know how you would have a job and.
Interviewer, have a baby if and like not have another person like i literally can't like what would you do.
Grimes, like what would you do yeah i totally agree like it's unpredictable it's yeah.
Interviewer, so we're talking about it now but how is um like how how is is it x-812 like how did i pronounce.
Grimes, that right or i say xai archangel because but uh there's great dispute um.
Interviewer, i think around the world and in my house because i don't know his name is malleable um i.
Grimes, don't want to talk about him too much because i'm like really in the like wanting to de-celebritize him i i did.
Interviewer, i guess i really got in my own world i didn't think his name would be that big of a meme.
Grimes, so like when it became like a giant meme i was like oh like i already my kid and it's.
Interviewer, like no don't worry about it he's got plenty of time to become um uh aware trust me you know i've got.
Grimes, two boys and they don't know what the heck is going on even now and they're like you know five years older than him.
Interviewer, so you're fine don't worry about it i feel like it's like a consent thing like a baby can't consent to being like.
Grimes, famous or whatever so i'm like very cognizant of yeah trying to keep his life normal and not have him be.
Interviewer, like a celebrity baby or whatever um does he have a does he have the beginnings of a personality like.
Grimes, is he doing his thing oh yeah yeah yeah definitely i mean i think that's what's crazy like.
Interviewer, personality seems almost there from day one more like day 20 but you know.
Grimes, well one of the things that happens when you're a parent you'll probably agree with this.
Interviewer, i think uh is that before you you have children and you get this like nature versus.
Grimes, nurture debate um you think like oh it's like they're both really important it's like 50 50. and.
Interviewer, then after you have kids you're like nature totally totally like like actually like you know.
Grimes, yeah like he was smiling and um like reacting to the helicopters and stuff like weeks before.
Interviewer, he was responding to people and i was like okay obsessed with aircraft this seems.
Grimes, uh um so yeah no but it's i mean because he just his personality.
Interviewer, is fully fully like he just he has his vibe it's just there like i don't think we could change it like he.
Grimes, enjoys what he enjoys he literally has taste there's music he hates like there's music he loves like it's.
Interviewer, just like fully set you know i'm sure i'm sure you could like i don't know yeah.
Grimes, well i have the same experience where you know like our boys are very very specific and has nothing to do.
Interviewer, with anything we did you know like um so parents think it's more nature than nurture and.
Grimes, apparently science agrees apparently science says there's a lot of doesn't mean yeah science does agree it's a bit.
Interviewer, more nature than nurture um so it's not our imagination.
Grimes,Andrew i want to talk to you about something called noom which is basically a psychology focused.
Interviewer,Way to lose weight get healthier get your mind right getting in shape quote.
Grimes,Unquote is something that we all say but it doesn't actually have to be about losing a specific amount of.
Interviewer,Weight or a magic number on the scale is about these healthy habits of feeling better about yourself which is why the.
Grimes,Psychology is really important so if fitting into your favorite pair of jeans is great but there are many.
Interviewer,Reasons you might want to practice self-care and every person is different so for me.
Grimes,I find that at least on the trail too when you're eating like crap or you're traveling a lot you're working a lot.
Interviewer,Like the energy starts dropping your sleep gets a little inconsistent uh the desire to have an alcoholic.
Grimes,Beverage too often uh creeps up so this app and website and program noom is pretty.
Interviewer,Powerful and what you do is you take this quiz and we've actually done a fair amount of.
Grimes,These types of quizzes but i really like this one because it's not just like hey what's your weight loss number it's like.
Interviewer,What's important to you what are you struggling with what are you uh passionate about how busy are you what.
Grimes,Is bothering you it's just stress level is it eating it's nutrition it's digestion whatever it is.
Interviewer,Um so you create this quiz and it takes like three minutes or so if you take it a little more serious put.
Grimes,More thought into probably five to six minutes and when you're done you get this plan.
Interviewer,And it's 10 minutes a day of either focusing on your diet or physical activity or.
Grimes,Meditation or whatever you think is or whatever they determine is helpful for your efforts.
Interviewer,And for your plan and so for me i am on a getting shape plan by middle of january.
Grimes,Which concludes a little bit of working out and a little bit about diet adjustments and i'm just getting started.
Interviewer,But i've loved it so far because it's simple and it's not trying to hit a home run on your first.
Grimes,At bat like a lot of times when i get back into working out i think things like newmar the future.
Interviewer,Noom represents the best application of technology to actually make.
Grimes,Us healthier happier sign up for your trial today at noom n-o-o-m-dot-com.
Interviewer,Speaks visit noom.com speaks to start your trial today  so you just had an album come out um the.
Grimes, the creative process i can't imagine what that's like for you you know like i have.
Interviewer, a couple of things that i work on but like for you i feel like you have to be absorbing.
Grimes, uh images and music and just consuming culture in a particular way because then at some.
Interviewer, point you're going to produce a video an album and there was a quote from you that i loved it was something.
Grimes, like i don't want to just be the face of this thing i produce i want to build it like it sounds like you really have your.
Interviewer, uh your el your elbows deep into everything that you're doing um so i feel like to do that you have to.
Grimes, be this kind of sponge where you're synthesizing um art and music um.
Interviewer, you know maybe not all the time because everyone needs a break but like i feel like that must be.
Grimes, uh an important part of your work yeah no i think it's yeah i mean i'm just like.
Interviewer, constantly obsessively consuming new music and um you know books or movies or whatever um it's really.
Grimes, important to me it's it's actually like one of the reasons i did the i don't know if you.
Interviewer, saw like the i recently released an app that's like a ai um yes i wanted to talk about this it.
Grimes, was like um the digital avatar that people could use uh.
Interviewer, it's it's a different it's like it creates ai it's like an ai music generative thing.
Grimes, that makes um audio for babies um but part of the reason i did it is like all the baby is so.
Interviewer, i um uh i just feel like it's not good art like i find it like distressingly.
Grimes, obnoxious um and like it was stressing me out because i was like man i can't keep like.
Interviewer, engaging with all this bad art in order to raise my kid because it's gonna make me a worse artist and also i.
Grimes, feel like it'll make him  worse taste as well um.
Interviewer, but that is so on point because you just end up exposing yourself and your kid to this.
Grimes, kind of crap for kids dumb kids stuff is great some kid stuff is great like i we were.
Interviewer, watching fantasia the other night and i was like wow fantasia is a masterpiece like an.
Grimes, otter masterpiece have you seen that movie that this old disney movie oh yeah the old disney.
Interviewer, mickey mouse the brooms the whole thing yeah and did you know what fantasia was made.
Grimes, in 1944 and if you watch it from the lens of the war it like completely changes the whole thing.
Interviewer, it's like yeah um great film but um so i mean there's some i mean some kids.
Grimes, content is in my opinion some of the best content there's also just a lot of more like the baby stuff like getting.
Interviewer, babies to like open their eyes and you know you know like all the little cards where you show.
Grimes, them the black and white thing to try to get them to learn how to focus like i feel like that stuff is.
Interviewer, just feels weirdly mass produced and not very artistic um and i'm like man this stuff could be.
Grimes, it just could it could be prettier and brought more crimes if you wanted to uplift that you would.
Interviewer, be doing the world such a massive service uh because every parent goes through this where you.
Grimes, look up and you're like okay like how old is my kid what am i supposed to be doing and then like you.
Interviewer, you know like go online and like buy some products and you you bring them in.
Grimes, um and a lot of it is not as uh human as it could be or should be like that like there there is not a lot.
Interviewer, of heart and soul in a lot of it uh that yeah yeah so if and i know this in part because evelyn went through some.
Grimes, similar processes and so what she did is she had like a scratch pad of.
Interviewer, product ideas um and the the funny thing is that um by the time you turn to the product.
Grimes, idea as a mom like your kid has aged into a need for another product so you forget about that.
Interviewer, one i mean i my brother and i had this really funny one that like no one would.
Grimes, ever want um but do you know like brutalist architecture.
Interviewer, yeah yeah like so it was called brutalist baby and like everything would just be like.
Grimes, cement like hyper minimalist um i don't know apparently that for sure i feel like yeah now they'd be like oh.
Interviewer, this is gonna make my kid more rugged maybe it's like bad for the kid though to be.
Grimes, maybe it's sort of like pr prison-esque i don't know but yeah i'm like super into brutal.
Interviewer, brutalist architecture at the moment and i thought like brutalist baby like you.
Grimes, know like just like a square cement crib would be kind of cool.
Interviewer, oh well one of the things you and i you and i were bonding over which i i think we need in the world is that we.
Grimes, need more public art like and one of the fun things about you is like you're continuously like posting kind of.
Interviewer, visions and images of various uh structures and sculptures that.
Grimes, that should or could exist in the world have you been to burning man i have not i have many friends you've.
Interviewer, been i take it you ben yes and like the thing that struck me the most about about it is.
Grimes, it's just like art everywhere and it's just like it just feels amazing to just be walking through.
Interviewer, and there's no there's also no um obviously sound restrictions so it's just like every.
Grimes, half a block there's just like a whole new audio experience and there's just like.
Interviewer, beautiful art everywhere and i'm just like man like imagine if our cities had this much.
Grimes, like if you were just to go make something and just put it there without all the bureaucracy and.
Interviewer, paperwork and like you know like even i wanted to like mural my house or like paint it.
Grimes, black or something and like i had to go through the city council and it was like a whole thing i was like okay fine i'll.
Interviewer, just have a normal house like you know because if it's gonna be such a problem.
Grimes, you're gonna devalue the neighborhood and whatever then fine i i won't like have a cool house but like.
Interviewer, like that's you can't even like mural your house we should be able to mural our houses uh.
Grimes, in all seriousness i think public art at a bigger scale would be really.
Interviewer, transformative because right now one of the problems with america is that we're uh cynical about our ability to.
Grimes, change and evolve uh you know and and that's something around like a level of.
Interviewer, optimism and um appetite for change in a positive way and i genuinely think that art can.
Grimes, produce that in people like if you were walking around a neighborhood and then that like i guess.
Interviewer, in your case like there's like a house with a giant black mural and you're like what the heck is that and then it makes.
Grimes, you like think for a second you just done like i i was in berlin recently to work.
Interviewer, on the app actually and um like there's just there is there's just a lot more public art in berlin and i.
Grimes, was just like man this just feels cool like it just yes it just makes my day a bit better.
Interviewer, like it's just a bit it's uplifting like you're just more likely to be positive you're more likely.
Grimes, to be kind or generous or give someone the benefit of the doubt when they cut you.
Interviewer, off or whatever the heck it is like you know you're just like um more more positive to the extent.
Grimes, aside from burning man which i understand like you know i mean that that would be uh.
Interviewer, like a singular experience are there american cities that actually are like not terrible at this where you go.
Grimes, and you're like okay like this place kind of reminds me of.
Interviewer, berlin in that way or something like that i'm trying to think um i mean there's cities like.
Grimes, detroit or baltimore or montreal where there's just a lot of abandoned stuff and so there's a lot of like cool.
Interviewer, sort of illegal spaces where artists are residing um uh like i'm less familiar with this.
Grimes, now but more like when i was in my like super uh whatever underground touring days.
Interviewer, um and it's not like public but i i it is like sick like detroit there are murals.
Grimes, everywhere because there are like uh there are buildings that have fallen into.
Interviewer, uh blight and disrepair and no one cares what the heck you do so there are people going.
Grimes, miami drink our basil which i think they paint over the murals during the year i'm not sure.
Interviewer, but like it's sick to just like block some blocks of murals just it's just i'm like this is nice you.
Grimes, know it's just cool and then they were kind of having mural painting parties too where people were.
Interviewer, painting murals and there'd just be a bunch of people sitting around like drinking and like chilling like well the.
Grimes, artists were painting the murals and i was like i don't know it's just nice like if i.
Interviewer, had a sunday afternoon off and i was walking around and i saw someone painting a mural like i'd probably sit.
Grimes, there and watch and hang out like nice it's like a community a community building.
Interviewer, vibe exercise yeah in your case you'd probably sit there and be like you know what you should probably go in this.
Grimes, direction over there they'd be like oh yeah you're right no no i don't want a backseat drive.
Interviewer, that's the worst when someone's like if i'm djing and people come up with requests i'm like.
Grimes, you know don't want to backstage drive to other people's art just enjoy my vision.
Interviewer, have you wanted to be athletic have you also wanted to be green.
Grimes,Then we've got the product for you athletic greens what is athletic greens it's a.
Interviewer,Nutritional supplement uh what it is it's a mix you put in with water and all of a sudden all of these super vitamins.

Grimes,And then you feel better and then you do it on the regular and all of a sudden it feels like you had a much more complete.

Grimes, so i have only recently discovered k-pop because you know i'm like like an adult dude or whatever but.
Interviewer, um but now that i've discovered it oh my gosh like i'm convinced that they've done they've like discovered.
Grimes, parts of our brains that like activated something really uh primal and and fundamental in us where.
Interviewer, you can just watch that stuff and and just like like almost fall into like uh trance like i feel like.
Grimes, i was saying all this the other day i was talking to my friends the other day and about i like.
Interviewer, my friend like was doing some art and she was like oh but it's so wholesome and there's no dark and it was just this.
Grimes, really like everything was like pink and stuff and i was like i don't know dude like i feel.
Interviewer, like this is like radically wholesome and it's like being wholesome is actually sort of.
Grimes, like especially in art it's sort of looked down upon and like you're supposed to be a tortured artist or.
Interviewer, whatever but it's like it's actually kind of um uh edgy to be wholesome at this point.
Grimes, and i sort of feel like with kpop sometimes it's just it's like radically wholesome like it's just like.
Interviewer, nothing about it is abrasive and like i think that's actually like kind of a good thing like i feel like we almost.
Grimes, like don't have enough of that like it's it's like nice to just like know i'm gonna like vibe in and engage with.
Interviewer, something that's just gonna like sound great it's gonna look great it's gonna be positive it's like about.
Grimes, love like there's like dancing like it's just and it's just gonna be executed at a flawless level.
Interviewer, it's like i feel like it's sort of a well i was gonna say underrated but clearly not.
Grimes, anymore um well it's like the artists are kind of frozen in time at a particular age and stage.
Interviewer, let you know if you had to trace the age you'd say something like 16 to 26 i mean i.
Grimes, don't know if that's actually how old they all are um and and then the the music's aimed at a.
Interviewer, particular demo that's you know kind of similar but it's also kind of frozen in time like it reminds.
Grimes, me of michael jackson and then bruno mars on top of michael jackson or at least that.
Interviewer, bts song that now is on the radio everywhere um where um where there.
Grimes, to me and this betrays you know i grew up in the 80s or whatever but it gives me like this wholesome 80s vibe.
Interviewer, and i happened to have been in my teens during the 80s so so it's like it's like transported back.
Grimes, to um to that point i think elon and i are like not you know.
Interviewer, like around the same age i guess you might have a year or two on me um so uh.
Grimes, so i i feel like they've really figured they've like decoded something they you know and i mean they've now.
Interviewer, formed this billion dollar creative industry like powerhouse industry um.
Grimes, uh out of korea um did you see the black pink documentary that's on netflix it's like about the kind of training.
Interviewer, information oh there's a black thing talking about netflix yeah.
Grimes, you really watch that yeah like but so that they're like it's it's great and mostly wholesome and the.
Interviewer, rest of it but it also shows the way these girls and they were girls at the time.
Grimes, i got identified and recruited and trained at essentially this boot camp that goes 12 hours.
Interviewer, a day like 13 out of 14 days where they get taught how to sing dance speak korean uh like generally.
Grimes, traffic in this way and like and it also talks about how girls get weeded out.
Interviewer, on the regular like they're they're there and then um you know the person that they were brought in with.
Grimes, disappears and and like they they come up and they're training for this debut.
Interviewer, um and their training of this debut like five years later or whatnot like they have the this archival footage.
Grimes, of them showing up as uh 16 year olds or whatever it is and then they're like debuting at.
Interviewer, uh 21. um it's a you're gonna love it like because you know you're gonna know okay you know.
Grimes, that is like you know yeah that's the directly exactly what i'm looking for at this moment in time.
Interviewer, holy cow can they dance like they can dance like freaking um they're almost like ai the entire.
Grimes, thing actually k-pop kind of reminds me of ai i mean i think they're just they're just.
Interviewer, really well trained um you know it's kind of it's kind of like the the beyonce thing or whatever they're.
Grimes, just trained from young age so they're just like actually super pro like a lot of musicians like.
Interviewer, me or a lot of people i know like like i was 24 when grimes kind of took off you know and i had put like.
Grimes, very little effort into training as a artist or you know i'd never even taken a single look at this crimes one.
Interviewer, is daddy's friend one thing that i know you were inspired by from one of your early albums which i.
Grimes, was a fan of too was dune for you was dune the book the early movie.
Interviewer, like wha what was it because you're one of your early albums you were pretending to essentially craft a soundtrack for.
Grimes, dune you were like oh if this was if this was my soundtrack to it well the tragedy of my life so like my dream as a.
Interviewer, child like i was like i want to be the i want to direct the dune movie and like even.
Grimes, as a child i always had i actually like i respect a lot of things about the david lynch movie but.
Interviewer, it's not this prop maybe this is sort of like not supposed to say this i don't love.
Grimes, the david lynch movie um uh i super loved the book like my i read the book when i was really young.
Interviewer, like my dad started reading it to me when i was like five or six and then i just like got obsessed with.
Grimes, it and just like finished it like when i was like six or something so it's this very.
Interviewer, formative experience to me um uh but yeah i think dune is like phenomenal.
Grimes, phenomenal i know it's like i guess sort of problematic in some ways or.
Interviewer, you know um but uh i'm actually really excited about the new movie at first i was like.
Grimes, extremely bitter and i was like  danny villeneuve and blah blah blah blah or whatever but honestly the cast.
Interviewer, you probably wrapped around a lot of these circles have you met um denny villeneuve or any of these guys.
Grimes, no i've never met him i may be saying his name wrong but i recently i just copied my uh.
Interviewer,  um but like weirdly timothy chalamet is actually like a great actor.
Grimes, um and like zendaya like i don't know honestly the casting in dune is like almost perfect like it's.
Interviewer, probably what i would have done so but i'm so sad that it's been postponed it was like i would literally i was like.
Grimes, i was like this is like the light at the end of the tunnel like of the pandemic was.
Interviewer, going to dune like and i was you know going to rent out a feeder for all my friends and.
Grimes, everyone cosplay as a character from dune um and i was going to be like a sand.
Interviewer, worm or an artistic interpretation of a sand worm um but yeah huge tragedy that that film.
Grimes, release has been delayed what um what a glorious vision of this uh film premiere or the private.
Interviewer, film premiere like i hope this comes to pass just delayed you know a bit because like.
Grimes, the the you and the um sand worm in a costume would be funny.
Interviewer, there'd be a lot of funny things to be had um um i'm a dune fan from the book uh the.
Grimes, the movie didn't do much for me which is kind of funny um but i loved the world building of the book.
Interviewer, and i think that it was almost it was very very hard to make a good movie about that book.
Grimes, given filmmaking capabilities of like the 80s and whatnot yeah yeah yeah um i mean i.
Interviewer, i one of the things that i love about doing that i think is so interesting is it's.
Grimes, it's like so far in the future but it's sort of post technological you know like ai is banned thinking.
Interviewer, machines are banned and so like people are just crazy mind enhancement and stuff to like make up for.
Grimes, um you know the technology bands which is really really interesting to me um especially.
Interviewer, because like i do worry we might get into a situation where like governments might start banning.
Grimes, technology um like i think a lot of like the tech boom has been amazing but also it.
Interviewer, has been quite irresponsible from a safety perspective and it like you know i'm worried if the degree to.
Grimes, which like if the irresponsibility continues we might get into a place where like.
Interviewer, we're shutting down technology like because we just no no it's a real i mean right now that's like the.
Grimes, the overreaction that everyone can see coming uh because right now there are so many people that do not feel like.
Interviewer, they're getting included by technologies uh forward advancement uh and that there is something happening.
Grimes, where uh where technology is consuming more and more of our time.
Interviewer, more and more of our kids time um are you on tick tock um on and off i do find the algorithm.
Grimes, to be unsafely addictive so i'm bingo that's where i was going with it yeah wait was i talking.
Interviewer, about the main technology center for humane yeah we were talking about tristana.
Grimes, yeah yeah totally yeah and you know i think for example like i was listening to a podcast with.
Interviewer, tristan harris and i think it's tristane whatever i'm saying his name wrong that's right and um.
Grimes, you know the guy who invented the endless scroll you know and it's just like.
Interviewer, like a lot of this stuff is like really addictive and also like um prioritizes hysteria.
Grimes, and rage um and also just uh misinformation um and you know i think it's.
Interviewer, like leading to not only like a political crisis but a mental health crisis.
Grimes, um yes you know i was also i was reading this thing about how like you go on twitter.
Interviewer, or whatever and you your brain is kind of getting the social chemicals and you're like feel.
Grimes, like you're getting the social time but you know you're not like there's different hormonal releases when you're.
Interviewer, actually in a room with real people you know and it's like you're actually you feel like you're getting social.
Grimes, a social experience but you're really not and and so it's like people are kind of having the byproducts of being.
Interviewer, quite isolated um not to mention the lack of sleep like you know like these things like you're.
Grimes, on your phone late at night like it's gonna be harder to sleep like i think sleeping pill usage is going way up yeah.
Interviewer, which is leads to less rem sleep blah blah blah and all this like feeds into like mental health crisis on top of.
Grimes, you know all the political political stuff and everything um but yeah i i it's quite concerning and.
Interviewer, you know i was thinking the other day i was talking some people the other day um about how it you know it's like we.
Grimes, have global warming and then we have all these global warming scientists or whatever.
Interviewer, or like we have pandemic and then we have all these pandemic scientists but then we have tech.
Grimes, and then there isn't like a tech safety community that's super large like it's quite small.
Interviewer, it's quite unforgotten the extent that it exists it's tiny like it's just the people that he has on the podcast.
Grimes, and that that's like i think there's like oxford there's like some stuff at oxford like.
Interviewer, there but it's still it's like it's just not it you know it's interesting that.
Grimes, when people consider career in tech it's it's all sort of like making the tech and none of it is the sort of like the.
Interviewer, stuff about the guard rails yeah yeah and it's like especially like when we're getting.
Grimes, close to ai and talking about ai you know it's like it's going to be super important to have.
Interviewer, like as many people working on ai safety as the.
Grimes, as much as actually just building ai this is one of the things i said on on the trail grimes is that i said look.
Interviewer, some of the most powerful technologists in the world have said to me that they want guardrails on ai.
Grimes, because all the incentives right now are to go as fast as possible because we're competing against each other and the.
Interviewer, chinese and one of us is going to do something very regrettable.
Grimes, and and so i would say to folks it's like look if elon is saying this or sam altman is.
Interviewer, saying this then we really need to listen because these are not people that frankly generally request guardrails you.
Grimes, know like that that's not really yeah yeah yeah yeah no exactly like late.
Interviewer, you know they yeah um uh i mean one of the things that really concerns me about the state of the.
Grimes, government right now um you know at the risk of sounding aegis.
Interviewer, is we just have a lot of people in the government who are like very old they didn't grow up with the internet they're.
Grimes, not super tuned into technology like you know there's people who are like getting.
Interviewer, their they're not even checking their email like in congress and stuff.
Grimes, they might never check their email in their entire life yeah like their emails get printed out and they read the paper.
Interviewer, and then like say you know it's just like this is like really concerning like i don't think.
Grimes, the government across the board has any understanding of technology and that's part of the reason.
Interviewer, the facebook situation is so out of control we can all see it's happening and you.
Grimes, don't want to be a jerk to be like oh you know the olds don't get this stuff but the fact is the average age of a u.s.
Interviewer, senator is 62. so like how many 62 year olds you know that like understand.
Grimes, like the mechanics of the social media companies um very few and there has not been independent.
Interviewer, guidance on technology related issues in the us congress since 1995 you know 25 years so so they're.
Grimes, completely out to lunch on this set of issues uh it's corrosive for democracy it's close.
Interviewer, environmental health and i've experienced these social media apps in a particular way.
Grimes, where i ran for president and tried to use these apps to the best of my ability to make my case.
Interviewer, and compete and generate a following uh and so i've benefited from them tremendously um.
Grimes, yes yep but same i rely on them completely to run my business yeah um but i can.
Interviewer, very very clearly see the downsides for users uh where i think that i'm unusually good on them.
Grimes, and even for me sometimes like i sense myself lapsing into like a twitter vortex or.
Interviewer, like uh you know like an hour two will pass um and yeah and then i'll look up and be.
Grimes, like oh wait like i was supposed to do this other thing you know it it feels like you're being.
Interviewer, productive in a particular way and social in a particular way well you huge reward you know the way.
Grimes, it's been set up like as tristan harris or whatever says like it's it's just.
Interviewer, rewards we're like ooh like you hit the heart and go blue like it you know like the squirrel like this.
Grimes, it's so set up visually to just like make your brain just like like tuned in and you know it does it.
Interviewer, does feel semi-productive or you know you're like oh i'm learning things i'm learning.
Grimes, things but it's like a very shallow um comprehension you know if you're getting a one sentence on a thing it's.
Interviewer, like ooh like a fact like are you even gonna remember that and there's no deep knowledge there um which.
Grimes, and i'm not saying this like i don't wanna say social media is all bad social media obviously is great and.
Interviewer, you know there's been a lot of like political organizing and stuff on it so yeah you know it's it's definitely like.
Grimes, i'm not just saying like you know social media but but but there are there are excesses and the.
Interviewer, excesses are hitting teenage girls particularly hard yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean the.
Grimes, beauty stuff i i think is like concerning um and i believe that that tick tock is.
Interviewer, the most powerful of these in its own way like i just got on tick tock maybe um.
Grimes, two weeks ago three weeks ago and holy cow is that stuff powerful like you you get in there and uh it's.
Interviewer, it's hypnotic uh you know you just end up seeing these videos of human beings like like dancing humans are trained to.
Grimes, want to look at human faces you know it's like like consider the amount of portraits versus landscapes.
Interviewer, you know in the lineage of painting um like we want to look at humans like we're you know.
Grimes, i i think yeah i think it behooves most any adult who wants to understand what's going on.
Interviewer, with the younger generation to try and spend a few hours on tick tock just to see what the heck the kids are.
Grimes, doing um because it's like another language it's like another visual and digital language.
Interviewer, it's got a different energy and vocabulary different people uh you know it's like it's fascinating.
Grimes, because like you know i've been on twitter now for a little bit and all the media and the journalists.
Interviewer, are on twitter and then you go on tick tock and it's like just actual like kids having fun.
Grimes,  i think it's great for music for you for music it would be.
Interviewer, i'm sure like a really useful fire hose you could just like turn it on and like um get stimulation in a particular way.
Grimes, well it's sort of i think a more natural i mean maybe there are you know the dark forces of major labels.
Interviewer, pushing certain songs or whatever but like as far as i'm aware like i feel like it's just people.
Grimes, like dig a song a song has a cool vibe with a certain movement and then like that song can kind of take.
Interviewer, off in a natural organic way and i think that's pretty cool.
Grimes, um because music is super over gate kept and i like i think tick tock doesn't have that.
Interviewer, i don't know i might be wrong but there's a music discovery element and there are.
Grimes, like undiscovered artists who are just making their stuff there uh and yeah yeah and getting found are you.
Interviewer, gonna run again do you think uh i'm almost certainly gonna run for something at some point.
Grimes, and i i've been pretty public about that um and i dare say it would be more fun the second time.
Interviewer, than the first time because we'd start at a higher base the but the problems are just getting.
Grimes, bigger and hairier and nastier and i just want to try and solve them for your son for my sons for everyone's kids.
Interviewer, um because you and i are in a position where we're actually more able to make a difference in the world and.
Grimes, frankly you know like the vast vast majority of folks and so uh like i take that responsibility to.
Interviewer, heart so yeah you're going to see andre yang on some ballot somewhere in some campaign.
Grimes, i've got a couple of uh visions uh but first things first you know we we have um right now this.
Interviewer, this might be too um uh too nitty-gritty for you but we're heading to georgia for the senate races.
Grimes, uh trying to win the senate oh yeah for the dems and then uh you know and then i may end up in the.
Interviewer, administration trying to tackle some of the social media problems you're talking about.
Grimes, um that would be cool yeah if you if you if that does end up happening and you end up like.
Interviewer, i don't know like working with the center for humane tech people or anything like that like.
Grimes, and you need any help definitely hit me up i will hit you up that would be so fun.
Interviewer, grimes what we do is we'd have this um you know this message that we need to get out um and then you could help.
Grimes, you could like make some freaking incredible creative for it um we'll hit you up on that for.
Interviewer, for sure look at that you could be like the champion of the of the humane technology movement or the.
Grimes, human tech movement i would love it cool yeah well anyway i can help just let me know thank.
Interviewer, you for listening in i hope you enjoyed this conversation if you did please do subscribe to yang.
Grimes, speaks and click on notifications so we can let you know every time we have a new episode.
Interviewer,  .
Grimes,"It's weird because I've already heard the record a million times so it's old. I finished it in August and the way I roll is that I make a record and then after the record's done, I'm just done with it. Giving it more time almost gives me more time to not be so sick of it, though. Right after I finished it, I was like 'Wow, I just killed myself to make this' and there was just a point where if I heard any of those songs, any of those drum beats, I would just shutter!"
Interviewer,Grimes.
Grimes,"I wrote my thesis on Medieval music and I've always thought the dialogue between music and God in Medieval society was really cool and even though I don't believe in any of that stuff, I've always thought all that stuff was really interesting. Like, this idea of seq:uestering yourself and fasting, it's a process and it leads to good art, or whatever, so I just decided to blackout my windows and lock myself in my room and just not really have any stimulation of any kind. I didn't talk to anybody for three weeks, I had been on tour for a really long time so I just didn't tell anyone I was back, and I tortured myself and kind of went crazy in my room. My roommate went and got my groceries because, obviously, I didn't fast the entire time or I would've died! It worked incredibly well, I was inspired the entire time and I was making so much music. I think it's my best work yet."
Interviewer,Is this the way you always record music or was this a first?
Grimes,I've done it for a couple of days before but it's definitely a whole new ball game when you do it for an extended period of time.
Interviewer,"Whenever you talk about Visions, you make it sound like it's your debut album but, in reality, this is your third. Why does this feel like the first to you?"
Grimes,"This is like my first record as a musician, the first record that was thought out and meticulous and not just random songs that I liked. This one was more reflective of the phase I was in and just more artistically and emotionally directed. Also, this was the first time I knew that people were going to hear it. In the past, I always just made music and it was just whatever; put it on the internet for free and I just didn't give a suct or think about it that much. With this, there was actually a publicist involved and there's an infrastructure here. And, obviously, we started talking to labels and it was like, 'OK, this isn't going to be me posting things online for free, this is going to be an actual thing so it needs to be good!'."
Interviewer,It's also your most poppy-sounding record yet. Was that intentional?
Grimes,"I think that was just natural. I've always to make pop music and I've just slowly been working on getting there on my records. Actually, at the time, I thought my first two releases were pop records but it's only now that I realized that I was just crazy!"
Interviewer,You're a musician and a producer but you've expressed more interest in producing. What does the future hold for Grimes?
Grimes,"I definitely want to make at least two more albums after this but I just don't want to be a touring musician when I'm 30 years-old. It's a crazy life, I'll just be so haggard! I probably have 11 more records in me but maybe two or three more records that I'm willing to tour. I'd rather recede into the background. I'm getting really interested in film and I can't afford to go to film school but I'd like to somehow be a filmmaker or producer of pop songs or something. I want to finish my records for 4AD and do a really good job, build the concept of Grimes because it's a brand and just expand that into other arts and bring in other people later on and be able to work on things where I don't actually have to look nice or be charismatic because those are things I don't like doing."
Interviewer,Do you feel like you always have to look nice?
Grimes,"Well, as of tomorrow, I'll be in Europe so I have to do all these photo shoots and stuff. When left to my own devices, I'll just wear my pajamas for weeks and not shower! I grew up with four brothers, I'm a huge tomboy so this whole fashion thing has just come out of the blue. It's really great but it's definitely like, fuck I have to always be presentable. I'd just rather be dirty, angry and alone in my room."
Interviewer,"Largely, the music writing that's out there about you is focused on how non-specific your sound is and how your influences are wide-ranging; the word ""ethereal"" is used a lot. Was that your intention?"
Grimes,"I mean, I think my sound is post-Internet. People my age had the Internet when they were kids. So I think I just had a really diverse musical background, but from a really young age. People who are 30 and older don't have that, they were raised with genres of music. But people my age had everything all at once, and that's why get Animal Collective and all these weird medley bands. Because genres are sort of disappearing, people just use bands as reference points. And if I were to describe my sound, I'd just say it's ""modern?""."
Interviewer,"But you obviously love singing, so who did you sing along to growing up?"
Grimes,"Christina Aguilera, you know, crap like that."
Interviewer,We all did. Who else?
Grimes,"Mariah Carey. I was really into Disney soundtracks, like Mulan and Pocahontas."
Interviewer,"When you're performing onstage, you're Grimes. How do you prepare? Is there a specific mood you channel, or as soon as the music starts, it's immediate?"
Grimes,"It's different every time. Tonight, I was probably more caffeinated than is probably a good idea. Usually I drink a beer, take five lozenges, drink tea, and do a hundred or two hundred skips on the skipping rope, and then I go."
Interviewer,So now you're based in Montreal; why do think there's always so much groundbreaking music coming out of there?
Grimes,"Well I feel like Montreal's this sort of weird anomaly in Canada, because it's pretty hard to leave Canada economically, but all of the cities that provide metropolitan benefits are very expensive, like Toronto and Vancouver. But Montreal is really cheap so it's pretty much the best place to be if you're trying to be an artist, because you don't have to pay a lot of rent. Nobody I know has a steady job, at all. Nobody. And we all just work on art all the time, and it's really dark and depressing most of the year, so you work on art even more."
Interviewer,"So in the Montreal music scene, what's your everyday artist life like?"
Grimes,"Well I sort of lead a double life because I attend McGill University, or I recently got kicked out of McGill University for not attending. I was studying general Arts and Science degree, but I was in the electro-acoustics program, which is like psycho-physics, which I love. It's the physics of neuro-biology, specifically related to music, and I have a lot of really good friends who study that. And then I have my music friends; I live with Marilis, who's my publicist and is heavily involved in the label. My manager lives on my block; four of the apartments in my apartment complex of seven are people I know. It's a really close-knit community, and almost everyone on these few blocks are artists or graphic designers, because we live right on the cusp of a warehouse district."
Interviewer,You've suddenly gained a lot of momentum; what's that been like?
Grimes,"I think the big development for me was on our tour down at South by Southwest, because it was just too crazy, and I didn't go any the shows except the ones I was playing. The band I was playing with was called Doldrums, and the guy in that band had such a lucid philosophy about what music was and why we're doing it, and I was kind of getting stressed about press, and things getting weirder. I had to restructure my ideas about why this is necessary why this is a good thing, and that I do really want to do this. Also finding a balance between pop music and my background, which is goth, metal, and industrial. I used to play smoky warehouse parties to lots of drunk people at midnight, and I don't want to lose that."
Interviewer,How did you start playing those parties?
Grimes,"I moved to Montreal before I started playing music. I was 17 or 18; as soon as I graduated from high school, I just left Vancouver. I guess because people perceived my first two records as dance records, which they're not, at all, but I kept getting asked to play these parties. But I didn't know how the hell to play music live so I'd play weird ambient stuff, and people would be like, ""What the fuck?"" So I started playing more dance-oriented music. I think that's why my sound is a lot more upbeat now."
Interviewer,And now you're opening for Lykke Li? What's that like?
Grimes,"Pretty crazy. It's pretty intense. I've not played for this many people in my life. This is a really big jump, because I only just started playing music. I have no idea what I'm doing. It's psychologically intense, but I think it's important to do things that you're not ready to do, because you'll just get better and better."
Interviewer,"Since this life is fairly new, how do you wind down or return from having to suddenly play at Webster Hall or be away from home for stretches of time?"
Grimes,"We chill out, drink, well, I can't really drink. All the things that make me happy, I can't do because they wreck my voice, like eat yogurt and smoke weed."
Interviewer,"Because you're still figuring out life as a musician, what other aspects of your life have influenced your sound?"
Grimes,"I've always had this problem where I'm just a little too crazy to deal with academic life while being an intensely academic person, and the I kind of had a breakdown a couple years ago and was homeless in America."
Interviewer,Where do your songs come from? You sound upset in a lot of them.
Grimes,"Yeah, they're mostly from a place of me being really upset, and weirdly, that's probably why they sound really happy a lot of the time. hahaha I've always had this need to constantly be putting something out. I did ballet for 11 years, and then after that, really intense into visual arts, and now I'm really intense into music. But this is the one that I feel most connected to. It's very escapist for me, but at the same time it's not about avoiding reality, I want to make things more real, but not always have to deal with the crap in my life, if that makes sense?"
Interviewer,Is there anyone you're really interested in working with?
Grimes,"I'd really like to work with Physical Therapy, I think he's super sick."
Interviewer,Anyone else?
Grimes,Anybody? Nicki Minaj!
Interviewer,Does it ever get lonely not having a band?
Grimes,"There's definitely solitary aspect to not having a band, and there are times when I wish that I did. Ultimately, this is something I would really need to do on my own; I couldn't work with anyone else, I think, it's really personal project. And I like that fact that I can be lying in bed trying to sleep and then getting up at two in the morning and recording. That's big for me. I need the control and spontaneity, and not have to rely on anyone, and not have anyone rely on me."
Interviewer,How did you meet?
Grimes,We have all the same friends.
Interviewer,Were those early incarnations of d'Eon and Grimes?
Grimes,I guess. You played traditional Eastern music....
Interviewer,"Yeah, I was playing Tibetan music at the time...."
Grimes,"And I was just like, it was Blue Hawaii but it was me instead of Raf."
Interviewer,"On the bill you were listed as Claire-slash-Alex, and not Grimes, and this was right before your first tape came out. And I was playing with my buddy under the name Hassan I Sabbah X."
Grimes,But I thought it would just be like B-sides and no one would ever hear it... it kind of is B-sides.
Interviewer,"Both of our labels were just like, ""Yeah we wanna get in on this!"" and decided to release it properly."
Grimes,We jammed twice. The first one we smoked a lot of weed and it was really good... second one not so good.
Interviewer,"We don't jam with other people very much, so... that's why we did the split, rather than a collaboration, because it would just be too stressful to compromise both of our ."
Grimes,Probably play shows. Remixes would be good. I was going to sing for you....
Interviewer,"Yeah, I definitely want to write some vocal music for her. There are certain things that I want to do vocally that I can't do, and I'd have to get someone like Claire to sing."
Grimes,"I like the idea of someone writing a song and me singing it. I do that with Devon, from upstairs Majical Cloudz."
Interviewer,When were the tracks on the split recorded? Were they B-sides to your respective 2010 albums?
Grimes,"Mine is post-'Halfaxa', but... I don't know what I did, why I wasn't writing music. I've since written an album, since the split, but for some reason I had nothing for it."
Interviewer,For me it was definitely all new....
Grimes,"A lot of mine was from Christmas break, in Vancouver."
Interviewer,"All my stuff was made for the split. Over six months to a year, when I was recording 'Palinopsia', I was thinking on the side, maybe I should do something for this split that might happen someday. I made like four tracks, and then you made some tracks, and then we scrapped those and made some more...."
Grimes,Yeah we went through so much crap.
Interviewer,So there's probably at least twenty songs.
Grimes,B-sides for b-sides.
Interviewer,"My side was basically done in January. I did those four songs really quick, because I wanted it to go together, as parts."
Grimes,"I decided I'm going to be a video director. I think music videos are really important, and you can approach them the same way as you approach a song. For me, it doesn't need a narrative, it can just be an abstract representation of a sonic piece, rather than like, a film. I really wanted to do something that was... kind of impish... J-pop feel, but also kind of creepy."
Interviewer,They seem like two parts of a whole.
Grimes,I just wish we could have used the same camera for both though.
Interviewer,"But it's kind of cool, it's a little more DIY."
Grimes,I like that yours is DIY....
Interviewer,"Claire and Sadaf, who did the photos for the cover, are mostly responsible for the visual stuff, because I'm not really a visual artist and I don't have that sort of eye. But I'm really glad we used that photo for the album cover. It's weird, a lot of people in this sort of circle of music don't really use their faces."
Grimes,We want to bring back the pop star. Like an Alicia Keys cover where it's just her face.
Interviewer,"I am a little wary of having my face on the internet, but it is a little more distinctive just to have somebody's face instead of some abstract art."
Grimes,I think it's necessary.
Interviewer,"I kind of look like a metalhead, or a junkie, or a hippie or whatever, none of which I am. I like that cognitive dissonance, because you hear some of the songs and you think, ""This guy sounds like Phil Collins or Ashanti,"" but then you see the video and you're maybe like ""Who the fuck is this guy?"" I like not looking like my music."
Grimes,The photos are almost distastefully high contrast.
Interviewer,"Yeah, knowing what you look like it's hard for me to dissociate, but to some person, the people on the cover might not be you."
Grimes,"Same with Single Ladies! There's a visual catchiness. Humans like to look at people are there any really famous landscape paintings? Music is about humanity. I like pop stars because you can see who they are. Knowing who made something can make it a lot better, or a lot worse."
Interviewer,I think there is a rawness in the synchronized dancing in your  video in particular.
Grimes,"The actual production of that video was really intense and everyone got quite drunk... one girl puked. For everyone it was really nerve-wracking, but at the end we were really comfortable. It was a really long day. I wanted it to have this impish, we're-just-pulling-it-together quality, which it does kind of have, but then it's also got that...."
Interviewer,Sheen?
Grimes,It's got a sheen. I love the sheen. The guy who shot it  really knows what he's doing.
Interviewer,"Yeah, he's involved with fashion...."
Grimes,"He mostly does fashion stuff and that's why I like working with him, because he's turning Grimes into a fashion thing, and I really like that."
Interviewer,"Yeah that's part of the whole popstar culture now, with fashion. It used to be you could be a popstar look at Phil Collins...."
Grimes,Phil Collins all the time!
Interviewer,"I know... but he's a good example because in his videos he's wearing a sweater and some jeans... but now if you want to be a pop singer you have to always wear haute couture, avant garde, crazy shit."
Grimes,I love that.
Interviewer,"Claire, you're really into that angle but you  were talking about having a dissociation from your music what is your stance on it?"
Grimes,"I've been studying popstars... those songs, I feel are old though. I've moved far beyond that, in terms of like... me and my manager Seb went into the studio and then we mixed everything, and he basically taught me everything is still bedroom, but we replaced a lot of the drums in the studio, put effects on the vocals. Seb made me... he was like, ""we're mixing the vocals high"" and I was like  ""no, I'm so scared... "" but now I love it, I just had to get over that fear of hearing myself sing."
Interviewer,"For me too, I learned a lot from Seb. I don't know how to actually produce...."
Grimes,"No, everything is gained."
Interviewer,"It's a huge struggle for me because when I was really small to sixteen or seventeen, my whole life was classical piano. And I quit that almost ten years ago, but music theory is subconsciously ingrained in my mind. I can't help but follow the musical rules. I feel like a lot of producers especially in jungle or dubstep or hardcore... the reason it sounds so good is because you've got a bassline happening in C minor, but the vocals are in D major and it fits because it sounds really weird. If I want to do something like that, I have to make the conscious decision to...."
Grimes,It's so subtly weird.
Interviewer,"I've always thought of that song as being particularly sad, and really desperate and full of dread. It's not goodtime music, it's badtime music!"
Grimes,It's also goodtime music for me!
Interviewer,"Okay, personally it's badtime music. When I was making all of these songs I was insurmountably fucking unhappy, very angry, I was living in a room without a window... I was like, I hate everything that life is giving me...."
Grimes,The smell of sex.
Interviewer,"And really fucked up lyrics. A really good example of that is the Magnetic Fields. He had a few synthpop albums in the nineties that sort of sound like the Silly Kissers. All those songs are super sweet and schmaltzy, and chintzy and a little bit cheesy, but there's one lyric"
Grimes,"I like it when people are cocky... Tyler the Creator, Wiz Khalifa...."
Interviewer,They do have a self-deprecating element as well though.
Grimes,"I think about it a lot... I want to, but... I feel like any intention I have musically is very abstract... ahh, it's a struggle. It's much harder to mask what you're saying when  how to get a word that's that ""ooh"". It's hard to have that meticulous of an idea about enunciation when you're trying to construct vocal parts. I like a lot of consonants together, like in Eastern European languages. I sang one song in Russian, I've been putting a lot of things backwards...."
Interviewer,I wish I knew Arabic... all those glottal stops and guttural sounds....
Grimes,"None of them seem distasteful to us, I mean... when was drum & bass? It was the thing, it was in there. I went to some bad parties... everyone danced with a backpack on...."
Interviewer,"In high school, I was so into jungle, jungle mixtapes from people on the internet. It was so foreign and British and strange, and it comes out. I'm definitely going to make more tracks with jungle breakbeats... but I get a little miffed when people claim this is such-and-such a throwback. You can't not throw back."
Grimes,The world is finite... nobody I know listens to just one genre.
Interviewer,What's coming up for both of you?
Grimes,"I'm working on a full-length, which I kind of feel is my first album. I've had to travel and play a lot... there's not going to be any crap on this one."
Interviewer,Is that through Arbutus?
Grimes,Yeah. And I'm touring a lot.
Interviewer,"Let's talk about Visions first. You put up a tweet a couple days ago, a retweet of someone calling your music ""A sonnet to the bad future of the Japanese version of Sonic CD.""."
Grimes,Did I really write that?
Interviewer,"No, you just retweeted it."
Grimes,"I'll be honest, I had taken all my clonazepam when I crossed the border a few days ago because I didn't have a prescription. So, a couple days ago, for about 48 hours, I have no memory of."
Interviewer,What's the clonazepam for?
Grimes,"Eh, recreational.."
Interviewer,"Happens, I guess. Still, with what I mentioned in mind, especially with the general response to Visions, including tweets like this, what do you feel about it?"
Grimes,"It's super varied. I feel like there's a couple different types of Grimes fans that interpret it totally differently. So there's more the Lykke Li type fans, who are all, ""We like pop music."" And then there's sort of the more experimental fans that I feel like are more my peers."
Interviewer,"So, more the Lizzi Bougatsos fans."
Grimes,"Yeah, something like that. It's hard, I don't read any of my press. I really don't know what people think ... of my music except when I'm speaking with my friends and contemporaries because we all just throw stuff off each other. I feel like I'm out of the loop."
Interviewer,"Well, it's a good idea. You put your head into too much press, it just drags you in."
Grimes,"Yeah, and it sort of influences you. It's like when the hippie culture started getting sold back to the hippies. The Internet creates this ""idea"" of you that you then feel like you need to fit into. I just don't want to get sucked into that. I just never want to try to make music that sounds like my other music, or try to appease my fans. It shouldn't be about that."
Interviewer,"Going into production, what was your setup? I know you were doing this in your apartment...."
Grimes,"I was using a Roland Juno-G, Line 6 M9 vocal processor, and a BOSS VE-20 vocal processor. I used GarageBand, but I only used it for tracking. I use Logic now. I really need to make clear that I no longer use GarageBand."
Interviewer,"It's OK that you used GarageBand, especially if you used it for a demo or something."
Grimes,"But you can't export lossless, though. I feel like the record could have been more hi-fi."
Interviewer,Don't mind that.
Grimes,Ghosts.
Interviewer,"It's just a stage... And then suddenly, the doors open and people are looking at us and I'm all ""What the hell?""."
Grimes,There's always a number of state of minds. That general anxiety and constant self-evaluation/being totally out of my mind.
Interviewer,"Going back to setup, you mentioned a couple vocal processors. Do you have a certain preference for that?"
Grimes,I just felt that GarageBand didn't have good vocal effects.
Interviewer,"Well, that's obvious. You mentioned some specifics, I think it was a Line 6... ?"
Grimes,"Yeah. It's a guitar pedal actually, but still. At the time I made the record, I think I went crazy, because I didn't sleep for up to five or six days sometimes, and I was taking tons and tons of amphetamines. The whole thing is kind of like an insane prophetic glossolalic devotional piece or something."
Interviewer,"Speaking of your vocals, you seem to fluctuate a lot of the time in your tonality and inflection. What inspires you to do that?"
Grimes,"I just do what feels good. I don't try to think about it, really."
Interviewer,So it's more random and not some specific personality.
Grimes,"It's definitely not random. Music should just really be projected in a way that feels good. Not what the best thing to do is. I feel in the back of my head I know what the best thing to do is. I never sit down and and think, ""Now I'm going to sing like this,"" or, ""Now I'm gonna try and end like this."" It's always after the fact where I think, ""Well, my influences are really obvious here,"" or, ""I've listened to a lot this there and it comes through,"" da da da. Or occasionally, I'll be trying out stuff like... I remember seeing some interviews saying how Enya produces her own vocals, so I try to do a lot of that."
Interviewer,So you're big on singers like Enya and Elizabeth Fraser.
Grimes,"Yeah, Claire Hamill, too."
Interviewer,Does it bother you when people note or talk about your lisp?
Grimes,It used to. But I've gotten over it. I've accepted my fate.
Interviewer,"One thing I noted in looking over the artwork, there is this phrase in Russian  that translates roughly to ""But I warn you that this is the last time."" Is there any significance to that?"
Grimes,"I think it was, I just got a bit crazy with that record. I don't know, I just like to think about dying, whether or not I'm going to die. This record is, ""what if I died tomorrow?"" At the time I made the record, I think I went crazy, because I didn't sleep for up to five or six days sometimes, and I was taking tons and tons of amphetamines. The whole thing is kind of like an insane prophetic glossolalic devotional piece or something. But it's also obviously totally done in this pop way because that's what I know. That's how I interact with music."
Interviewer,So you're translating to fit within the language of the context?
Grimes,"I don't know if it's the past so much as the religious state of mind, if that makes any sense. Human beings are predisposed to complete irrationality or a desire to believe in something that is inexplicable, and potentially even devote themselves to that. That's what religion is, and what people have always fallen back on. I was raised in a super-Catholic environment. Now I'm not religious, but I do have the memory of how either a religious mindset or being religious works. A lot of my favorite composers and artists were really religious, and I think when you're creating art that isn't about your life, it's about a higher human consciousness or higher state of being that might not be human or might not be conscious. I think that's really beautiful. But then there's the fact that I play dance parties and exist totally on the Internet. I feel like I'm getting totally abstract here."
Interviewer,"No, no, you're fine. One thing to came to mind when I was coming over here was that you live in Montréal right now, I'm assuming Mile End or something like that...."
Grimes,"Yeah, I mean, I don't live anywhere right now, but when I did live in Montréal, I was on Parc and Van Horne."
Interviewer,"Anyway, before that, you were based in Vancouver. How much do these two places play off each other in terms of state of mind and this music?"
Grimes,"Well I think Vancouver was pretty formative for me, both in terms of the fact of being imbued in Asian culture and also nature. Also, the whole goth/industrial scene that was there when I was growing up kind of made me who I am, and caused me to identify as, ""I'm into music, I'm into alternative. That's me!"" Some stupid immature teenage shit, but at the end of the day, that's how I came to be."
Interviewer,You refer to Montréal in the past tense. Where do you intend to go after this tour?
Grimes,"Moving to Los Angeles, baby!"
Interviewer,"Going into your live setup, you've had Born Gold as sort of your backing band during this tour. Could you describe your current setup now in regards to that?"
Grimes,"On my end, the Juno-G, the two pedals... I make the backup vocals, obviously. My backup singers are my loop pedal, and my main pedal is for main shit. I also use an SP-404 sampler. I'm running my vocals through Cecil , who is doing more vocal processing. Calvin is playing electronic drums. Eric is extra keys plus noise plus I think some percussion. I let them jam because they're really good, so it's getting increasingly jammy."
Interviewer,So that's how you would describe working with them?
Grimes,"Definitely, like, super psychedelic and great. It's way better, I wish they were my permanent band, because they're fucking amazing. I start the set with me; I play two songs, then they come on, and it just makes everything so much bigger and better. People immediately start dancing when they come on stage because it's so much louder and  so much more percussion. They're good at that"
Interviewer,"And has that helped? If I recall these things correctly, you started out on your own."
Grimes,"I think it just makes me a lot more confident as a performer, because the audience isn't just focused on me. It's definitely a psychological thing. I'm going to be really depressed when I have to go back to not having a band."
Interviewer,Perhaps you should start one again.
Grimes,"Well, the kind of people I want to be in my band have priorities. The kind of people I want to contribute something cool to the live set are doing their own shit. I can't ask them to, and I don't want to just pay for session musicians, because I want someone who's going to do something weird."
Interviewer,"I wanted to talk a little bit about your artwork. Going over interviews and other things, you seem to emphasize using black-ink drawings in your art. What put you to that?"
Grimes,"I just have a real history with comics. I used to work at Drawn and Quarterly. My mom used to be a comic book publisher. So I'm just, deep in my heart, a super comic nerd. I'm also a Charles Burns fan. You can definitely see in my work he's a huge influence for me. But I'm also totally obsessed with Hieronymous Bosch at the same time. So my thing is bringing together super medieval panoramic shit through a Charles Burns-ish filter, and then making it really psychedelic, and super feminine and violent and scary. I forgot what we were talking about, sorry if I'm rambling."
Interviewer,Any particular comics you enjoy right now?
Grimes,"I'm actually opposed to comics right now. I have a very complex relationship with comics, but as of right now, I'm opposed to comics. But they still influence me a lot."
Interviewer,I wonder why....
Grimes,"It's because I've been drawing since I was little and that was just my style. I mean, I started drawing because I was trying to imitate anime, and then I got into Dan Clowes and guys like that."
Interviewer,"And how would you say that incorporates into your other work, say your music and production?"
Grimes,"I don't think it incorporates because it's all from the same brain I feel like there's a feeling that exists in all the work that I do, whether it's my art or my music or my video art."
Interviewer,"Going back to something you mentioned briefly intending towards a feminine ideal, is there something specific you go for, or is it just general?"
Grimes,"I guess I just feel like a lot of women who consider themselves experimental musicians don't want to embrace traditional ideas of femininity. I mean, I do think it's a construct in a lot of ways, but I don't think that makes it not beautiful. So there's a lot of things I do, like imitating Mariah Carey and Beyoncé and stuff like that. And I think they are really beautiful and strong examples of powerful, gorgeous, and hyper-feminine (if in a cookie-cutter sort of way) figures. But I like to take aspects of that aesthetic that are really great and funnel them through noise music and stuff like that. The idea of the pop star really does appeal to me, even though I want to do it in a different way."
Interviewer,"I just read the other day, you did a track for Cadence Weapon titled ""88."" How did that come about?"
Grimes,"He actually took the track ""Eight"" off Visions and cut it up and reproduced it. However, I would produce for him in a second. I made some remixes for him that he hasn't put out and I don't know why."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I heard he's trying to do a once a week thing like the Flaming Lips."
Grimes,"Well, he hasn't put out anything in three years because his label is super aggressively not letting him do shit. He has so much music, like gigs of unreleased music, and he should start putting it out. I think he's just sick of being trapped by his label."
