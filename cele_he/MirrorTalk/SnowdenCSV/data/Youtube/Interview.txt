i recently spoke with edward snowden a

military contractor who

revealed government secrets and now

lives in exile

did snowden do the right thing after

researching this i now think he did

you decide here's our full interview

you went to work for the government you

signed

agreements saying you wouldn't talk

about what you did

why go to the media we talk about

awards for progress and civil liberties

we talk about the importance of

independent thought

um and the history of it and this is

really what it is you know i

i did sign up to work for the government

um i volunteered for the army i

i applied to the cia i worked as a

contractor

uh in nsa facilities on nsa computers

again and again and again people think

contractors like you're working in a

different building but no you're in

it's just a con continuation of

government service and also you joined

the military after 9 11 because

you wanted to fight i did when everyone

else was protesting

i was a younger man and i was uh

much less politically educated i'd like

to think than i am

uh today you know some things only come

with experience

but so yeah it raises this question of

how does

you know how does

[Music]

someone like who i was become someone

like who i am

um and i got to tell you it was hard

it wasn't easy wasn't natural it wasn't

something i ever expected to do

but like i said i signed up to all of

these things i volunteered

because i believed in a

prevailing national mythos

to which we are all subscribed

when we're born into our country when we

go to a school system where we're

basically the only one in the world

where you get up in the morning and you

pledge allegiance to a flag

we all have the same stories um we all

watch

the same uh channels you know we see

men like you on on tv uh kind of telling

us

what's happening in the world what it's

like and

what changed me um was a realization

that as someone who held a top-secret

clearance and and

had access far beyond uh what a

top-secret clearance would entitle

someone to generally

the private

truths of what was actually happening in

our government

what our government actually does uh

what our nation

was involved in without the knowledge or

consent of the people that it purports

to represent

was very different than the public

representation of it

and that really just that seed alone

was the start of a journey that would

take me many years

to ultimately realize and the decision

as you said

to come forward and

the ultimate reason why i came forward

was

simply to bridge that gap in my own

experience and share that with everyone

else

to share the realization that i came to

that what we were being told

is true and real and is the state of our

world

was in fact a witting and continuing lie

uh by some of the highest

representatives in our government

and i felt that people needed to know

that what was the lie i think the most

famous one

um for me and really uh

you know the turning point um

would be when you look at uh the

exchange between

um senator ron wyden and then director

of national intelligence

james clapper this is a

sworn testimony in front of the senate

intelligence committee

and for those who don't remember it

because it was some time ago it looked a

little bit like this

so what i wanted to see is if you could

give me a yes or no answer to the

question

does the nsa collect any type of data at

all on millions or hundreds of millions

of americans

no sir it does not

not wittingly there are cases where they

could inadvertently

perhaps uh collect but not not willingly

uh now the importance of this is to to

think about what that represented

um this of course was was false the nsa

was collecting

uh the phone records of every verizon

customer

on a daily basis um they were doing this

for other major telecommunications

providers as well

i just didn't have the judicial order

for that

and this was happening to the internet

this was happening to email

communications what was happening

was uh a change in technology from

the old internet that was uh sort of

non-commercial very individual and

simple uh it was pretty crude everything

was cobbled together

to this larger more corporatized

internet where all of our communications

all of our interactions all of our

relationships

all the things that we read and like

online

um are being passed to us through

a facebook or a google or an apple

and in secret these um these

companies had basically gone far beyond

what the law

required of government to join

programs where they would share

information with the nsa

through the front door of the fbi and it

was continuing for years

without the kind of individual warrants

and

legal process that we expected and we

had become accustomed to we're told in

the constitution

this is how our government works and so

for me when you ask

what was the the lie the lie was not any

one particular part of these programs it

wasn't a particular detail

it was the fact that there was a

breathtaking

sweep of intentional knowing public

deception

by people at the level of the senate by

people in these

different executive agencies um

intelligence agencies and then in the

white house itself

even from the president then president

barack obama

who campaigned on ending warrantless

wiretapping that he had criticized so

heavily

in the bush administration but had in

fact

in secret uh extended and embraced

uh these programs and these authorities

to a level that i began to feel had

uh truly narrowed the boundaries of our

rights

does the nsa routinely intercept

american citizens emails

no does the nsa intercept

americans cell phone conversations

no google searches now

text messages no amazon.com

orders no bank records

no we're not authorized to do it nor do

we do it

you're at the nsa and you're dealing

with these secrets

before you even saw the head of the

national security agency on tv

and what did you think about them then

well so this was the

the thing when you look at the arc of my

career in intelligence

i was always working on the technical

aspect

of it and so by and large i was uh

modernizing our systems because post 911

the intelligence community realized they

weren't very good

uh at using technology they thought they

were

um and in a way it was true that they

were but it was a different

eras technology they were great with

radio they were great with satellite

they weren't so good with computers they

weren't so good with the internet so

they brought in a bunch of shaggy young

guys who looked like me

and they really liked what you did and

you were a star absolutely but it wasn't

that i was you know exceptional

um so much that i represented a

generation

that was native to these new systems

uh that they had shied away from because

they didn't trust the security of them

it turned out with good reason

but my generation came in we shared our

experiences we

shared our specialties and we were

always looking at what we were doing

through a straw

and you have to understand this

principle that we hear of in the movies

you know need to know

means normally you get a project you do

a project you don't know where it goes

you don't know who else is using it

but bit by bit i was redirecting and

collecting the flow of intelligence then

always backing it up

permanizing it making it so that if we

lost a building if we lost a site

we didn't lose everything that had

passed through that the information that

had been passed through that my thought

this was information about terrorists i

thought

this was saving lives i thought this was

preventing wars

but as i moved higher and higher in the

organization as i moved from

cia to nsa as i moved from office to

office

my straw that i'm looking through gets

wider and wider and wider until i land

in this

place called the office of information

sharing

it turned out i would be much better at

this job than anyone expected

um and i saw everything and it's

only there when you see the consequences

of your uh labor and the different

parts of your career all brought

together uh

with the labor of others of your entire

generation who themselves

not sitting in the position you are

can't see the big picture impact of what

they're doing

and the public who never even knew this

stuff

existed uh and again this was occurring

without their consent

but in theory it was being carried out

in their name

it felt to me that we needed to know we

needed to actually decide is this what

we want to happen

or not and you talk to your supervisors

yeah i talked to my supervisors i talked

to my colleagues on constitution day

they were all fine with it this is just

what we do and

no problem actually actually it's not

quite

uh that uh people had no problems when i

brought up

uh these programs that many of them had

never heard of because

they hadn't been exposed to them um i

said does this look right to you

when i show that we're collecting more

internet communications

in the united states at the nsa than we

were

in russia right meaning we are ingesting

more

americans communication than we are

ingesting

chinese people's communications or

russians communications or

north koreans communications or whoever

you're afraid of right

the bulk of our collection uh was

happening

domestically and happening with the aid

of

other partners in what's called the five

eyes network the united states the

united kingdom

australia new zealand and canada

and then the nsa would go well yes we're

collecting all of these communications

but

we're not reading them all we're

capturing

everything that you john stossel are

doing online we're capturing everything

that your family's doing online that

your friends are doing online but we

just pinky promise

it's not being used for anything bad and

then

you know at being an engineer i see how

these things actually are being touched

they are being processed they are being

sorted through

every single day algorithmically

uh it sort of

proves the lie right uh that all of

these promises they don't really amount

too much all of these

processes and regulations and procedures

don't amount too much and in reality

what the nsa is doing every single day

this ordinary course of business is

violating not

only the laws as written but likely the

constitution

and i tell this to the guy sitting to my

right a good friend of mine

said tell this the guy sitting on my

left good friend of mine

to my office manager right um and all of

them

actually in private right when you're

not in email

uh when they're just speaking

heart-to-heart about this

they go no you know this this is crazy

um i'm not sure why we're doing this i'm

not sure how we're doing this i'm not

sure this is legal

but you know what happens

to people who talk about this right i

wouldn't put this in writing i wouldn't

go

you know to this office or that office

they're not going to do anything about

it it's not your job it's not my job

this is way above our

pay level basically but what happens

to us as an organization at the nsa what

happens to

us as americans uh what happens to us as

a society

if everybody sees something wrong

and goes well if i say something about

i'm going to get into trouble

what happens if everybody goes i'm not

going to do anything about this because

it's not my job

that's how things go wrong

in a much more serious way and the

reality was i was just like them

for a long time i had had a growing

sense of unease uh but in reality it was

not my job to fix it

and this was actually one of the

criticisms that was eventually leveled

against me as they go

you know who elected you um but

it's not about you know who you are um

it's about what you've witnessed it's

about what you can prove

and does that matter and i think the

the last seven years when we've seen the

courts review these programs and

confirm that they were in fact unlawful

we've seen laws

changed even by the legislature that was

implicated in the wrongdoing in the

first place

but at some point you decided i'm not

going to keep my mouth shut

yeah i mean it's it's exactly because

this um

if i keep my mouth shut the guy to my

right the guy

to my left we you know we all think this

is wrong and we all keep our mouths shut

um what does tomorrow look like

and the year after that and the year

after that uh the reality with

um these kind of extraordinary powers in

government

particularly we all understand this now

in the post-9 11 moment

because it's not just surveillance it's

happened in war it's happened in

international diplomacy it's happened

in economy with the financial crisis i

haven't bailed out the banks

but we don't bail out ordinary people um

when the government writ large

identifies a moment of crisis uh

they use that crisis for uh

an exceptional demand for exceptional

powers to which they normally wouldn't

be entitled

this was the rise of the patriot act

right this was how

uh the bush administration got involved

in more or less fire tapping this is how

we got

uh extrajudicial killings through drone

strikes

off the ground um this is how we got

involved in torture

but it's always uh justified as an

again an exception to ordinary

operations

something that's done for a narrow

purpose in a narrow way

but then nobody objects to it

these all happen in secret remember they

keep

the body of witnesses small by design

to limit the amount of dissent that

concur internally organizationally

and those who do complain are generally

shuffled off the program they're put in

a closet somewhere

and they ride out their days to

retirement if they're lucky

never doing anything that that matters

again uh but also not having access to

anything that could cause

problems for those who are violating

people's rights

or our laws um

but this as you said why speak up

if you sit by and

see a system engaged in wrongdoing

and you do nothing even if you don't

participate in it any longer

even if you resign you are perpetuating

a system

of wrongdoing you have become not just

part of the wrongdoing but but party to

it um and for me uh when we looked at

this this was affecting

the country that i loved this was

affecting the internet that i grew up

with

which was practically part of my family

by this point in my life

and then you extrapolate uh

from how we got involved in sort of this

overreaching surveillance state to begin

with the national security state

and step by step bit by bit exception

after

exception uh these extraordinary and

narrow authorities become permanent

and perpetual authorities uh and bit by

bit as the

uh domain of government expands uh

the territory that is claimed to

the people narrows

and this became such a concern to me

that i was willing to risk a great deal

to tell people about it and see if they

agreed or if i was just crazy my

preference

and i think the american people's

preference would have been

for a lawful orderly examination of

these laws

a thoughtful

fact-based debate that would then lead

us to

a better place there were other avenues

available for somebody whose conscience

was stirred and thought that

they needed to question government

actions so why

go to certain members of the media

president obama later said there were

other avenues available for someone

whose

conscience was stirred specter generals

congress yeah no i mean this is a great

um

a great kind of question i mean we we

always look at these things

we don't want anybody in government

uh to be able to go out and you know

throw any secret about anything

uh out on the media uh willy-nilly and

this is one of the primary institutional

criticisms against me

on the other hand are there uh internal

channels as obama posited

for me no even under the most generous

reading of the law at the time what he

said was incorrect

and he said so at a time that by the way

he knew it was incorrect

even though it was politically useful

because this had been debated in

newspapers around the country by this

point

i was not an employee of the nsa

i was employed at a private company that

was contracted to do work for the nsa at

nsa buildings you know

on nsa equipment the only difference

between

myself and the actual nsa employee

sitting to my right in the office

was he had a blue badge i had a green

badge green was for contractor blue was

for staff

employee of government but the

whistleblower protection laws

did not apply to contractors this makes

sense if you think about it

in the context of the moment because how

can the government

protect someone from complaints uh when

it's not actually their employee right

how can the government prevent someone

from

being disciplined when they're a private

company for whatever purpose

uh and the reality is there was even if

i had gone through an internal purpose

or sorry internal process had i gone to

congress had i gone to the president

himself the

ultimate result would have been the same

i would have been stopped

at some level by an individual like the

nsa

inspector general who is supposed to be

kind of a watchdog that makes sure the

nsa's activities

are legally compliant or the office of

general counsel

i would have been terminated from my

position

i would have been investigated by the

police and i very likely would have been

charged under exactly the same loans

that i've been charged under today we

know this not

because i'm speculating and throwing

this out of air but because it had

happened before

in the case of a former nsa executive at

a much higher level than myself

by the name of thomas drake who did go

through proper channels and whose story

i was very familiar with

because i was determining should i do

this is it right will it work will it be

effective

william benny who was charged with

thomas drake at the same time were

investigated at the same time as

thomas straight for the same disclosure

he had men with guns drawn

coming to his house at dawn yes exactly

you had the fbi burst into your house

they take all your computers

they arrest you you know they

interrogate you you lose your clearance

you lose your job

first i went to the house intelligence

committee and the staff member that i

personally knew there

and she then went to the chairman of

that committee we were all trying to

work internally in the government

over these years trying to get them to

come around to being constitutionally

acceptable

and take it into the courts and have the

court's oversight of it too

we naively kept thinking that that could

uh

that could happen and it never did

they decided to raid us to keep us quiet

threaten us you know

in my case they came in with guns drawn

i don't know why they did that but they

did

thomas drake who was an executive at the

top of the u.s intelligence community

now works at an apple store right

but it's important to understand that he

did go through proper channels he did

everything right

and when he went to these officials this

is what they said this is the office of

general counsel

uh at the nsa a man by the name of vito

potenza

if he came to me someone who was not

read into the program

and told me that we were

running a muck essentially inviting the

constitution

there's no doubt in my mind i would have

told him you know

go talk to your management don't bother

me with this i mean

you know you you did the the minute he

said if if he did say

you're using this to violate the

constitution

i i mean i probably would have stopped

the conversation at that point

quite frankly so i mean if that's what

he said he said

then anything after that i probably

wasn't listening to anyway

and this is the reality and i think

everybody understands this naturally

these internal watchdog shops in

government they're great

if you need to report sexual harassment

they're great if you need to

uh report some kind of discrimination if

somebody's stealing office supplies

if you go the entire agency of

government

is engaged in a conspiracy to deceive

the public about the reality that we are

right now

working in concert across agencies uh

to uh carry out a program that is in

violation not only of law but the

constitution

they're not equipped to handle that and

they're not interested investigating

that

that's not why they were appointed i

gotta say in my endless

hundred-year career no one has ever

rolled in video before that's usually

what i need to do

if you ever get back right i'm a

technologist sorry i can't help it

that's good all right why do you think

you were charged under the espionage act

that's pretty rare to send a chilling

message

to whom to other whistleblowers to

others in the government

not to speak out or speak out do not

tell truth to power

we'll hammer you drake on 60 minutes

where he said

it the purpose was to send a chilling

message

do not tell truth to power we will

hammer you

i think that that's absolutely correct

when you look at the

lived experience of whistleblowers and

again

these are separated by decades of uh

you know different white houses

different presidents different

administrations different congresses

different policies

the response is always the same if

someone inside of government

reveals government wrongdoing uh

at the level uh that threatens the

reputations and certainly the

electability

of whether we're talking about agency

heads whether we're talking about

politicians whether in the legislature

or the executive

branches their

first priority is to stop you from

talking

because they want to control the

narrative and this is really what this

is about when you look at all of this

mass surveillance

um whether we're talking about internet

surveillance whether we're talking about

uh telephonic surveillance um whether

we're talking about domestic

surveillance whether we're talking about

international surveillance

um you've been in the news a long time

you've seen these officials you've

interviewed these officials

uh they constantly tell us uh this is

for your safety this is to investigate

terrorists right and i kind of believe

it right and we

all believe it to some extent

particularly when we shared the national

trauma of 9 11.

um but when you look uh from the inside

as an employee of what we're doing with

this

i see all the reporting right i've got

access to all reporting

and then you look at things that happen

in the wake of scandal for example after

i came forward obama who was facing

extraordinary pressure

appointed two independent commissions to

investigate these programs

because he was trying to um

basically justify these things and find

where they were actually or where they

were useful

this was the privacy and civil liberties

oversight board

and the president's review group on

intelligence and communications

technologies

both of these groups had full access to

classified information

both of them talked to all sides of the

intelligence community they went to the

fbi they went to the cia they went to

the nsa

and they said look we've got the

clearances give us your success stories

show us where this helped show us where

this saved lives show us why we should

be doing this

and they looked because at the time you

know uh we had people

we had keith alexander then director of

the national security agency going in

front of congress going on tv

and saying you know this stopped 47

plots or whatever

you know people are live buildings are

up because these programs

well barack obama's own investigations

into this uh found that in the case of

the very first

uh program that we looked at uh this was

the mass surveillance of

telephone records direct domestically um

it didn't stop

a single terrorist attack in more than

10 years of operation and that's

happening in secret mind you

uh before it's the front pages and all

that stuff

and in the only case they also found

sorry that it never made a

concrete difference and that's their

words in a single counterterrorism

investigation

there were plots that were found but the

court

found that they had other they already

had the information they didn't need

all this spying we've heard over and

over again the assertion that 54

terrorist plots were thwarted

that's plainly wrong these weren't all

plots and they weren't all thwarted

the american people were getting left

with

inaccurate impression of the

effectiveness of nsa

programs they actually never discovered

a plot

through these programs never not once uh

what they did do is they found

information related to a plot um in a

single case and this was a cab

driver uh in california uh mo allen i

believe um

wiring about 8 500

to his clan in somalia which was

affiliated with al-shabab which was

on a terrorism list by according the

state department

this was their great success story right

and in this case

uh judges said uh or sorry we had

already had watchdogs go through it

thanks fortunately to obama in this case

um and now we have since had

courts go at it and look at confirm it

was unlawful

and it was unnecessary and mind you this

is with access to the classified record

because they said

by the time the government had enough

information to look these guys up

in the nsa database you know cia fbi

whatever

they also had enough evidence to go to a

court through

traditional means and get a warrant

without relying on all this right you

didn't have to collect this

by violating the rights of you know 330

million americans

when you simply could have used the old

traditional means of law enforcement to

get exactly the same material

from exactly the same companies without

breaking the law

it's dozens of

terrorist events that these have helped

prevent the tip of the iceberg in terms

of numbers of terrorist attacks that nsa

programs contributed to stopping was

54. keith alexander says these programs

helped prevent

dozens of terrorist events the deputy

director the reason there hasn't been a

major attack in the united states since

9 11

is not an accident the number of

terrorist attacks

the nsa programs contributed to stopping

is

54. that makes me feel

safer when i hear that right and but we

want to believe it's true but it's not

this 54 number has been um

looked at uh intensively

by advocates and apologists for the

national security state

by critics of it and since then it's

boiled down again to i believe

one case uh and this one case

in this is not uh somalian wiring

8 500 um i believe it's some you know

guy with mental illness who was

thinking about bombing a subway in new

york

but it's the same context the same thing

they didn't need this authority it

wasn't necessary

because look uh let's say you don't john

stossel

uh work at the nsa you do the job i did

in my last position you go in every day

uh you've got the desk in front of you

with your keyboard uh connected to a

system called

x key score this is uh basically google

for spies

right it allows you to search through

all of the different uh methods of

ingestion

that we have not just domestically but

overseas

through our partners in what we call

second party countries these are these

anglophone countries and five eyes i

mentioned earlier

as well as third-party partners we have

sensors

you know all over the world some of them

placed by hacking some of them placed in

data centers

and you can type anybody's phone number

in anybody's email and website in any ip

address for a phone or a

computer a laptop and you can see all

the traffic

that has passed any of these sensors you

can

write to your fbi analyst buddy and have

them pull anybody in the world's uh

basically a whole facebook list uh

everything they've ever clicked on

anything that the facebook pixel tracker

was on the website for when they were

reading things

uh their amazon order history you know

everything they've typed in that google

search box ever

you have access to everything right

and you want to stop a terrorist plot

how do you know who to look up and this

is why these programs don't actually

stop terrorism

you have to have a seed you have to have

something to start your searches from

you have to have a cause for suspicion

traditionally under the fourth amendment

we require probable cause for these kind

of investigations to begin

police officers get a tip from someone

they notice something when they're

working to beat they know their

communities

they see someone acting strange they get

a complaint

and they investigate on this basis right

well in intelligence the way these tips

come across

is generally from the same thing it's

from a confidential informant

it's from law enforcement it's from

whatever

but once you have this once you have

probable cause to begin investigating

someone

you can go to a court you can get a

warrant you can access the same

information

without collecting it from the entire

internet before right

and so this is the thing um when you

look at the fact that

the government itself no longer makes

these claims that it's stopped 54 plots

right they have disowned that

keith alexander no longer works for the

nsa he's

out now he works on the board of

directors at amazon.com

the the thing is what are these things

effective

for right because you go well why does

the government pay for these programs

why

go to all this trouble if it doesn't

stop attacks yeah

why

[Laughter]

and the the answer of course is because

these programs

are tremendously useful for something

different

and that is information gathering right

intelligence

general investigation about anything on

anyone

it may not be effective in preventing

terrorist attacks

because again it's not uh particularly

more useful relative to the tools that

we already have

because again terrorism is rare it is

scarce and people

don't realize this based on the way the

media has changed

but the incidence of terrorism over time

is actually declining relative to the

last century if you look at for example

terrorist attacks

in western europe uh they have declined

decade over a decade

uh since like the 1960s people forget

about it but things like maybe

because of intelligence in the nsa

well again i worked for these agencies

and i would like to believe that was

true

but the rate at which they were falling

is completely different from the rate of

mass surveillance and this is what

people misunderstand about

my politics and my positioning

i am not against the use of intelligence

i'm not against the

existence of intelligence agencies i'm

not against surveillance

i am against mass surveillance and this

is what i brought information forward

about just to play devil's advocate here

why should i care i i figure google and

facebook knows

everything about everybody anyway i

figure that

teenage boy across the street could be

picking up

the stuff i sent it the the corks out of

the bottle

what difference does it make this goes

back to kind of that that nothing to

hide

argument which is like um i lead a very

ordinary life

uh i watch my shows i go to work

i take care of my family uh yeah i'm

weird yeah i look at porn

you know if you were talking about the

average person on the internet everybody

looks important right it's happened

um even if you don't want to there's a

pop-up ad somewhere it's in your history

but the reality is most people do and

they want to and

that's not strange

people particularly americans feel an

enormous sense of shame about this but

it's a tremendously common activity

at the same time it makes us feel

uncomfortable

you know for a lot of us as if our

family knew everything that we looked up

on the internet we would worry about how

they would look at us

um if you know every company in the

world

knew everything that you looked at we

would feel uncomfortable with it

but then what happens when your

workplace knows

uh what happens when your government

knows

and who decides what is normal what's

acceptable

and what's not right we can do things

that are very common today

or we can have positions uh or interests

that are very

uncommon today but harmless in a free

society we are allowed to be different

we are allowed to be weird we can be

strange

as long as we're not hurting anyone else

but laws change social wars change the

norms

shift and once we are entered into this

system

where everything we've ever done

everything we were ever interested in

everything we've ever bought

everywhere we've ever gone everywhere

that we have or anyone that we have ever

talked to

is instantly captured the moment it

happens and memorialized in some

database somewhere just waiting to be

used

it will be used and we already see this

happening

in places like china right we don't want

to emulate china

where we have a social credit system

where things that you do which are

harmless which aren't hurting anyone

but institutions or railways or airlines

or the communist party that sweeps into

power is already in power

decides is disfavored and should be

penalized should be disincentivized

now you can no longer get a job now you

have to wait

uh you know and go to the local police

station to get a pass to be able to

travel

and visit your family we cannot

anticipate these things and the problem

is

that i have with this idea of argument

is that we should have to that we should

have to prepare for that we should

think and constrain our intellectual

curiosity

and even frankly our weirdnesses our

distinctions our differences our

weirdness the things

that place us in the minority because

we could potentially someday be judged

on the basis for it even if we had done

nothing wrong even if it wasn't strange

because the definition of what is wrong

is constantly

changing if google's got it and facebook

has it

why is it so much worse

that our government has it this is this

is a great question there's two ways

uh that this is typically um responded

to

uh one and this is one that i used

myself um many years before

is that well the difference is uh google

can sell you a different pair of shoes

on the basis of what it knows about you

right the ads the place is on the side

of your bar

but they can't put you in jail they

can't bomb you

right the government can and for a lot

of people

the government does the second thing

which i think is actually more

interesting

um it requires a little bit more

technical understanding of how these

programs are implemented but not so much

that i think it loses even a general

audience

google knows an incredible amount about

an incredible number of people

but it is still finite there are things

that they do not know uh google does not

necessarily know what you bought on

amazon

google does not necessarily know what

you liked on facebook

uh google google does not necessarily

know what you posted on instagram

facebook knows what you posted on

instagram because they own that right

amazon knows what you bought on this but

they don't know what you sent in your

email it's on uh

google because it's a gmail account

right there are

silos in industry that even if they're

very large

still limit what these different

companies know the maximum domain

of their understanding of you as an

individual and

us broadly as a population

government however through its course of

authorities

in these kind of systems is able to look

into each of these different silos and

then

collate them together they see

everything that facebook sees

as well as everything that google sees

as well

as everything that amazon sees as well

as everything that your phone provider

sees as well as everything that your

airline provider has in terms of your

travel history

uh you know and so on and so forth to an

extraordinary extent

there are no um limitations placed on

this

beyond the uh their

appetite and willingness to pursue uh

these silos and find a way into them

now i am a little embarrassed and that

i'm a

consumer reporter and i report on

markets i i haven't

done much on spying or military secrets

and i hadn't paid much attention to you

i got you confused before researching

for this interview with manning and

julian assange

snowden which who did what and but now

that i've done the research

i conclude that you really got

screwed and yet you

talk about this very dispassionately and

thoughtfully

aren't you pissed off i mean james

clapper

lied to congress and to the peop

american people

and he wasn't fired he served out his

term in the obama administration and now

he works for cnn

and keith alexander uh

i think that's kind of a condemnation of

the direction our media has

has gone in um but i understand your

point absolutely keith alexander now

now runs a private security

firm appropriately and is on amazon's

board

they made out you're in exile

yeah i mean you don't do the kind of

things that i did

um if you're a pessimist uh

you do them because you're an idealist

you believe that things can get better

you believe that we can do better

um when i came forward it was in

recognition of the fact that there is a

two-tiered system to the way

american society is ordered today there

are

those in power uh who operate largely

behind a

veil of secrecy um and even this applies

even to people who aren't working for

the nsa right this happens to

congressmen

um it's very difficult to find out who

they're meeting with it's very difficult

to figure out you know what lobbyists

are having conversations with who and

you know what laws are being shaped and

what

uh text is being written that is passed

into law

that uh impacts all of our lives but was

corporately sponsored right and these

people are getting donations to their

campaign

or famously the justice system

uh if you're uh

a young person from a minority community

with limited access to

wealth and especially education

you're going to be treated very harshly

by our court system

but if you're one of these made men you

know working on a high level

you will face a very different flavor of

justice shall we say

none in the case of those two guys who

lied precisely

precisely uh or or no justice at all but

that will never change um

unless we make it change right power

admits nothing without a demand

government is not going to reform itself

and the only way that things get better

anywhere is through sacrifice

we've known this since we crawled out of

the swamp of history

if you want to stay warm uh somebody is

going to have to go through the trouble

of building a house it's not going to be

fun they're not going to love it but

they're going to be doing it because it

makes life better

somebody out there is going to have to

do the hard work of growing the food

that we all

you know survive on and they don't get a

lot of thanks for that but

society is a team's board our

society as exists today is flawed

i recognize that right um

i am doing what i can to make it better

as i can

i don't have any illusions that i'm

going to fix it

uh i'm not going to save the world

that's not how this works

and i think this is why i can be very

much at peace

with the choices that i've made and the

uh

unfortunately the price that i've paid

as a result of that

because it was the right thing to do and

it has made things better

even if it hasn't fixed the problem

people now

can understand these things we can begin

to argue

for better policies and in fact they're

already happening our courts

which for literally decades

excused themselves at all um

from uh weighing in on the legality and

constitutionality of

surveillance in the context of national

security

i have since 2013 when i came forward

ruled repeatedly on these programs and

repeatedly ruled

against the government uh that he they

had backstopped these things fully for

again for a very very long time the

nsa's gated repeated substantial

legal violations the ficer court called

a systemic

non-compliance by the government but the

programs go on

some of these programs have been halted

uh section 215 of the

patriot act is no more this was

ended by an act of congress and also at

the urging

of for no less than barack obama who at

the very beginning of 2014

interesting in terms of timing after the

very first court

to rule against these programs said it

was likely unlawful and unconstitutional

came out in his state of the union

speech and said although he could never

condone what i did

uh he felt that this conversation

about surveillance legalities its limits

had made us

stronger as a nation and he uh urged

congress to pass what was then called

the usa freedom act

to basically put new legal restraints on

this but as you say

uh that didn't end the problem of mass

surveillance that just pushed the tube

of toothpaste right now the toothpaste

is in slightly different part

of the same tube however

mass surveillance occurs largely through

certain

technical uh principles certain

vulnerabilities

mechanically in the way our

communications

move from your phone or the laptop on

your desk

across the internet to whoever it is

you're trying to communicate with right

whether we're talking about a website

uh whether we're talking about um

someone that you're talking to

on the phone uh now fewer and fewer

people

use plain voice fewer fewer people use

plain sms

now they're using encrypted messengers

like the signal messenger or

whatsapp which i would not trust myself

for a long period of time

because it was bought by facebook but

whatsapp was the world's most popular

messenger it had

one billion users in post 2013

they adopted a new technical protection

called

end-to-end encryption which

is intentionally designed to limit

precisely the kind of mass surveillance

that was being discussed in 2013 so now

at the flip of a switch one billion

people

get a greater level of privacy that is

not reliant on jurisdiction

it's not reliant on law it's not reliant

on politics and the encryption works

encryption does work uh one of the

lessons as a result of 2013

all these disclosures about how the nsa

works how the surveillance works

um is

uh you can be sneaky in a lot of ways

uh as the nsa as the cia when you're

trying to steal a secret

but encryption is basically

just math and there is no

currently with the best knowledge that

we have of mathematics

any sneaky way to just make encryption

go away entirely

from uh a point of interception right so

as

again your phone tries to reach this

other person

wherever they are in the world it has to

go

through the network of many other people

through the starbucks that you're

sitting at

through their internet service provider

through a data center through a

transatlantic cable that goes to for

example france

their data center their local internet

service provider their starbucks that

they're sitting in

any one of these points anybody

sitting on that line can snatch a copy

of the conversation

and if it wasn't encrypted they can read

it whether it's a criminal hacker

next to you uh at the cafe or whether it

is a national government

be that the american government or the

french government or anybody in between

right but the thing is

um the only way really to get around

strong encryption that is properly

implemented

is uh precisely what the purpose of the

2013 stories was

to achieve which is to make governments

shift from

mass indiscriminate collection of

communications

to specific individualized targeted

collection this means hacking right so

imagine for a second you send this

encrypted communication to the person

that you're talking to

people in the middle tons of them they

all catch it they all collect it

but none of them can read it because an

encrypted message cannot

be unlocked without a mathematical key

it's just the answer to the math problem

that you make up that you share with the

other person on the other side you guys

know the answer but nobody else in the

world can come up with it right

now um mass surveillance

no longer works game over finish doesn't

work quite that way

there's some more technical ways we can

talk about metadata later if you're

interested but

it's more in depth but the bottom line

is

how then if you're the cia and for

example

this is not someone harmless in a

starbucks this is an

actual terrorist or spy or a

dissident in a place like bahrain or

oman or hong kong

which unfortunately is all too real and

happens every day how do they read this

message

and the answer is they steal a copy of

the key

instead of catching it as it goes across

the line which they can no longer do

they can't do this for everybody on mass

around the world

they have to target the two places in

the world

that that message is readable where it's

unencrypted

and that's on your device and the device

of the person that you're talking with

now

instead of dealing with encryption

instead of dealing with that global

network that

easy cheap mass surveillance they do the

hard work

the traditional targeted investigative

work of

hacking that phone or selling that

person an implanted phone that's got spy

devices built into it basically

and then when that person is encrypting

messages or when they're receiving

messages and decrypting them

because they have taken over the phone

the encryption no longer matters to them

because they can see it with

unencrypted they can steal that

encryption key that answer to the math

problem

when it exists on the phone before it's

forgotten before it disappears

so long and short because i know that

was probably uh

complicated for a lot of people uh

encryption

end to end encryption which is to say

properly implement encryption that

doesn't have a man in the middle doesn't

have

some facebook some google who's keeping

their own copy of the key but

encryption where the keys are only held

by the

communicants by the people who are

supposed to know this information

that defeats mass surveillance in the

generic general sense that we understood

in 2013

it does not prevent all surveillance it

does not prevent

particularly legitimate targeted

surveillance but it returns

the intelligence and law enforcement

world to the more traditional means of

investigative

investigation which have fewer

implications for our rights

writ large as a society let's talk

a little more about your personal story

you decide that you've got to do this

you asked

27 countries for asylum people are

uh shall we say less familiar

particularly now with seven years of

distance between it what exactly

happened in 2013

uh so i left the united states and met

with journalists in a hotel room in hong

kong

hong kong was selected because it was a

kind of no man's land that had very good

media access it had a largely unfiltered

internet neither of which is true

today unfortunately but it was very easy

for journalists to operate it was very

easy for

me to access as a us intelligence

employee

without popping up on any radars or

anything like that

and i would meet with them there and

china also would not necessarily be free

to operate against

us particularly the way they can today

because of rivalries and friction and

bureaucratic infighting between the

local hong kong services and the

beijing government so this was really an

ideal kind of no man's land which to

operate

i provided them with documents and

explained the significance of them

and i didn't publish any documents this

is important for people to understand i

didn't put anything online

i instead told the journalists to look

through this

explained it and if they felt uh as i

did that this was in the public interest

to know

they would need to make an independent

editorial judgment

that this was the case go to the

government in advance of publication

uh give the government a chance to argue

against this say that snowden guy's

crazy or he doesn't understand this or

this document's incorrect

or if you publish this people will get

hurt

basically give the government the best

chance to argue against this

which the government took in almost all

cases that i'm aware of

and they talked to the white house and

talked about the white house

exactly what happened was as i mentioned

before i had had

uh a decade's worth of history uh and

actually more than a decade's worth of

history

uh of cases to look over i looked at

daniel ellsberg in the case of the

pentagon papers in the 1970s

in the injunction against the newspapers

working with him

how that was resolved by the courts what

that meant i looked at the case of

thomas drake

how even though he went through the

right channels uh he ended up at the

same

place where his story unfortunately

didn't get out he faced enormous

consequences policy

and the public were unable to grapple

with this very important issue because

of the government suppression of it

and then i looked at the case of

wikileaks and chelsea manning with the

iraq and afghanistan

war longs and one of the interesting

things against this was manning

of course was rested and they said you

know manning had uh

blood on her hands uh cost the lives of

all these soldiers and

you know publishing this material which

was only secret not

top secret uh was going to cause

basically that the atmosphere to catch

fire and the oceans to boil off

and none of this happened and in fact at

manning's sentencing

the judge specifically asked the

government uh do you want to argue

that people were harmed as a result of

this uh do you want to say

you know someone was hurt someone died

anything like this

because we'll take it into our sentence

in consideration give a harsher sentence

and the government said actually no we

can't show that it doesn't exist

and this is what we saw actually in the

case of ellsberg it's a constant

uh refrain where the government goes uh

whenever they're put in the hot seat

they don't want to talk about the

concrete harms of their policy

they don't want to talk about how they

violated rights they don't want to talk

about how they broke the law

instead they want to shift the

conversation to the whistleblower

to the source of the disclosure say

they're weird say they're disloyal say

they have problems say they shouldn't

have done this for whatever reason

say that you're going to get spies

killed or you're going to reveal troop

movements

precisely what they want to do is talk

about

the theoretical risks of journalism

in an open society instead of the

concrete demonstrated harms as

documented by the government's own

malpractice and so this was something

that i anticipated this was why this

uh sort of process was designed i used

three different journalists

three different outlets um they could

all go

to the government the government would

get a chance to do this so we could

demonstrate

we had gone in theoretically the most

responsible way

we had done everything the government

thought was proper and appropriate

as compared to prior cases and see if it

made a difference and the interesting

thing is

even though this was uh sort of

tremendously indulgent of the

government's interests

it didn't make a single change in their

messaging uh they used the same rhetoric

against me

as they did with men as they did with

drake as they did

um with ellsberg but

from here uh i left uh

hong kong on route to latin america

and i tell this story in my book

permanent record how it happened

but as i was leaving hong kong the

government we're not sure

there's no true way to know whether this

was an intentional strategic decision or

whether they panicked and it was just a

mistake

but once they learned the government had

learned that i had

departed hong kong they cancelled my

passport

which meant i couldn't leave russia and

i spent the next you know uh

30 days and 30 nights basically um

trapped in this russian airport

chirometer uh trying to get asylum from

as you said these 27 different countries

things that americans wouldn't be

particularly concerned with you know

germany

france and every time one of these

companies

accompanies one of these countries uh

would appear

uh to be leaning towards granting asylum

saying okay come here

uh they would get a phone call from one

of two people

uh then secretary of state um john

kerry or soon to be possibly

excuse me uh then vice president joe

biden

and this is uh this is the interesting

thing

why would the us government work so

hard to keep me trapped in russia

rather than allow me to go to a

jurisdiction where they would be much

freer to operate

and much more comfortable realistically

like france or germany or iceland or

something like that

uh if they had even the slightest

doubt about my loyalty

and this is something a question that

even to this day i had difficulty

answering

i would assume they just didn't want you

to go anywhere

and you happened to be in moscow

you didn't think it's true right imagine

you're the director of the nsa

or you're the cia and you've got this

guy out there he's the person that you

hate the most in the world and you know

all your authorities you know all your

incredible powers you know even the

things that i didn't know with all of my

access right

all the ways you can get people and they

go

you know we really don't like this guy

we really want to do something about him

uh would you rather me be

in moscow or literally anywhere else

right and so to me it's very strange uh

that the government

worked quite hard to keep me exiled

specifically in russia

and i've always been a little bit um

particularly as years have gone by and

you can't

explain it away simply as a mistake of

policy back then they've had time to

rectify it

they realize that me being in russia

provides them with an evergreen

political attack that doesn't have to be

explained it doesn't have to be

justified simply the association with

russia

is enough for them to call into question

my character and some americans would

say

really he went to china and admittedly

it was

it was hong kong and different than and

russia these two countries and

there was no other way to get to latin

america except

through russia right certainly and this

i mean this

was uh subject of much debate and it was

again born out there was a lot of public

reporting on this

back in uh 2013 when it was contemporary

uh the reality is you can't fly from

hong kong or at least couldn't fly from

hong kong at the time

to latin america uh without crossing u.s

airspace unless you went the long way

around

right and so then you do this and you

have to go it's very short list

what are the non-extradition countries

to get from hong kong

all the way over to south america and

again it's just building a bridge

through the air step by step

and you know my whole flight manifest at

this point has been made public

there were journalists on the flight

that i was ticketed for

from moscow to havana uh taking pictures

of my empty seat

when i was prevented from boarding uh

and so yeah this has all been looked

into and

it's just to me it's frustrating but

it's also interesting because i wonder

you know if they did this intentionally

if they did this strategically

it was really the most brilliant move

they made in terms of communications

planning that they they could have

i'm not sure we can give them that much

credit because it very well could have

been

a moment of panic but it is i think

disappointing

that all these years later they still

haven't rectified it and it didn't work

out well for you

obama commuted chelsea manning's

sentence

she's now running for political office

uh politicians say you should be killed

well you know the funny thing is we see

that much less now than we did in 2013.

uh the reality is there's uh

there's sort of a pardon movement going

on on my behalf i have not asked for

pardon

uh from this president or the prior

president

um but many others have on my behalf and

i'm tremendously grateful for that and

the advocacy

that people brought forward um

but excuse me uh

the thing is as each year passes and all

of those claims as you said you know

they were like oh he got people killed

there were ages you know there were

programs or whatever all this stuff fell

apart it didn't work

attacks are gonna get through none of it

came to pass and this was exactly the

story in the manning case you know uh

obama could not have commuted manning's

sentence

politically realistically um

in this 2013 era in this 2014 era

but years after right when manning's

actions were actually in 2009

2010 you start getting year after year

after year

the fact that what manning did did not

harm national security in a material way

it did not harm individuals lives and

livelihood

in a material way all it did

is inform the public and embarrass

uh the us government and its partner

governments in the case of diplomatic

cables

but largely it was about um

reputational harm right the government

had egg on its face and it retaliates as

a result of this

moreover you know from reporting on the

justice system in other contexts i think

the government is very interested in

what it describes as the deterrent

effect manning

becomes secondary right uh someone like

me

or ellsberg or drake any of these people

they become secondary to the point of

the government

pointing to the rest of their workforce

even if this person did the right thing

even if they did it carefully even if

they did it in the best way

we don't want you to emulate it so we

are going to come after this person

chase them all the way around the earth

in order to set an example i hope you

get pardoned

it's a little puzzling the attorney

general says

you're a traitor and the information you

peddled were

uh you you peddled it around like a

commercial merchant

yeah which you didn't you never

tried to get money from it president

trump in

2013 said they got a lot of information

out of this guy he's a

terrible guy who set our country back

this guy's a bad guy

and you know there is still a thing

called execution

this is a bad guy and there's still a

thing called execution

but then seven years later a reporter

asks him

do you want to give edward snowden a

pardon and he says well i'm going to

look into it

do you want to give edward snowden a

pardon well i'm going to look at it i

mean i'm not that aware of the snowden

situation but i'm going to start looking

at it

yeah this is a good example of the

distance

donald trump has traveled from 2013

trump to 2020 trump

but also more generally when you bring

up the case of the attorney general who

does not seem familiar at all

with the basic facts of the case when

he's speaking publicly on it

that is a lot of distance historically a

lot of things have happened in between

then

and as we start to look at uh what

happened in 2013

uh less with the heat of the moment and

sort of careers on the line

and more dispassionately from a historic

context

i think it's clearer and clearer uh that

what i did was the right thing to do

uh and in fact public opinion is

swinging very heavily

uh toward that side and in fact even

elite opinion

which is largely turned against um

individuals working outside of the

organization in this kind of way

you will not find a lot of love for

whistleblowers

uh in corporate america in in government

agencies

in any country in the world i think but

even there

uh you were beginning to see people

speak uh in in fact

i would say large majority terms

favorably rather than disfavorably and i

think that's because

history has a way of exonerating the

truth in some

ways attitudes switch the other way

president-elect biden before he became

vice president

was against the spying this data

collection and said

it's very intrusive we're going to trust

the president and vice president to do

the right thing

don't count me in on that the real

question here is

what do they do with this information

that they collect

that does not have anything to do with

al qaeda and we're going to trust the

president and the vice president united

states that they're doing the right

thing

don't count me in on that but he changed

his tune once he was in power yeah

and again this was the same for uh

president-elect

barack obama some people say well you

know obama was this

raving liberal before now he's you know

dick cheney

um he tells this uh very briefly in his

memoir

he said yeah he was campaigning against

mass surveillance yeah it was wrong yeah

it should have been done it was a

problem

uh so on and so forth but then he says

after he became president he realized

he was seeing that from the cheap seats

and now

bush's wars were his

wars and this is very uh in line with

his decision

to move from investigating bush-era

abuses

things like torture things like unlawful

killing things like the

massive domestic surveillance program

that happened under the bush

administration

he didn't investigate them at all

instead he said it was important that we

look

forward not backwards and it's this

this lack of accountability

amongst the american political elite at

the same time we are constantly

increasing the level of accountability

for ordinary members of the public right

particularly when we talk in the context

of this mass surveillance

not only is the government policing you

twitter is policing you you know what

you say online

youtube is locking your channel you know

whatever uh

there are people in little police hats

everywhere you look and at the same time

these people with power are excusing

their behavior

they are heightening the standard of

accountability to which we are held and

to me i say isn't this backwards right

we used to call them uh

public servants and we were private

citizens because

we were supposed to know everything

about them and we were all supposed to

scrutinize them

and we were private citizens because no

one was supposed to know what we were

doing we had no power we had no

influence

and so we were meant to be left alone

but that is increasingly being inverted

and we

are under constant gaze uh

electronically at the same time

they are permanently sheltered by this

uh fog of unaccountability

and that's by design and just to be

clear twitter and youtube can't put us

in jail

yeah they can't well yet but

stay tuned or force you to stay in

in moscow you can't return to america

at the moment you got married in

russia uh what's your life in exile

like yeah so my my long-term partner

many years

who was with me in the united states uh

lindsey mills she's also american

and i got married uh we are expecting

our first

child uh which is a tremendous stroke of

fortune

i'm really excited about it um

and this is really all-consuming for us

right now

i think it's a scary thing i've never uh

been through this before

uh and i think it's even more

frightening for her

um but the reality is

uh exile as a political weapon

is beginning to fail um these

conversations the

this what's happening between you and i

uh today

was a rare and uh sort of extraordinary

thing

when it first started happening in my

story in the beginning of 2014

but now due to this global pandemic it's

everywhere all the time i just had a

conversation

with ai weiwei who lives in exile from

china

as a result of his own uh criticism of

his government

and this idea from history

that governments used to be able to go

fine you know we're just going to

divorce you from the public conversation

we're going to silence you through

distance um

it doesn't work anymore because even

though i put my

head down on the pillow far away

i still very much live in the united

states

you know and uh our child i think will

hopefully embody the best of all worlds

you're applying for

citizenship in russia and some americans

say that's disloyal that makes me

suspicious

yeah i mean this is part of the same

conversation that i think has been

intentionally pushed by the government

for many years now the reality is i've

been in russia now for

seven years uh i cannot leave um

i'm expecting uh to start a family

and i want my son to not

grow up as an outsider i don't want him

to feel like he is born into exile as i

am

i want him to feel at home wherever he

is

i don't want my wife to be separated

from me

because you know she doesn't have

permanent residence in the same way that

i do

uh particularly when the borders to

russia are closed as they are today

so the only way that my family can be

together

um is for me uh to do this and i don't

think that's wrong

a year ago you released permanent record

and the government sued

froze the proceeds

they sought to it's true but

the reality is the government's judgment

in the case of permanent record

uh is not enforceable uh certainly not

internationally questionably

uh domestically and i don't have any

assets in the united states

uh sort of banking system or whatever

that they could pull so

that judgment hasn't had any material

effect but more broadly i speak publicly

i did before that was also part of the

lawsuit and i continue to do so today

and i'm very fortunate for the

invitations to speak

because it's allowed me to live a good

life in a difficult situation and i have

no reason to expect that'll change

and just to be clear we're not paying

you but

these are other speeches that should

what what are some of the worst privacy

violations

left and and talk for example about

love int sure so love it

or love intelligence as it's uh sort of

portmanteau for

um is the intelligence communities uh

sort of insider cute term for spying on

spouses

romantic interests exes

normally we use this ind to refer to

intelligence there's

sig int for signals intelligence there's

command for communications intelligence

there's human for human intelligence you

would think of it as kind of the james

bond

human enabled operations well love int

is where you take this giant uh

sort of world spanning surveillance

system uh or even just your local police

force whatever

um and you turn it to going hey you know

who did she call after you know she hung

up the phone

where is she going you know what is he

doing and this has happened and the nsa

has actually publicly confirmed this

happened after the accusations came out

in at least 13 different instances one

of the particularly interesting things

about this practice of lovent

um is that the government doesn't

typically

charge people with crimes when they're

found to do this even though this is

felony behavior

and this is true anytime analysts at the

nsa or cia or elsewhere in the

intelligence community

abuse their governmentally granted

authorities

and you might go well why is that

but the answer is self-apparent when you

think through it

the existence of this program is a

secret

the operation of this program is itself

uh

possibly unlawful in the most charitable

sense

likely unlawful and the way i would put

it

and so avowing that these programs exist

avowing that a government employee

who had gone through a polygraph got a

top-secret clearance was actively using

these programs

to spy on americans or any kind of

unauthorized

target like that um

simply admitting that is possible would

expose these systems to legal challenges

so what does the government instead do

it simply disciplines them or worst case

fires

shuffles them out and gets a new body

and puts them in the chair

and so this is the kind of low-level

constant abuse

that is not likely to go away because

it's introduced by a

human element

in the context of this larger systemic

problem

what else is the problem prism

turbulence i mean we could go on

all day with this i would say for um the

average listener

uh if you want to see the the full scope

of what's happening and why it matters

all of the facets of it uh

look at my book permanent record that's

why i wrote it this is for you

but what's not in the book

uh and what is a concern is what's

coming down the road

uh and this is i

see uh things like

companies like amazon for example the

fact that they just appointed

the former nsa director who resigned its

disgrace

for having uh overseen the mass

surveillance program that now courts

have condemned is unlawful

uh that should be of concern to people

why

are they doing that why does that seem

like a good idea to them but then when

you look at what they actually do

amazon's web services as it's called

which is a cloud provider

for um technical hosting on the internet

it runs

basically like half the internet i

looked at statistics recently and i

i think when you look at the largest

sites

it is a substantial uh portion of the

internet's traffic

this is all going through amazon's data

center these are all things they can see

these are all things they can record

now when you intersect

um all of the different devices that

americans have

that they visit websites from this has

an internet address right associated

with your device

you likely have identifiers for the

sites that you're connected to

you know a username or login or a phone

number a

facebook or a gmail login you also have

cookies these are little digital files

that are planted in your browser

visiting a site which allows them to

show you different ads

to keep you logged in different

different kind of things

now this means you can track

to a more detailed degree what people

are looking at

on the internet what they're visiting

what they're searching for what their

interests are what their political

leanings are you can do sentiment

analysis even without

looking at anyone on an individual level

by taking these identifiers these

locations these associations and

affiliations

where they were in the world because

their location services were turned on

who they were there with um this is

happening more in the context of

leicester tracing programs

um and then you go with

all this rich information that amazon

has about purchasing decisions about

financial information they know

what your card is right they know what

your shipping address is they know all

of these things

and you start to collate these together

and now we see amazon

because of their alexa or echo or

whatever these things are called

these days they hire keith alexander

they implement this thing called the

sidewalk program or whatever

where it is listening not just to you in

your home it's not just listening for

your devices but it's listening

for the radio information

provided by other people's cell phones

by the wi-fi

access point the unit next to you in

apartment building or

you know on vacation or at a hotel and

all of this thing is being collated by

amazon and it's all being sent back

what they are doing is they are getting

a

broader and more detailed sense

of the world's um

[Music]

identity right individual identities

um collectively and individually

they are cross-referencing them with

basically intellectual interests and

pursuits and purchasing

information this is called enriching it

and then they're

sharing it they're applying it to uses

that we don't know about their

partnering increasingly with uh

like police through subsidiaries

we see things like google and their ring

doorbells and all that

um and what this means is we're entering

uh

increasingly a quantified world where

everywhere you go everything you do

everyone you interact with uh and

everything you're

interested in is now being

pre-judged it is being collected

and recorded and analyzed and assessed

and not by humans we don't have the

benefit of human judgment here

an algorithm makes a decision about

whether you're desirable or undesirable

about whether the things you're doing

are good or bad and we don't know how

that is being applied yet

but we do know once they have this

information we can't take it back from

them

under the laws as they are written today

and the united states of america is one

of the only if not the only

developed democracy uh in the world

today

that does not have a basic privacy law

we have the constitution would that make

a difference

i mean it's ju here's the problem that

americans by and large don't care

and i mostly don't care alexa are you

spying on me

um no i'm not spying on you actually she

answers no i'm not spying

um learn more by visiting amazon.com

alexa privacy she's she's still going

off and

john oliver had to do a bit with you

only way he could get people interested

in the invasion of privacy was to point

out that this little

light here where i see the green light

it isn't always

on if the nsa is spying on us and they

might take pictures of our private parts

and show it to people only that got a

reaction

the government should not be able to

look at dick pictures if the government

was looking at a picture of gordon's

penis i definitely feel it would be an

invasion of

my privacy they should never ever the

u.s government have a picture

of my dick yeah this is something that's

i i encounter constantly um

and again i've spoken in places all over

the world

uh all kinds of different countries all

kinds of different audiences all kinds

of different age groups

and i typically hear this

as a question being asked by older

people

and the interesting thing is it's

formulated a lot of times as

young people don't care um they go

they're on facebook they're on instagram

you know they're putting this all out

there on social media

and the reality is when i talk to

audiences and i have these conversations

young people care more

about privacy and they care more about

these intrusions

because just as my generation grew up

with the the sort of web

as it was in the 1.0 version and now you

know i'm

i'm aging out of the youth even though i

still consider myself young enough right

uh they know this web

2.0 this interactive web where you

aren't just

reading things on static sites but

you're interacting with them you're

posting you're enriching right

but that sharing is selective

and this is clear when you look to these

big you know basically beauty pageant

sites like instagram

where people are putting themselves

through filters you know they're showing

their wonderful dinner

uh they're not showing their garbage

piece of burnt toast in the morning

why they're doing that because they

understand that they are

selectively sharing they're looking at

experiences in their lives and parts of

themselves

as thoughts parts of a conversation that

they want to bring other people into

they

they want to invite you into this they

don't give you

everything and what is happening is that

trust that openness is being exploited

by companies that could not sell us you

know products

when they commercialize the web dot 1.0

right do you remember the tech boom and

pets.com uh younger listeners have no

idea what we're talking about

but the early forays into the internet

were not

uh wildly successful uh there was a boom

and a bust

because they were trying to sell us

things that we did not need

once they realized that there was only

so much they could sell us

they went searching for a new product

that led to the new web and their new

product is

us we are not the users of this system

we are being

used by this system and the reason that

you say

you don't care about this is and i say

this

without any offense intended whatsoever

is because you do not understand

the way that that system is being used

against you and that's not due to a

failing as you as an individual

that is by design these companies do not

want you to understand how it is being

used

they work with lawyers how is it being

used against me

it's profiling you it is basically uh

taking creating what's called a pattern

of life

and a social graph not just for you but

for

everyone and this means that even if

you're trying

to do something anonymously uh let's say

you have something like a cancer scare

right

and you want to look up an oncology

clinic

you want to call a doctor you know or

you know there's a planned parenthood

thing happening with a young woman

um all of these different things you

just want a moment

to seek help you're in a vulnerable

state uh and you know you you try to

open like a private browser window by

the way that doesn't work for the kind

of

tracking that we're talking about here

on the network level just for anybody

listening

but a lot of people think it does

and they re-associate your identity

based on what's called a fingerprint

that they've established of your browser

of your device of your logins

google's doing these things on your

phone apple's doing these things on your

phone

two different extents but the idea is

they're trying to

capsulate encapsulate

not just what you are but how you think

how you live who you interact with to

make you a

value in a database in a set in a

solution

that can then be influenced and

controlled and when you ask what they're

doing to you right um this is where

people start to lose it because

it feels like an abstraction it's not

clear to them because they haven't seen

you know a neighbor get marched off on

the street

as happened in like world war ii kind of

uh

nazi uprising context uh where you've

got

data sets that were uh constructed for

like a census by

you know group like ibm and then it's

abused and applied to a different

purpose

and we went well it's harmless you know

it's a sense it's something that you

want you don't see how these things are

going to be applied later

but what they are doing today um

in the most concrete form as i said

is they are collapsing everything about

you

into a known value

that can then be manipulated that is the

beginning and the end of the system they

want to make you controllable

we talked about mass surveillance before

how it's not effective in the context of

surveillance

what is it effective for it is this kind

of

intelligence surveillance

which is a means of influence right

people ask me about terrorism and they

go you know why weren't these affected

for the program for

stopping terrorism it's because they

were never designed to stop terrorism

they are about uh diplomatic

manipulation they're about

social influence they're about an

informational advantage they are about

power the corporate variance is a

variant is about the same thing

when you look at all of these things

where we've talked about in the past

like

election interference and you know this

last wave was really ugly with political

advertising and targeting that is just

the smallest part

of a very big game the bottom line

is power is derived from any means

it can be from violence it could be from

law it can be uh from money financial

influence right

but the new means of influence the one

that is most

easily hidden and the one that is the

most reliable

at scale which you can't buy off

everyone in the world you can't murder

them all if you want to have something

to control

and even with law there are law breakers

right there are the

the edge cases there with information

applied at the right time in the right

way you can change

behaviors when you see a banner ad

they're trying to shape your behavior to

sell you a new pair of shoes

but they can also control what you

see and in enough time and this is

you know been been studied by academics

what you

believe facebook which is a big company

you know where we're not talking like a

small startup that's a little bit shady

here

they ran their own psychological studies

on you know the the current population

to see if they could make you angry they

intentionally wanted to manipulate their

users it worked

they did you said and it worked exactly

you are correct right

this is controlling human behavior

by a private company for what end just

to see if they could

well the next variance and this was

years ago

are not going to be just to see if they

could it is going to be for their

advantage

it is going to be to shape laws it is

going to be to shape elections and it is

going to be

to shape individual outcomes they are

going to change

lives they it might be good for you

right you you might get a job that you

didn't expect to have

but it could also be very very bad for

you

and i think for a significant portion of

the population it will be i don't

feel threatened you make a good case why

i

should i'm not scared of amazon or

facebook because

yes they want to manipulate me but

i'm a little scared of the algorithm and

how it might divide america by

feeding us more of what we believe and

push us apart more

but basically they want my money and to

get my money

in a free market company has to give me

what i want

and that's a good thing even if we look

at this from the most libertarian

perspective

when we talk about free market operating

we are presuming that there is open

competition we are presuming that there

is fair competition

uh we do not live in a perfect world we

do not live uh we do not have the

benefit at a perfect market

there are monopolies that exist um there

are companies that exploit

uh flaws in regulations and emotes that

have been

uh granted to them and there is

it's hard to find a better example of

this uh than a lot of the internet

giants as they exist today

um and so i think it's fair uh to

recognize that even though yeah free

market even though we have consumer

choice even though we can do other

things

that only is true where there is an

alternative

where there is a reasonable competitor

that can provide the same service

or that it's even possible to launch a

competitor to these things

and i i don't believe this is true in in

that larger sense

but as you say so you were saying if i

heard it correctly

that um you're not super afraid of these

things uh

in the specific sense you understand in

the general sense you have these

fears but uh you know what can you do to

protect yourself this is always a

question that i get and it's very

difficult to answer because

the advice changes year to year because

technology is dynamic the devices are

changing the protocols are changing the

services are changing the platforms are

changing

the laws are changing and so i don't

like to give specific advice

um because uh it dates very quickly

and this video will live forever with

all of the rest of the things on our

permanent record

uh what i will tell you is there are

organizations out there

that are dedicated to creating these

kind of guides

for how to protect yourself and keeping

them up to date

you can search for sites like privacy

tools

like surveillance self-defense guides

from the electronic frontier foundation

the american civil liberties union

creates guides

the freedom of the press foundation

which i'm the president

of creates a guide for working

journalists

but largely the most important thing to

protect yourself

um is to recognize you are not going to

win an

arms race against the

richest companies in history and the

most

powerful states that the world has ever

seen

the surveillance problem first and

foremost

is a political problem

because it is enabled by a political

class that

does not share our burdens it does not

share our struggles

and it exempts itself from this gaze

it is not held to the same standard of

behavior the same level of

accountability

as you and i and this system this

knowledge

this influence will increasingly be used

to shape our lives

while excusing them from the same

methods of control so

uh political action um i think and

concern

is actually the root of resolving this

and recognizing

what are the ways that this can be

changed what is the single point of

failure

that all of these exploitative practices

are relying on

that allows this system as it is to come

into being

and we talked before about these silos

you know the google stash the facebook

stash you know everybody's private

records that are

raining in there and being used in

different ways and the government can

sort of open the lids to the different

you know assault shakers and help

themselves

well how did those silos get filled uh

we have in the united states as i said

no no basic privacy law

the fourth amendment binds the federal

government and the

state government but it does not

restrain

these companies that are basically

acting in will

full conspiracy with regulators uh where

each hand washes the other

in a sort of monopoly position

there is uh i believe a

common failure in uh

the laws as they are interpreted by the

courts of the united states today

a 1970s era case uh this sounds random

but i i promise it uh

comes together very quickly uh called

smith versus maryland

and it led to the birth of uh what is

called the third party doctrine

if you look back in american history

into what law enforcement could get

through investigations

they were strictly limited to two

categories of gains

they were called the fruits and

instrumentalities of a crime

if they were chasing a burglar they

could get a warrant the warrant would

allow them to go in the house go in the

business whatever

they could get the bag of loot the

fruits that they won

they could take the crowbar the mask the

gloves the instrumentalities of the

crime

and they could use this as evidence to

convict

they could not go to that burglar's

landlord

and you know get records of payment they

could not go to the phone company and

seize the phone company's records

because they were neither fruits nor

instrumentalities this new world

where the government can demand private

entities

uh private records about

customers or even your own records about

yourself your diaries or whatever

is a very very new thing it's about 60

years old right

and in this smith versus maryland case

in the 1970s

uh the government interpreted one case

of the cops uh investigating a uh

basically man making harassing phone

calls to a woman

where this was an individual who was

suspected of wrongdoing the cops went to

the phone company

and said can we get uh

his phone records to see if he called

this house because uh the woman saw his

license plate as he drove by sort of

leering at her house

and thought it was him and the cops

agreed phone company turned it over

and uh sure enough it was him they

caught the guy making the harassing

phone calls

you know it seems fair but they did it

without a warrant

and uh when this went all the way up to

the supreme court because the supreme

court knew he was a bad guy needed a bad

thing they didn't want to let him

walk and so they went they tried to

create a paradigm in which they could go

the phone company could do this

they could give this person's records of

what they were doing over to the cops

without a warrant and this was called

the third party doctrine the government

said that because these records

did not belong to the man even though

there were records about him

they belonged to the company because the

company created him

that man had no privacy interest in

those records therefore he had no fourth

amendment protections

uh regarding those records well in the

decades since the 1970s when you know

the court could not have imagined

the world that we live in today that our

movements can be tracked by our phones

that companies have records of

everything about us uh

the government has repeatedly leaned on

this one

single outdated court opinion of one guy

making scary phone calls

to go no one in the country

no one in the world has a privacy

interest in

any records that are created about them

but held by a third party if that

changes this surveillance ends

ends really people won't find a way to

get around it

i think legally if you recognize that

people

have a a property interest or a privacy

interest

in information about them that means

it's no longer the company's records

they're your

records and so you now are in the

driver's seat yes

amazon could create a record about you

with your consent but you control it

you can revoke it you can destroy it uh

and this is what has changed um right

now

we have a non-consensual relationship it

is premised on the illusion of consent

the idea that

you know you clicked okay to continue um

but that doesn't work in any other

contract law

uh sense you know you can't click okay

to

bind yourself into servitude for the

rest of your life you can't

click ok to be victimized repeatedly

anywhere else except the internet and i

think as soon as we recognize

that this is not proper and is not

appropriate

um life will be better for all of us

because we will have more control over

our own destinies and over our own

stories

i confess that i'm a bad example when it

comes to what you say about worrying

about this

and that i've been on television since i

was in my 20s

calling businessmen crooks

and i figured i had enemies and

some of them wanted to get me and so

i've

been very careful and when i got a

cancer scare

i wrote a column about it so i figure i

have no

privacy really and i'm kind of

come to terms with that but there ought

to be a private sphere

where people could go it's a fair point

i i will say there is a difference

between you and

shall we see the average person because

just like we talked about

um public officials and private citizens

we also have this other category

public figures um and you aren't

nobody you have a platform you have a

voice

you have influence you have friends you

have associations you have connections

um and more importantly you derive your

power

i think in society uh from sharing that

voice and

using that voice but not everybody is as

clever as you as well spoken as you

right uh and has the

the the history um and the skill set

that you do

and i think recognizing that there are

different people in society with

different capabilities

uh isn't a bad thing it's a good thing

it's okay for someone to say they do not

care

about this that or the other um but

the way rights work is it's not for

the average person and it's not

especially

for the most privileged among us right

bill gates doesn't need rights

bill gates writes the laws right bill

gates could hire his own army

um it is rights are for the least among

us they are for the

minorities they are for the strange

they're for the exposed they're for the

people

who stand out and are different rights

exist

to protect the minority from the

majority

because it is our differences that lead

to progress

and those differences those

disagreements uh

those new ideas always start out as a

minority of one

and just like a seedling we in uh free

societies

make an intentional decision to

structure our systems our laws

to protect and shelter these

weirdos so that once they have been

tested

we can benefit from those ideas well i

thank you very much for giving us

lots of time here thank you very much

it's been a pleasure to be with you

thank you edward snowden stay free
