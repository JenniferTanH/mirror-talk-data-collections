Interviewer,I know you're having to jet over here to talk to us there's so much to talk to Jack about both at Twitter.
Dorsey,And at square i want to start on twitter but I want to move to square because I don't know if everybody here appreciates.
Interviewer,The square is on its way now to actually being bigger than then Twitter and I want to understand how that even factors.
Dorsey,Into your thinking and where that company is going but given that it's in the news I do want to start with Twitter.
Interviewer,I want to start with this as everybody saw the news last week you eliminated president Trump's account on Twitter and.
Dorsey,There's some people i know who are applauding and other people who may have other views but just take us inside the.
Interviewer,Room and help us understand what actually happened and why it was so easy for something like that to happen.
Dorsey,An employee who on this person's last day to Kapaun themselves to deactivate the account and there are a number of.
Interviewer,Things that came out of this for us first should never be possible so we started looking into the controls that.
Dorsey,We have in place and what we could improve and where we have weaknesses and where we have gaps second just the you.
Interviewer,Know particular policies around what agents have control over and what they don't the account was not removed it was.
Dorsey,Not suspended it was deactivated which is a very different state than what you would assume so it was not deleted it.
Interviewer,Was put in a state waiting for the owner to come back to it and reactivate it did the owner yes otherwise the.
Dorsey,President yes he came back to it he came back to take him back to it and what had it and he reactivated it so and did they.
Interviewer,Call you we we have conversations we have conversations real quick you have no no you you have.
Dorsey,Policies and we're talking monica earlier Facebook about policies about divisive hate speech things that can be.
Interviewer,Said and can be unsaid or not said on Twitter and there was a moment at which you kicked rose mcgowan off briefly.
Dorsey,Things like that a couple people emailed in today actually a couple we even put it on Twitter for me to ask you this.
Interviewer,What would the president have to say on Twitter to be kicked off well so first and foremost we um we hold every single.
Dorsey,Account to the same standard to the same rules and to the same policies where we haven't been great is showing the.
Interviewer,Interpretations of our policies as it pertains to enforcement if an account were to publicly attack or harass a.
Dorsey,Private citizen for instance we would take action and we would of course have conversations with.
Interviewer,The party involved in the abuse or the harasser I think you said things about certain people so we do we do have a.
Dorsey,Clause in our terms of service that unfortunately we did not have publicly stated but we operated internally which.
Interviewer,Is one of those caps that i'm speaking to around newsworthiness and public interest and keeping content up because.
Dorsey,Of it because it is of public interests because there is reporting on it because it is a record of an action and this is.
Interviewer,A subject subjective evaluation by us and we work really hard to make sure that we are listening to voices and.
Dorsey,Specifically the journalists on our platform to determine news worthiness and to determine what is public interest.
Interviewer,And what's not public interest in some cases were going to get it wrong but as their peers have said like this is.
Dorsey,Something that is evolving this is something that's moving very very fast we're trying to learn as quickly as.
Interviewer,Possible and the only way we know how to help build trust in our process is to be transparent as possible around.
Dorsey,How we're thinking and i when it give us a high grade at the moment but we do have the intention internally in the.
Interviewer,Company to fix that and it's flexing a muscle that we haven't had to flex or weed in it flex in the past around being.
Dorsey,Very open and being very transparent now the company has been transparent in many degrees in other ways requests for.
Interviewer,Information from governments for instance we have established a transparency report which is.
Dorsey,Industry-leading but we haven't been consistent throughout all of our actions and and that doesn't inspire trust and.
Interviewer,And that causes people to make assumptions that are probably incorrect against our intentions so we're just.
Dorsey,Trying to make those intentions clear we're trying to close the gap between policy and interpretation of policy and.
Interviewer,Enforcement and it's real work and it's work that requires engineering it requires legal aspects and what one.
Dorsey,Policy question last last week there were the hearings and all the companies sent lawyers they didn't send the CEOs.
Interviewer,Did you think about wanting to go was there was there a conversation about whether whether whether you or others.
Dorsey,Should go absolutely and i would i would be happy to stand up and represent our company at any point and we want to make.
Interviewer,Sure that we are sending our experts and people who are familiar deeply with the knowledge and can speak to that and.
Dorsey,Shawn or gc was that person if i was called specifically I would go and I would get prepared and make sure that I.
Interviewer,Understand every single aspect of what happened and what we're doing about it more importantly but we want to make.
Dorsey,Sure that we were showing not only you know the you know our understanding of what happened in our investigations and.
Interviewer,By the people who actually led them but also by the people who can run with the work and push it and make the changes.
Dorsey,Okay so i want to know a little bit about your life which is you are now the CEO of two companies and as I meant.
Interviewer,And square gets a lot less attention in all of this but how do you manage both of these things in a personal basis.
Dorsey,Daily basis yeah i mean it's um it's evolved as as things do I I am when I started I just took in as much as.
Interviewer,Possible and then i figured out what i need to focus on and what mattered and where I need to prioritize and both.
Dorsey,Companies are in very different phases Square is something I built from day one and I know every single detail of that.
Interviewer,System and twitter i had to learn a few things in my absence and I had to understand why we made decisions and.
Dorsey,What the principles were and and how we might how we might change those or how we might evolve those so both required.
Interviewer,Very different answers both companies are right across the street from one another so it makes a little bit easier.
Dorsey,But i benefit from number one a lot of structure number two realizing that it's not about the amount of time I spend at.
Interviewer,One thing it's about how i spend the time and what we're focused on and are we focused on the thing that truly.
Dorsey,Matters the most and is it most important are we ignoring everything else at least for now and then three do.
Interviewer,We have the right team around to do the work and to make the decisions and move things forward and Square had been.
Dorsey,Building that team for a long time and we we had to do some research to Twitter throughout the company and it just it.
Interviewer,Takes time it takes time for a team to gel it takes time to understand how to collaborate with one another and.
Dorsey,Meanwhile we have a lot of other things that were not expected that I was coming into that we had to deal with and we had.
Interviewer,To we had director okay so here's what I'm going with this it feels to me like Square is your baby really your baby.
Dorsey,Twitter's your baby too but square is appearing like it could really be on this remarkable ride is there ever a.
Interviewer,Moment at which you think you're going to have to choose your children I well I don't have children right now I.
Dorsey,Am part of two amazing companies and my goal is to make sure that we are building something that outlives me and.
Interviewer,That endorsed and that continues to serve generations beyond me and that means I need to build structures that.
Dorsey,Aren't dependent entirely upon me that need that means I need to recognize leaders who can succeed me that means we.
Interviewer,Need to get our decision-making rigor and process and understanding into the v-very DNA of our companies and as I.
Dorsey,Said both companies are in different phases of that tell us about where Square is going and the reason I reason.
Interviewer,I ask is i'm used to new we all know Square you go to a go to a store or a coffee shop and and and either slide it.
Dorsey,In we had all sorts of taxi drivers are now using it as well or they've been using it for years but you recently.
Interviewer,Bought a bank and you you you mayn't you look like you're on the way to becoming a bank that it's gonna be a different.
Dorsey,Business am i wrong well we didn't buy a bank like we didn't buy a license either we applied applied.
Interviewer,For a license for an ilc which isn't a futon company and and that process takes about a year so we're not through it yet.
Dorsey,When nothing has been confirmed or or completed but the reason we did that is because we have this really amazing.
Interviewer,Business called square capital which gives out loans to sellers and owning a bank charter allows us to be more.
Dorsey,Efficient in that but it also allows us some freedom to make bigger moves or different moves in the financial space.
Interviewer,And you know more and more we've realized over time that now when we started the company we thought we were.
Dorsey,Building a credit card reader a lot of people to accept credit cards but then we realized that we were actually.
Interviewer,Building a tool that helped people participate in the economy because they were losing sales because they connect.
Dorsey,Up credit cards and as we thought about that more we looked more and more towards financial services instead of.
Interviewer,Just hardware or point-of-sale and Square Capital came out of that installment which is.
Dorsey,Humor product camera or that squirt cash came out of that and that is a big part of our future I believe is to continue.
Interviewer,To serve an underserved audience that's who we're serving in the early days of sellers and I believe we have a huge.
Dorsey,Opportunity to do that with individuals as well most of Silicon Valley though tries to run away from regulated.
Interviewer,Businesses so that's why i was curious about the banking piece of this and to the degree that if you get involved in.
Dorsey,The banking piece does it therefore affect the other pieces right regulation isn't always a negative and we also have.
Interviewer,To realize that regulation evolves and you know a big part of our role is to help educate the right way regulation.
Dorsey,Might evolve and what we've learned and what we can invent what we can do what we can build that can give access to.
Interviewer,More people and that is our focus is this word access access to the financial systems both from a seller and.
Dorsey,Individual standpoint so when we first started the company we were questioned by our banking partners and by their.
Interviewer,Regulators and and said no hundreds and hundreds of times until we could show the intent and we could show that we.
Dorsey,Could reach a broader audience and we could reach an audience that wasn't able to participate in the past and that was.
Interviewer,Good for everyone and we had to change some things to do that we didn't want to force people to go through a FICO score.
Dorsey,A credit check to start accepting credit cards it didn't make sense to us it didn't make sense to them so we changed.
Interviewer,That model and we went from a merchant acquisition process that only accepted thirty to forty percent of those who.
Dorsey,Applied to 99 percent of those who applied so we constantly questioned the regulatory but we also realized the.
Interviewer,Benefits to it is that it does have protection not just for our customers but also for our industry and we need to.
Dorsey,Do our work to make sure that we're showing solutions that that of all thinking there's been a lot of folks in.
Interviewer,Silicon valley we've tried to think about how do you rewrite the FICO score what is it how do you get the new.
Dorsey,Algorithm taking other new pieces of data to try to let the unbanked Bengt what have you done on that meaning.
Interviewer,How does it work we've just questioned a bunch of the of the fundamentals I mean I think a lot of.
Dorsey,The reason why we found so many people left out of accepting credit cards in the first place is a lot of our banking.
Interviewer,Partners just had inertia around understanding identity and changing the system and these are very old legacy.
Dorsey,Systems that work and they're predictable and they don't fail and when you build something new there's an.
Interviewer,Element of failure there's an element of risk and you have to manage that and it creates a lack of momentum so we just.
Dorsey,Wanted to take that on and question that and make sure that we are understanding new forms of identity and and we're.
Interviewer,Agile around it so i think the what we brought to bear was not a specific solution but a mindset of agility to be.
Dorsey,Open to different forms of data whether that what's the data give us an example of what are you seeing that you're.
Interviewer,You're you're willing to give somebody a loan that a traditional bank would not even look at that person well I think.
Dorsey,First and foremost square is unique because our square capital is unique because we actually see their business.
Interviewer,So they use our register they use our payments they enter all their employees into our system we see all their.
Dorsey,Customers we see their competition we have a very deep understanding of how they're doing.
Interviewer,And who they are and we don't make a judgement until we have a pretty strong understanding to make that at risk risk.
Dorsey,Assessment so our own data is one thing we're seeing because we built our platform in such a way that we are the.
Interviewer,Tool that's being used to run the entire business so we have an advantage that others mostly do not but outside of our.
Dorsey,Walls we look at you know how sellers are engaging with Yelp or Facebook or Instagram or Twitter or all these.
Interviewer,Signals that people are sending around the world and of course other other aspects that that are available to us.
Dorsey,But a lot of our assessment comes from our own understanding our own data so you have a product called square square.
Interviewer,Cat competes with something called venmo some of you may know that but it's.
Dorsey,Recently the numbers have been off the charts with your business but there's been a.
Interviewer,Big question of how these type of transfer payments that are coming among each other whether there's actual money.
Dorsey,Meaning how are you gonna make money doing that yeah so I've been really really proud of square cashes progress.
Interviewer,It's consistently broken into the top 20 free apps in the iOS App Store which is a huge feat for a finance app it's.
Dorsey,Consistently been the number one above our competitors run though and PayPal over the past few months and the way.
Interviewer,That we've done that is we haven't seen it just as peer-to-peer we've evolved past peer to peer and we've realized and.
Dorsey,We've observed that people are using it as a spending device and the more ability we add and the more capabilities.
Interviewer,We add to spend it in more places the more adoption we see in the more retention we see so what we've done it's.
Dorsey,Quite simple and intuitive we started with the most critical thing which was sending money between 10 people and then.
Interviewer,We moved on to issuing a card that could be used online and offline why the big banks haven't figured this out I mean.
Dorsey,Why is jp morgan chase not been able to do a square cache or a venmo they were trying but they haven't they haven't.
Interviewer,Gotten there i don't know but i know what has worked for us is focusing on our strengths simplicity is a strength.
Dorsey,Speed access to funds the strength building something that feels cohesive is a real strength building something.
Interviewer,That is self serve where you don't have to talk with anyone or or engage with any system outside of just downloading.
Dorsey,The app and getting getting going is a real strength so that's the formula that works for us in the suicide and the.
Interviewer,Individual side and we've just wanted to do it we've wanted to make it happen we didn't want it we don't want to wait for.
Dorsey,It happen we wanted to make it happen we took on that mindset and I think 80% of our success is just willing it into.
Interviewer,Existence and pushing through every barrier that we found in order to serve people in a different and unique way.
Dorsey,We've had a raging debate all day up here on the stage about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and since you're here.
Interviewer,And wishes a ken chenault was here earlier today also in the payment space of sorts what's your take both on.
Dorsey,Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is it is it is it a fraud is it the next Enron or is it is it here to stay and very real I.
Interviewer,Think it's easy to get lost in the superficial aspects of it and the surface level and ignore all the amazing.
Dorsey,Technology underneath I think the Bitcoin white paper is one of the most seminal works in the past 20.
Interviewer,Years in computer science i think it has impact far beyond currency I think as impact on trust as impact on identity.
Dorsey,But it's a continuation of decentralization we saw a decentralization work with the internet.
Interviewer,We saw a decentralization work with data in the cloud we saw a decentralization work with compute more and more with.
Dorsey,Platforms like aws and gcp and we continue to see it in one of the last fundamental utilities that we use as a.
Interviewer,Society which is the ledger it's a decentralized ledger and that has extreme power so I want to make sure as.
Dorsey,A company and this is not just square but also Twitter that we're looking at technologies like the blockchain my.
Interviewer,Cryptocurrency and learning from it and learning how we can apply it to create new experiences or create new.
Dorsey,Efficiencies or to do things that we were always trying to do but were hampered in the past because of X or Y.
Interviewer,Or z but now we suddenly have this amazing accelerator that we can apply in a very unique way so you expired but you.
Dorsey,Accept bitcoin we accepted bitcoin in 2014 and then 1/2 a lot of our sellers at the time we're selling things like.
Interviewer,Incense and candles and it turns out people in 2014 weren't using coined it by incense and candles so we.
Dorsey,Didn't see very many transactions but we learned a bunch from it and we've integrated that thinking and I III think.
Interviewer,It's i think it's fascinating so i would not get caught up in the trap of writing it off because of the surface level.
Dorsey,Aspects of it i would look really deeply in the technology and how we can use it to improve things and and you know.
Interviewer,Improve another form of communication around the world which is how we transact and how we trade money there's.
Dorsey,The the traditional competitors to your business but I'm curious and I've always been curious why you're wearing an Apple.
Interviewer,Watch - why do you think apple hasn't hasn't gone into this space and owned it and do you think an Amazon where some of.
Dorsey,The companies and weren't probably not even thinking of will ultimately be where you are or try to be Amazon did.
Interviewer,Try and we're very aggressive and competing with us through price and we saw some customers go over to them and.
Dorsey,Then we saw those same customers come back to us and you know I think we you have to focus on your strengths and our.
Interviewer,Strengths there was cohesiveness you were not just building a register we're not just building payments we're not.
Dorsey,Just building a loan product we're not just building payroll all of them work together and we've taken this approach.
Interviewer,Of what is the most critical need for a seller and just go after them line by line by line and make them work so that.
Dorsey,There are no seams and you know you don't have to think about connecting them at all so you download one up and.
Interviewer,You're done so we just haven't seen that approach but certainly Apple and Amazon could go after the same thing but this.
Dorsey,Is our focus this is our dna and you know when we get to partners with with companies like like Apple who we've.
Interviewer,Learned so much from and square only exists today because of Apple we're honored and and we learn and you.
Dorsey,Know we we hope to contribute to the ecosystem that they created that made us even possible in the first place I want.
Interviewer,To sneak in to questions from the audience before we have to say goodbye so let's bring up the lights.
Dorsey,If we could well while we're getting the microphone by the way 140 characters are 280 these days where you live in both.
Interviewer,Both yeah what are you gonna have read you think under 140 under 140 okay we have a couple people a couple hands.
Dorsey,Right here in this in the friend claudia Rojas capital bringing it to the theme of playing for the long term can you.
Interviewer,Speak to the value of founder centric companies or founder run companies in the public markets and perhaps their.
Dorsey,Greater capacity to plan for the long term and so here I'm thinking about face book under Mark Zuckerberg Tesla and.
Interviewer,Netflix and then of course your own experience as a founder I have a very great fortune of being on the board of.
Dorsey,The walt disney company which was also a very strongly founder led company and the founder has died and the company.
Interviewer,Thrives and what walt was able to do to imbue his values and his creativity and his direction into the company lives on.
Dorsey,And you feel it in every single thing the company does every single conversation at the board level all the.
Interviewer,Way down so i have the fortune of being on that board because I get to learn how to do that I as Lorene said death is.
Dorsey,Life's greatest invention we are all going to die and that forces a bunch of considerations around how we prioritize.
Interviewer,Our work but more importantly it puts this this constraint upon us that if we want to leave something that actually.
Dorsey,Has impact we need to make sure that we're leaving something that isn't dependent upon us living and there's an.
Interviewer,Independent pulse upon us being there in the first place so that's what I aspire to every single day I don't I think it's.
Dorsey,A failure if i have to make a decision there's something wrong with the organization that we need to fix.
Interviewer,Whether it be the people the context the organization the the problem we're trying to go after.
Dorsey,The articulation the fact that we might be doing too much that's the criteria that I started looking at when I'm.
Interviewer,Forced to make a decision there god forbid our board has to make a decision so that's that's how I'm measuring.
Dorsey,Myself is are we building a structure that isn't dependent upon me is it a dependent upon our current leadership.
Interviewer,And ultimately isn't depend upon anyone in the company today and that forces a bunch of considerations that are really.
Dorsey,Hard to do but will allow us to ultimately thrive and that's that's what I want to build that's what I want to.
Interviewer,Leave behind you know what on that note I'm gonna say thank you thank you for the conversation so very much and let me.
Dorsey,Let me also say thank you to everybody here it has been a tremendous day I want to thank everybody for the questions for.
Interviewer,Sticking with us jack dorsey everybody thank you we hope to all see you next year right back here Thanks thank you.
Dorsey,For joining us at the new york times deal book conference this concludes today's program please join us in the.
Interviewer,Atrium until 6 p.m. for cocktails sponsored by United coat-check we'll also be found on the atrium level have a.
Dorsey,Wonderful evening  .
