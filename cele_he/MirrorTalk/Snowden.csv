name,line
Interviewer,So add snowden a lot of people in this country are probably curious when was the last time you had substantive.
Snowden,Discussions about coming home to the United States and would this still be your preference do you still refer to it.
Interviewer,As home the united states will always be my home and I'll always be willing to come back on a single condition and I've.
Snowden,Been quite clear about this over the years this is that the government guarantee that I have the right and.
Interviewer,Every whistleblower has the right to tell the jury why they did what they did right we can disagree about whether this.
Snowden,Was right or wrong we can disagree about whether this is good or bad we can disagree about whether this is legal.
Interviewer,Early illegal that's right and proper in a democracy but we have to agree that the jury is supposed to be the proper.
Snowden,Authority to ultimately decide was this right or wrong and I hate to say it but under current laws that is explicitly.
Interviewer,Forbidden under the espionage act which as you know it's increasingly being used against the sources of journalism.
Snowden,Instead of foreign spies the law makes no distinction between someone who tells a secret to a journalist and someone who.
Interviewer,Tells a secret to a foreign government and and so yeah there have nots there has not been any movement unfortunately.
Snowden,On that conversation since the obama administration when I told that the government that all they need to do is.
Interviewer,Give me the right of what we call a public interest offense this is a fair trial an open trial where the jury hears.
Snowden,What is happening and they decide was this justified or not and unfortunately a then Attorney General Eric Holder.
Interviewer,Responded and said we can't promise that we won't promise that we will promise not to torture you unfortunately I'd say.
Snowden,That's not quite enough something you've said repeatedly is that you would expect and you would accept a certain.
Interviewer,Punishment for your actions what if that package of punishment in working for the home team what if.
Snowden,Someone said help us harden our elections from attack using your skills I would volunteer for that instantly you.
Interviewer,Know they they wouldn't even have to pay me for that remember I volunteered to work for the CIA.
Snowden,For the nsa when i came forward to reveal mass surveillance which we need to be clear the courts have found was in.
Interviewer,Fact unlawful on the part of the government and one court said likely unconstitutional so I have no objection.
Snowden,To helping the government i came forward not to burn the NSA down I came forward to reform it to help it return to the.
Interviewer,Ideals that we're all supposed to share so there will never be a question of when my government is ready when my.
Snowden,Government wants me to help i will be there how has your opinion changed about mr..
Interviewer,Putin since you've been in russia well i don't think it really has changed because the question might presume that.
Snowden,I had a positive opinion at some point i think everyone would agree probably including the Russian President himself.
Interviewer,That he is an authoritarian leader i think the Russian government broadly does not have a good record on human.
Snowden,Rights and that hasn't changed how odd is it to you that while you've been there consensus here has hardened that.
Interviewer,They are the actors who interfered in our last presidential election I don't think that's especially surprising there.
Snowden,Was a story published in the new york Times actually reporting on a study in February of 2018 and was also done in.
Interviewer,The washington post a few months prior to that about the record of electoral interference and they looked at the.
Snowden,History of russia and the soviet union and an electoral Intel interference by intelligence agencies and they found I.
Interviewer,Think 36 different cases of electoral interference over roughly the past 50 years.
Snowden,But then they also looked at the united States intelligence services and found that we hit enter feared in foreign.
Interviewer,Elections eighty-one different times now this is not to say one is better than the other it's not about that it's about.
Snowden,Budget about capability but we do what we do see from this is that what happened in 2016 actually was not.
Interviewer,Unusual from the perspective of intelligence agencies this is what they believe are they are hired to do what we.
Snowden,Have to do is find out how to secure our systems against the attacks that we know are inevitable something you've been.
Interviewer,Asked before something you have answered before but since this is a fresh occasion we'll will ask it again why not.
Snowden,Stay in this country and face the music if you believed in the strength of your conviction this is a great question.
Interviewer,Brian and i'm glad you asked it when we say face the music the question is well what song are they playing I was.
Snowden,Intentionally charged as every major whistleblower in the last decades has been with the very particular crime this.
Interviewer,Is a violation of the espionage act of 1917 and and this is a law that is explicitly designed to prohibit a.
Snowden,Meaningful defense in court this is applied or this law is used against people who's the only thing that they've.
Interviewer,Done and this is by the government's own terms the only thing the government accuses people defending themselves.
Snowden,Against this charge i have done is that they have told something to a journalist that the government considers classified.
Interviewer,That is the whole of the crime they don't consider whether it was good or bad they don't consider whether or not.
Snowden,It caused harm simply did you tell something classified to a journalist if you did the jury is not allowed to.
Interviewer,Consider and in fact they're explicitly forbidden from considering why you told journalists they're explicitly forbidden.
Snowden,From considering did it result in a public benefit right did it further the public interest instead they simply say.
Interviewer,Did you tell a journalist let the glass buy so I am NOT if I had stayed in the United States and my good friend Daniel.
Snowden,Ellsberg by the way that has told me that I was right not to stand and wait for an inevitable arrest because the.
Interviewer,Laws and the way they're enforced today is not the same as the 1970s when he came forward with the Pentagon Papers I.
Snowden,Would not have received a fair trial there would not have been much of a trial at all I would only have received.
Interviewer,A sentencing and the question there is what message does that send whether you like me or not.
Snowden,I could be the best person in the world I could be the worst what message does a conviction where you spend the rest of.
Interviewer,Your life in prison for telling journalists things that change the laws of the United States that have resulted.
Snowden,In the most substantive reform so intelligence authorities since the 1970s if the only result of doing that is a.
Interviewer,Life sentence in prison the next person who sees something criminal happening in the United States government will be.
Snowden,Discouraged from coming forward and i can't be a part of that where do your parents come down on what you did in the.
Interviewer,Book we learn a lot more than we knew about them they were both we say this in quotes deep Staters we learn that they.
Snowden,Both had varying degrees of security clearances in their lives yeah I come from a federal family my father worked.
Interviewer,For the military my mother works for the courts my whole line going back has worked in the in the government service.
Snowden,So i think this was difficult for them and in fact one of the things that I will be eternally grateful for is the.
Interviewer,Fact that they still stand by me today and believe that I did the right thing were they present for your wedding.
Snowden,You've gone and gotten married in the years since we've last spoken there hasn't been a wedding yet actually we.
Interviewer,Were married but it was just a paperwork sighs in a courthouse because Lindsay and I had been living together we had.
Snowden,Been in love with each other we had been in a relationship for more than ten years there will be a wedding someday.
Interviewer,Brian and i hope you'll be there what do you make of Donald Trump there are so many things that are said about.
Snowden,The president right now and so much thinking and honestly I try not to think about it there's so much chaos and there.
Interviewer,Are so many aggressive and offensive things said I think even his supporters would would grant that but I think he's.
Snowden,Actually quite simple to understand Donald Trump strikes me like nothing so much as a man who has never really known.
Interviewer,A love that he hasn't had to pay for and so everything that he does is informed by a kind of transactional ism I think.
Snowden,And what he is actually looking for is simply for people to like him unfortunately that produces a lot of.
Interviewer,Negative effects do you believe he is a threat to national security I mean this is the question of who defines national.
Snowden,Security what is national security when we used to talk about national security we thought about public safety but now.
Interviewer,National security really means the security of the system itself the institution of government and I think.
Snowden,He's made it his stated goal to change the way that system works I think we have seen tremendous harm done to civil.
Interviewer,Liberties in the united states increasingly since September 11th and I haven't seen any reduction in the rate.
Snowden,Of that we have several important jobs vacant in this country including director of national security national.
Interviewer,Security advisor is that a threat to our security I think it really says something about.
Snowden,Where we are what this point in our history looks like when we find that there are not enough people in the.
Interviewer,Country that are willing not to serve in the White House and qualify to serve in the White House who all sides of the.
Snowden,Government feel comfortable working with and who they can back we are in a time that is increasingly fractured and I.
Interviewer,Think that's a product of the fact that look if you look around at the world right now when you look at news when you.
Snowden,Look at news coverage when you look at every controversy that we see something has changed and that is that it has.
Interviewer,Become increasingly popular for your feelings to matter more than the facts and I think that's toxic to a democracy.
Snowden,Because if there's one thing that we have to have to be able to have this discussion to be able to learn to live.
Interviewer,With people that we disagree with we can't have a conversation about what we should do we can't have a conversation.
Snowden,About where we are going if we can't agree on where we are if we can't agree on what is happening facts have to.
Interviewer,Matter more than the feelings you've said your greatest fear over what you did was that things would not change.
Snowden,Have things changed would you do it again today knowing what you know now this is a significant portion of the the.
Interviewer,Final chapter of my book things have changed and I would do it again if I changed anything I would hope that I.
Snowden,Could have come forward sooner it took me so long just to understand what was happening and it took so long.
Interviewer,Not to realize that nobody else was going to fix this believe me when I say I did not want to light a match and burn.
Snowden,My life to the ground no one does nobody really wants to be a whistleblower but the results of that.
Interviewer,Have been staggering i thought this was gonna be two days story I thought everybody was gonna forget about this a.
Snowden,Week after the journalist ran the first stories in 2013 but here we are in 2019 and we're still talking about it in fact.
Interviewer,Data security surveillance the internet manipulation and influence that's provided or produced rather by a.
Snowden,Corporate or governmental control of this permanent record of all of our private lives that's been created every.
Interviewer,Day by the devices that we have before 2013 if you said there's a system that's watching everything you do the.
Snowden,Government is collecting records of every phone call in the United States even for those people who are not.
Interviewer,Suspected of any crime it was a conspiracy yes there were some people who believed it was happening yes there.
Snowden,Were academics who could say this was technically possible yes there were technologists who could went this is.
Interviewer,Something that could be done but what we didn't have it was we the world of 2013 we suspected some suspected that this.
Snowden,Was happening the world after 2013 we know that it's happening and this is the critical importance of journalism.
Interviewer,Particularly in this moment that we have today the distance between speculation and.
Snowden,Fact is everything in a democracy because that's what what lets us as we did post 2013 change our laws now the.
Interviewer,Very first program that was real to newspapers I has since been terminated Barack Obama who criticized me so.
Snowden,Strongly in june of 2013 by january of 2014 was proposing that this program be ended eventually it was ended under the.
Interviewer,Usa freedom act the nsa argued that mass surveillance was legal bulk collection as they they call it they said 15.
Snowden,Different judges authorized this what they didn't tell us was that those 15 judges all belonged to the rubber-stamp.
Interviewer,Fisa court that over 33 years had been asked 33 thousand nine hundred times by the government to approve surveillance.
Snowden,Requests only said tow in 33 years 11 times now this was a court that was never designed.
Interviewer,To interpret the constitution right it was never designed to create novel powers for the intelligence community.
Snowden,It was just designed to stamp basic routine warrants now we know what has changed the very first open court.
Interviewer,Outside of these secret rubber-stamp courts that got this case in front of them I was judge Leon in a federal court.
Snowden,And then a court of appeals and said that the NSA's mass surveillance activities were violating even the very.
Interviewer,Loose standards of the patriot act they broke the law he further said these programs are likely unconstitutional and.
Snowden,This would not have happened if we couldn't say this is real this is actually happening and I just want to.
Interviewer,Make clear that's not me saying that that's not speculation that was the determination of the Supreme Court just.
Snowden,A few months before i came forward in a famous case Amnesty versus clapper I I believe it was in February of 2013 or.
Interviewer,Door december of 2012 all the way to the Supreme Court these surveillance authorities were being challenged the.
Snowden,Plaintiff said the government has a mass surveillance program it has impacted this human rights organization they have.
Interviewer,Been spied on in secret by the government the government said that may be but if it's happening we will neither.
Snowden,Conform confirm nor deny that it's happening it is a state secret and because you can't prove it the court.
Interviewer,Should be forbidden from ruling on the constitutionality of this program and sadly the Supreme Court of the United.
Snowden,States agreed they said this program could be unconstitutional but if you cannot prove.
Interviewer,It exists we cannot evaluate it that's what 2013 changed on the legal side we have now had the GDP or we have firt had.
Snowden,The first european regulation that are trying to limit the amount of data that can be collected secretly and.
Interviewer,Used against populations broadly and we have also seen the basic structure of the Internet itself change in response.
Snowden,To this understanding that the network path that all of our communications cross when you request a website when.
Interviewer,You send a text message when you read an email for so long those communications have been electronically naked or.
Snowden,Unencrypted before 2013 more than half the world's internet communications were unencrypted now far more than half are.
Interviewer,Measured by just web traffic from where the world's leading browsers the Google Chrome browser some figures showed it.
Snowden,More than 80 percent the entire world has changed in the last few years it hasn't gone far enough the problems.
Interviewer,Still exist and in some ways they've gotten worse but we have made progress that would not have been possible if we.
Snowden,Didn't know what was going on related question what today can the government do to your phone and your laptop the.
Interviewer,Phone and laptop of any american what's the extent of the government's reach if they're determined to reach into your.
Snowden,Life we could talk about this question for hours Brian but we don't have time so I'll try to summarize hacking has.
Interviewer,Increasingly become what governments consider a legitimate investigative tool they use the same methods and techniques.
Snowden,As criminal hackers and what this means is they will try to remotely take over your device once they do this by.
Interviewer,Detecting a vulnerability and in the software that your device runs such as Apple's iOS or Microsoft Windows they.
Snowden,Can craft a special kind of attack code called an exploit they then launch this exploit at the.
Interviewer,Vulnerability on your device which allows them to take total control of that device anything you can do on that.
Snowden,Device the attacker in this case the government can do they can read your email they can.
Interviewer,Collect every document they can look at your contact book they can turn the location services on they can see.
Snowden,Anything that is on that phone instantly and send it back home to the mothership they can do the same with laptops the.
Interviewer,Other prong that we forget so frequently is that in many cases they don't need to hack our devices they can simply ask.
Snowden,Google for a copy of our email box because Google saves a copy of that everything that you've ever typed into.
Interviewer,That search box google has a copy of every private message that you've sent on Facebook every link that you've.
Snowden,Clicked everything that you've liked they keep a permanent record of and all of these things available not just to.
Interviewer,These companies but to our governments as they are increasingly deputized as sort of miniature arms of government.
Snowden,What about enabling your microphone camera if you can do it they can do it it is trivial to remotely turn on your.
Interviewer,Microphone or to activate your camera so long as you have systems-level access if you had hacked someone's device remotely.
Snowden,Anything they can do you can do they can look up your nose right they can record what's in the room the screen may be off.
Interviewer,As it's sitting on your desk but the device is talking all of the time the question we have to ask is who is it.
Snowden,Talking to even if your phone is not act right now you look at it it's just sitting there on the charger it is.
Interviewer,Talking tens or hundreds or thousands of times a minute to any number of different companies who.
Snowden,Have apps installed on your phone it looks like it's off it looks like it's just sitting there but it is constantly.
Interviewer,Chattering and unfortunately like pollution we have not created the tools that are necessary for ordinary people.
Snowden,To be able to see this activity and it is the invisibility of it that makes it so popular in common and attractive for.
Interviewer,These companies because if you do not realize they're collecting this data from you this very private and personal.
Snowden,Data there's no way you're going to object to it what about its ability to track its own.
Interviewer,And talk to me specifically about the case of Jamal khashoggi so in the case of Jamal Khashoggi.
Snowden,This is a washington post reporter and a primary critic of the Saudi regime he was lured into the Saudi Arabian.
Interviewer,Consulate in istanbul in turkey and while his fiance waited outside for him to get the paperwork he needed in order.
Snowden,To marry her he was murdered by the Saudi government allegedly on the orders of the Crown Prince now we have to ask.
Interviewer,Ourselves how did the saudi government decide that he was worth killing how did they decide when and how they would kill.
Snowden,Him how did they know this opportunity was going to arise how do they know what his plans and intentions were that they.
Interviewer,Needed to stop from their perspective we don't have evidence that his phone personally was hacked unfortunately.
Snowden,Because we do not have his phone but we do have the phones of his friends who were living in exile in Canada and we do.
Interviewer,Know thanks to the research of a group called the citizen lab affiliated with a university in Canada that their phones.
Snowden,Were hacked which means their conversations with Jamal khashoggi were intercepted and this allowed the Saudi.
Interviewer,Regime to know that he was intending to create an electronic protest movement they didn't need to know from his.
Snowden,Friend's phone or even from his phone that he was travelling to the consulate because he had to make an appointment.
Interviewer,But it did tell them his private intentions his hopes and dreams for a different government for their country.
Snowden,And perhaps although we do not know for sure on that basis they decided to murder him once your phone is hacked.
Interviewer,What is in their hands is not simply your device it is your future it's important also to remember how did.
Snowden,The government of saudi arabia manage to hack these people's phones which are modern phones well they didn't have this.
Interviewer,Capability in their government they didn't have this level of intelligence capability available to them directly so.
Snowden,They purchased it from a digital arms broker a company called the NSO Group an Israeli company in this company the only.
Interviewer,Thing they do is manufacture digital weapons kind of hacking tools they can be used against the critical.
Snowden,Infrastructure that all of us rely on the phones and our pockets they primarily target devices such as the.
Interviewer,Apple iphone and they sell this capability to break into phones of people around the world for millions and.
Snowden,Millions of dollars to some of the worst governments on earth and the only meaningful oversight that they have.
Interviewer,Unfortunately because the export control laws for these kind of digital weapons are extremely weak in Israel is their.
Snowden,Own internal ethics board this is oh it was fine we didn't break any rules that has to.
Interviewer,Change what about the public attitude held by millions of everyday Americans all I've got on a computer is pictures.
Snowden,Of my family cctv cameras that are prevalent in a ton of American cities and overseas capitals those cameras are.
Interviewer,Your friend if you're innocent and have nothing to hide well I'd say that's very much what the average Chinese citizen.
Snowden,Believed or perhaps even still to this day believes but we see how these same technologies are being applied to create.
Interviewer,What they call the social credit system if any of these family photos if any of your activities online if your purchases.
Snowden,If your associations if your friends or in any way different from what the government or the powers-that-be of the.
Interviewer,Moment would like them to be you're no longer able to purchase train tickets you're no longer a.
Snowden,To board an airplane you may not be able to get a passport you may not be eligible for a job you might not be able.
Interviewer,To work for the government all of these things are increasingly being created and programmed and decided by algorithms.
Snowden,And those algorithms are fueled by precisely the innocent data that our devices are creating all of the time.
Interviewer,Constantly invisibly quietly right now our devices are casting all of these records that we do not see being created.
Snowden,That in aggregate seemed very innocent you were at Starbucks at this time you went to the hospital afterwards you.
Interviewer,Spent a long time at the hospital after you left the hospital you made a phone call you made a phone call to your.
Snowden,Mother you talked to her until the middle of the night the hospital was an oncology clinic even if you can't see.
Interviewer,The content of these communications the activity records what the government calls metadata which they argue they do.
Snowden,Not need a warrant to collect tells the whole story and these activity records are being created and shared and.
Interviewer,Collected and intercepted constantly by companies and governments and ultimately it means as they sell these as they.
Snowden,Trade these as they make their businesses on the backs of these records what they are selling is not information.
Interviewer,What they're selling is us they're selling our future they're selling our past they are selling our history our.
Snowden,Identity and ultimately they are stealing our power and making our stories work for them what devices do.
Interviewer,You use in your life now and have you accepted the notion that you are watched rather constantly well probably every.
Snowden,Intelligence the world is definitely targeting me in trouble anything they can just as they did with.
Interviewer,Jamal khashoggi in regards to what are my plans and intentions I try not to make that easy for them if I get a smart.
Snowden,Phone and i need to use a phone i actually open it up before I use it I perform a kind of surgery on it to.
Interviewer,Physically desolder or sort of melt the metal connections that hold the microphone on the phone and I physically.
Snowden,Take this off i remove the camera for the phone and then I close it back up I seal it up and then if I need to make a.
Interviewer,Phone call i will attach an external microphone on and this is just so if the phone is sitting there and I'm not.
Snowden,Making a call it cannot hear me now this is extreme most people do not need this but for me it's about being able to.
Interviewer,Trust our technology my phone could still be hacked my laptop could still be hacked and just as I told you before the.
Snowden,Same principles applied to me if it is hacked they can do anything to the device that I can do so my trust in.
Interviewer,Technology is limited but just because that's how it is today doesn't mean that's how it has to be and a large.
Snowden,Majority of my work with the freedom of the press foundation where I serve as president of the board is dedicated to.
Interviewer,Trying to make technology more secure to try to create programs and protocols by which we can make the communications of.
Snowden,Sources and journalists more confidential because if we lose the confidentiality between sources and.
Interviewer,Journalists we lose access to those essential facts that let us understand what's happening in the world and.
Snowden,Unfortunately under this white house just like under the prior White House we see the sources of very important.
Interviewer,Stories that have advanced the public interest facing retaliation from a very angry government I believe it's in the.
Snowden,First half of the book and i'm paraphrasing you come out and just say the computer guy knows everything or at.
Interviewer,Least he should what part computer guy are you were you and what part trained spy.
Snowden,Well for the vast majority of my career I was what was called a systems engineer or a systems administrator an.
Interviewer,Administrator sort of maintains and expands a system that they have inherited and a systems engineer sort of.
Snowden,Develops new projects new capabilities for these systems roles what this means in short was that all of the systems the.
Interviewer,Nsa and the cia that i was put in charge of I had total access to and this is just what happens with the systems.
Snowden,Administrator when you think about a computer system who gives someone else access well someone has to be the.
Interviewer,Original authority that has access to everything that was me and so I would say the computer guy knows everything.
Snowden,That's not a boast that's simply the way these systems are designed that's the way they're structured and this is very.
Interviewer,Much a vulnerability because it means that you have to trust this this administrator will work to the good of.
Snowden,The users but what happens when the people using that network the people constructing that network are going.
Interviewer,Against the benefit of the broader society and this put me in a very interesting kind of conflicted position.
Snowden,I could do what the nsa wanted me to do or I could do what the Constitution of the United States the the public of the.
Interviewer,United states needed me to do which was report that my agency had broken the law do you regard yourself as a journalist.
Snowden,These days i'm not i'm not i have tremendous respect for journalists but I try to keep a distance particularly in.
Interviewer,This moment where so much of journalism is coming under attack because the government has a tremendous incentive to.
Snowden,Discredit me to make people distrust me and so if I hold myself out if I start reporting stories if I start talking to.
Interviewer,Sources if i try to start advancing what the public knows on a personal level my reputation could could sort of poison.
Snowden,Instead i keep a distinction what i do is I try to aid the work of journalism but I am NOT myself a journalist your.
Interviewer,Book is highly personal tell us about the price your then girlfriend now wife paid for your actions and how you feel.
Snowden,She was miss portrayed in the eyes of the world when we got that first kind of thumbnail sketch of who she was so in.
Interviewer,The wake of the revelations of mass surveillance in 2013 this was suddenly the world's biggest story in every.
Snowden,Country they were talking about the same thing and unfortunately that meant that everyone who was connected to me in some.
Interviewer,Way they were also talking about because they were trying to say who I was where I came from and this unfortunately meant.
Snowden,That lindsey my lifelong partner was intensely investigated both by the FBI in the United States she didn't know.
Interviewer,What i was doing i could not tell her what I was doing because if I had they would have said she was an accessory to.
Snowden,The crime they would have said she was part of a criminal conspiracy so long as she didn't immediately pick up the phone.
Interviewer,And say help help someone's talking to a journalist and so this meant that I couldn't tell her she learned about what.
Snowden,Was going to happen the same way everybody else did about what is happening the same way everybody else.
Interviewer,Did she saw me on tv which probably makes me the worst boyfriend in the history of the United States but she.
Snowden,Stuck by me and we are reunited and together today and I will never be able to repay her for the faith that she's.
Interviewer,Shown me but the media had a tremendous amount of salacious reporting when they realized that she taught toll pole.
Snowden,Fitness classes which are quite popular for him in these days they called her a stripper even though she's never been.
Interviewer,One even though she's a poet even though she's a photographer they sexualized her they focused on her.
Snowden,Body they focus on her image because that's what got attention she's a much more complex and deep figure than the.
Interviewer,Media ever gave her credit for she is more brave then anyone can possibly understand and she's more political and.
Snowden,Intelligent than any of these reporters at the time could appreciate her politics in fact influenced mine and I'd.
Interviewer,Like to think i learned as much from her or perhaps even more than she ever learned from me you paint a portrait of.
Snowden,What some of us knew and that was that you were a thoroughly American kid in your upbringing you wake up every day in.
Interviewer,Russia you go to sleep every night in Russia are you actively seeking to get out are you as has been reported looking.
Snowden,For asylum elsewhere well this is not an actively seeking this is not a new thing and this.
Interviewer,Is important history especially for those people who don't like me for those people who doubt me who have heard.
Snowden,Terrible things about me it was never my intention to end up in Russia I was going to Latin America and my final.
Interviewer,Destination was hopefully going to be Ecuador when the United States government heard that I had left Hong.
Snowden,Kong where i met the journalists they canceled my passport they gave press conferences about it which meant I.
Interviewer,Wasn't allowed to board my ongoing flight which was going to take me that's a Latin America rather than.
Snowden,Applying for russian asylum rather than saying I'll play ball with any Russian intelligence service just please protect.
Interviewer,Me i said no i will not cooperate with the Russian government or any government instead what I did as I was trapped for.
Snowden,40 days in an airport i don't know a year longest layover is but 40 days was was a tough stint I applied for asylum.
Interviewer,In 27 different countries around the world traditional US allies places like France.
Snowden,And germany places like norway that i felt the US government and the American public could be.
Interviewer,Comfortable that was fine for whistleblower being and yet every time one of these governments got close to.
Snowden,Opening their doors the phone would ring and they're in their Foreign Ministries and on the other end of the line would.
Interviewer,Be a very senior american official it was one of two people then Secretary of State John Kerry or then Vice President.
Snowden,Joe biden and they would say look we don't care what the law is we don't care if you can do this or not we understand.
Interviewer,The protecting whistleblowers and granting asylum as a matter of Human Rights and you could do this if you want.
Snowden,To but if you protect this man if you let this guy out of Russia there will be consequences we're not gonna say what.
Interviewer,They're what they're gonna be but there will be a response I continue to this day to say look if the United States.
Snowden,Government if these countries are willing to open the door that is not a hostile act that is the act of the front.
Interviewer,Of a friend if anything if the United States government is so concerned about Russia.
Snowden,Right shouldn't they be happy for me to leave and yet we see they're trying so hard to prevent me from leaving I would.
Interviewer,Ask you why is that I'm guessing Joe Biden is not your candidate for 2020 actually I don't take.
Snowden,A position on the 2020 race look it's a difficult position being in the executive branch it's a difficult.
Interviewer,Position being in power and you have to make unpopular decisions I would like to think having seen now in 2019 that all.
Snowden,Of the allegations against me did not come true national security was not harmed as a result of these disclosures.
Interviewer,But they did win the pulitzer prize for public service journalism the laws were changed as a result the courts said.
Snowden,These programs were unconstitutional we live in a safer and more secure world because the Internet is safer and more.
Interviewer,Secure as a result of understanding these common vulnerabilities which not just US intelligence agencies we're.
Snowden,Exploiting but our adversaries were exploiting one close these holes we do not become more.
Interviewer,Vulnerable we become more secure in 2013 it's fair to say some of these officials some of these candidates grow well the.
Snowden,Intelligence services are saying this guy's dangerous they're saying this is a risk they're saying this shouldn't have.
Interviewer,Happened in 2019 we can see that no evidence has ever been presented that the public understanding mass.
Snowden,Surveillance is real has caused any kind of harm whatsoever no one has died no terrorist attacks have succeeded because.
Interviewer,We knew about this stuff these programs work regardless of whether or not you know about them but we have seen the.
Snowden,Public benefits substantiated year after year after year and so I'd like to think these people would reevaluate their.
Interviewer,Position you know there are government officials who would push back very strong on your assertion that national.
Snowden,Security was not harmed you do you chose not to stop with your revelations at what was being done to Americans and you.
Interviewer,Got into america and its allies and perceived enemies when we're looking at the reports that were published in 2013.
Snowden,It's important to understand i never published a single story the number of documents that I revealed is zero what I.
Interviewer,Did was i collected an archive of material showing criminality or unethical or unconstitutional behavior.
Snowden,On the part of the united states government I provided this archive to journalists who were required as a.
Interviewer,Condition of access to this material not to publish any story because it's interesting they could publish no story.
Snowden,Simply because it's newsworthy they were only allowed as so far as the agreement went to publish stories that they were.
Interviewer,Willing to stand up and say we're in the public interest to know and this is not some crazy fly-by-night organization.
Snowden,These are newspapers like the washington Post like the New York Times like the Guardian and in every case this process.
Interviewer,Was followed now as an extraordinary check on top of this in case I went too far in.
Snowden,Case i collected a document that was too hot or I misunderstood things or the jernt the journalists misunderstood.
Interviewer,Things the journalists were further required to go to the government in advance of publication and they were.
Snowden,Required to do this at my request and warned the government this is the story that we're gonna run this is what it's.
Interviewer,About this is what we're gonna say so the government could argue against it to.
Snowden,Create an adversarial check on what the journalists and I were trying to do to reconstruct the system of checks and.
Interviewer,Balances in the united states that hid itself failed in the government you know because that process was followed so.
Snowden,Scrupulously that's why i am so confident that no harm happened no harm occurred now if there are those in the.
Interviewer,Government that say harm took place if there are those in the government who say people have died I ask you this why.
Snowden,Haven't they proved it you know better than anyone Brian that these government officials are more than happy to pick up.
Interviewer,A phone and make a leak to the new york Times every day of the week I if they had some evidence that somebody.
Snowden,Was hurt if they had evidence that a terrorist attack got through because of this journalism it would be in the front.
Interviewer,Page of every newspaper in the world and despite six years of history that's never happened describe your life today.
Snowden,What is every day like how are you supporting yourself and and as a simple equation if the Russians have reached so.
Interviewer,Effectively into our lives and our electoral systems they must be all over your life so that was several different.
Snowden,Questions but yeah i'm sure the russian government is trying to spy on me I'm sure the United States government is.
Interviewer,Trying to spy on me everyone's trying to spy on me the thing is I don't cooperate with them.
Snowden,My allegiance is to my country my allegiance is to my Constitution now in my terms of my daily life it's actually.
Interviewer,Pretty ordinary oh which is to say it's not so interesting I've always been something of an indoor.
Snowden,Cat right among nightclubs and partying my life since I was a child has always been.
Interviewer,Mediated by a screen that's my choice so not much actually changes in my day-to-day whether I'm living in New.
Snowden,York or berlin or moscow in terms of my work which a lot of people are curious about this I think is a polite way of.
Interviewer,People asking do you work for the Russian government do you accept money from the Russian government you know are.
Snowden,You living in russian government housing are you in a bunker are there guards and of course the answer to all of these is.
Interviewer,No no i'm not what i do for a living is speak professionally and now I'm actually an author I have a speaker's.
Snowden,Bureau it's called the american program Bureau and you can call them and you can book a public event I speak at.
Interviewer,Universities i speak at corporate events I speak at cybersecurity conferences to talk to people about what is happening.
Snowden,On the internet what is the future of surveillance and how can we protect ourselves I'm very fortunate to have had.
Interviewer,That opportunity and it's meant that I've had a quite comfortable life and in quite a difficult position the former.
Snowden,White house aide hr haldeman left us with an expression for the ages and when he said you can't put the toothpaste.
Interviewer,Back in the tube for americans who feel that that this is just a behemoth that they could there's no way they could.
Snowden,Have any control over it for americans who long ago decided we're just going to have to live with this surveillance how.
Interviewer,Could it possibly be receded or rescinded or stopped we can stop a program we can thwart an attack we can.
Snowden,Make a device more secure but as you imply the system is still better the institutions and agencies and companies.
Interviewer,That produced these attacks that are creating new methods of spying every day will still be there the fundamental.
Snowden,Change not just in the United States but around the world that has to happen is we have.
Interviewer,To stop thinking about the limitations on how data is used as data protection regulations right now when we talk about.
Snowden,What google and facebook are doing right now when we talk about what the NSA is doing right now when we talk about what.
Interviewer,Rival governments are doing what the Russians are doing what the Chinese are doing what the North Koreans and the.
Snowden,Iranians are doing we're constantly thinking about all right this data has been collected and these companies have.
Interviewer,It how do we regulate their use regulating the use is a mistake we should do that but that's the wrong.
Snowden,Focus it is the collection of data that is a problem when you start trying to regulate use you're going to the.
Interviewer,Collection has already happened the collection was already legal one of the fundamental flaws in u.s. privacy.
Snowden,Legislation is the fact that we are one of the only advanced democracies in the world that does not have any basic.
Interviewer,Privacy law whatsoever we have the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution which is the reason that I came forward.
Snowden,But that restricts what the federal government can do that restricts what the state governments can do it doesn't.
Interviewer,Restrict what companies can do and as you know as everybody knows these companies are playing a bigger and.
Snowden,Bigger part in the world today we have to say all of these records that they're creating about all of us all this.
Interviewer,Control that they're developing from these surveillance programs whether they're saying they're doing it for.
Snowden,Targeting advertisements or whether they're doing it for targeting killings these records belong to the people that.
Interviewer,They are about not to the companies and this is a fundamental change that we have never discussed in a meaningful way.
Snowden,Broadly and publicly but we have to because all of these governments have said you know the the mass surveillance.
Interviewer,System why do we have it why is it useful they say because of terrorism they say it's saving lives they save its.
Snowden,Oppressive anting attacks but no less than Barack Obama and the response to the 2013 revelations.
Interviewer,Created two independent commission's to investigate exactly the answer to that question were these programs effective.
Snowden,In stopping terrorist attacks did these revelations cause harm to national security it was called the privacy and.
Interviewer,Civil liberties oversight board and the president's review group on intelligence and communications technologies and.
Snowden,Despite having an enormous budget despite having complete access to classified information despite the fact.
Interviewer,That they interviewed the heads of the FBI the NSA the CIA you know the full alphabet soup they found in the.
Snowden,Government's own words the kind of mass surveillance that's represented by this bulk collection program where the NSA.
Interviewer,Was secretly collecting the phone records of every American and everybody else around the world every day under an.
Snowden,Authority provided by a secret court order that nobody even knew existed that program had never made their own words a.
Interviewer,Concrete difference in a single counterterrorism investigation think about that more than 10 years of.
Snowden,Operation and secret never made a single concrete difference these programs mass surveillance is not about public safety.
Interviewer,It is not about terrorism it is about power it is about economic espionage it is.
Snowden,About diplomatic manipulation and it is about social influence it is about understanding the actions of everyone in.
Interviewer,The world as carefully as they can no matter who they are no matter how innocent their life final question has.
Snowden,To do with the fourth amendment we have it today because mr. Adams and others wanted to keep the British out of their.
Interviewer,Homes and their horse carriages what would mr. Adams and the founders make of the reach of the government in your view.
Snowden,Into our lives given its humble beginnings I think if any of the founders of this.
Interviewer,Country looked around today they would be shocked by the kind of rhetoric they hear and they would be shocked by the.
Snowden,Kind of activities of government they see if you read the Bill of Rights something that struck me when I was.
Interviewer,Writing about it and in this book was that fully half of the first ten amendments are explicitly making the.
Snowden,Work of government harder they're making life for law enforcement officials harder and all of the founding fathers.
Interviewer,Thought that was a good idea because they recognized the more efficient a government is the more dangerous it is.
Snowden,We want a government always that is not too efficient we want a government always that is just efficient enough.
Interviewer,Because government holds extraordinary power in our lives we want government always to be using their powers in a way.
Snowden,That is only necessary and proportionate to the threat presented by whoever it is that they're investigating when the.
Interviewer,Government is getting by by the skin of their teeth the people are free right the government should be afraid of the.
Snowden,People people shouldn't be afraid of the government one of the ironies about the founding fathers for those who are.
Interviewer,Skeptical of me which is fair again i don't want you to trust me and I want you to doubt me I want you to question.
Snowden,Me but i want you to look at the facts i want you to look beyond how you feel in the moment how we all feel in the moment.
Interviewer,And see what these stories said in 2013 see that the courts of the United States where I'm being charged as a criminal.
Snowden,Said that the government itself was engaged in criminal activity look at these things and then remember the.
Interviewer,People who founded this country were called traitors the signing the writing of the Declaration of Independence was.
Snowden,An outrageous act of treason it was criminal but it was also right the question whether or not I broke the law.
Interviewer,Is less difficult and less interesting than whether you think what I did was right or wrong what.
Snowden,Is legal is not always the same as what is more final prediction then we'll let you go nightclubbing.
Interviewer,And that is do you predict do you predict you will at some point live out your life and die in the United States I.
Snowden,Think i will return when we look at the kind of things that we're being said about me in 2013 the kind of hostility I.
Interviewer,Face the kind of accusations i faced from the most senior officials in government and we look at the world.
Snowden,Today yes there are many still who don't like me but far far fewer because we have seen that all the harms that they.
Interviewer,Alleged over the course of these years never came to pass they were never substantiated because.
Snowden,They don't exist but the benefits are becoming more clear with each passing year the question that I think people.
Interviewer,Have to answer whether you like me as person or not right whether you agree with how I did what I did whether you.
Snowden,Agree with the work of the journalists who decided what the public should know in order to cast their votes today you.
Interviewer,Know the government broke the law today you know the United States government had broken that violated the.
Snowden,Constitution and the rights of people in this country and around the world would you rather not know thank you and.
Interviewer,Snowden thank you very much good luck with the book that's my pleasure Brian thank you for having me.
Snowden,Hey there i'm chris hayes from msnbc thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the.
Interviewer,Videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos.
Snowden,Lives in exile did snowden do the right thing after researching this i now think he did.
Interviewer,You decide here's our full interview you went to work for the government you signed.
Snowden,Agreements saying you wouldn't talk about what you did why go to the media we talk about.
Interviewer,Awards for progress and civil liberties we talk about the importance of independent thought.
Snowden,Um and the history of it and this is really what it is you know i i did sign up to work for the government.
Interviewer,Um i volunteered for the army i i applied to the cia i worked as a contractor.
Snowden,Uh in nsa facilities on nsa computers again and again and again people think contractors like you're working in a.
Interviewer,Different building but no you're in it's just a con continuation of government service and also you joined.
Snowden,The military after 9 11 because you wanted to fight i did when everyone else was protesting.
Interviewer,I was a younger man and i was uh much less politically educated i'd like to think than i am.
Snowden,Uh today you know some things only come with experience but so yeah it raises this question of.
Interviewer,How does you know how does .
Snowden,Someone like who i was become someone like who i am um and i got to tell you it was hard.
Interviewer,It wasn't easy wasn't natural it wasn't something i ever expected to do but like i said i signed up to all of.
Snowden,These things i volunteered because i believed in a prevailing national mythos.
Interviewer,To which we are all subscribed when we're born into our country when we go to a school system where we're.
Snowden,Basically the only one in the world where you get up in the morning and you pledge allegiance to a flag.
Interviewer,We all have the same stories um we all watch the same uh channels you know we see.
Snowden,Men like you on on tv uh kind of telling us what's happening in the world what it's.
Interviewer,Like and what changed me um was a realization that as someone who held a top-secret.
Snowden,Clearance and and had access far beyond uh what a top-secret clearance would entitle.
Interviewer,Someone to generally the private truths of what was actually happening in.
Snowden,Our government what our government actually does uh what our nation.
Interviewer,Was involved in without the knowledge or consent of the people that it purports to represent.
Snowden,Was very different than the public representation of it and that really just that seed alone.
Interviewer,Was the start of a journey that would take me many years to ultimately realize and the decision.
Snowden,As you said to come forward and the ultimate reason why i came forward.
Interviewer,Was simply to bridge that gap in my own experience and share that with everyone.
Snowden,Else to share the realization that i came to that what we were being told.
Interviewer,Is true and real and is the state of our world was in fact a witting and continuing lie.
Snowden,Uh by some of the highest representatives in our government and i felt that people needed to know.
Interviewer,That what was the lie i think the most famous one um for me and really uh.
Snowden,You know the turning point um would be when you look at uh the exchange between.
Interviewer,Um senator ron wyden and then director of national intelligence james clapper this is a.
Snowden,Sworn testimony in front of the senate intelligence committee and for those who don't remember it.
Interviewer,Because it was some time ago it looked a little bit like this so what i wanted to see is if you could.
Snowden,Give me a yes or no answer to the question does the nsa collect any type of data at.
Interviewer,All on millions or hundreds of millions of americans no sir it does not.
Snowden,Not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps uh collect but not not willingly.
Interviewer,Uh now the importance of this is to to think about what that represented um this of course was was false the nsa.
Snowden,Was collecting uh the phone records of every verizon customer.
Interviewer,On a daily basis um they were doing this for other major telecommunications providers as well.
Snowden,I just didn't have the judicial order for that and this was happening to the internet.
Interviewer,This was happening to email communications what was happening was uh a change in technology from.
Snowden,The old internet that was uh sort of non-commercial very individual and simple uh it was pretty crude everything.
Interviewer,Was cobbled together to this larger more corporatized internet where all of our communications.
Snowden,All of our interactions all of our relationships all the things that we read and like.
Interviewer,Online um are being passed to us through a facebook or a google or an apple.
Snowden,And in secret these um these companies had basically gone far beyond what the law.
Interviewer,Required of government to join programs where they would share information with the nsa.
Snowden,Through the front door of the fbi and it was continuing for years without the kind of individual warrants.
Interviewer,And legal process that we expected and we had become accustomed to we're told in.
Snowden,The constitution this is how our government works and so for me when you ask.
Interviewer,What was the the lie the lie was not any one particular part of these programs it wasn't a particular detail.
Snowden,It was the fact that there was a breathtaking sweep of intentional knowing public.
Interviewer,Deception by people at the level of the senate by people in these.
Snowden,Different executive agencies um intelligence agencies and then in the white house itself.
Interviewer,Even from the president then president barack obama who campaigned on ending warrantless.
Snowden,Wiretapping that he had criticized so heavily in the bush administration but had in.
Interviewer,Fact in secret uh extended and embraced uh these programs and these authorities.
Snowden,To a level that i began to feel had uh truly narrowed the boundaries of our rights.
Interviewer,Does the nsa routinely intercept american citizens emails no does the nsa intercept.
Snowden,Americans cell phone conversations no google searches now text messages no amazon.com.
Interviewer,Orders no bank records no we're not authorized to do it nor do we do it.
Snowden,You're at the nsa and you're dealing with these secrets before you even saw the head of the.
Interviewer,National security agency on tv and what did you think about them then well so this was the.
Snowden,The thing when you look at the arc of my career in intelligence i was always working on the technical.
Interviewer,Aspect of it and so by and large i was uh modernizing our systems because post 911.
Snowden,The intelligence community realized they weren't very good uh at using technology they thought they.
Interviewer,Were um and in a way it was true that they were but it was a different.
Snowden,Eras technology they were great with radio they were great with satellite they weren't so good with computers they.
Interviewer,Weren't so good with the internet so they brought in a bunch of shaggy young guys who looked like me.
Snowden,And they really liked what you did and you were a star absolutely but it wasn't that i was you know exceptional.
Interviewer,Um so much that i represented a generation that was native to these new systems.
Snowden,Uh that they had shied away from because they didn't trust the security of them it turned out with good reason.
Interviewer,But my generation came in we shared our experiences we shared our specialties and we were.
Snowden,Always looking at what we were doing through a straw and you have to understand this.
Interviewer,Principle that we hear of in the movies you know need to know means normally you get a project you do.
Snowden,A project you don't know where it goes you don't know who else is using it but bit by bit i was redirecting and.
Interviewer,Collecting the flow of intelligence then always backing it up permanizing it making it so that if we.
Snowden,Lost a building if we lost a site we didn't lose everything that had passed through that the information that.
Interviewer,Had been passed through that my thought this was information about terrorists i thought.
Snowden,This was saving lives i thought this was preventing wars but as i moved higher and higher in the.
Interviewer,Organization as i moved from cia to nsa as i moved from office to office.
Snowden,My straw that i'm looking through gets wider and wider and wider until i land in this.
Interviewer,Place called the office of information sharing it turned out i would be much better at.
Snowden,This job than anyone expected um and i saw everything and it's only there when you see the consequences.
Interviewer,Of your uh labor and the different parts of your career all brought together uh.
Snowden,With the labor of others of your entire generation who themselves not sitting in the position you are.
Interviewer,Can't see the big picture impact of what they're doing and the public who never even knew this.
Snowden,Stuff existed uh and again this was occurring without their consent.
Interviewer,But in theory it was being carried out in their name it felt to me that we needed to know we.
Snowden,Needed to actually decide is this what we want to happen or not and you talk to your supervisors.
Interviewer,Yeah i talked to my supervisors i talked to my colleagues on constitution day they were all fine with it this is just.
Snowden,What we do and no problem actually actually it's not quite.
Interviewer,Uh that uh people had no problems when i brought up uh these programs that many of them had.
Snowden,Never heard of because they hadn't been exposed to them um i said does this look right to you.
Interviewer,When i show that we're collecting more internet communications in the united states at the nsa than we.
Snowden,Were in russia right meaning we are ingesting more.
Interviewer,Americans communication than we are ingesting chinese people's communications or.
Snowden,Russians communications or north koreans communications or whoever you're afraid of right.
Interviewer,The bulk of our collection uh was happening domestically and happening with the aid.
Snowden,Of other partners in what's called the five eyes network the united states the.
Interviewer,United kingdom australia new zealand and canada and then the nsa would go well yes we're.
Snowden,Collecting all of these communications but we're not reading them all we're.
Interviewer,Capturing everything that you john stossel are doing online we're capturing everything.
Snowden,That your family's doing online that your friends are doing online but we just pinky promise.
Interviewer,It's not being used for anything bad and then you know at being an engineer i see how.
Snowden,These things actually are being touched they are being processed they are being sorted through.
Interviewer,Every single day algorithmically uh it sort of proves the lie right uh that all of.
Snowden,These promises they don't really amount too much all of these processes and regulations and procedures.
Interviewer,Don't amount too much and in reality what the nsa is doing every single day this ordinary course of business is.
Snowden,Violating not only the laws as written but likely the constitution.
Interviewer,And i tell this to the guy sitting to my right a good friend of mine said tell this the guy sitting on my.
Snowden,Left good friend of mine to my office manager right um and all of them.
Interviewer,Actually in private right when you're not in email uh when they're just speaking.
Snowden,Heart-to-heart about this they go no you know this this is crazy um i'm not sure why we're doing this i'm.
Interviewer,Not sure how we're doing this i'm not sure this is legal but you know what happens.
Snowden,To people who talk about this right i wouldn't put this in writing i wouldn't go.
Interviewer,You know to this office or that office they're not going to do anything about it it's not your job it's not my job.
Snowden,This is way above our pay level basically but what happens to us as an organization at the nsa what.
Interviewer,Happens to us as americans uh what happens to us as a society.
Snowden,If everybody sees something wrong and goes well if i say something about i'm going to get into trouble.
Interviewer,What happens if everybody goes i'm not going to do anything about this because it's not my job.
Snowden,That's how things go wrong in a much more serious way and the reality was i was just like them.
Interviewer,For a long time i had had a growing sense of unease uh but in reality it was not my job to fix it.
Snowden,And this was actually one of the criticisms that was eventually leveled against me as they go.
Interviewer,You know who elected you um but it's not about you know who you are um it's about what you've witnessed it's.
Snowden,About what you can prove and does that matter and i think the the last seven years when we've seen the.
Interviewer,Courts review these programs and confirm that they were in fact unlawful we've seen laws.
Snowden,Changed even by the legislature that was implicated in the wrongdoing in the first place.
Interviewer,But at some point you decided i'm not going to keep my mouth shut yeah i mean it's it's exactly because.
Snowden,This um if i keep my mouth shut the guy to my right the guy.
Interviewer,To my left we you know we all think this is wrong and we all keep our mouths shut um what does tomorrow look like.
Snowden,And the year after that and the year after that uh the reality with um these kind of extraordinary powers in.
Interviewer,Government particularly we all understand this now in the post-9 11 moment.
Snowden,Because it's not just surveillance it's happened in war it's happened in international diplomacy it's happened.
Interviewer,In economy with the financial crisis i haven't bailed out the banks but we don't bail out ordinary people um.
Snowden,When the government writ large identifies a moment of crisis uh they use that crisis for uh.
Interviewer,An exceptional demand for exceptional powers to which they normally wouldn't be entitled.
Snowden,This was the rise of the patriot act right this was how uh the bush administration got involved.
Interviewer,In more or less fire tapping this is how we got uh extrajudicial killings through drone.
Snowden,Strikes off the ground um this is how we got involved in torture.
Interviewer,But it's always uh justified as an again an exception to ordinary operations.
Snowden,Something that's done for a narrow purpose in a narrow way but then nobody objects to it.
Interviewer,These all happen in secret remember they keep the body of witnesses small by design.
Snowden,To limit the amount of dissent that concur internally organizationally and those who do complain are generally.
Interviewer,Shuffled off the program they're put in a closet somewhere and they ride out their days to.
Snowden,Retirement if they're lucky never doing anything that that matters again uh but also not having access to.
Interviewer,Anything that could cause problems for those who are violating people's rights.
Snowden,Or our laws um but this as you said why speak up if you sit by and.
Interviewer,See a system engaged in wrongdoing and you do nothing even if you don't participate in it any longer.
Snowden,Even if you resign you are perpetuating a system of wrongdoing you have become not just.
Interviewer,Part of the wrongdoing but but party to it um and for me uh when we looked at this this was affecting.
Snowden,The country that i loved this was affecting the internet that i grew up with.
Interviewer,Which was practically part of my family by this point in my life and then you extrapolate uh.
Snowden,From how we got involved in sort of this overreaching surveillance state to begin with the national security state.
Interviewer,And step by step bit by bit exception after exception uh these extraordinary and.
Snowden,Narrow authorities become permanent and perpetual authorities uh and bit by bit as the.
Interviewer,Uh domain of government expands uh the territory that is claimed to the people narrows.
Snowden,And this became such a concern to me that i was willing to risk a great deal to tell people about it and see if they.
Interviewer,Agreed or if i was just crazy my preference and i think the american people's.
Snowden,Preference would have been for a lawful orderly examination of these laws.
Interviewer,A thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to.
Snowden,A better place there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that.
Interviewer,They needed to question government actions so why go to certain members of the media.
Snowden,President obama later said there were other avenues available for someone whose.
Interviewer,Conscience was stirred specter generals congress yeah no i mean this is a great um.
Snowden,A great kind of question i mean we we always look at these things we don't want anybody in government.
Interviewer,Uh to be able to go out and you know throw any secret about anything uh out on the media uh willy-nilly and.
Snowden,This is one of the primary institutional criticisms against me on the other hand are there uh internal.
Interviewer,Channels as obama posited for me no even under the most generous reading of the law at the time what he.
Snowden,Said was incorrect and he said so at a time that by the way he knew it was incorrect.
Interviewer,Even though it was politically useful because this had been debated in newspapers around the country by this.
Snowden,Point i was not an employee of the nsa i was employed at a private company that.
Interviewer,Was contracted to do work for the nsa at nsa buildings you know on nsa equipment the only difference.
Snowden,Between myself and the actual nsa employee sitting to my right in the office.
Interviewer,Was he had a blue badge i had a green badge green was for contractor blue was for staff.
Snowden,Employee of government but the whistleblower protection laws did not apply to contractors this makes.
Interviewer,Sense if you think about it in the context of the moment because how can the government.
Snowden,Protect someone from complaints uh when it's not actually their employee right how can the government prevent someone.
Interviewer,From being disciplined when they're a private company for whatever purpose.
Snowden,Uh and the reality is there was even if i had gone through an internal purpose or sorry internal process had i gone to.
Interviewer,Congress had i gone to the president himself the ultimate result would have been the same.
Snowden,I would have been stopped at some level by an individual like the nsa.
Interviewer,Inspector general who is supposed to be kind of a watchdog that makes sure the nsa's activities.
Snowden,Are legally compliant or the office of general counsel i would have been terminated from my.
Interviewer,Position i would have been investigated by the police and i very likely would have been.
Snowden,Charged under exactly the same loans that i've been charged under today we know this not.
Interviewer,Because i'm speculating and throwing this out of air but because it had happened before.
Snowden,In the case of a former nsa executive at a much higher level than myself by the name of thomas drake who did go.
Interviewer,Through proper channels and whose story i was very familiar with because i was determining should i do.
Snowden,This is it right will it work will it be effective william benny who was charged with.
Interviewer,Thomas drake at the same time were investigated at the same time as thomas straight for the same disclosure.
Snowden,He had men with guns drawn coming to his house at dawn yes exactly you had the fbi burst into your house.
Interviewer,They take all your computers they arrest you you know they interrogate you you lose your clearance.
Snowden,You lose your job first i went to the house intelligence committee and the staff member that i.
Interviewer,Personally knew there and she then went to the chairman of that committee we were all trying to.
Snowden,Work internally in the government over these years trying to get them to come around to being constitutionally.
Interviewer,Acceptable and take it into the courts and have the court's oversight of it too.
Snowden,We naively kept thinking that that could uh that could happen and it never did.
Interviewer,They decided to raid us to keep us quiet threaten us you know in my case they came in with guns drawn.
Snowden,I don't know why they did that but they did thomas drake who was an executive at the.
Interviewer,Top of the u.s intelligence community now works at an apple store right but it's important to understand that he.
Snowden,Did go through proper channels he did everything right and when he went to these officials this.
Interviewer,Is what they said this is the office of general counsel uh at the nsa a man by the name of vito.
Snowden,Potenza if he came to me someone who was not read into the program.
Interviewer,And told me that we were running a muck essentially inviting the constitution.
Snowden,There's no doubt in my mind i would have told him you know go talk to your management don't bother.
Interviewer,Me with this i mean you know you you did the the minute he said if if he did say.
Snowden,You're using this to violate the constitution i i mean i probably would have stopped.
Interviewer,The conversation at that point quite frankly so i mean if that's what he said he said.
Snowden,Then anything after that i probably wasn't listening to anyway and this is the reality and i think.
Interviewer,Everybody understands this naturally these internal watchdog shops in government they're great.
Snowden,If you need to report sexual harassment they're great if you need to uh report some kind of discrimination if.
Interviewer,Somebody's stealing office supplies if you go the entire agency of government.
Snowden,Is engaged in a conspiracy to deceive the public about the reality that we are right now.
Interviewer,Working in concert across agencies uh to uh carry out a program that is in violation not only of law but the.
Snowden,Constitution they're not equipped to handle that and they're not interested investigating.
Interviewer,That that's not why they were appointed i gotta say in my endless.
Snowden,Hundred-year career no one has ever rolled in video before that's usually what i need to do.
Interviewer,If you ever get back right i'm a technologist sorry i can't help it that's good all right why do you think.
Snowden,You were charged under the espionage act that's pretty rare to send a chilling message.
Interviewer,To whom to other whistleblowers to others in the government not to speak out or speak out do not.
Snowden,Tell truth to power we'll hammer you drake on 60 minutes where he said.
Interviewer,It the purpose was to send a chilling message do not tell truth to power we will.
Snowden,Hammer you i think that that's absolutely correct when you look at the.
Interviewer,Lived experience of whistleblowers and again these are separated by decades of uh.
Snowden,You know different white houses different presidents different administrations different congresses.
Interviewer,Different policies the response is always the same if someone inside of government.
Snowden,Reveals government wrongdoing uh at the level uh that threatens the reputations and certainly the.
Interviewer,Electability of whether we're talking about agency heads whether we're talking about.
Snowden,Politicians whether in the legislature or the executive branches their.
Interviewer,First priority is to stop you from talking because they want to control the.
Snowden,Narrative and this is really what this is about when you look at all of this mass surveillance.
Interviewer,Um whether we're talking about internet surveillance whether we're talking about uh telephonic surveillance um whether.
Snowden,We're talking about domestic surveillance whether we're talking about international surveillance.
Interviewer,Um you've been in the news a long time you've seen these officials you've interviewed these officials.
Snowden,Uh they constantly tell us uh this is for your safety this is to investigate terrorists right and i kind of believe.
Interviewer,It right and we all believe it to some extent particularly when we shared the national.
Snowden,Trauma of 9 11. um but when you look uh from the inside as an employee of what we're doing with.
Interviewer,This i see all the reporting right i've got access to all reporting.
Snowden,And then you look at things that happen in the wake of scandal for example after i came forward obama who was facing.
Interviewer,Extraordinary pressure appointed two independent commissions to investigate these programs.
Snowden,Because he was trying to um basically justify these things and find where they were actually or where they.
Interviewer,Were useful this was the privacy and civil liberties oversight board.
Snowden,And the president's review group on intelligence and communications technologies.
Interviewer,Both of these groups had full access to classified information both of them talked to all sides of the.
Snowden,Intelligence community they went to the fbi they went to the cia they went to the nsa.
Interviewer,And they said look we've got the clearances give us your success stories show us where this helped show us where.
Snowden,This saved lives show us why we should be doing this and they looked because at the time you.
Interviewer,Know uh we had people we had keith alexander then director of the national security agency going in.
Snowden,Front of congress going on tv and saying you know this stopped 47 plots or whatever.
Interviewer,You know people are live buildings are up because these programs well barack obama's own investigations.
Snowden,Into this uh found that in the case of the very first uh program that we looked at uh this was.
Interviewer,The mass surveillance of telephone records direct domestically um it didn't stop.
Snowden,A single terrorist attack in more than 10 years of operation and that's happening in secret mind you.
Interviewer,Uh before it's the front pages and all that stuff and in the only case they also found.
Snowden,Sorry that it never made a concrete difference and that's their words in a single counterterrorism.
Interviewer,Investigation there were plots that were found but the court.
Snowden,Found that they had other they already had the information they didn't need all this spying we've heard over and.
Interviewer,Over again the assertion that 54 terrorist plots were thwarted that's plainly wrong these weren't all.
Snowden,Plots and they weren't all thwarted the american people were getting left with.
Interviewer,Inaccurate impression of the effectiveness of nsa programs they actually never discovered.
Snowden,A plot through these programs never not once uh what they did do is they found.
Interviewer,Information related to a plot um in a single case and this was a cab driver uh in california uh mo allen i.
Snowden,Believe um wiring about 8 500 to his clan in somalia which was.
Interviewer,Affiliated with al-shabab which was on a terrorism list by according the state department.
Snowden,This was their great success story right and in this case uh judges said uh or sorry we had.
Interviewer,Already had watchdogs go through it thanks fortunately to obama in this case um and now we have since had.
Snowden,Courts go at it and look at confirm it was unlawful and it was unnecessary and mind you this.
Interviewer,Is with access to the classified record because they said by the time the government had enough.
Snowden,Information to look these guys up in the nsa database you know cia fbi whatever.
Interviewer,They also had enough evidence to go to a court through traditional means and get a warrant.
Snowden,Without relying on all this right you didn't have to collect this by violating the rights of you know 330.
Interviewer,Million americans when you simply could have used the old traditional means of law enforcement to.
Snowden,Get exactly the same material from exactly the same companies without breaking the law.
Interviewer,It's dozens of terrorist events that these have helped prevent the tip of the iceberg in terms.
Snowden,Of numbers of terrorist attacks that nsa programs contributed to stopping was 54. keith alexander says these programs.
Interviewer,Helped prevent dozens of terrorist events the deputy director the reason there hasn't been a.
Snowden,Major attack in the united states since 9 11 is not an accident the number of.
Interviewer,Terrorist attacks the nsa programs contributed to stopping is.
Snowden,54. that makes me feel safer when i hear that right and but we want to believe it's true but it's not.
Interviewer,This 54 number has been um looked at uh intensively by advocates and apologists for the.
Snowden,National security state by critics of it and since then it's boiled down again to i believe.
Interviewer,One case uh and this one case in this is not uh somalian wiring 8 500 um i believe it's some you know.
Snowden,Guy with mental illness who was thinking about bombing a subway in new york.
Interviewer,But it's the same context the same thing they didn't need this authority it wasn't necessary.
Snowden,Because look uh let's say you don't john stossel uh work at the nsa you do the job i did.
Interviewer,In my last position you go in every day uh you've got the desk in front of you with your keyboard uh connected to a.
Snowden,System called x key score this is uh basically google for spies.
Interviewer,Right it allows you to search through all of the different uh methods of ingestion.
Snowden,That we have not just domestically but overseas through our partners in what we call.
Interviewer,Second party countries these are these anglophone countries and five eyes i mentioned earlier.
Snowden,As well as third-party partners we have sensors you know all over the world some of them.
Interviewer,Placed by hacking some of them placed in data centers and you can type anybody's phone number.
Snowden,In anybody's email and website in any ip address for a phone or a computer a laptop and you can see all.
Interviewer,The traffic that has passed any of these sensors you can.
Snowden,Write to your fbi analyst buddy and have them pull anybody in the world's uh basically a whole facebook list uh.
Interviewer,Everything they've ever clicked on anything that the facebook pixel tracker was on the website for when they were.
Snowden,Reading things uh their amazon order history you know everything they've typed in that google.
Interviewer,Search box ever you have access to everything right and you want to stop a terrorist plot.
Snowden,How do you know who to look up and this is why these programs don't actually stop terrorism.
Interviewer,You have to have a seed you have to have something to start your searches from you have to have a cause for suspicion.
Snowden,Traditionally under the fourth amendment we require probable cause for these kind of investigations to begin.
Interviewer,Police officers get a tip from someone they notice something when they're working to beat they know their.
Snowden,Communities they see someone acting strange they get a complaint.
Interviewer,And they investigate on this basis right well in intelligence the way these tips come across.
Snowden,Is generally from the same thing it's from a confidential informant it's from law enforcement it's from.
Interviewer,Whatever but once you have this once you have probable cause to begin investigating.
Snowden,Someone you can go to a court you can get a warrant you can access the same.
Interviewer,Information without collecting it from the entire internet before right.
Snowden,And so this is the thing um when you look at the fact that the government itself no longer makes.
Interviewer,These claims that it's stopped 54 plots right they have disowned that keith alexander no longer works for the.
Snowden,Nsa he's out now he works on the board of directors at amazon.com.
Interviewer,The the thing is what are these things effective for right because you go well why does.
Snowden,The government pay for these programs why go to all this trouble if it doesn't.
Interviewer,Stop attacks yeah why .
Snowden,And the the answer of course is because these programs are tremendously useful for something.
Interviewer,Different and that is information gathering right intelligence.
Snowden,General investigation about anything on anyone it may not be effective in preventing.
Interviewer,Terrorist attacks because again it's not uh particularly more useful relative to the tools that.
Snowden,We already have because again terrorism is rare it is scarce and people.
Interviewer,Don't realize this based on the way the media has changed but the incidence of terrorism over time.
Snowden,Is actually declining relative to the last century if you look at for example terrorist attacks.
Interviewer,In western europe uh they have declined decade over a decade uh since like the 1960s people forget.
Snowden,About it but things like maybe because of intelligence in the nsa well again i worked for these agencies.
Interviewer,And i would like to believe that was true but the rate at which they were falling.
Snowden,Is completely different from the rate of mass surveillance and this is what people misunderstand about.
Interviewer,My politics and my positioning i am not against the use of intelligence i'm not against the.
Snowden,Existence of intelligence agencies i'm not against surveillance i am against mass surveillance and this.
Interviewer,Is what i brought information forward about just to play devil's advocate here why should i care i i figure google and.
Snowden,Facebook knows everything about everybody anyway i figure that.
Interviewer,Teenage boy across the street could be picking up the stuff i sent it the the corks out of.
Snowden,The bottle what difference does it make this goes back to kind of that that nothing to.
Interviewer,Hide argument which is like um i lead a very ordinary life.
Snowden,Uh i watch my shows i go to work i take care of my family uh yeah i'm weird yeah i look at porn.
Interviewer,You know if you were talking about the average person on the internet everybody looks important right it's happened.
Snowden,Um even if you don't want to there's a pop-up ad somewhere it's in your history but the reality is most people do and.
Interviewer,They want to and that's not strange people particularly americans feel an.
Snowden,Enormous sense of shame about this but it's a tremendously common activity at the same time it makes us feel.
Interviewer,Uncomfortable you know for a lot of us as if our family knew everything that we looked up.
Snowden,On the internet we would worry about how they would look at us um if you know every company in the.
Interviewer,World knew everything that you looked at we would feel uncomfortable with it.
Snowden,But then what happens when your workplace knows uh what happens when your government.
Interviewer,Knows and who decides what is normal what's acceptable.
Snowden,And what's not right we can do things that are very common today or we can have positions uh or interests.
Interviewer,That are very uncommon today but harmless in a free society we are allowed to be different.
Snowden,We are allowed to be weird we can be strange as long as we're not hurting anyone else.
Interviewer,But laws change social wars change the norms shift and once we are entered into this.
Snowden,System where everything we've ever done everything we were ever interested in.
Interviewer,Everything we've ever bought everywhere we've ever gone everywhere that we have or anyone that we have ever.
Snowden,Talked to is instantly captured the moment it happens and memorialized in some.
Interviewer,Database somewhere just waiting to be used it will be used and we already see this.
Snowden,Happening in places like china right we don't want to emulate china.
Interviewer,Where we have a social credit system where things that you do which are harmless which aren't hurting anyone.
Snowden,But institutions or railways or airlines or the communist party that sweeps into power is already in power.
Interviewer,Decides is disfavored and should be penalized should be disincentivized now you can no longer get a job now you.
Snowden,Have to wait uh you know and go to the local police station to get a pass to be able to.
Interviewer,Travel and visit your family we cannot anticipate these things and the problem.
Snowden,Is that i have with this idea of argument is that we should have to that we should.
Interviewer,Have to prepare for that we should think and constrain our intellectual curiosity.
Snowden,And even frankly our weirdnesses our distinctions our differences our weirdness the things.
Interviewer,That place us in the minority because we could potentially someday be judged on the basis for it even if we had done.
Snowden,Nothing wrong even if it wasn't strange because the definition of what is wrong is constantly.
Interviewer,Changing if google's got it and facebook has it why is it so much worse.
Snowden,That our government has it this is this is a great question there's two ways uh that this is typically um responded.
Interviewer,To uh one and this is one that i used myself um many years before.
Snowden,Is that well the difference is uh google can sell you a different pair of shoes on the basis of what it knows about you.
Interviewer,Right the ads the place is on the side of your bar but they can't put you in jail they.
Snowden,Can't bomb you right the government can and for a lot of people.
Interviewer,The government does the second thing which i think is actually more interesting.
Snowden,Um it requires a little bit more technical understanding of how these programs are implemented but not so much.
Interviewer,That i think it loses even a general audience google knows an incredible amount about.
Snowden,An incredible number of people but it is still finite there are things that they do not know uh google does not.
Interviewer,Necessarily know what you bought on amazon google does not necessarily know what.
Snowden,You liked on facebook uh google google does not necessarily know what you posted on instagram.
Interviewer,Facebook knows what you posted on instagram because they own that right amazon knows what you bought on this but.
Snowden,They don't know what you sent in your email it's on uh google because it's a gmail account.
Interviewer,Right there are silos in industry that even if they're very large.
Snowden,Still limit what these different companies know the maximum domain of their understanding of you as an.
Interviewer,Individual and us broadly as a population government however through its course of.
Snowden,Authorities in these kind of systems is able to look into each of these different silos and.
Interviewer,Then collate them together they see everything that facebook sees.
Snowden,As well as everything that google sees as well as everything that amazon sees as well.
Interviewer,As everything that your phone provider sees as well as everything that your airline provider has in terms of your.
Snowden,Travel history uh you know and so on and so forth to an extraordinary extent.
Interviewer,There are no um limitations placed on this beyond the uh their.
Snowden,Appetite and willingness to pursue uh these silos and find a way into them now i am a little embarrassed and that.
Interviewer,I'm a consumer reporter and i report on markets i i haven't.
Snowden,Done much on spying or military secrets and i hadn't paid much attention to you i got you confused before researching.
Interviewer,For this interview with manning and julian assange snowden which who did what and but now.
Snowden,That i've done the research i conclude that you really got screwed and yet you.
Interviewer,Talk about this very dispassionately and thoughtfully aren't you pissed off i mean james.
Snowden,Clapper lied to congress and to the peop american people.
Interviewer,And he wasn't fired he served out his term in the obama administration and now he works for cnn.
Snowden,And keith alexander uh i think that's kind of a condemnation of the direction our media has.
Interviewer,Has gone in um but i understand your point absolutely keith alexander now now runs a private security.
Snowden,Firm appropriately and is on amazon's board they made out you're in exile.
Interviewer,Yeah i mean you don't do the kind of things that i did um if you're a pessimist uh.
Snowden,You do them because you're an idealist you believe that things can get better you believe that we can do better.
Interviewer,Um when i came forward it was in recognition of the fact that there is a two-tiered system to the way.
Snowden,American society is ordered today there are those in power uh who operate largely.
Interviewer,Behind a veil of secrecy um and even this applies even to people who aren't working for.
Snowden,The nsa right this happens to congressmen um it's very difficult to find out who.
Interviewer,They're meeting with it's very difficult to figure out you know what lobbyists are having conversations with who and.
Snowden,You know what laws are being shaped and what uh text is being written that is passed.
Interviewer,Into law that uh impacts all of our lives but was corporately sponsored right and these.
Snowden,People are getting donations to their campaign or famously the justice system.
Interviewer,Uh if you're uh a young person from a minority community with limited access to.
Snowden,Wealth and especially education you're going to be treated very harshly by our court system.
Interviewer,But if you're one of these made men you know working on a high level you will face a very different flavor of.
Snowden,Justice shall we say none in the case of those two guys who lied precisely.
Interviewer,Precisely uh or or no justice at all but that will never change um unless we make it change right power.
Snowden,Admits nothing without a demand government is not going to reform itself and the only way that things get better.
Interviewer,Anywhere is through sacrifice we've known this since we crawled out of the swamp of history.
Snowden,If you want to stay warm uh somebody is going to have to go through the trouble of building a house it's not going to be.
Interviewer,Fun they're not going to love it but they're going to be doing it because it makes life better.
Snowden,Somebody out there is going to have to do the hard work of growing the food that we all.
Interviewer,You know survive on and they don't get a lot of thanks for that but society is a team's board our.
Snowden,Society as exists today is flawed i recognize that right um i am doing what i can to make it better.
Interviewer,As i can i don't have any illusions that i'm going to fix it.
Snowden,Uh i'm not going to save the world that's not how this works and i think this is why i can be very.
Interviewer,Much at peace with the choices that i've made and the uh.
Snowden,Unfortunately the price that i've paid as a result of that because it was the right thing to do and.
Interviewer,It has made things better even if it hasn't fixed the problem people now.
Snowden,Can understand these things we can begin to argue for better policies and in fact they're.
Interviewer,Already happening our courts which for literally decades excused themselves at all um.
Snowden,From uh weighing in on the legality and constitutionality of surveillance in the context of national.
Interviewer,Security i have since 2013 when i came forward ruled repeatedly on these programs and.
Snowden,Repeatedly ruled against the government uh that he they had backstopped these things fully for.
Interviewer,Again for a very very long time the nsa's gated repeated substantial legal violations the ficer court called.
Snowden,A systemic non-compliance by the government but the programs go on.
Interviewer,Some of these programs have been halted uh section 215 of the patriot act is no more this was.
Snowden,Ended by an act of congress and also at the urging of for no less than barack obama who at.
Interviewer,The very beginning of 2014 interesting in terms of timing after the very first court.
Snowden,To rule against these programs said it was likely unlawful and unconstitutional came out in his state of the union.
Interviewer,Speech and said although he could never condone what i did uh he felt that this conversation.
Snowden,About surveillance legalities its limits had made us stronger as a nation and he uh urged.
Interviewer,Congress to pass what was then called the usa freedom act to basically put new legal restraints on.
Snowden,This but as you say uh that didn't end the problem of mass surveillance that just pushed the tube.
Interviewer,Of toothpaste right now the toothpaste is in slightly different part of the same tube however.
Snowden,Mass surveillance occurs largely through certain technical uh principles certain.
Interviewer,Vulnerabilities mechanically in the way our communications.
Snowden,Move from your phone or the laptop on your desk across the internet to whoever it is.
Interviewer,You're trying to communicate with right whether we're talking about a website uh whether we're talking about um.
Snowden,Someone that you're talking to on the phone uh now fewer and fewer people.
Interviewer,Use plain voice fewer fewer people use plain sms now they're using encrypted messengers.
Snowden,Like the signal messenger or whatsapp which i would not trust myself for a long period of time.
Interviewer,Because it was bought by facebook but whatsapp was the world's most popular messenger it had.
Snowden,One billion users in post 2013 they adopted a new technical protection called.
Interviewer,End-to-end encryption which is intentionally designed to limit precisely the kind of mass surveillance.
Snowden,That was being discussed in 2013 so now at the flip of a switch one billion people.
Interviewer,Get a greater level of privacy that is not reliant on jurisdiction it's not reliant on law it's not reliant.
Snowden,On politics and the encryption works encryption does work uh one of the lessons as a result of 2013.
Interviewer,All these disclosures about how the nsa works how the surveillance works um is.
Snowden,Uh you can be sneaky in a lot of ways uh as the nsa as the cia when you're trying to steal a secret.
Interviewer,But encryption is basically just math and there is no currently with the best knowledge that.
Snowden,We have of mathematics any sneaky way to just make encryption go away entirely.
Interviewer,From uh a point of interception right so as again your phone tries to reach this.
Snowden,Other person wherever they are in the world it has to go.
Interviewer,Through the network of many other people through the starbucks that you're sitting at.
Snowden,Through their internet service provider through a data center through a transatlantic cable that goes to for.
Interviewer,Example france their data center their local internet service provider their starbucks that.
Snowden,They're sitting in any one of these points anybody sitting on that line can snatch a copy.
Interviewer,Of the conversation and if it wasn't encrypted they can read it whether it's a criminal hacker.
Snowden,Next to you uh at the cafe or whether it is a national government be that the american government or the.
Interviewer,French government or anybody in between right but the thing is um the only way really to get around.
Snowden,Strong encryption that is properly implemented is uh precisely what the purpose of the.
Interviewer,2013 stories was to achieve which is to make governments shift from.
Snowden,Mass indiscriminate collection of communications to specific individualized targeted.
Interviewer,Collection this means hacking right so imagine for a second you send this encrypted communication to the person.
Snowden,That you're talking to people in the middle tons of them they all catch it they all collect it.
Interviewer,But none of them can read it because an encrypted message cannot be unlocked without a mathematical key.
Snowden,It's just the answer to the math problem that you make up that you share with the other person on the other side you guys.
Interviewer,Know the answer but nobody else in the world can come up with it right now um mass surveillance.
Snowden,No longer works game over finish doesn't work quite that way there's some more technical ways we can.
Interviewer,Talk about metadata later if you're interested but it's more in depth but the bottom line.
Snowden,Is how then if you're the cia and for example.
Interviewer,This is not someone harmless in a starbucks this is an actual terrorist or spy or a.
Snowden,Dissident in a place like bahrain or oman or hong kong which unfortunately is all too real and.
Interviewer,Happens every day how do they read this message and the answer is they steal a copy of.
Snowden,The key instead of catching it as it goes across the line which they can no longer do.
Interviewer,They can't do this for everybody on mass around the world they have to target the two places in.
Snowden,The world that that message is readable where it's unencrypted.
Interviewer,And that's on your device and the device of the person that you're talking with now.
Snowden,Instead of dealing with encryption instead of dealing with that global network that.
Interviewer,Easy cheap mass surveillance they do the hard work the traditional targeted investigative.
Snowden,Work of hacking that phone or selling that person an implanted phone that's got spy.
Interviewer,Devices built into it basically and then when that person is encrypting messages or when they're receiving.
Snowden,Messages and decrypting them because they have taken over the phone the encryption no longer matters to them.
Interviewer,Because they can see it with unencrypted they can steal that encryption key that answer to the math.
Snowden,Problem when it exists on the phone before it's forgotten before it disappears.
Interviewer,So long and short because i know that was probably uh complicated for a lot of people uh.
Snowden,Encryption end to end encryption which is to say properly implement encryption that.
Interviewer,Doesn't have a man in the middle doesn't have some facebook some google who's keeping.
Snowden,Their own copy of the key but encryption where the keys are only held by the.
Interviewer,Communicants by the people who are supposed to know this information that defeats mass surveillance in the.
Snowden,Generic general sense that we understood in 2013 it does not prevent all surveillance it.
Interviewer,Does not prevent particularly legitimate targeted surveillance but it returns.
Snowden,The intelligence and law enforcement world to the more traditional means of investigative.
Interviewer,Investigation which have fewer implications for our rights writ large as a society let's talk.
Snowden,A little more about your personal story you decide that you've got to do this you asked.
Interviewer,27 countries for asylum people are uh shall we say less familiar particularly now with seven years of.
Snowden,Distance between it what exactly happened in 2013 uh so i left the united states and met.
Interviewer,With journalists in a hotel room in hong kong hong kong was selected because it was a.
Snowden,Kind of no man's land that had very good media access it had a largely unfiltered internet neither of which is true.
Interviewer,Today unfortunately but it was very easy for journalists to operate it was very easy for.
Snowden,Me to access as a us intelligence employee without popping up on any radars or.
Interviewer,Anything like that and i would meet with them there and china also would not necessarily be free.
Snowden,To operate against us particularly the way they can today because of rivalries and friction and.
Interviewer,Bureaucratic infighting between the local hong kong services and the beijing government so this was really an.
Snowden,Ideal kind of no man's land which to operate i provided them with documents and.
Interviewer,Explained the significance of them and i didn't publish any documents this is important for people to understand i.
Snowden,Didn't put anything online i instead told the journalists to look through this.
Interviewer,Explained it and if they felt uh as i did that this was in the public interest to know.
Snowden,They would need to make an independent editorial judgment that this was the case go to the.
Interviewer,Government in advance of publication uh give the government a chance to argue against this say that snowden guy's.
Snowden,Crazy or he doesn't understand this or this document's incorrect or if you publish this people will get.
Interviewer,Hurt basically give the government the best chance to argue against this.
Snowden,Which the government took in almost all cases that i'm aware of and they talked to the white house and.
Interviewer,Talked about the white house exactly what happened was as i mentioned before i had had.
Snowden,Uh a decade's worth of history uh and actually more than a decade's worth of history.
Interviewer,Uh of cases to look over i looked at daniel ellsberg in the case of the pentagon papers in the 1970s.
Snowden,In the injunction against the newspapers working with him how that was resolved by the courts what.
Interviewer,That meant i looked at the case of thomas drake how even though he went through the.
Snowden,Right channels uh he ended up at the same place where his story unfortunately.
Interviewer,Didn't get out he faced enormous consequences policy and the public were unable to grapple.
Snowden,With this very important issue because of the government suppression of it and then i looked at the case of.
Interviewer,Wikileaks and chelsea manning with the iraq and afghanistan war longs and one of the interesting.
Snowden,Things against this was manning of course was rested and they said you know manning had uh.
Interviewer,Blood on her hands uh cost the lives of all these soldiers and you know publishing this material which.
Snowden,Was only secret not top secret uh was going to cause basically that the atmosphere to catch.
Interviewer,Fire and the oceans to boil off and none of this happened and in fact at manning's sentencing.
Snowden,The judge specifically asked the government uh do you want to argue that people were harmed as a result of.
Interviewer,This uh do you want to say you know someone was hurt someone died anything like this.
Snowden,Because we'll take it into our sentence in consideration give a harsher sentence and the government said actually no we.
Interviewer,Can't show that it doesn't exist and this is what we saw actually in the case of ellsberg it's a constant.
Snowden,Uh refrain where the government goes uh whenever they're put in the hot seat they don't want to talk about the.
Interviewer,Concrete harms of their policy they don't want to talk about how they violated rights they don't want to talk.
Snowden,About how they broke the law instead they want to shift the conversation to the whistleblower.
Interviewer,To the source of the disclosure say they're weird say they're disloyal say they have problems say they shouldn't.
Snowden,Have done this for whatever reason say that you're going to get spies killed or you're going to reveal troop.
Interviewer,Movements precisely what they want to do is talk about.
Snowden,The theoretical risks of journalism in an open society instead of the concrete demonstrated harms as.
Interviewer,Documented by the government's own malpractice and so this was something that i anticipated this was why this.
Snowden,Uh sort of process was designed i used three different journalists three different outlets um they could.
Interviewer,All go to the government the government would get a chance to do this so we could.
Snowden,Demonstrate we had gone in theoretically the most responsible way.
Interviewer,We had done everything the government thought was proper and appropriate as compared to prior cases and see if it.
Snowden,Made a difference and the interesting thing is even though this was uh sort of.
Interviewer,Tremendously indulgent of the government's interests it didn't make a single change in their.
Snowden,Messaging uh they used the same rhetoric against me as they did with men as they did with.
Interviewer,Drake as they did um with ellsberg but from here uh i left uh.
Snowden,Hong kong on route to latin america and i tell this story in my book permanent record how it happened.
Interviewer,But as i was leaving hong kong the government we're not sure there's no true way to know whether this.
Snowden,Was an intentional strategic decision or whether they panicked and it was just a mistake.
Interviewer,But once they learned the government had learned that i had departed hong kong they cancelled my.
Snowden,Passport which meant i couldn't leave russia and i spent the next you know uh.
Interviewer,30 days and 30 nights basically um trapped in this russian airport chirometer uh trying to get asylum from.
Snowden,As you said these 27 different countries things that americans wouldn't be particularly concerned with you know.
Interviewer,Germany france and every time one of these companies.
Snowden,Accompanies one of these countries uh would appear uh to be leaning towards granting asylum.
Interviewer,Saying okay come here uh they would get a phone call from one of two people.
Snowden,Uh then secretary of state um john kerry or soon to be possibly excuse me uh then vice president joe.
Interviewer,Biden and this is uh this is the interesting thing.
Snowden,Why would the us government work so hard to keep me trapped in russia rather than allow me to go to a.
Interviewer,Jurisdiction where they would be much freer to operate and much more comfortable realistically.
Snowden,Like france or germany or iceland or something like that uh if they had even the slightest.
Interviewer,Doubt about my loyalty and this is something a question that even to this day i had difficulty.
Snowden,Answering i would assume they just didn't want you to go anywhere.
Interviewer,And you happened to be in moscow you didn't think it's true right imagine you're the director of the nsa.
Snowden,Or you're the cia and you've got this guy out there he's the person that you hate the most in the world and you know.
Interviewer,All your authorities you know all your incredible powers you know even the things that i didn't know with all of my.
Snowden,Access right all the ways you can get people and they go.
Interviewer,You know we really don't like this guy we really want to do something about him uh would you rather me be.
Snowden,In moscow or literally anywhere else right and so to me it's very strange uh that the government.
Interviewer,Worked quite hard to keep me exiled specifically in russia and i've always been a little bit um.
Snowden,Particularly as years have gone by and you can't explain it away simply as a mistake of.
Interviewer,Policy back then they've had time to rectify it they realize that me being in russia.
Snowden,Provides them with an evergreen political attack that doesn't have to be explained it doesn't have to be.
Interviewer,Justified simply the association with russia is enough for them to call into question.
Snowden,My character and some americans would say really he went to china and admittedly.
Interviewer,It was it was hong kong and different than and russia these two countries and.
Snowden,There was no other way to get to latin america except through russia right certainly and this.
Interviewer,I mean this was uh subject of much debate and it was again born out there was a lot of public.
Snowden,Reporting on this back in uh 2013 when it was contemporary uh the reality is you can't fly from.
Interviewer,Hong kong or at least couldn't fly from hong kong at the time to latin america uh without crossing u.s.
Snowden,Airspace unless you went the long way around right and so then you do this and you.
Interviewer,Have to go it's very short list what are the non-extradition countries to get from hong kong.
Snowden,All the way over to south america and again it's just building a bridge through the air step by step.
Interviewer,And you know my whole flight manifest at this point has been made public there were journalists on the flight.
Snowden,That i was ticketed for from moscow to havana uh taking pictures of my empty seat.
Interviewer,When i was prevented from boarding uh and so yeah this has all been looked into and.
Snowden,It's just to me it's frustrating but it's also interesting because i wonder you know if they did this intentionally.
Interviewer,If they did this strategically it was really the most brilliant move they made in terms of communications.
Snowden,Planning that they they could have i'm not sure we can give them that much credit because it very well could have.
Interviewer,Been a moment of panic but it is i think disappointing.
Snowden,That all these years later they still haven't rectified it and it didn't work out well for you.
Interviewer,Obama commuted chelsea manning's sentence she's now running for political office.
Snowden,Uh politicians say you should be killed well you know the funny thing is we see that much less now than we did in 2013..
Interviewer,Uh the reality is there's uh there's sort of a pardon movement going on on my behalf i have not asked for.
Snowden,Pardon uh from this president or the prior president.
Interviewer,Um but many others have on my behalf and i'm tremendously grateful for that and the advocacy.
Snowden,That people brought forward um but excuse me uh the thing is as each year passes and all.
Interviewer,Of those claims as you said you know they were like oh he got people killed there were ages you know there were.
Snowden,Programs or whatever all this stuff fell apart it didn't work attacks are gonna get through none of it.
Interviewer,Came to pass and this was exactly the story in the manning case you know uh obama could not have commuted manning's.
Snowden,Sentence politically realistically um in this 2013 era in this 2014 era.
Interviewer,But years after right when manning's actions were actually in 2009 2010 you start getting year after year.
Snowden,After year the fact that what manning did did not harm national security in a material way.
Interviewer,It did not harm individuals lives and livelihood in a material way all it did.
Snowden,Is inform the public and embarrass uh the us government and its partner governments in the case of diplomatic.
Interviewer,Cables but largely it was about um reputational harm right the government.
Snowden,Had egg on its face and it retaliates as a result of this moreover you know from reporting on the.
Interviewer,Justice system in other contexts i think the government is very interested in what it describes as the deterrent.
Snowden,Effect manning becomes secondary right uh someone like me.
Interviewer,Or ellsberg or drake any of these people they become secondary to the point of the government.
Snowden,Pointing to the rest of their workforce even if this person did the right thing even if they did it carefully even if.
Interviewer,They did it in the best way we don't want you to emulate it so we are going to come after this person.
Snowden,Chase them all the way around the earth in order to set an example i hope you get pardoned.
Interviewer,It's a little puzzling the attorney general says you're a traitor and the information you.
Snowden,Peddled were uh you you peddled it around like a commercial merchant.
Interviewer,Yeah which you didn't you never tried to get money from it president trump in.
Snowden,2013 said they got a lot of information out of this guy he's a terrible guy who set our country back.
Interviewer,This guy's a bad guy and you know there is still a thing called execution.
Snowden,This is a bad guy and there's still a thing called execution but then seven years later a reporter.
Interviewer,Asks him do you want to give edward snowden a pardon and he says well i'm going to.
Snowden,Look into it do you want to give edward snowden a pardon well i'm going to look at it i.
Interviewer,Mean i'm not that aware of the snowden situation but i'm going to start looking at it.
Snowden,Yeah this is a good example of the distance donald trump has traveled from 2013.
Interviewer,Trump to 2020 trump but also more generally when you bring up the case of the attorney general who.
Snowden,Does not seem familiar at all with the basic facts of the case when he's speaking publicly on it.
Interviewer,That is a lot of distance historically a lot of things have happened in between then.
Snowden,And as we start to look at uh what happened in 2013 uh less with the heat of the moment and.
Interviewer,Sort of careers on the line and more dispassionately from a historic context.
Snowden,I think it's clearer and clearer uh that what i did was the right thing to do uh and in fact public opinion is.
Interviewer,Swinging very heavily uh toward that side and in fact even elite opinion.
Snowden,Which is largely turned against um individuals working outside of the organization in this kind of way.
Interviewer,You will not find a lot of love for whistleblowers uh in corporate america in in government.
Snowden,Agencies in any country in the world i think but even there.
Interviewer,Uh you were beginning to see people speak uh in in fact i would say large majority terms.
Snowden,Favorably rather than disfavorably and i think that's because history has a way of exonerating the.
Interviewer,Truth in some ways attitudes switch the other way president-elect biden before he became.
Snowden,Vice president was against the spying this data collection and said.
Interviewer,It's very intrusive we're going to trust the president and vice president to do the right thing.
Snowden,Don't count me in on that the real question here is what do they do with this information.
Interviewer,That they collect that does not have anything to do with al qaeda and we're going to trust the.
Snowden,President and the vice president united states that they're doing the right thing.
Interviewer,Don't count me in on that but he changed his tune once he was in power yeah and again this was the same for uh.
Snowden,President-elect barack obama some people say well you know obama was this.
Interviewer,Raving liberal before now he's you know dick cheney um he tells this uh very briefly in his.
Snowden,Memoir he said yeah he was campaigning against mass surveillance yeah it was wrong yeah.
Interviewer,It should have been done it was a problem uh so on and so forth but then he says.
Snowden,After he became president he realized he was seeing that from the cheap seats and now.
Interviewer,Bush's wars were his wars and this is very uh in line with his decision.
Snowden,To move from investigating bush-era abuses things like torture things like unlawful.
Interviewer,Killing things like the massive domestic surveillance program that happened under the bush.
Snowden,Administration he didn't investigate them at all instead he said it was important that we.
Interviewer,Look forward not backwards and it's this this lack of accountability.
Snowden,Amongst the american political elite at the same time we are constantly increasing the level of accountability.
Interviewer,For ordinary members of the public right particularly when we talk in the context of this mass surveillance.
Snowden,Not only is the government policing you twitter is policing you you know what you say online.
Interviewer,Youtube is locking your channel you know whatever uh there are people in little police hats.
Snowden,Everywhere you look and at the same time these people with power are excusing their behavior.
Interviewer,They are heightening the standard of accountability to which we are held and to me i say isn't this backwards right.
Snowden,We used to call them uh public servants and we were private citizens because.
Interviewer,We were supposed to know everything about them and we were all supposed to scrutinize them.
Snowden,And we were private citizens because no one was supposed to know what we were doing we had no power we had no.
Interviewer,Influence and so we were meant to be left alone but that is increasingly being inverted.
Snowden,And we are under constant gaze uh electronically at the same time.
Interviewer,They are permanently sheltered by this uh fog of unaccountability and that's by design and just to be.
Snowden,Clear twitter and youtube can't put us in jail yeah they can't well yet but.
Interviewer,Stay tuned or force you to stay in in moscow you can't return to america at the moment you got married in.
Snowden,Russia uh what's your life in exile like yeah so my my long-term partner many years.
Interviewer,Who was with me in the united states uh lindsey mills she's also american and i got married uh we are expecting.
Snowden,Our first child uh which is a tremendous stroke of fortune.
Interviewer,I'm really excited about it um and this is really all-consuming for us right now.
Snowden,I think it's a scary thing i've never uh been through this before uh and i think it's even more.
Interviewer,Frightening for her um but the reality is uh exile as a political weapon.
Snowden,Is beginning to fail um these conversations the this what's happening between you and i.
Interviewer,Uh today was a rare and uh sort of extraordinary thing.
Snowden,When it first started happening in my story in the beginning of 2014 but now due to this global pandemic it's.
Interviewer,Everywhere all the time i just had a conversation with ai weiwei who lives in exile from.
Snowden,China as a result of his own uh criticism of his government.
Interviewer,And this idea from history that governments used to be able to go fine you know we're just going to.
Snowden,Divorce you from the public conversation we're going to silence you through distance um.
Interviewer,It doesn't work anymore because even though i put my head down on the pillow far away.
Snowden,I still very much live in the united states you know and uh our child i think will.
Interviewer,Hopefully embody the best of all worlds you're applying for citizenship in russia and some americans.
Snowden,Say that's disloyal that makes me suspicious yeah i mean this is part of the same.
Interviewer,Conversation that i think has been intentionally pushed by the government for many years now the reality is i've.
Snowden,Been in russia now for seven years uh i cannot leave um i'm expecting uh to start a family.
Interviewer,And i want my son to not grow up as an outsider i don't want him to feel like he is born into exile as i.
Snowden,Am i want him to feel at home wherever he is.
Interviewer,I don't want my wife to be separated from me because you know she doesn't have.
Snowden,Permanent residence in the same way that i do uh particularly when the borders to.
Interviewer,Russia are closed as they are today so the only way that my family can be together.
Snowden,Um is for me uh to do this and i don't think that's wrong a year ago you released permanent record.
Interviewer,And the government sued froze the proceeds they sought to it's true but.
Snowden,The reality is the government's judgment in the case of permanent record uh is not enforceable uh certainly not.
Interviewer,Internationally questionably uh domestically and i don't have any assets in the united states.
Snowden,Uh sort of banking system or whatever that they could pull so that judgment hasn't had any material.
Interviewer,Effect but more broadly i speak publicly i did before that was also part of the lawsuit and i continue to do so today.
Snowden,And i'm very fortunate for the invitations to speak because it's allowed me to live a good.
Interviewer,Life in a difficult situation and i have no reason to expect that'll change and just to be clear we're not paying.
Snowden,You but these are other speeches that should what what are some of the worst privacy.
Interviewer,Violations left and and talk for example about love int sure so love it.
Snowden,Or love intelligence as it's uh sort of portmanteau for um is the intelligence communities uh.
Interviewer,Sort of insider cute term for spying on spouses romantic interests exes.
Snowden,Normally we use this ind to refer to intelligence there's sig int for signals intelligence there's.
Interviewer,Command for communications intelligence there's human for human intelligence you would think of it as kind of the james.
Snowden,Bond human enabled operations well love int is where you take this giant uh.
Interviewer,Sort of world spanning surveillance system uh or even just your local police force whatever.
Snowden,Um and you turn it to going hey you know who did she call after you know she hung up the phone.
Interviewer,Where is she going you know what is he doing and this has happened and the nsa has actually publicly confirmed this.
Snowden,Happened after the accusations came out in at least 13 different instances one of the particularly interesting things.
Interviewer,About this practice of lovent um is that the government doesn't typically.
Snowden,Charge people with crimes when they're found to do this even though this is felony behavior.
Interviewer,And this is true anytime analysts at the nsa or cia or elsewhere in the intelligence community.
Snowden,Abuse their governmentally granted authorities and you might go well why is that.
Interviewer,But the answer is self-apparent when you think through it the existence of this program is a.
Snowden,Secret the operation of this program is itself uh.
Interviewer,Possibly unlawful in the most charitable sense likely unlawful and the way i would put.
Snowden,It and so avowing that these programs exist avowing that a government employee.
Interviewer,Who had gone through a polygraph got a top-secret clearance was actively using these programs.
Snowden,To spy on americans or any kind of unauthorized target like that um.
Interviewer,Simply admitting that is possible would expose these systems to legal challenges so what does the government instead do.
Snowden,It simply disciplines them or worst case fires shuffles them out and gets a new body.
Interviewer,And puts them in the chair and so this is the kind of low-level constant abuse.
Snowden,That is not likely to go away because it's introduced by a human element.
Interviewer,In the context of this larger systemic problem what else is the problem prism.
Snowden,Turbulence i mean we could go on all day with this i would say for um the average listener.
Interviewer,Uh if you want to see the the full scope of what's happening and why it matters all of the facets of it uh.
Snowden,Look at my book permanent record that's why i wrote it this is for you but what's not in the book.
Interviewer,Uh and what is a concern is what's coming down the road uh and this is i.
Snowden,See uh things like companies like amazon for example the fact that they just appointed.
Interviewer,The former nsa director who resigned its disgrace for having uh overseen the mass.
Snowden,Surveillance program that now courts have condemned is unlawful uh that should be of concern to people.
Interviewer,Why are they doing that why does that seem like a good idea to them but then when.
Snowden,You look at what they actually do amazon's web services as it's called which is a cloud provider.
Interviewer,For um technical hosting on the internet it runs basically like half the internet i.
Snowden,Looked at statistics recently and i i think when you look at the largest sites.
Interviewer,It is a substantial uh portion of the internet's traffic this is all going through amazon's data.
Snowden,Center these are all things they can see these are all things they can record now when you intersect.
Interviewer,Um all of the different devices that americans have that they visit websites from this has.
Snowden,An internet address right associated with your device you likely have identifiers for the.
Interviewer,Sites that you're connected to you know a username or login or a phone number a.
Snowden,Facebook or a gmail login you also have cookies these are little digital files that are planted in your browser.
Interviewer,Visiting a site which allows them to show you different ads to keep you logged in different.
Snowden,Different kind of things now this means you can track to a more detailed degree what people.
Interviewer,Are looking at on the internet what they're visiting what they're searching for what their.
Snowden,Interests are what their political leanings are you can do sentiment analysis even without.
Interviewer,Looking at anyone on an individual level by taking these identifiers these locations these associations and.
Snowden,Affiliations where they were in the world because their location services were turned on.
Interviewer,Who they were there with um this is happening more in the context of leicester tracing programs.
Snowden,Um and then you go with all this rich information that amazon has about purchasing decisions about.
Interviewer,Financial information they know what your card is right they know what your shipping address is they know all.
Snowden,Of these things and you start to collate these together and now we see amazon.
Interviewer,Because of their alexa or echo or whatever these things are called these days they hire keith alexander.
Snowden,They implement this thing called the sidewalk program or whatever where it is listening not just to you in.
Interviewer,Your home it's not just listening for your devices but it's listening for the radio information.
Snowden,Provided by other people's cell phones by the wi-fi access point the unit next to you in.
Interviewer,Apartment building or you know on vacation or at a hotel and all of this thing is being collated by.
Snowden,Amazon and it's all being sent back what they are doing is they are getting a.
Interviewer,Broader and more detailed sense of the world's um .
Snowden,Identity right individual identities um collectively and individually they are cross-referencing them with.
Interviewer,Basically intellectual interests and pursuits and purchasing information this is called enriching it.
Snowden,And then they're sharing it they're applying it to uses that we don't know about their.
Interviewer,Partnering increasingly with uh like police through subsidiaries we see things like google and their ring.
Snowden,Doorbells and all that um and what this means is we're entering uh.
Interviewer,Increasingly a quantified world where everywhere you go everything you do everyone you interact with uh and.
Snowden,Everything you're interested in is now being pre-judged it is being collected.
Interviewer,And recorded and analyzed and assessed and not by humans we don't have the benefit of human judgment here.
Snowden,An algorithm makes a decision about whether you're desirable or undesirable about whether the things you're doing.
Interviewer,Are good or bad and we don't know how that is being applied yet but we do know once they have this.
Snowden,Information we can't take it back from them under the laws as they are written today.
Interviewer,And the united states of america is one of the only if not the only developed democracy uh in the world.
Snowden,Today that does not have a basic privacy law we have the constitution would that make.
Interviewer,A difference i mean it's ju here's the problem that americans by and large don't care.
Snowden,And i mostly don't care alexa are you spying on me um no i'm not spying on you actually she.
Interviewer,Answers no i'm not spying um learn more by visiting amazon.com alexa privacy she's she's still going.
Snowden,Off and john oliver had to do a bit with you only way he could get people interested.
Interviewer,In the invasion of privacy was to point out that this little light here where i see the green light.
Snowden,It isn't always on if the nsa is spying on us and they might take pictures of our private parts.
Interviewer,And show it to people only that got a reaction the government should not be able to.
Snowden,Look at dick pictures if the government was looking at a picture of gordon's penis i definitely feel it would be an.
Interviewer,Invasion of my privacy they should never ever the u.s government have a picture.
Snowden,Of my dick yeah this is something that's i i encounter constantly um and again i've spoken in places all over.
Interviewer,The world uh all kinds of different countries all kinds of different audiences all kinds.
Snowden,Of different age groups and i typically hear this as a question being asked by older.
Interviewer,People and the interesting thing is it's formulated a lot of times as.
Snowden,Young people don't care um they go they're on facebook they're on instagram you know they're putting this all out.
Interviewer,There on social media and the reality is when i talk to audiences and i have these conversations.
Snowden,Young people care more about privacy and they care more about these intrusions.
Interviewer,Because just as my generation grew up with the the sort of web as it was in the 1.0 version and now you.
Snowden,Know i'm i'm aging out of the youth even though i still consider myself young enough right.
Interviewer,Uh they know this web 2.0 this interactive web where you aren't just.
Snowden,Reading things on static sites but you're interacting with them you're posting you're enriching right.
Interviewer,But that sharing is selective and this is clear when you look to these big you know basically beauty pageant.
Snowden,Sites like instagram where people are putting themselves through filters you know they're showing.
Interviewer,Their wonderful dinner uh they're not showing their garbage piece of burnt toast in the morning.
Snowden,Why they're doing that because they understand that they are selectively sharing they're looking at.
Interviewer,Experiences in their lives and parts of themselves as thoughts parts of a conversation that.
Snowden,They want to bring other people into they they want to invite you into this they.
Interviewer,Don't give you everything and what is happening is that trust that openness is being exploited.
Snowden,By companies that could not sell us you know products when they commercialize the web dot 1.0.
Interviewer,Right do you remember the tech boom and pets.com uh younger listeners have no idea what we're talking about.
Snowden,But the early forays into the internet were not uh wildly successful uh there was a boom.
Interviewer,And a bust because they were trying to sell us things that we did not need.
Snowden,Once they realized that there was only so much they could sell us they went searching for a new product.
Interviewer,That led to the new web and their new product is us we are not the users of this system.
Snowden,We are being used by this system and the reason that you say.
Interviewer,You don't care about this is and i say this without any offense intended whatsoever.
Snowden,Is because you do not understand the way that that system is being used against you and that's not due to a.
Interviewer,Failing as you as an individual that is by design these companies do not want you to understand how it is being.
Snowden,Used they work with lawyers how is it being used against me.
Interviewer,It's profiling you it is basically uh taking creating what's called a pattern of life.
Snowden,And a social graph not just for you but for everyone and this means that even if.
Interviewer,You're trying to do something anonymously uh let's say you have something like a cancer scare.
Snowden,Right and you want to look up an oncology clinic.
Interviewer,You want to call a doctor you know or you know there's a planned parenthood thing happening with a young woman.
Snowden,Um all of these different things you just want a moment to seek help you're in a vulnerable.
Interviewer,State uh and you know you you try to open like a private browser window by the way that doesn't work for the kind.
Snowden,Of tracking that we're talking about here on the network level just for anybody.
Interviewer,Listening but a lot of people think it does and they re-associate your identity.
Snowden,Based on what's called a fingerprint that they've established of your browser of your device of your logins.
Interviewer,Google's doing these things on your phone apple's doing these things on your phone.
Snowden,Two different extents but the idea is they're trying to capsulate encapsulate.
Interviewer,Not just what you are but how you think how you live who you interact with to make you a.
Snowden,Value in a database in a set in a solution that can then be influenced and.
Interviewer,Controlled and when you ask what they're doing to you right um this is where people start to lose it because.
Snowden,It feels like an abstraction it's not clear to them because they haven't seen you know a neighbor get marched off on.
Interviewer,The street as happened in like world war ii kind of uh.
Snowden,Nazi uprising context uh where you've got data sets that were uh constructed for.
Interviewer,Like a census by you know group like ibm and then it's abused and applied to a different.
Snowden,Purpose and we went well it's harmless you know it's a sense it's something that you.
Interviewer,Want you don't see how these things are going to be applied later but what they are doing today um.
Snowden,In the most concrete form as i said is they are collapsing everything about you.
Interviewer,Into a known value that can then be manipulated that is the beginning and the end of the system they.
Snowden,Want to make you controllable we talked about mass surveillance before how it's not effective in the context of.
Interviewer,Surveillance what is it effective for it is this kind of.
Snowden,Intelligence surveillance which is a means of influence right people ask me about terrorism and they.
Interviewer,Go you know why weren't these affected for the program for stopping terrorism it's because they.
Snowden,Were never designed to stop terrorism they are about uh diplomatic manipulation they're about.
Interviewer,Social influence they're about an informational advantage they are about power the corporate variance is a.
Snowden,Variant is about the same thing when you look at all of these things where we've talked about in the past.
Interviewer,Like election interference and you know this last wave was really ugly with political.
Snowden,Advertising and targeting that is just the smallest part of a very big game the bottom line.
Interviewer,Is power is derived from any means it can be from violence it could be from law it can be uh from money financial.
Snowden,Influence right but the new means of influence the one that is most.
Interviewer,Easily hidden and the one that is the most reliable at scale which you can't buy off.
Snowden,Everyone in the world you can't murder them all if you want to have something to control.
Interviewer,And even with law there are law breakers right there are the the edge cases there with information.
Snowden,Applied at the right time in the right way you can change behaviors when you see a banner ad.
Interviewer,They're trying to shape your behavior to sell you a new pair of shoes but they can also control what you.
Snowden,See and in enough time and this is you know been been studied by academics what you.
Interviewer,Believe facebook which is a big company you know where we're not talking like a small startup that's a little bit shady.
Snowden,Here they ran their own psychological studies on you know the the current population.
Interviewer,To see if they could make you angry they intentionally wanted to manipulate their users it worked.
Snowden,They did you said and it worked exactly you are correct right this is controlling human behavior.
Interviewer,By a private company for what end just to see if they could well the next variance and this was.
Snowden,Years ago are not going to be just to see if they could it is going to be for their.
Interviewer,Advantage it is going to be to shape laws it is going to be to shape elections and it is.
Snowden,Going to be to shape individual outcomes they are going to change.
Interviewer,Lives they it might be good for you right you you might get a job that you didn't expect to have.
Snowden,But it could also be very very bad for you and i think for a significant portion of.
Interviewer,The population it will be i don't feel threatened you make a good case why i.
Snowden,Should i'm not scared of amazon or facebook because yes they want to manipulate me but.
Interviewer,I'm a little scared of the algorithm and how it might divide america by feeding us more of what we believe and.
Snowden,Push us apart more but basically they want my money and to get my money.
Interviewer,In a free market company has to give me what i want and that's a good thing even if we look.
Snowden,At this from the most libertarian perspective when we talk about free market operating.
Interviewer,We are presuming that there is open competition we are presuming that there is fair competition.
Snowden,Uh we do not live in a perfect world we do not live uh we do not have the benefit at a perfect market.
Interviewer,There are monopolies that exist um there are companies that exploit uh flaws in regulations and emotes that.
Snowden,Have been uh granted to them and there is it's hard to find a better example of.
Interviewer,This uh than a lot of the internet giants as they exist today um and so i think it's fair uh to.
Snowden,Recognize that even though yeah free market even though we have consumer choice even though we can do other.
Interviewer,Things that only is true where there is an alternative.
Snowden,Where there is a reasonable competitor that can provide the same service or that it's even possible to launch a.
Interviewer,Competitor to these things and i i don't believe this is true in in that larger sense.
Snowden,But as you say so you were saying if i heard it correctly that um you're not super afraid of these.
Interviewer,Things uh in the specific sense you understand in the general sense you have these.
Snowden,Fears but uh you know what can you do to protect yourself this is always a question that i get and it's very.
Interviewer,Difficult to answer because the advice changes year to year because technology is dynamic the devices are.
Snowden,Changing the protocols are changing the services are changing the platforms are changing.
Interviewer,The laws are changing and so i don't like to give specific advice um because uh it dates very quickly.
Snowden,And this video will live forever with all of the rest of the things on our permanent record.
Interviewer,Uh what i will tell you is there are organizations out there that are dedicated to creating these.
Snowden,Kind of guides for how to protect yourself and keeping them up to date.
Interviewer,You can search for sites like privacy tools like surveillance self-defense guides.
Snowden,From the electronic frontier foundation the american civil liberties union creates guides.
Interviewer,The freedom of the press foundation which i'm the president of creates a guide for working.
Snowden,Journalists but largely the most important thing to protect yourself.
Interviewer,Um is to recognize you are not going to win an arms race against the.
Snowden,Richest companies in history and the most powerful states that the world has ever.
Interviewer,Seen the surveillance problem first and foremost.
Snowden,Is a political problem because it is enabled by a political class that.
Interviewer,Does not share our burdens it does not share our struggles and it exempts itself from this gaze.
Snowden,It is not held to the same standard of behavior the same level of accountability.
Interviewer,As you and i and this system this knowledge this influence will increasingly be used.
Snowden,To shape our lives while excusing them from the same methods of control so.
Interviewer,Uh political action um i think and concern is actually the root of resolving this.
Snowden,And recognizing what are the ways that this can be changed what is the single point of.
Interviewer,Failure that all of these exploitative practices are relying on.
Snowden,That allows this system as it is to come into being and we talked before about these silos.
Interviewer,You know the google stash the facebook stash you know everybody's private records that are.
Snowden,Raining in there and being used in different ways and the government can sort of open the lids to the different.
Interviewer,You know assault shakers and help themselves well how did those silos get filled uh.
Snowden,We have in the united states as i said no no basic privacy law the fourth amendment binds the federal.
Interviewer,Government and the state government but it does not restrain.
Snowden,These companies that are basically acting in will full conspiracy with regulators uh where.
Interviewer,Each hand washes the other in a sort of monopoly position there is uh i believe a.
Snowden,Common failure in uh the laws as they are interpreted by the courts of the united states today.
Interviewer,A 1970s era case uh this sounds random but i i promise it uh comes together very quickly uh called.
Snowden,Smith versus maryland and it led to the birth of uh what is called the third party doctrine.
Interviewer,If you look back in american history into what law enforcement could get through investigations.
Snowden,They were strictly limited to two categories of gains they were called the fruits and.
Interviewer,Instrumentalities of a crime if they were chasing a burglar they could get a warrant the warrant would.
Snowden,Allow them to go in the house go in the business whatever they could get the bag of loot the.
Interviewer,Fruits that they won they could take the crowbar the mask the gloves the instrumentalities of the.
Snowden,Crime and they could use this as evidence to convict.
Interviewer,They could not go to that burglar's landlord and you know get records of payment they.
Snowden,Could not go to the phone company and seize the phone company's records because they were neither fruits nor.
Interviewer,Instrumentalities this new world where the government can demand private entities.
Snowden,Uh private records about customers or even your own records about yourself your diaries or whatever.
Interviewer,Is a very very new thing it's about 60 years old right and in this smith versus maryland case.
Snowden,In the 1970s uh the government interpreted one case of the cops uh investigating a uh.
Interviewer,Basically man making harassing phone calls to a woman where this was an individual who was.
Snowden,Suspected of wrongdoing the cops went to the phone company and said can we get uh.
Interviewer,His phone records to see if he called this house because uh the woman saw his license plate as he drove by sort of.
Snowden,Leering at her house and thought it was him and the cops agreed phone company turned it over.
Interviewer,And uh sure enough it was him they caught the guy making the harassing phone calls.
Snowden,You know it seems fair but they did it without a warrant and uh when this went all the way up to.
Interviewer,The supreme court because the supreme court knew he was a bad guy needed a bad thing they didn't want to let him.
Snowden,Walk and so they went they tried to create a paradigm in which they could go the phone company could do this.
Interviewer,They could give this person's records of what they were doing over to the cops without a warrant and this was called.
Snowden,The third party doctrine the government said that because these records did not belong to the man even though.
Interviewer,There were records about him they belonged to the company because the company created him.
Snowden,That man had no privacy interest in those records therefore he had no fourth amendment protections.
Interviewer,Uh regarding those records well in the decades since the 1970s when you know the court could not have imagined.
Snowden,The world that we live in today that our movements can be tracked by our phones that companies have records of.
Interviewer,Everything about us uh the government has repeatedly leaned on this one.
Snowden,Single outdated court opinion of one guy making scary phone calls to go no one in the country.
Interviewer,No one in the world has a privacy interest in any records that are created about them.
Snowden,But held by a third party if that changes this surveillance ends ends really people won't find a way to.
Interviewer,Get around it i think legally if you recognize that people.
Snowden,Have a a property interest or a privacy interest in information about them that means.
Interviewer,It's no longer the company's records they're your records and so you now are in the.
Snowden,Driver's seat yes amazon could create a record about you with your consent but you control it.
Interviewer,You can revoke it you can destroy it uh and this is what has changed um right now.
Snowden,We have a non-consensual relationship it is premised on the illusion of consent the idea that.
Interviewer,You know you clicked okay to continue um but that doesn't work in any other contract law.
Snowden,Uh sense you know you can't click okay to bind yourself into servitude for the.
Interviewer,Rest of your life you can't click ok to be victimized repeatedly anywhere else except the internet and i.
Snowden,Think as soon as we recognize that this is not proper and is not appropriate.
Interviewer,Um life will be better for all of us because we will have more control over our own destinies and over our own.
Snowden,Stories i confess that i'm a bad example when it comes to what you say about worrying.
Interviewer,About this and that i've been on television since i was in my 20s.
Snowden,Calling businessmen crooks and i figured i had enemies and some of them wanted to get me and so.
Interviewer,I've been very careful and when i got a cancer scare.
Snowden,I wrote a column about it so i figure i have no privacy really and i'm kind of.
Interviewer,Come to terms with that but there ought to be a private sphere where people could go it's a fair point.
Snowden,I i will say there is a difference between you and shall we see the average person because.
Interviewer,Just like we talked about um public officials and private citizens we also have this other category.
Snowden,Public figures um and you aren't nobody you have a platform you have a voice.
Interviewer,You have influence you have friends you have associations you have connections um and more importantly you derive your.
Snowden,Power i think in society uh from sharing that voice and.
Interviewer,Using that voice but not everybody is as clever as you as well spoken as you right uh and has the.
Snowden,The the history um and the skill set that you do and i think recognizing that there are.
Interviewer,Different people in society with different capabilities uh isn't a bad thing it's a good thing.
Snowden,It's okay for someone to say they do not care about this that or the other um but.
Interviewer,The way rights work is it's not for the average person and it's not especially.
Snowden,For the most privileged among us right bill gates doesn't need rights bill gates writes the laws right bill.
Interviewer,Gates could hire his own army um it is rights are for the least among us they are for the.
Snowden,Minorities they are for the strange they're for the exposed they're for the people.
Interviewer,Who stand out and are different rights exist to protect the minority from the.
Snowden,Majority because it is our differences that lead to progress.
Interviewer,And those differences those disagreements uh those new ideas always start out as a.
Snowden,Minority of one and just like a seedling we in uh free societies.
Interviewer,Make an intentional decision to structure our systems our laws to protect and shelter these.
Snowden,Weirdos so that once they have been tested we can benefit from those ideas well i.
Interviewer,Thank you very much for giving us lots of time here thank you very much it's been a pleasure to be with you.
Snowden,Thank you edward snowden stay free  .
Interviewer,There is very little information on private individuals the intelligence services cannot get access to.
Snowden,The reality is this
Interviewer,"Snowden waited to release the documents, hoping Obama would bring change."
Snowden,"Obama's campaign promises and election gave me faith that he would lead us toward fixing the problems he outlined in his quest for votes. Many Americans felt similarly. Unfortunately, shortly after assuming power, he closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantánamo, where men still sit without charge."
Interviewer,He fears that the US will stop at nothing to silence him.
Snowden,"All I can say right now is the US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped."
Interviewer,Snowden is confident he has the public on his side.
Snowden,"If the Obama administration responds with an even harsher hand against me, they can be assured that they'll soon find themselves facing an equally harsh public response."
Interviewer,But he is less impressed with the media response.
Snowden,"Initially I was very encouraged. Unfortunately, the mainstream media now seems far more interested in what I said when I was 17 or what my girlfriend looks like rather than, say, the largest program of suspicionless surveillance in human history."
Interviewer,Encryption offers protection.
Snowden,"Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it."
Interviewer,He isn't too upset about being called a traitor by Dick Cheney.
Snowden,"Being called a traitor by Dick Cheney is the highest honor you can give an American, and the more panicked talk we hear from people like him, Feinstein, and King, the better off we all are. If they had taught a class on how to be the kind of citizen Dick Cheney worries about, I would have finished high school."
Interviewer,And if Snowden had been planning to defect to China he'd be petting a phoenix right now.
Snowden,"The US media has a knee-jerk 'RED CHINA!' reaction to anything involving HK or the PRC, and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct. Ask yourself"
Interviewer,Can you tell us about your interactions with journalists and the press?
Snowden,"One of the most challenging things about the changing nature of the public's relationship to media and the government's relationship to media is that media has never been stronger than it is now. At the same time, the press is less willing to use that sort of power and influence because of its increasing commercialization. There was this tradition that the media culture we had inherited from early broadcasts was intended to be a public service. Increasingly we've lost that, not simply in fact, but in ideal, particularly due to the 24-hour news cycle."
Interviewer,"Let's think about it in terms of your role in changing the world, which is presenting these new facts. There was a section of the technology press and the intelligence press who, at the time of the leaks, said we already know this, except it's hidden in plain sight. Yet, a year after you made the disclosures, there was a broad shift of public perception about surveillance technologies. That may recede, and probably post-Paris, it is receding a little bit. Are you frustrated that there isn't more long-term impact? Do you feel the world has not changed quickly enough?"
Snowden,"I actually don't feel that. I'm really optimistic about how things have gone, and I'm staggered by how much more impact there's been as a result of these revelations than I initially presumed. I'm famous for telling Alan Rusbridger that it would be a three-day story. You're sort of alluding to this idea that people don't really care, or that nothing has really changed. We've heard this in a number of different ways, but I think it actually has changed in a substantial way."
Interviewer,"Former Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson has said her paper definitely made mistakes, ""I wish we had not withheld stories."" What you're saying certainly resonates with what I know and understand of the recent history of the US press, which is that national security concerns post-9/11 really did alter the relationship of reporting, particularly with administration and authority in this country. What we know about drone programs comes from reporting, some of it comes from the story which The Intercept got hold of, and Jeremy Scahill's reporting on it, which has been incredibly important. But a great deal of it has also come from the ground level. The fact that we were aware at all that drones were blowing up villages, killing civilians, crossing borders where they were not supposed to be really comes from people who would report from the ground."
Snowden,"One of the biggest issues is that we have many more publishers competing for a finite, shrinking amount of attention span that's available. This is why we have the rise of these sort of hybrid publications, like a BuzzFeed, that create just an enormous amount of trash and cruft. They're doing AB testing and using scientific principles. Their content is specifically engineered to be more attention getting, even though they have no public value at all. They have no news value at all. Like here's 10 pictures of kittens that are so adorable. But then they develop a news line within the institution, and the idea is that they can drive traffic with this one line of stories, theoretically, and then get people to go over onto the other side."
Interviewer,"Yes, well that's the coming singularity between the creation of journalism and large-scale technology platforms, which are not intrinsically journalistic. In other words, they don't have a primary purpose."
Snowden,"They don't have a journalistic role, it's a reportorial role."
Interviewer,"Well, it's a commercial role, right? So when you came to Glenn and The Guardian, there wasn't a hesitation in knowing the primary role of the organization is to get that story to the outside world as securely and quickly as possible, avoiding prior restraint, protecting a source."
Snowden,I have an unfair advantage.
Interviewer,"You do, but still, that's a big change from 20 years ago."
Snowden,"This is something that we saw contemporary examples of in the public record in 2013. It was the James Rosen case where we saw the Department of Justice, and government more broadly, was abusing its powers to demand blanket records of email and call data, and the AP case where phone records for calls that were made from the bureaus of journalism were seized."
Interviewer,"Right, but that's kind of what happened with the reporting of the story."
Snowden,"And in ways that I didn't even predict, because who could imagine the way a story like that would actually get out of hand and go even further"
Interviewer,"You're actually giving a sophisticated analysis of much of what's happened to both reporting practice and media structures. As you say, you had no prior interactions with journalists. I think one of the reasons the press warmed to you was because you put faith in journalists, weirdly. You went in thinking I think I can trust these people, not just with your life, but with a huge responsibility. Then you spent an enormous amount of time, particularly with Glenn, Laura, and Ewen  in those hotel rooms. What was that reverse frisking process like as you were getting to know them? My experience is as people get closer to the press, they often like it less. Why would you trust journalists?"
Snowden,"This gets into the larger question-how did you feel about journalists, what was the process of becoming acquainted with them? There's both a political response and a practical response. Specifically about Glenn, I believe very strongly that there's no more important quality for a journalist than independence. That's independence of perspective, and particularly skepticism of claims. The more powerful the institution, the more skeptical one should be. There's an argument that was put forth by an earlier journalist, I.F. Stone"
Interviewer,"I hope they're not using Microsoft Office, but you never know."
Snowden,They have the blank page ....
Interviewer,"They have the blank page, exactly."
Snowden,"In their content management system, or whatever. How is that individual going to approach this collection of facts in the next week, in the next month, in the next year, in the next decade? What will the professor in the journalism school say in their lecture that will impart these values, again, sort of memetically into the next cohort of reporters? If we do not win on that, we have lost comprehensively. More fundamentally, people say, why did you trust the press, given their failures? Given the fact that I was, in fact, quite famous for criticizing the press."
Interviewer,"If they had done their job, you would be at home now."
Snowden,"Yeah, I would still be living quite comfortably in Hawaii."
Interviewer,"Which is not so bad, when you put it that way."
Snowden,"People ask how could you do this, why would you do this? How could you trust a journalist that you knew had no training at all in operational security to keep your identity safe because if they screw up, you're going to jail. The answer was that that was actually what I was expecting. I never expected to make it out of Hawaii. I was going to try my best, but my ultimate goal was simply to get this information back in the hands of the public. I felt that the only way that could be done meaningfully was through the press. If we can't have faith in the press, if we can't sort of take that leap of faith and either be served well by them, or underserved and have the press fail, we've already lost. You cannot have an open society without open communication. Ultimately, the test of open communication is a free press. If they can't look for information, if they can't contest the government's control of information, and ultimately print information-not just about government, but also about corporate interests, that has a deleterious impact on the preferences of power, on the prerogatives of power. You may have something, but I would argue it's not the traditional American democracy that I believed in."
Interviewer,"So nothing you experienced in the room with the team, or what happened after, made you question or reevaluate journalism?"
Snowden,"I didn't say that. Actually working more closely with the journalists has radically reshaped my understanding of journalism, and that continues through to today. I think you would agree that anybody who's worked in the news industry, either directly or even peripherally, has seen journalists-or, more directly, editors-who are terrified, who hold back a story, who don't want to publish a detail, who want to wait for the lawyers, who are concerned with liability."
Interviewer,When did that happen?
Snowden,"This was at the height of public interest, basically. The idea here is that a journalist ultimately, and particularly a certain class of journalist, they don't owe any allegiance to their source, right? They don't write the story in line with what the sources desires, they don't go about their publication schedule to benefit, or to detriment, in theory, the source at all. There are strong arguments that that's the way it should be"
Interviewer,Do you foresee a world where someone won't have to be a whistleblower in order to reveal the kinds of documents that you revealed? What kinds of internal mechanisms would that require on behalf of the government? What would that look like in the future?
Snowden,"That's a really interesting philosophical question. It doesn't come down to technical mechanisms, that comes down to culture. We've seen in the EU a number of reports from parliamentary bodies, from the Council of Europe, that said we need to protect whistleblowers, in particular national security whistleblowers. In the national context no country really wants to pass a law that allows individuals rightly, or wrongly, to embarrass the government. But can we provide an international framework for this? One would argue, particularly when espionage laws are being used to prosecute people, they already exist. That's why espionage, for example, is considered a political offense, because it's just a political crime, as they say. That's a fairly weak defense, or fairly weak justification, for not reforming whistleblower laws. Particularly when, throughout Western Europe they're going, yeah, we like this guy, he did a good thing. But if he shows up on the doorstep we're going to ship him back immediately, regardless of whether it's unlawful, just because the US is going to retaliate against us. It's extraordinary that the top members of German government have said this on the record-that it's realpolitik; it's about power, rather than principle."
Interviewer,"But Ed, when you talk about this in those terms, you make it sound as though you see this as a progression. Certainly there was a sharp increase, as you demonstrated, in overreach of oversight post-9/11. Is it a continuum?"
Snowden,"I don't think they are actually contradictory views to hold. I think what we're talking about are the natural inclinations of power and vice, what we can do to restrain it, to maintain a free society. So when we think about where things have gone in the USA Freedom Act, and when we look back at the 1970s, it was even worse in terms of the level of comfort that the government had that it could engage in abuses and get away with them. One of the most important legacies of 2013 is not anything that was necessarily published, but it was the impact of the publication on the culture of government. It was a confirmation coming quite quickly in the wake of the WikiLeaks stories, which were equally important in this regard. That said, secrecy will not hold forever. If you authorize a policy that is clearly contrary to law, you will eventually have to explain that."
Interviewer,What do you think about the relationship between governments asking Facebook and other communications platforms to help fight ISIS?
Snowden,"Should we basically deputize companies to become the policy enforcers of the world? When you put it in that context suddenly it becomes clear that this is not really a good idea, particularly because terrorism does not have a strong definition that's internationally recognized. If Facebook says, we will take down any post from anybody who the government says is a terrorist, as long as it comes from this government, suddenly they have to do that for the other government. The Chinese allegations of who is and who is not a terrorist are going to look radically different than what the FBI's are going to be. But if the companies try to be selective about them, say, well, we're only going to do this for one government, they immediately lose access to the markets of the other ones. So that doesn't work, and that's not a position companies want to be in."
Interviewer,And what are some of the positions you held previously within the intelligence community?
Snowden,"I've been a systems engineer, systems administrator, senior advisor for the Central Intelligence Agency, solutions consultant, and a telecommunications."
Interviewer,"One of the things people are going to be most interested in, in trying to understand what who you are and what you're thinking is, there came some point in time when you crossed this line of thinking about being a whistleblower, to making the choice to actually become a whistleblower. Walk people through that decision making process."
Snowden,"When you're in positions of privileged access, like a systems administrator for the sort of intelligence community agencies, you're exposed to a lot more information on a broader scale than the average employee, and because of that, you see things that maybe disturbing, but over the course of a normal person's career, you'd only see one or two of these instances. When you see everything, you see them on a more frequent basis, and you recognize that some of these things are actually abuses, and when you talk to people about them, in a place like this, where this is the normal state of business, people tend not to take them very seriously, and you know, move on from them. But over time, that awareness of the wrong-doing sort of builds up, and you feel compelled to talk about it, and the more you talk about it, the more you're ignored, the more you're told it's not a problem, until eventually you realize that these things need to be determined by the public, not by somebody who was simply hired by the government."
Interviewer,"Talk a little bit about how the American surveillance state actually functions, and does it target the actions of Americans."
Snowden,"NSA and the intelligence community in general is focused on getting intelligence where ever it can, by any means possible. It believes, on the grounds of, sort of, a self-certification that they serve the national interests. Originally we saw that focus very narrowly tailored, as foreign intelligence gathered over seas. Now increasingly we see that it's happening domestically. And to do that, they, the NSA specifically, targets the communications of everyone. It ingests them by default, it collects them in a system and it filters them and it analyzes them and it measures them and it stores them, for periods of time, simply because that's the easiest most efficient and most valuable way to achieve these ends. So while they may be intending to target someone with an association with a foreign government, or someone they suspect of terrorism, they're collecting your communications to do so. Any analyst, at any time, can target anyone; any selector, anywhere. Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of the sensor networks, and the authorities that that analyst is empowered with. Not all analysts have the ability to target everything, but I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President, if I had a personal email."
Interviewer,"One of the extraordinary parts about this episode is that usually whistleblowers do what they do anonymously, take steps to remain anonymous for as long as they can which, they hope often, is forever. You on the other hand have decided to do the opposite, which is, to declare yourself openly as the person behind these disclosures. Why did you choose to do that?"
Snowden,"I think that the public is owed an explanation of the motivations behind the people who make these disclosures that are outside of the democratic model. When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to a democracy. And if you do that in secret consistently, as the government does when it wants to benefit from that secret action that it took, it'll kind of give it's official mandate to go, Hey, tell the press about this thing and that thing so the public is on our side, but they rarely, if ever, do that when an abuse occurs. That falls to individual citizens, but they're typically maligned, it becomes a thing of these people are against the country or against the government, but I'm not. I'm not different from anybody elseI don't have special skills. I'm just another guy who sits there, day to day, in the office and watches what's happening and goes, 'This is something that's not our place to decide. The public needs to decide whether these policies are right or wrong.' And I'm wiling to go on the record to defend the authenticity of them and say 'I didn't change these, I didn't modify the story. This is the truth, this is what's happening, you should decide whether we need to doing this.'."
Interviewer,"Have you given thought to what the US government's response to your conduct is, in terms of of what they might say about you, how they might try to depict you, what they might try to do to you?"
Snowden,"Yeah. I could be rendered by the CIA, I could have people come after me, or any of their third party partners, you know. They work closely with a number of other nations. Or, you know, they could pay off the Triads, or any, any of their agents or assets. We've got a CIA station just up the road in the consulate here in Hong Kong, and I'm sure they're going to be very busy for the next week. And that's a fear I'll live under for the rest of my life, however long that happens to be. You can't come forward against the world's most powerful intelligence agencies and be completely free from risk because they're such powerful adversaries that no one can meaningfully oppose them. If they want to get you, they'll get you in time. But, at the same time, you have to make a determination about what it is that's important to you, and if living unfreely but comfortably is something you're willing to acceptand I think many of us are, it's human natureyou can get up everyday, you can to go to work, you can collect your large paycheck, for relatively little work, against the public interest, and go to sleep at night after watching your shows. But, if you realize that that's the world you helped create, and it's going to get worse with the next generation and the next generation, who extend the capabilities of this sort of architecture of oppression, you realize that you might be willing to accept any risk, and it doesn't matter what the outcome is so long as the public gets to make their own decision about how that's applied."
Interviewer,Why should people care about surveillance?
Snowden,"Because even if you're not doing anything wrong, you're being watched and recorded. And the storage capability of these systems increases every year, consistently, by orders of magnitude. It's getting to the point where you don't have to have done anything wrong, you just eventually have to fall under suspicion from somebody, even if it's by a wrong call, and then they can use the system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision you've ever made, every friend you've ever discussed something with, and attack you on that basis to sort of derive suspicion from an innocent life and paint anyone in the context of a wrong-doer."
Interviewer,"We are currently sitting in a room in Hong Kong, which is where we are because you traveled here. Talk a little bit about why it is that you came here and, specifically, there are going to be people who will speculate that you intend to defect to the country that many see as the number one rival to the United States, which is China, and what you're really doing is essentially seeking to aid an enemy of the United States with which you intend to seek asylum. Can you talk a little bit about that?"
Snowden,"Sure. So there are a couple of assertions in those arguments that are sort of embedded in the questioning of the choice of Hong Kong. The first is that China is an enemy of the United States. It's not. I mean, there are conflicts between the United States government and the Chinese PRC government, but the peoples, inherently, we don't care, we trade with each other freely, we're not at war, we're not in armed conflict, and we're not trying to be we're the largest trading partners out there for each other. Additionally, Hong Kong has a strong tradition of free speech. People think, 'Oh, great China firewall.' Mainland China does have significant restrictions on free speech, but the people of Hong Kong have a long tradition of protesting in the streets, of making their views known; the internet is not filtered here, no more so than any Western government, and I believe that the Hong Kong government is actually independent in relation to a lot of leading Western governments."
Interviewer,"If your motive had been to harm the US and help its enemies, or if your motive had been personal material gain, were there things you could have done with these documents to advance those goals that you didn't end up doing?"
Snowden,"Oh, absolutely. Anybody in the position of access with the technical capabilities that I had could, you know, suck out secrets, pass them on the open market to Russia they always have an open door, as we do. I had access to the whole roster of everyone at the NSA, the entire intelligence community, and undercover assets all around the world, the locations of every station that we have, what their missions are, and so forth. If I had just wanted to harm the US, you could shut down the surveillance system in an afternoon. And I think for anyone making that argument, they need to think, if they were in my positionand you know, you live a privileged life, you're living in Hawaii, in paradise and making a ton of moneywhat would it take to make you leave everything behind? The greatest fear that I have regarding the outcome, for America, of these disclosures is that nothing will change. People will see in the media all of these disclosures, they'll see the lengths the government's going to to grant themselves powers unilaterally to create greater control over American society and global society, but they won't be willing to take the risks necessary to stand up and fight to change things, to force their representatives to actually take a stand in their interests. And the months ahead, the years ahead, it's only going to get worse until, eventually, there will be a time when policies will change, because the only thing that restricts the activities of the surveillance state is policy. Even our agreements with foreign governments, we consider that to be a stipulation of policy rather than a stipulation of law. And, because of that, a new leader will be elected, they'll flip the switch, say that because of the crisis, because of the dangers that we face in the worldsome new and unpredicted threat we need more authority, we need more power. And there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it and it will be turnkey tyranny."
Interviewer,What are some operational security practices you think everyone should adopt? Just useful stuff for average people.
Snowden,"Opsec is important even if you're not worried about the NSA. Because when you think about who the victims of surveillance are, on a day-to-day basis, you're thinking about people who are in abusive spousal relationships, you're thinking about people who are concerned about stalkers, you're thinking about children who are concerned about their parents overhearing things. It's to reclaim a level of privacy."
Interviewer,"What do you think about Tor? Do you think that everyone should be familiar with it, or do you think that it's only a use-it-if-you-need-it thing?"
Snowden,I think Tor is the most important privacy-enhancing technology project being used today. I use Tor personally all the time. We know it works from at least one anecdotal case that's fairly familiar to most people at this point. That's not to say that Tor is bulletproof. What Tor does is it provides a measure of security and allows you to disassociate your physical location. ....
Interviewer,"So that is all stuff that everybody should be doing. What about people who have exceptional threat models, like future intelligence-community whistleblowers, and other people who have nation-state adversaries? Maybe journalists, in some cases, or activists, or people like that?"
Snowden,So the first answer is that you can't learn this from a single article. The needs of every individual in a high-risk environment are different. And the capabilities of the adversary are constantly improving. The tooling changes as well.
Interviewer,"What about for people who are, like, in a repressive regime and are trying to ...."
Snowden,Use Tor.
Interviewer,Use Tor?
Snowden,"If you're not using Tor you're doing it wrong. Now, there is a counterpoint here where the use of privacy-enhancing technologies in certain areas can actually single you out for additional surveillance through the exercise of repressive measures. This is why it's so critical for developers who are working on security-enhancing tools to not make their protocols stand out."
Interviewer,"So you mentioned that what you want to spread are the principles of operational security. And you mentioned some of them, like need-to-know, compartmentalization. Can you talk more about what are the principles of operating securely?"
Snowden,"Almost every principle of operating security is to think about vulnerability. Think about what the risks of compromise are and how to mitigate them. In every step, in every action, in every point involved, in every point of decision, you have to stop and reflect and think, ""What would be the impact if my adversary were aware of my activities?"" If that impact is something that's not survivable, either you have to change or refrain from that activity, you have to mitigate that through some kind of tools or system to protect the information and reduce the risk of compromise, or ultimately, you have to accept the risk of discovery and have a plan to mitigate the response. Because sometimes you can't always keep something secret, but you can plan your response."
Interviewer,Are there principles of operational security that you think would be applicable to everyday life?
Snowden,"Yes, that's selective sharing. Everybody doesn't need to know everything about us. Your friend doesn't need to know what pharmacy you go to. Facebook doesn't need to know your password security questions. You don't need to have your mother's maiden name on your Facebook page, if that's what you use for recovering your password on Gmail. The idea here is that sharing is OK, but it should always be voluntary. It should be thoughtful, it should be things that are mutually beneficial to people that you're sharing with, and these aren't things that are simply taken from you."
Interviewer,Do you think people should use adblock software?
Snowden,"Yes. There's disk encryption attacks like evil maid attacks, and cold-boot attacks. There's all sorts of firmware attacks. There's BadUSB and BadBIOS, and baseband attacks on cellphones. All of these are probably unlikely to happen to many people very often. Is this something people should be concerned about? How do you go about deciding if you personally should be concerned about this sort of attack and try to defend against it?"
Interviewer,What sort of security tools are you currently excited about? What are you finding interesting?
Snowden,"I'll just namecheck Qubes here, just because it's interesting. I'm really excited about Qubes because the idea of VM-separating machines, requiring expensive, costly sandbox escapes to get persistence on a machine, is a big step up in terms of burdening the attacker with greater resource and sophistication requirements for maintaining a compromise. I'd love to see them continue this project. I'd love to see them make it more accessible and much more secure.."
Interviewer,People use smartphones a lot. What do you think about using a smartphone for secure communications?
Snowden,"Something that people forget about cellphones in general, of any type, is that you're leaving a permanent record of all of your physical locations as you move around. ... The problem with cellphones is they're basically always talking about you, even when you're not using them. That's not to say that everyone should burn their cellphones ... but you have to think about the context for your usage. Are you carrying a device that, by virtue of simply having it on your person, places you in a historic record in a place that you don't want to be associated with, even if it's something as simple as your place of worship?"
Interviewer,There are tons of software developers out there that would love to figure out how to end mass surveillance. What should they be doing with their time?
Snowden,"Mixed routing is one of the most important things that we need in terms of regular infrastructure because we haven't solved the problem of how to divorce the content of communication from the fact that it has occurred at all. To have real privacy you have to have both. Not just what you talked to your mother about, but the fact that you talked to your mother at all. ...."
Interviewer,"Ideally, governments around the world shouldn't be spying on everybody. But that's not really the case, so where do you think, what do you think the way to solve this problem is? Do you think it's all just encrypting everything, or do you think that trying to get Congress to pass new laws and trying to do policy stuff is equally as important? Where do you think the balance is between tech and policy to combat mass surveillance? And what do you think that Congress should do, or that people should be urging Congress to do?"
Snowden,"I think reform comes with many faces. There's legal reform, there's statutory reform more generally, there are the products and outcomes of judicial decisions. ... In the United States it has been held that these programs of mass surveillance, which were implemented secretly without the knowledge or the consent of the public, violate our rights, that they went too far, that they should end. And they have been modified or changed as a result. But there are many other programs, and many other countries, where these reforms have not yet had the impact that is so vital to free society. And in these contexts, in these situations, I believe that we do, as a community, as an open society, whether we're talking about ordinary citizens or the technological community specifically, we have to look for ways of enforcing human rights through any means."
Interviewer,"On a different note, people said I should ask about Twitter, how long have you had a Twitter account for?"
Snowden,Two weeks.
Interviewer,How many followers do you have?
Snowden,"A million and a half, I think."
Interviewer,That's a lot of followers. How are you liking being a Twitter user so far?
Snowden,I'm trying very hard not to mess up.
Interviewer,"You've been tweeting a lot lately, including in the middle of the night Moscow time."
Snowden,"Ha. I make no secret about the fact that I live on Eastern Standard Time. The majority of my work and associations, my political activism, still occurs in my home, in the United States. So it only really make sense that I work on the same hours."
Interviewer,Do you feel like Twitter is sucking away all your time? I mean I kind of have Twitter open all day long and I sometimes get sucked into flame wars. How is it affecting you?
Snowden,"There were a few days when people kept tweeting cats for almost an entire day. And I know I shouldn't, I have a lot of work to do, but I just couldn't stop looking at them."
Interviewer,"The real question is, what was your Twitter handle before this? Because you were obviously on Twitter. You know all the ins and outs."
Snowden,I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of other Twitter accounts.
Interviewer,"Now you said in the book you wish you had a strategy in terms of a what's next plan once you released those documents. You sit here six years later, in exile in Moscow where you say you don't want to be , was it worth it?"
Snowden,"It was. I mean when we look at all of these complexities and all of the consequences that we have as a result of any of the decisions that we go through in our lives. I think we realize that, look we see chances, opportunities in life when we get the chance to do something. And right now, in 2019, it's hard to look at the world and think nothing needs to change. But nothing changes just if we believe in something, we have to actually be willing to risk something. We have to actually be willing to stand for something."
Interviewer,"But you took an oath to the Constitution, Edward. You took an oath not to betray the country. You know the CIA has what you call an orientation, and indoctrination program, where they have a parade of horribles. And now you are on the list of parade of horribles, your picture is there."
Snowden,"Probably, yes, but that is actually an important point. I was required to swear into oath when I entered into duty in the CIA. It is a very solemn thing. You are in a darkened room in front of a flag, everyone else is there. But it is important to notice that we did not say an oath of secrecy. One of the common misconceptions in one of the earlier attacks, that we heard in 2015, that we don't hear of so much anymore is that I violated this oath of secrecy. That does not exist. There is a secrecy agreement, but there is also an oath of service. An oath of service is to support and defend, not an agency, not even the president, it is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies , direct quote , foreign and domestic. And this begs the question, what happens when our obligations come into conflict, right? What happens when you have a secrecy agreement, but you have also witnessed your own government, your own agency, your workplace, violating the rights of Americans, and people around the world on a massive scale."
Interviewer,"Edward, this is a very personal book, Mr. Snowden. And as you've pointed out, growing up in the intelligence community, and your parents were in government. It wasn't easy for you to become personal here. But, I am curious, since you grew up in a community where almost everyone was somehow connected to government service, many of them FBI, did you approach your family at all about this? How did they react to it when you went through this process and how do they feel about it now?"
Snowden,"This was actually one of the hardest parts of coming forward, was that I couldn't talk to anyone about it. Because this is the bizarre sort of circumstance is the way that our laws are currently structured. In 2013, I was a contractor working for the NSA through a private company. I worked in the NSA facility, I had an NSA boss, I was working at NSA systems, doing NSA tasks. But, formally, just on paper, I worked for a private company. Now these contractors weren't covered by whistleblower protection laws. If I had tried to talk to a judge, a priest, a congressman, it would've been the same felony. If I talked to my family, it would've been the same felony. And of course, if I talked to a journalist, they considered telling the truth about talking about the government breaking the law is in itself a crime. And so, I couldn't tell anyone. I couldn't tell the love of my life, who is a central figure in this story, Lindsay Mills, my long time partner. Because if I had, the FBI could have charged her, as a part of the conspiracy. They could have charged her as sort of an accessory to the crime, so long as she didn't immediately after hearing from me, you know I'm thinking about talking about journalists, picked up the phone and said help, help, someone is going to talk to the press. And so that made it a very isolating experience."
Interviewer,"Edward, your formal employer at the NSA said they couldn't comment on your book because ongoing investigation. But, they did give us the following statement:Edward Snowden violated his life time obligation to protect classified information and betrayed the trust of his coworkers and the American people. Edward, do you acknowledge that you broke the law and that there are many people in this country that see your actions as traitorous?"
Snowden,"Well, I won't take a position on whether or not I broke the law because that's one for the lawyers. But what I will say is this. You know, it's not hard to make the argument that I broke the law, and I think that's actually the less interesting question. It's funny that whenever the government comes after me they say, you know, these disclosures cause harm. But they never justify the harm, they never show evidence for it. Even though, we are now more than six years on, it would be the easiest thing to show."
Interviewer,"To be fair, sorry to break in there. But on the question of harm. I don't know that you're, forgive me, but how are in a position to judge the harm in your disclosures. Isn't that something that the intelligence community would be uniquely situated to gauge."
Snowden,"Well, I would argue, that I worked for the US intelligence agency for a long time. I am the only one who knows the actually documents that the journalists have, and the ones that they published. We all know, and so it's available to all of us to assess the harms. And again, if they had some classified information. If they had some classified evidence that a hair on a single person's head was harmed, you know as well as I do, it would be on the front page of The New York Times by the end of the day. Because, leaking is not something that only happens to the people that are working to inform the press that are doing. It is also what the government does to sort of backstop their positions. They are authorized leaks, that happen all the time. That are not public interest whistleblowing, right. But back to that question of did I break the law. Again, what's the question that's more important here? Was the law broken or was that the right thing to do? If you look back at the history of the United States, it doesn't take very long for the average person to think about a moment in which it was absolutely illegal to do something. But at the same time, it was absolutely the same thing to do."
Interviewer,"You're living in Russia and have for some time now. As you've pointed out it's not where you want to be, it's where you're forced to be. Have the Russians ever asked for any information from you?"
Snowden,"This is actually a big scene in the book as soon as I landed. And for the audience that might be less familiar with the story, it was never my intention to be in Russia. I was actually transiting en route to Latin America. The United States government, for some reason , we don't know if it was intentionally to create kind of an evergreen political attack against me, guilt by association to be able to point to the Russian government , or they simply panicked when they saw that I might be, what they considered, escaping. They canceled my passport. When I landed, I could no longer travel. So I get pulled out of passport control and brought into a room. And yes! Directly. The Russian intelligence service was like, do you want to cooperate? Do you have any information? Life is going to be very hard if you don't have anyone on your side. And I said look, that's not how this is going to be. That is not how this is going to work. I do not have any information. You can search my bag if you want, because I destroyed my information before I got on the plane. I think that was probably what they expected, because remember, there's about 4,000 journalists downstairs looking for me in this airport at this moment. I'm on every tv channel, I'm on every newspaper. And I was just trying to continue on my journey into asylum. The reason that you know this actually happened, because you might be skeptical, you might think, Oh, well the Russians are just going to let this guy go. Russia has, uh, shall we say, a problematic human rights record, at a minimum. That's if we're being generous. When we look at the opportunities they have to do the right thing on the international stage, it seems pretty few and far between. But here's a circumstance when they don't have to do anything to do the right thing. All they have to do is not hand me over. Even despite the fact that Russia was, probably, the hardest place in the world for the CIA to operate. I didn't go, alright, this is great, let me out of the airport. I was stuck in that airport for 40 days."
Interviewer,"Do you have concerns, Edward, that."
Snowden,27 countries in the world.
Interviewer,"Russia is monitoring your actions today? Do you have concerns that they're gathering intelligence on you? Because the optics, as we sit here in America, looking at you in Russia, you know, the optics are not good."
Snowden,"No, you're absolutely right. You and I are on the same side on this issue."
Interviewer,"Then why don't you come home, Mr. Snowden?"
Snowden,"One of the big topics in Europe right now is should Germany and France invite me in to get asylum, that's how they're handling the response to this new book. But when you look at that kind of thing, of course it's problematic. Of course I would like to return to the United States. That is the ultimate goal. But if I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison, then one bottom line demand that we all have to agree to is at least I get a fair trial. That is the one thing the government has refused to guarantee because they won't provide me access to what's called a public interest defense."
Interviewer,"But Mr. Snowden, in all due respect."
Snowden,Go ahead.
Interviewer,"Mr. Snowden, in all due respect, criminals and alleged criminals barely get to decide the terms of their trial. They broke the law and they face the consequences. What makes you different?"
Snowden,"Well I'm not different. Again, I'm not asking for a parade. I'm not asking for a pardon. I'm not asking for a pass. What I'm asking for is a fair trial. And this is the bottom line that any American should require. We don't want people thrown in prison without the jury being able to decide that what they did was right or wrong. The government wants to have a different kind of trial. They want to use special procedures. They want to be able to close the court room. They want the public not to be able to know what's going on. And essentially, the most important fact to the government, and this is the thing we have a point of contention on, is that they do not want the jury to be able to consider the motivations , why I did what I did. Was it better for the United States? Did it benefit us? Or did it cause harm? They don't want the jury to be able to consider that at all. They want the jury strictly to consider whether these actions were lawful or unlawful not whether they were right or wrong. I'm sorry but that defeats the purpose of a jury trial."
Interviewer,"You were able to steal 1.5 million documents which is an astounding number, do you think that could be done today?"
Snowden,First off that's not correct (laughs). That's the government's number. And all of the journalists that have been handling this archive for years have said that's not accurate.
Interviewer,What is the number?
Snowden,I think that's especially troubling.
Interviewer,"Yeah, what is the number?"
Snowden,"Well, you're asking a privacy advocate for private information. Of course that's not going to go very well. But good try. What I will say is this:I gathered a lot of information about what I believed was evidence of criminal activity on the part of the United States government's unconstitutional programs. And simply, things that were problematic, that were ethically questionable. And I provided these to journalists. And this is critical here, the number of documents that I published is zero. So when the government says 'I caused harm' what do they mean by that? What they mean is the press, having access to things the government didn't want the public to know, decided and made an institutional judgement and these are some of the most trusted institutions in journalism, like The Washington Post. And these guys said the public has a right to know this, and I required them as a condition , these journalists , as a condition of access to this archive of material, to make an agreement that they'd publish no story simply because it was interesting, no story simply because it was newsworthy. They could only publish stories they said were in the public interest to know. And as an extraordinary measure on top of this, to sort of reconstruct the system of checks and balances that have failed internally in government between the executive and legislative and judicial branches, the journalists would then in advance of publication, warn the government about the story they were about to break. They would give the government an adversarial stage in the process and argue against this, saying you guys don't understand this, or Snowden's a liar, or these documents are fake, or even if it's absolutely right, somebody will be hurt as a result of this, and so they could always make these arguments in the publication process. As far as I understand, this process was followed for all the publications. And that is why I am so confident now, in 2019, that despite the evergreen sort-of allegations of government, whenever any whistleblower comes up, they say, it causes harm, it causes harm, it causes harm, we have never seen any evidence of that. And just one last point on that , because I think it is especially critical. Just remember the history of this , we have always seen that in this country. When the country , not the country. When the government is embarrassed after being caught breaking the law, they say the people who revealed that lawbreaking have caused serious harm to national security. This was the case of Daniel Ellsberg way back in the Vietnam War with the Pentagon Papers which was the classified history of the government's role in Vietnam. Now Ellsberg."
Interviewer,Alright.
Snowden,when Ellsberg revealed this they said he was the most dangerous man.
Interviewer,We can't go back into that history.
Snowden,"No, no, no, we are not going back."
Interviewer,Wrap it up.
Snowden,It's just a central point.
Interviewer,Yes you are.
Snowden,"It's just a central principle here. What harms the country? Is it a war built on lies? Or is it the revelation of those lies? Is it the construction of a system of mass surveillance that violates our rights? Or is it the revelation of that by the newspapers that we trust? If we can't trust newspapers, if we can't agree on the basic facts and then have a discussion, about whether this was right or wrong, not what's lawful or unlawful, we're losing our position as a democracy and as a government that is controlled by the people, rather than people that are controlled by the government."
Interviewer,"Alright Edward Snowden, it's interesting you said newspapers released it, but you gave the information to the newspapers to release, minor detail there. We thank you very much for taking."
Snowden,Absolutely.
Interviewer,We thank you for taking the time.
Snowden,Absolutely.
Interviewer,The story's not over. Thank you.
Snowden,You're very professional.
Interviewer,"Well, you know, people are like, ""How do you live?"" and things like that. They might be taking money from the Russians. Of course, the answer's no, but I do this for a living. I speak. I don't have a YouTube channel where I'm Joe Rogan, but I give speeches at universities and things like that. I do a lot of interviews, so I've got my own setup."
Snowden,"We're recording now, right? Is it possible that you could do a YouTube channel? Would that work?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, if you introduced me so like I get followers, yeah, we could do that."
Snowden,Dude! I'm all in! That could absolutely happen. Do you want to do that? Is that something you want to do?
Interviewer,"No, I mean this is a big question. I came on because I had just written a book called Permanent Record, which is the story of my life because that's what publishers make you do when you're writing your first book, but it's more than that because I didn't just want to talk about me. It's actually about the changing of technology and the changing of government in this sort of post 9/11 era, which our generation just sort of happened to be growing up during."
Snowden,"was at the CIA and the NSA all this stuff, but the day that the book came out, the government hit me with a lawsuit, and they hit the publisher of the books with a lawsuit because they don't want to see books like this get written. They especially don't want to see books like this get read, so the big thing was, we didn't know where this was going. We didn't know what was going to happen and my publisher, of course, wanted me very badly to let people know this book existed in case the government leaned harder and harder and harder. We didn't know where that's going."
Interviewer,"e government is still pursuing that case quite strongly. They're more focused on the financial censorship side of it, basically taking any money that I made from it, kind of as a warning to the others and getting a legal judgment against the publisher, saying you can't pay this guy, that kind of thing, more so than taking the book off the shelves, but that's not because they're okay with the book being on the shelves. It's because, thankfully, we've got the First Amendment, so they can't. That's a very rare and good thing."
Snowden,"yway, in the context of that, they were like, ""Well, what about Joe Rogan?"" I'd heard about you at this point, but the only thing that I had really seen that I really understood, had familiarity with, was you talking to Bernie Sanders which, by the way, I very much appreciated hearing then because a lot of people don't give the guy time to talk."
Interviewer,"ah. To hear him in those soundbites, you don't really get an understanding of who he actually is."
Snowden,"ght, and this is the other thing. They're like, well, you can go on all these major network shows, and I did a couple of them. I did a morning show, I did Brian Williams but, broadly, the media, the sort of more corporatized media, as we might say, is exactly what you just described, right? They want you to be able to answer in like eight, 15 seconds, or less. When we're talking about big, massive shifts in society, when we're talking about power, when we're talking about technology and how it controls and influences us in the future, you can't have a meaningful conversation within those constraints."
Interviewer,"Instead, these guys all want to say, repeat these long discredited sort of criticisms. I'm sure you'll ask the same thing, and that's okay. They're fair questions, but it's like we can't have the conversation if we can't have the space to think and breathe and have this sort of discussion. Anyway, they mentioned you, and I was like, ""Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan. Where do I know this name from before Bernie Sanders?"" I looked back through my Twitter mentions, and the funny thing is, your fans have been harassing me to death for like the last year. Wonderful people. Wonderful people. ""Go on Joe Rogan! Go on Joe Rogan!""."
Snowden,"I remember after I had just made a Twitter account. Neil deGrasse Tyson actually helped me get on Twitter, gave me that little initial boost. They said Joe Rogan, so they linked you, and I mouse over your name because I use a desktop and not mobile for this because of security reasons, and it pops up and I get your avatar, man. I have to say, your logo is the worst thing in the world for people who are trying to be politically serious, and they're worried about the National Security Advisor condemning them because this bald guy with this maniacal grin and like the third eye on his forehead, and I'm like, ""Oh, man, that show!"" That doesn't look good, but it's actually when you watch what you do, it's great stuff, man."
Interviewer,"It's great, but that first impression, this almost didn't happen, but everybody who has talked to you, everybody who watches your show, I think they get a very different impression than how you're painted. For me, it's a wonderful thing because nobody understands that better than I do. The government ran a smear campaign against me endlessly for six months when I came forward in June of 2013. I know we got way off topic here. I'll get back to it."
Snowden,Fun! There's no such thing as off topic. We could talk about whatever.
Interviewer,"Great. Okay, so for those people, first off, who have no idea who the hell I am, I'm the guy who was behind the revelations of global mass surveillance in 2013. I worked for the CIA. I worked for the NSA as a contractor at the NSA, staff officer at the CIA. I was under cover working at embassies. I talk about the difference between this and a book and contractor and government official and how it's all sort of lost its meaning, but I saw something wrong, and I saw basically the government was violating the law and what I believe to be the Constitution of the United States and, more broadly, human rights for everyone in the United States and around the world."
Snowden,"There were domestic surveillance programs. There were mass surveillance programs that worked internationally. Basically, everything that they could monitor, they were monitoring, and this is actually like, people go, ""Well, isn't that obvious? Isn't that what they're supposed to do?"" This is weird, but the answer actually is no. Under the framework of our constitution, the government is only supposed to be monitoring people that it has an individualized, particularized suspicion of wrongdoing. We think about this in the investigative means, right?"
Interviewer,"All those TV shows where they go and get a warrant, the reason they have to do that, like we fought a revolution over this a couple of hundred years back, is the idea that, when we had kings, when we had governments with absolute power, they could simply go in your home and go, ""Is this guy a pot smoker?"", get his diary, whatever it is and, if you find evidence of a crime, you march him off to prison and it's all good. You found evidence they're a criminal or you didn't find evidence. Well, no harm, no foul. You're just doing what government does."
Snowden,"We were trying to build a better system where, ""Yes, the government has extraordinary capabilities, but it only uses them where they're necessary, where they're proportionate to the threat that is presented by this person. We shouldn't be afraid of the person who's got a baggie of weed in their dresser or something like that. That is not a threat to national security. That is not a threat to public safety."
Interviewer,"What happened in the wake of 9/11 was a whole bunch of government officials got together behind closed doors, and this was actually led, interestingly enough, by the Vice President of the United States, Cheney. Everybody remembers that name or, hopefully, can look that name up, Dick Cheney, and his personal attorney, sort of the Giuliani of Dick Cheney, a guy named David Addington."
Snowden,"This lawyer, David Addington, wrote a secret legal interpretation that no one else was allowed to see. It was kept in the Vice President's safe at the White House. They weren't giving this... Even when they told people, and it was just a couple of people in Congress... Nancy Pelosi was one of them and a couple of these other folks. When they talked to the heads of the agency at the NSA and the CIA and the FBI and all this stuff, they told them, the White House and the Office of Legal Counsel and the president's attorneys. All of these guys had decided this would be legal to do, but we can't tell you why, we can't show you the legal authorization for it. You just got to take our word for it, so they did this."
Interviewer,"This became a mass surveillance program called Stellar Wind, which they said was supposed to monitor the phone calls and internet communications, emails and things like that of everybody in the United States and around the world who they could get access to for links to Al-Qaeda because, if you remember in the wake of the September 11th attacks, they were saying, ""We thought there could be sleeper cells of Al-Qaeda."" They were just peppered all throughout the country, and they were going to spring up at any moment. Of course, like weapons of mass destruction, it just didn't exist. It was all a power grab."
Snowden,"On that basis, they started doing this in secret, and it was completely unconstitutional. It was completely illegal, even under the very loose requirements of the Patriot Act, but they did it for so long that they got comfortable with it, and they thought, ""You know, this is a really powerful capability. What if we started using this for stuff that was other than terrorism?"" because it wasn't finding any terrorists because there weren't any terrorists in this context that they were looking for them."
Interviewer,"The ones where there were terrorists, the program wasn't effective because these were guys in Pakistan that weren't using email and phone calls. They were getting on a moped with their cousin who was a courier who was bringing a letter to his guy who runs the food stand or whatever. Bit by bit, over time, this grew and grew and grew, and there were scandals. If you want to drill down on these later, I'll go into them, but what happened was, step by step by step, our constitutional rights were changed, and we weren't allowed to know it. We were never granted a vote on it, and even the many members of Congress, 535 in the United States, they were prohibited from knowing this. Instead, they told only a few select people."
Snowden,"In the original case, there were only eight members of Congress, called the Gang of Eight, who knew about this. Then, there were the people on the Intelligence Committees, both in the Senate and the House, who were told about this, but they were only told partially about it. They weren't told the full scope of it. Now that they had been told about it because they had security clearances and things like that, they weren't allowed to tell anybody else, even if they objected to it."
Interviewer,"We had one senator, Ron Wyden, and another one, Tom Udall was the name of him, who did object to this and who wanted something to happen but, because they couldn't tell anybody that it was happening, they were sort of doing these weird Lassie barks to the press where they were like, ""We have grave concerns about the way these programs are being carried out,"" but nobody knew what they were talking about. Journalists were like, ""You know they've got concerns. What is that, Lassie? What are you trying to say?"" Timmy's said, ""Well,"" but they were getting it wrong. They couldn't tell what was happening, so what had happened was that we, the American people, had sort of lost our seat at the table of government."
Snowden,"We were no longer partnered to government. We had simply become subject to government, and I think everybody who's in the world today who is aware of what's going on, whether it's under this administration, the last administration, the one before that, they have seen a constant kind of shift where we, the public, have less say and less influence over the policy of government with each passing year. There's kind of a new class that's being created, a government class and then the public civil class that are held to different standards of behavior. When we start talking about leaking and whistleblowing, this becomes even more clear."
Interviewer,"So, what I did was, I wanted to clarify that kind of Lassie bark. I just wanted everybody to know what was going on. I didn't want to say, ""The government can't do this."" I didn't want to say, ""This is how you guys have to live"" because that's not for me to say, but I do believe that everybody in the United States and, more broadly, people in the world who are having their rights violated by government, should have at least an understanding of how that is happening, what the authorities, sort of the policies and programs that are enabling that are so that they can protest them, so that they can cast a vote about them, so that they can say, ""You know what? You guys say this is okay, but I disagree that this is not okay. I object, and I want things to change.""."
Snowden,"So, I gathered evidence of what I believed to be criminal or unconstitutional activity on the part of the government, and I gave this to journalists, right? Now, I gave this to journalists under a very strict condition here, which was that they publish no story in this archives of information simply because it was interesting, no click bait, not anything just because they thought it would make news, it would get them awards. They would only publish stories that they were willing to make an institutional judgment and stand behind, and this was three different newspapers, that it was in the public interest to know."
Interviewer,"So, then beyond that, there was additional, because if you could see sort of what I was doing here, what had happened, what had led us into this pitfall was that the system of checks and balances that's supposed to self-regulate our government had failed. The courts had abdicated their role in policing the executive in the Congress. Because terrorism was such a hot argument at the time, they were worried about being criticized and blamed if something went wrong and an attack did go through, and they didn't have access to the information that the programs were ineffective, so they were just taking the government's word for it. They didn't want to wade in."
Snowden,"Congress, most of them didn't even know, right? The ones who did know, it was the same thing. They were getting their pockets stuffed with money by the defense contractors that were getting rich for building these systems, or violating the rights of each of us. So, they benefited by just saying nothing, and then the executive themselves, whether we're talking about Bush, whether we're talking about Obama, or whether we're talking about Trump now, all these guys were okay with the constantly growing surveillance state because they're the ones whose hands were on the level at the time they got to aim it. They got to use it."
Interviewer,"If you had a little search box in front of you, they would give you the email history of everybody in the United States, anybody you want, if you could pull up their text messages, anybody you want, if you could see anything they ever typed into that Google search box. Joe, what is the worst thing you've ever typed into that search box? That lasts forever, and they have a record of that. They can get that from Google. This was the whole thing."
Snowden,"How do we correct for that? When you have somebody who wants to inform the public of something, and we'll get into the proper channels arguments later, but you can't go through the institution to get these corrected because the institution knows it's wrong and is doing it anyway. That's the whole origin of the program is, they want to do something that they're not allowed to do. What do you do? So, I didn't want to say, ""I'm the President of Secrets."" I didn't want to just put this stuff on the internet, and I could have. I'm a technologist, right?"
Interviewer,"I worked with the journalists and then, to create an adversarial step, someone who would argue against what I believed and, hopefully, what the journalists believed once they consulted the documents and basically authenticated them, can we get the government to play that role? So, before the journalists published any story,... This is a controversial thing."
Snowden,"People still criticize me for this, actually. They say I was too accommodating of government, and they could be right, is that the journalists would go to the government and give them warning and say, ""We're about to run this story about this secret program that says you did X,Y,&Z bad thing. One, is that right? Two, is this going to cause harm. Is anybody going to get hurt? Is this program effective? Is there something we don't understand? Is there something Snowden doesn't understand? Does this guy just not get it? Are these documents fake? Whatever you want, say we shouldn't run this story.""."
Interviewer,"In every case I'm aware of, that process was followed, and that's why because there's a lot of people out there who don't like me, who criticize me, who go, ""This was unsafe. This caused harm to people"" or whatever. We're in 2019 now. I came forward, and these stories won the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism, starting back in June of 2013. We've had six years to show bodies. We've had six years to show harm, and you know as well as I do, the government's happy to leak things when it's in their interest. Nobody has been hurt as a result of these disclosures because everyone who was involved in them was so careful."
Snowden,"We wanted to maximize the public benefit while mitigating the potential risks, and I think we did a pretty good job. Just to get back to the main thing, the original thing that got us off on that trail, when I came forward in June of 2013, I gave one interview to the people who were in the room with the documents, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, Ewan McCaskill. I said who I was. I said why I was doing this. I said what this was about, why it matters, and that we were constructing a system of turnkey tyranny. Even if you trust that to Obama, you never know whose hand is going to be on that key next, and all they have to do is turn it and there's nothing we can do to stop it."
Interviewer,"The only thing that's restraining these programs, really, is policy more so than law, and the president at any time can sign a napkin and those policies change. After that, I went six months without giving any interviews because I didn't want people to talk about me. I wanted them to talk about what actually mattered, and the government, of course, was trying very hard to change the conversation, as they always do, to be about who is this guy, what've they done, what's wrong with them, what are their problems, who is this loony guy so they can controversialize the source of a story rather than having to confront the story itself."
Snowden,"That's why I said I really kind of appreciate your take on the media and everything like that because, when you don't tell your story, other people will tell it for you. They'll say so many things about you, and they'll have these misimpressions, like I did, because of something as stupid as the avatar that you were using on Twitter where I think it's a certain kind of show with a certain kind of guy, and it's this crazy stuff but, when I actually listen to you, when I actually look at the facts, and when I hear you just speak, I go, ""Actually, this is a thoughtful guy. Actually, this is somebody who does care, who does want to look at these things deeply,"" and appearances and our first impressions can be very misleading."
Interviewer,I work hard on that. I try to mislead people. It's good. It works to my advantage.
Snowden,"You're doing a good job, man."
Interviewer,"Thank you. I want to bring it back to when you first started with the NSA. You started as a contractor, right? What was your initial impression and when did you know that things were really squirrely with the programs you were ."
Snowden,"I'm not saying this to put you on the spot. I know you've been a busy guy. I know you have done I think shows recently. You come back from a break, right? Have you read the book, because it'll just help me put things in frame?"
Interviewer,Your book?
Snowden,"If you haven't got a chance to read it, yeah, my book."
Interviewer,"No, I have not read your book or got a copy of it."
Snowden,"Okay, well, I will send you a signed copy, brother."
Interviewer,Beautiful. Thank you.
Snowden,"I hope you'll read it, and I hope you will enjoy it. All right, so, I had a really weird history in the intelligence community. I grew up in a federal family, in the shadow of Fort Meade, all these little suburban communities in Maryland where, basically, the entire industry of the state is the federal government, of all these different agencies and then all the subcontractors, all the defense industries that serve that government and really are kind of our war-making machine, our system of control for the country and the world, broadly. All that stuff spreads in a couple hundred mile radius out of DC."
Interviewer,"My mother worked for the district courts, rather the federal courts, and it's kind of funny because she still works there, and those are the courts that are trying to throw me in jail for the rest of my life now. My father worked for the Coast Guard, retired after 30 years. My grandfather was an admiral, and then he worked for the FBI. As far back as it goes, my family, my whole line of family, even generations back, was working for the government, so it was pretty ordinary, pretty expected for me to go into the same kind of work."
Snowden,"Now, I started, I wasn't super successful in school because I felt, and this is the most arrogant thing in the world that anybody says, that I had more to learn from computers than I did from biology class, so I spent more and more time focusing on technology. Then, I got mono, and I dropped out of high school. Now, it's like, all right, how do I make this up? I say drop out of high school, but I'm actually going to community college. They called it concurrent enrollment where I'm not taking any classes at high school. I'm going to community college instead and I'm not doing that great there, either. It's fine. I'm enjoying it, but school is school. I can't wait to be grown."
Interviewer,You were bored.
Snowden,"Yeah. I think a lot of people have felt that, but I ran into somebody at the community college who ran their own home-based business doing web design, and they could see I was kind of technical, and they went, ""Hey, do you want to work for me?"" I was like, ""Well, that sounds great,"" so I started doing web design really, really early on. This is like, gosh, I don't know, probably 1998 vintage during the big boom and then the collapse that followed. The funny thing is, she worked, she was married to an NSA analyst, a linguist, so she lived on Fort Meade, and she ran her business out of their home on Fort Mead that's right up the street from the NSA."
Interviewer,"So, before I'm even working there, I'm driving past this building all of the time and trying to figure out what the next step is going to be. I enjoy this. It's a good thing for me, and it works well. I start getting trained and certified, all these little industry stamps you've got to get as a technologist to say, ""Oh, you know this program"" or whatever and just start climbing the ladder, but then 9/11 happens, and I'm on Fort Meade when 9/11 happens. I'm just going in to work, and I tell this in the book in some detail, and I think it's very much worth reading for people who don't know this because this is forgotten history. Nobody...."
Snowden,How old were you at the time?
Interviewer,"Gosh, I was born in '83, so I was probably 18 years old. Yeah, I had just turned 18 a couple months before. What people forget is who knew what was going on before anybody else on September 11th? The intelligence community, right? What did they do? Did they get out a public warning? Did they tell you guys to evacuate? Did they say do this, that, or the other? No, no, not for everybody, not for a long time but, at the NSA, then Director Michael Hayden, he was a general, he later became Director of the CIA, ordered the entire campus evacuated of thousands, tens of thousands of people actually. He just said, ""Go home."" The CIA did the same thing."
Snowden,"They were running on skeleton crews at the moment the country needed them more than they ever had, and I get a call, well, I hear a call that's from my boss's wife, her husband to her. He's calling from the NSA and saying, "" Hey, you know, I think Ed should leave for the day because I'm the only employee in this business besides her because I think they're going to close the base down."" I'm like, ""This is crazy! It never closes down."" We don't know what's happening. Then, we start checking the news, which is through websites because we're doing all this stuff and, suddenly, it's the big story everywhere. You know, nobody understands how big it is yet."
Interviewer,"Most of us are like, ""Oh, it's going to mess with our workday. Oh, it's going to mess with our commute"" but, when I'm leaving, I hear car horns all over the base. It's the craziest thing because this is a military base, right? It's right outside the NSA, and I entered just this absolute state of pandemonium as I go past Canine Road, which is the road that travels right in front of the NSA's headquarters. It's just a parking lot as far as you can see. They have military police out under the stoplights directing traffic because there's this massive evacuation, and I still have no idea what's happening. The story is still developing, but I will never forget that image."
Snowden,"Why did these people have so much power and so much money and so much authority that, at the moments we need them the most, they're the first ones in the country that are leaving their buildings. Later on, they said, and this is covered in a book, I believe. I think it's James Bamford who interviewed that Director of NSA who gave that order about what was happening. He was going, well, you know, he called his wife and he was asking where their kids were and everything like that and then, after that, he wanted to think about where could these other planes that they knew were in the area that hadn't struck yet, where could they be headed?"
Interviewer,"This sort of shows how self-centric the intelligence community is. This is the DC Metro area, right? They could hit the White House, they could hit Congress, they could hit the Supreme Court, and they go, ""Oh, they're going to fly their planes into the CIA Headquarters"" or, ""They're going to fly their planes into the NSA Headquarters."" Of course, it was never realistic that these would be the targets but, on that basis, they were like, ""Ooh, let's get our bacon out of the pan.""."
Snowden,But why....
Interviewer,I don't say this....
Snowden,"I'm sorry, but just in the interest of... Wasn't it possible that they could've attacked those places? I mean, they attacked the Pentagon. They knew that there were attacks."
Interviewer,"Look, it's absolutely possible they could have attacked your Denny's, but it's a question of risk assessment. If you have planes in the air, if you believe there's an ongoing terrorist attack that's happening in the United States right now and if you have built history's greatest surveillance agencies, the most powerful intelligence forces in the history of the species, you are going to take those off the board, or at least the majority of their personnel off the board then in a chance that you have no sort of grounds for substantiating that they could be targeting you?"
Snowden,"To begin with, simply because they could? Well, somebody else will get hit with those. As you say, it's going to be the Pentagon. It's going to be the World Trade Center. It's going to be someone, somewhere, and the more minutes you're in front of that desk, the higher the chance is, even if it's a very small chance, even if it's somebody who doesn't work on terrorism, maybe if it's somebody who normally works finance in North Korea, but they go, ""Look, this is an emergency.""."
Interviewer,"Everybody understands. You don't need to explain this. You just go stop what you're doing, look at financial transactions related to who purchased these plane tickets, do this... You just go full spectrum and do anything you can do right now. If the building gets hit, we get hit. That's what we signed up for. Nobody wants that. That's not the desired outcome but, if they had asked the staff to do that, they all would've agreed. That's what these people signed up to do and yet, the director goes, ""No. Just no. We're not going to take that ri-... ""."
Snowden,"It says so much about the bureaucratic character of how government works, the people who rise to the top of these governments. It's about risk management for them. It's about never being criticized for something, and this is, if we want to get really controversial, and this is something that'll haunt me because people will bring it up again and again and again, people ask about... People still criticize me. In the book, I talk about aliens and chemtrails and things like that and the fact that there's no evidence for that. I went looking on the network, right? I know, Joe, I know you want there to be aliens."
Interviewer,I do.
Snowden,"I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly wants there to be aliens, and there probably are, but the idea that we're hiding them... If we are hiding them, I had ridiculous access to the networks at the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups. I couldn't find anything so, if it's hidden, and it could be hidden, it's hidden really damn well, even from people who are on the inside. The main thing is conspiracy theories, right? Everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it helps life make sense. It helps us believe that somebody is in control, that somebody is called the shots, that these things all happen for a reason, this, that, and the other."
Interviewer,"There are real conspiracies, but they're not typically that they've got tens of thousands of people working on them unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence community itself, which is basically constructed on the idea that you can get, I think there's four million or 1.4 million people in the United States who hold security clearances, and you can get all of these people to not talk ever to journalists or this, that, or the other."
Snowden,"When you look back at the 9/11 report and when you look back at the history of what actually happened, what we can prove, not what we can speculate on, but what are at least t commonly agreed facts, it's very clear to me that someone who worked in the intelligence community, not during this period, of course, I was too young, but very shortly thereafter that these attacks could've been prevented. In fact, the government says this too, but the government goes, the reason that these attacks happened, the reasons that they were prevented is, what they call, stovepiping. There was not enough sharing."
Interviewer,"They needed to break down the walls and the restrictions that were chaining these poor patriots at the NSA and the CIA and FBI from all working on the same team. To some extent, they're correct on this. There were limits on the way agencies were supposed to play ball with each other, but I worked there, and I know how much of this is bullshit and how much of this is not. Those are procedural and policy limits, in some cases legal limits on what can be shared without following a process, without doing this, that, or the other, without basically asking for permission, without getting a signoff or anything like that."
Snowden,"If the FBI wanted to send absolutely everything they had to the CIA, they could've done so. If the CIA wanted to send everything they had to the FBI, they could've done so. They didn't, and people died as a result. Now, government goes bureaucratic proceduralism was responsible, and it's because we had too many restrictions on the intelligence community, and this is what led to the world post 9/11 where all of our rights...."
Interviewer,"on the intelligence community, and this is what led to the world post-9/11 where all of our rights sort of evaporated was they went, ""Well, restrictions on what these agencies can do are costing lives. Therefore, naturally we just have to unchain these guys and everything will be better. Right?""."
Snowden,"And if you remember that post-9/11 moment, you can understand how that actually could come off as persuasive. How that might be a kind of thing you go, ""All right, well, will that make sense?"" Because everybody was terrified, right? There were people quite quickly who got their heads back on their shoulders the right way. There were some of them who never lost their heads at all and who protested the Iraq War. At the same time, my dumb self was signing up to go fight it. Volunteering for the Army. We'll get into that in a minute."
Interviewer,"But everything that has followed in the decades past came from the fact that in a moment of fear, we lost our heads and we abandoned all the traditional constitutional restraints that we had put on these agencies, and we abandoned all of the traditional political restraints, and just social constraints, ideological systems of belief about the limitations that the secret police should have in a free and open society."
Snowden,"And we went, ""Look, terrorists."" We created shows like 24 and Jack Bauer where he's threatening to knife people's eyeballs out if they won't tell them this, that, or the other. And we entered this era of increasingly unlimited government as a result. And now in hindsight we go, ""Well, we shouldn't have been surprised."" But at the time, everyone panicked, right?"
Interviewer,"But if you go back to, did that help? And we know the answer now is in fact, no it did not. It made things worse. I don't think any historian is going to look at the Bush administration and go, ""This improved the position of the United States in the world."" But if you wind back the tape to that pre-9/11 moment, wind back the tape to those silos and those walls that they said needed to come down because that was restraining government. Instead of the rules, they said, ""Well, you can share these things, but there's got to be a basis. There's got to be a justification."" You've got to go, ""Why are we trading people's information like baseball cards and all of this stuff?""."
Snowden,"It's super easy as an intelligence officer to justify sharing information about a suspected terrorist who you think is planning to kill people, or is even just in a country they shouldn't be, or a place they shouldn't be, or doing something you don't think they should be with another agency, because no one's going to question that. A judge isn't going to question that. Any judge in the world will stamp that warrant without even thinking about it and then go to bed that night without a care in the world. Because you're not spying on a journalist, you're not spying on human rights defender, right? This is not an edge case. This is someone that you believe to be associated with al Qaeda or whatever. Now, this is all a lot of preamble to say that essential fact. The government agrees, everyone agrees the attacks probably could have been prevented if information had been shared. So, why wasn't the information shared? The government says information wasn't shared because of these restrictions. And it's half true, because every important lie has some criminal truth to it. And there were these barriers."
Interviewer,"But the reality is, why were those barriers respected in the case of a major terrorist plot? Why wasn't the CIA sharing information with the FBI? Why wasn't the FBI sharing information with the NSA? Why wasn't the NSA sharing information with the CIA in the case of a major terrorist plot?"
Snowden,"And if you've worked in government, if you've worked in the intelligence community, if you work in any large institution, you know? If you work at a company that sells batteries, you know that every office is fighting the other office for budget, for clout, for promotions, and this is the sad reality of what actually happened."
Interviewer,"Every one of those agencies wanted to be the guy who busted the plot. They wanted to be the one who got credit for it, and they didn't realize how serious it was until it was too late because they were competing with each other rather than cooperating."
Snowden,"That's exactly what I was going to ask you, if that was the issue. The competition between these agencies, because they are very proud of the CIA accomplishing something, or the FBI accomplishing something, and they want to be the one to take credit for that."
Interviewer,"Yeah. And I mean, I think it's important in their defense, because nobody else here is going to provide a defense for them, is that that's actually darkly human. Again, this happens in every industry, this happens in every sort of big corporate thing because you want to get promoted, and everybody's putting in their achievements at the end of the year for what they did, and if you're the guy who does that, you're going straight to the top."
Snowden,But their solution instead of-.
Interviewer,But this was the-.
Snowden,So we have a weird delay here-.
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,... for folks that are listening.
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,"So their solution, instead of having someone be responsible for bridging the gap and providing that information to each individual agency, their solution was mass surveillance?"
Interviewer,"Well, no. They're different things. 9/11 is what woke these guys up."
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,"Basically. And they went, ""Well, we screwed up and Americans died as a result. We really don't want to take the hit on that."" And to be honest, the government had no interest in putting the hit on them. To be honest, the public had no interest in putting the hit on them at the time because everybody understood, terrorism is a real thing. There are bad people in the world, and that's true, right? That will always be true. There's always going to be criminals, there's always going to be terrorists, whether they're at your church, whether they're across the ocean, there are people out there who are angry, they're disenfranchised, they're violent, and they just want to harm something. They want to change something even in a negative way because that's what they feel is all they have left."
Snowden,"Which these are criminals, right? These are people that we don't need to pity. But if we ever want to stop it, we do need to understand it and where those things come from, where there's these drives come from in the first place. But basically everybody went, ""All right, how do we stop this?"" Because nobody wants to feel unsafe. Nobody wants to feel like the building's going to come down the next time you go in it. And so everybody just went, ""I don't care who does it, stop it."" And they said this to Dick Cheney, which is a historic mistake because Dick Cheney knows how government works. He was the person in that White House who was best placed to know all the levers of government, all the interagency cooperation, where we were strong, where we were weak, what we could do, what we were not allowed to do."
Interviewer,"And what he did was he took that little dial on what we're not allowed to do and he changed it all the way until it broke and snapped off, and then there was nothing that we couldn't do anymore."
Snowden,And you were there while this was happening. This was-.
Interviewer,"No, I was not. Again, this is in 2001. I was 18 years old. I was working on the base, I had drove past the building, but that was it. This is all hindsight. This is biography. This is documented history, but this is not the gospel of Edward Snowden. I don't know this, right? This is public record."
Snowden,Okay.
Interviewer,This is what we all know.
Snowden,"What we have though, the reason that I bring this up is this is a teachable moment because there's so many people right now in the Trump administration who go, ""Look, this guy has too much power. He's abusing it against immigrants. He's abusing it against domestic opponents. He's doing whatever. He's trying to hurt political rivals in the next election,"" all of this stuff."
Interviewer,"And we can get into this stuff later if you want in detail, but the bottom line is they're going, ""This is a guy who's in the White House who's throwing elbows, right? He doesn't really care. He wants to hurt people as long as he can convince the Americans that those are the bad guys, right? That's the enemy. It doesn't matter if they're far away. It doesn't matter if they're close at home, whoever he's against, he's going to harm.""."
Snowden,"And the dark thing is, this is actually why he was elected. In moments of fear where the world starts falling apart, and this happens in authoritarian country after country. This is why you have Vladimir Putin in Russia who's been there for 20 years, right? President for basically 20 years. Think about that. He sort of skipped in the middle there because he had to dodge the fact that presidents can only serve so many consecutive terms. So he dropped down to prime minister and then came back as president. But think about that. How do you get that kind of political longevity? And it's because, if you know anything about Russian history, which even I don't know that much about it, the 90s after the collapse of the Soviet Union were an extraordinarily dark time. If you look at Russian cinema, all they had were gangster movies, right? All they had were the disintegration of society, how things are dark and broken, no one trusts each other, pensions were no longer being paid. Social security's not there anymore. There's nothing to buy, there's nothing to do, there's no job. No one had a future."
Interviewer,"And so they went, ""If there's somebody who can lead us out of this, if there's somebody who will fix this, who will find us an enemy and defeat that enemy to restore prosperity, we'll put them in office."" We see it happen in Turkey with Erdogan, right? We've seen it happen successively with bad governments even in Western democracies. We see it happening, sadly, in places like Poland and Hungary. You can even argue it's happening in the United Kingdom, right? And now there are a lot of people arguing that's exactly what we're seeing with Donald Trump's White House in the United States. And this is the lesson that we didn't learn from 2001 is when we become fearful, we become vulnerable, right? To anyone who promises they will make things better, even if they have no ability to make things better, even if they will actively make things worse, even if they will make things better for themselves and their buddies by taking from you, but if they tell you that they'll make things better and you believe them in a moment of fear, that typically leads to unfortunate outcomes."
Snowden,"So, sorry, let me turn this back over to you because we got way off track there."
Interviewer,"No, that's all right. I want to bring it back to the initial question. So you're working for the NSA, when do you realize there's a huge issue-."
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,"... and when do you feel this responsibility to let the American people know about this issue? When do you contact these journalists, and what was the thought process regarding this? What steps did you go through once you realized that this was in violation of the Constitution, and that even with the laws of the PATRIOT Act and the PATRIOT Act II, things had changed so radically that you knew this was wrong and you had to do something about it, or you felt a responsibility to speak out?"
Snowden,"Okay. So since we gave so much historical preamble, let me just give the CliffsNotes version-."
Interviewer,Okay.
Snowden,"... to get us up to that. So after September 11th, I'm a little bit lost."
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,"I'm doing my technical stuff, but it doesn't really feel like it matters anymore. I'm making more money, I'm becoming more accomplished, but the world's on fire, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,"You remember, there was a crazy mood of patriotism in the country because we were all trying to come together and get through it. You remember people were sticking Dixie cups in the top of every chain link fence on every overpass that was like, ""Stand together. Never forget. United we stand.""."
Interviewer,Flags on every car.
Snowden,Exactly.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Snowden,"And I was a young guy who is not especially political, right? And I come from a military background, federal family, all that stuff, and so that means I'm very vulnerable to this kind of stuff. I see it on the news and Bush and all his sort of cronies are going, ""Look, it's al Qaeda, it's terrorist organization, they have all these international connections. There's Iraq, dictators, weapons of mass destruction, they're holding the world at ransom."" You got Colin Powell at the UN dangling little vials of fake anthrax."
Interviewer,"And so I felt an obligation to do my part, and so I volunteered to join the Army. You probably can't tell from looking at me, but I'm not going to be at the top of the MMA circuit anytime soon, so it didn't work out. I joined a special program that was called the 18XRAY Program where they take you in off the street and they actually give you a shot at becoming a Special Forces soldier."
Snowden,"So you train harder in special platoons, you go further, and I ended up breaking my legs basically. So they put me out under-."
Interviewer,Both your legs?
Snowden,"... a special discharge. Yeah, basically what it was, they were shin splints that I was too dumb to get off of, right? So I kept marching under weight and I'm a pretty light guy to begin with, I had a 24-inch waist when I joined the Army."
Interviewer,Girls are jealous.
Snowden,"Yeah. I think I weighed like 128 pounds. I was in great shape in bootcamp because I came up really quick because all I could do was gain, but it was just too much on my frame because I wasn't that active."
Interviewer,"And so when you keep running on a stress injury, right? And you're running under weight with rucksacks and things like that, and you're running in boots and then you're doing a exercise, and the Army is a whole chapter in the book. You've got your battle buddy, right? Because they never allow you to be alone, you've always got to have somebody watching you."
Snowden,"They thought it was funny to put me, the smallest guy in the platoon, the drill sergeants did, with the biggest dude in the platoon who was like an amateur bodybuilder. He was like 230 or 260, something like that. He was a big fellow. And so he would, when we're off in the woods doing these marches and things like that and we have to practice buddy carries, like the fireman's carry and things like that, he throws me around his neck. I'm like a towel, he's just skipping down like it's nothing. And then I got to put him on me and I'm just like, ""Oh God,"" dying. And it was weirdly fun. I enjoyed it, but it was no good for my body."
Interviewer,"And so in a land navigation movement, I step off a log because I was on point, and on the other side of the log, because it's the woods in Georgia at Sand Hill, I see a snake. And so in my memory, it's like time slows down. Because North Carolina, where I grew up, you think all snakes are poisonous."
Snowden,It just popped up.
Interviewer,Speaker 1:.
Snowden, that's fine.
Interviewer,"Okay. Sorry, there's an issue."
Snowden,Do we need to take a break?
Interviewer,No. We're good. We're good. We're good.
Snowden,It's completely fine.
Interviewer,No we're fine.
Snowden,All right.
Interviewer,There was something that happened on the screen and I wanted to make sure it was okay.
Snowden,Oh that's just the FBI joining the chat.
Interviewer,"That's what I was worried about, there's a second image opened up here."
Snowden,"Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, I tried to take a much longer step in mid-air, I land badly and it's just one leg is like fire. I'm limping, I'm limping, I'm limping. But everybody says don't go to sick call, because if you go to sick call, you'll lose your slot, you'll end up in general infantry or regular infantry."
Interviewer,"And so I go back, I just tough it out. I get in my rack. And the next morning when I get out of the rack, which is the top bunk bed, right? I jumped out and my legs, they just give out underneath me, and I try to get up and I just can't get up. And so I go to sick call and I end up going to the hospital and they end up x-raying me. And they also x-rayed my battle buddy because I got to go there with somebody else, and he has a broken hip where they had to bring him to surgery. And it's in the book, there's a lot more detail about it, it was kind of a dramatic moment."
Snowden,"But for me, they just said I had bilateral tibial fractures, right? All the way up my legs. They said I had spiderwebs and the next free phase of the training was jump school, right? Where you've got to jump out of a plane. And the doctor is like, ""Son, if you jump on those legs, they're going to turn into powder."" And he's like, ""I can hold you back. We can put you for like six months, you stay off them, then you can go back through the whole cycle, right? Start basic from scratch, but you'll lose your slot in the Special Forces pipeline because of the way these things are scheduled and everything like that. And then you'll basically be reassigned to the needs of the Army,"" which probably meant I was going back to IT, which was what I joined the Army to kind of escape, "" Or you can go out on this special kind of discharge that's called an administrative discharge, right?""."
Interviewer,"Normally you've got honorable discharge, dishonorable discharge, things like that. This is something for people who have been in for I think less than six months where it's like annulling a marriage. It's as if it never happened. It's as if you never joined. And at the time I was like, ""Wow, that's very kind of him to do that."" And I took it. They sent me to sick call or sort of the sick bay where you're in the medical platoon and you do nothing for, it was I think about a month, and then they let you out once the paperwork all finishes."
Snowden,"But in hindsight I realized that if you take an administrative discharge, it exempts the Army for liability for your injuries. So actually what I thought it was a kindness a was just, now if I had future problems with my legs, they wouldn't have to cover it or health insurance or any of those things. And it was just a funny thing."
Interviewer,"But anyway, I get out of the Army and here I'm on crutches for a long time and just sort of trying to figure out, ""All right, well what's next in life?"" Because I had gotten a basic security clearance just for going through signing up for the military process, I applied for a security guard position at the University of Maryland because it said you had to get a top secret clearance, which was a higher clearance than I had at the time. And I went, ""Well that sounds good,"" because I knew if I combined my IT skills, which were now suddenly much more relevant again to my future, with a top secret security clearance because of the way it works, if you have a top secret security clearance and tech skills, you get paid a ridiculous amount of money for doing very little work."
Snowden,"So I was like, ""All right, well I can basically make twice what I would be making in the private sector working for government at this level, at this phase."" Because what we talked about earlier with September 11th and how the intelligence community changed, they no longer cared that I hadn't graduated from college, right? And I had gotten a GED just by going in and taking a test. So for government purposes, it was the same as if I was a high school graduate."
Interviewer,"So now suddenly it was like these doors were opened. This University of Maryland facility turned out to be an NSA facility. It was called CASL, the Center for the Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland College Park. And all I was was literally a a security guy walking around with a walkie talkie, making sure nobody breaks in at night, managing the electronic alarm system and things like that."
Snowden,"But once I had my foot in the door there, I could start climbing the ladder step-by-step, and I applied for ... or I went to a job fair, actually, that was only for people who had security clearances. And I ended up going to the table for one of the technical companies, it was a little tiny subcontractor nobody's ever heard of, and they said, ""We've got tons of positions for somebody like you. Are you comfortable working nights?"" And I was like, ""Yeah, I wake up in the middle of the day anyway, that's fine with me.""."
Interviewer,"And suddenly I've gone from working for the NSA through a university in a weird way where it's like the NSA holds the clearance, but I'm formally an employee of the State of Maryland at the college and this is government man, it's all these weird dodges and boondoggles for how people are employed there. Now suddenly, I'm working at CIA headquarters, right? The place where all the movies show, you swoop over the marble seal and everything like that. I'm the king of the castle, right? I'm there at the middle of the night when no one else is there, the lights are on motion sensors. It's the creepiest thing in the world. There's flags on the wall that are just gently billowing in the air conditioning like ghosts. The hallway lights up as you walk alongside it-."
Snowden,Whoa.
Interviewer,"... because it's a green building, and they disappear behind you. And there's no one there. I can go down to the gym at like 2:00 in the morning at the CIA and not see a soul on the other side of the building and then go all the way back. And this kind of thing was my in because they were like, ""Look, it's the night shift. Nothing that bad is going to happen."" But it was on a very senior technical team that was basically handling systems administration for everybody in the Washington metropolitan area, right?"
Snowden,"So every basically CIA server, this is a computer system that data is stored on, that reporting is stored, that traffic is moved on, all of this stuff. Suddenly me, this is circa 2005 I think, I'm in charge of, and it's just me and one other guy on the night shift. And if you're interested in the book, there's a lot of detail on this, but I get sort of scouted from this position because they realize I actually know a lot about technology. They were expecting me just to basically make sure the building doesn't burn down, all these systems don't go down overnight and then never come back up."
Interviewer,"But they go, ""Well, are you willing to go overseas?"" And to a young man at that age that's actually like, ""Hey, that sounds kind of exciting."" Who doesn't want to go work overseas for the CIA? And there's a lot of people listening to the podcast who are like, ""Not me.""."
Snowden,I'm one of them.
Interviewer,"Because they're like, ""Wait, the CIA's the bad guys, right?"" Yeah, exactly. They're like, ""What are you going to go overthrow a government somewhere?"" But you have to understand that I'm still very much a true believer. The government is the living compressed embodiment of truth and goodness and light, the shining city on the hill. So I want to do my part to spread that to the world."
Snowden,"I didn't have skepticism is really what I'm trying to establish here. And so I sign up and I go through this special training school, like people hear in movies about The Farm, which is down at Camp Peary in Virginia. I'm sent to this actually much more secret facility called the Hill, which is in Warrenton, Virginia. And this has been covered a few times in open source media, but I think this is one of the few book-length discussions of what happens there in permanent record."
Interviewer,"But yeah, so I go through training and then I get assigned overseas and I end up in Geneva, Switzerland undercover as a diplomat, right? I think my formal title for the embassy is something super bland like diplomatic attaché, and what I am is I'm a forward deployed tech guy. They send you through this school to make you into kind of a MacGyver, right?"
Snowden,"Yes, you can handle all the computers, but you can also handle the connections for the embassy's power systems, right? The actual electrical connections. You can handle the HVAC systems, right? You can handle locks and alarms and security systems. Basically anything that's got an on button on it at the embassy that's secure now you're responsible for, and I traveled from Geneva to other countries in Europe for sort of assignments, and it was an exciting time. I actually still enjoyed it, but this was where I first, working with intelligence, started to get doubts."
Interviewer,"And the story has been told many times so I won't go over it in full detail here, but the CIA does primarily, and it's not the only thing they do, what's called human intelligence. Now there are many different types of intelligence the intelligence community is responsible for. The primary ones are human intelligence and signals intelligence. You want to think of signals intelligence, right? As tapping lines, hacking computers, all of these sort of things that provide electronic information or anything that's a digital or analog signal that can be intercepted and then turned into information."
Snowden,"Human intelligence is all that fun stuff we've heard of the CIA doing for decades and decades, which is where they try to turn people. Basically they say, ""Look, we'll give you money if you sell out your country."" It's not even your country a lot of times, it's your organization. These guys could be working for a telecommunications provider and they want to sell customer records, or they work at a bank, which was the thing that I saw, and we wanted records on the bank's customers so we wanted a guy on the inside."
Interviewer,"But anyway, that's sort of how it works. And what I saw was they were way more aggressive for the lowest stakes than was reasonable or responsible. They were totally willing to destroy somebody's life just on the off chance they would get some information that wouldn't even be tremendously valuable. And so, ethically, that struck me as a bit off, but I let it pass because what I've learned over my life, short though it's been, is that skepticism is something that needs to build up over time. It's a skill, something that needs to be practiced. Or you can think of it as something that you develop through exposure, right?"
Snowden,"nd of like radiation poisoning, but in a positive way. It's when you start to realize inconsistencies or hypocrisy or lies, and you notice them and you give somebody the benefit of the doubt or you trust them or you think it's all right, but then over time you see it's not an isolated instance, it's a pattern behavior. And over time, that exposure to inconsistency builds and builds and builds until it's something that you can no longer ignore."
Interviewer,"w, after the CIA, I went to the NSA in Japan where I was working there in Tokyo. And then from there, a couple years later, I went to the CIA again. Now I was working as private employee for Dell, but I was the senior technical official on Dell's sales account to the CIA. People in these big companies, they have sales accounts to the CIA. And so this means I'm going in, and now ... it's crazy because I'm still a very young man, but I'm sitting across the table from chiefs of these enormous CIA divisions. I'm sitting across from their chief technology officer for the entire agency or the chief information officer for the entire CIA."
Snowden,"(0 d these guys are going, ""Look, here's our problems, here's what we want to do,"" and it's my job to pitch them a system, right? And I'm paired up with this sales guy, and the whole thing is just to go, ""How much money can we get out of the government?"" Right? That's the whole goal and we'll build them ... what we were pitching was a private cloud system, right? Everybody knows about cloud computing now. It's why your Gmail account is available wherever you go. It's why Facebook has this massive system of records for everyone everywhere."
Interviewer,"(0 e government wanted to have these kinds of capabilities too. Dell ended up getting beat out by Amazon. Some people aren't familiar with this, many of them are, but Amazon runs a secret cloud system for the government. I forget what they've rebranded it now, but there's this massive connection between industry and government in the classified space that just goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper."
Snowden,"But at this point I was already ... I had misgivings because of what I'd seen in Japan about government, but I was just trying to get by. I was trying to ignore the conflicts. I was trying to ignore the inconsistencies, and I think this is a state that a lot of people in these large institutions, not just in our country, but around the world, struggle with every day, right? They've got a job, they've got a family, they've got bills. They're just trying to get by, and they know that some of the things they're doing are not good things. They know some of the things that they're doing are actively wrong, but they know what happens to people who rock the boat."
Interviewer,"Eventually I changed my mind. And when I had gone to Hawaii, which was the final position in my career with the intelligence community, I was ... because of an accident of history here, I wasn't supposed to be in this position at all. I was supposed to be at a group called the National Threat Operation Center, NTOC."
Snowden,"But because of the way contracting works, and again, this is covered in the book, I ended up being reassigned to this little rinky-dink office that nobody's ever heard of in Hawaii called the Office of Information Sharing. And I'm replacing this old-timer who's about to retire, really, really nice guy. But he's spent most of his days just reading novels and doing nothing and letting people be content to the fact ... or letting people forget that his office existed, because he was the only one in it. There's a manager who's over him, but it's actually over a larger group and he just looks over him as sort of a favor."
Interviewer,"So now I come in and now I'm the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing. But I'm not close enough to retirement that I'm okay with just doing nothing at all. So I get ambitious and I come up with this idea for a new system called the Heartbeat, and what the Heartbeat is going to do is connect to basically every information repository in the intelligence community, both at the NSA and across network boundaries, which you normally can't cross. But because I had worked at both the CIA and the NSA, I knew the network well enough, both sides of it, sides that normal workers at the NSA would never have seen because you have to be in one or the other."
Snowden,"I could actually connect these together, I could build bridges across this kind of network space, and then draw all of these records into a new kind of system that was supposed to look at your digital ID. Basically your sort of ID card that says, ""This is who I am. I work for this agency, I work in this office, these are my assignments, these are my group affiliations."" And because of that, the system would be able to eventually aggregate records that were relevant to your job, that were related to you, and then it can provide them, and basically you could hit this site and it would be an update of what we used to call [inaudible boards, which were manually created."
Interviewer,"Then it would go, look, you work in network defense, right? These are all the things that are happening on network defense. You work on, I don't know, economic takeovers in Guatemala, this is what's going on for you there. But in my off time, I helped the team that sat next to me, which was a systems administration team for Windows networks because I had been a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, which means basically I knew how to take care of Windows networks. And this was all those guys did, and they always had way too much work, way too much work, and I had basically no work that I needed to do at all, because all I was supposed to do was share information, which was not something that was particularly in demand because most people already knew what they wanted or what they needed."
Snowden,"So basically, my job was to sit there and collect a paycheck unless I wanted to get ambitious. And so I did some side gigs for these other guys, and one of them was running what were called dirty word searches. Now dirty word-."
Interviewer,"Now dirty word searches are ... Let me dial this back cause I know we're sort of, this is hard to track. Everything that the NSA does, in large part, is classified. Everything the CIA does, in large part, is classified. If I made lunch plans with other people in my office, it was classified. That was the policy. It's dumb. This over classification problem is one of the central flaws in government right now. This is the reason we don't understand what they're doing. This is why they can get a away way. This is why they can get away with breaking the law or violating our rights for so long, five years, 10 years, 1550 years before we see what they were doing. It's because of this routine classification, right? Every system, computer system has a limit on what level of classified information is supposed to be stored on it. We've got all these complicated systems for code words and caveats that establish a system of what's called compartmentation. This is the idea when you work at the CIA, when you work at the NSA, you're not supposed to know what's happening in the office next to you, right? Because you don't have need to know. Right? Again, that thing from the movies. The reason they have this is they don't want one person to be able to go and know everything and tell everybody everything. They don't want anybody to know too much, particularly when they're doing lots of bad things, because then there's the risk that you realize they're doing so many bad things that it's past the point that we can justify. They might develop ideological objection to that."
Snowden,"Well, in the Office of Information Sharing, and actually in basically every part of my career, before that, I had access to everything. I had what was called a special caveat on my accesses called PRIVAC, which means privileged access. What this means is your kind of super user. Most people have all of these controls on the information they can access, but I'm in charge of this system, right? People who need information, they have to get it from somewhere. They don't know. Even the director of the CIA right? He says, ""I need to know everything about this."" Well, he doesn't know where to get it. He's just a manager. Somebody has to be able to actually cross these thresholds and get those things. That guy was me."
Interviewer,"Dirty word searches were these automated queries that I would set up to go across the whole network and look at all of the different levels of classification and compartmentation and exceptionally controlled information. You can think of it as above top secret in these special compartments where you're not even supposed to know what these compartments are for. You only know the code word unless you work in them, unless you have access to them, unless you're read into them."
Snowden,"One day I get a hit on the dirty word search for a program that I'd never heard of called Stellar Wind. It came back because the little caveat for it, they're called handling caveats, which is like you can think of like burn after reading or for your eyes only, but this one's called STLW, which means Stellar Wind. Unless you know what Stellar Wind is, you don't know how to handle it. All I knew was it wasn't supposed to be on my system. I went, ""This is a little bit unusual.""."
Interviewer,"It turned out this document was placed on the system because one of the employees who had worked on this program years before had come to Hawaii. This person was a lawyer, I believe. They had worked in the Inspector General's office and they had compiled a report, part of the Inspector General's report, which is when the government is investigating itself, into the operations and activities of this program. Well, this was the domestic mass surveillance program that I talked about in the very beginning of our conversation. It started under the Bush White House. Stellar Wind was no longer supposed to be really an operation. It had been unveiled and a big scandal in December 2005 in the New York Times by journalist, James Risen and I'm not going to name him, because I don't want to get it wrong, another journalist, you can look at the byline now if you want to see their involvement. There's a lot of history here too. What they had found was of course the Bush White House had constructed a warrantless wiretapping program, if you remember the warrantless wiretapping scandal, that was affecting everyone in the United States."
Snowden,"Well, the Bush White House was really put in a difficult position by the scandal. They would have lost the election over this scandal, because the New York Times actually had this story in October 2004 which was the election year. They were ready to go with it. At this specific request to the White House, talking to the publisher of the New York Times, Sulzberger and Bill Keller then the executive editor of the New York Times, the New York Times said, ""We won't run the story because the president just said, 'if you run this story a month before the election,' that's very tight margin if you recall, 'you'll have blood on your hands.'"" It was so close in 2001, the New York Times just went, ""You know what? Fine. Americans don't need to know that the Constitution should be violated. They don't need to know that the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean what they think it means. If the government says it's all right. It's a secret. You shouldn't know about it, that's fine.""."
Interviewer,"Now, December, 2005 why did that change? Why did the New York Times suddenly run this story? Well, it's because James Risen, the reporter who found this story had written a book. He was about to publish this book. The New York Times was about to be in a very uncomfortable position of having to explain why they didn't run this story and how they got scooped by their own journalists. And so they finally did it, but it was too late. Bush had been reelected. Now it was sweeping up the broken glass of our lost rights."
Snowden,"Congress, the Bush White House, was very effective. As I said before, telling a very few select members of Congress that this program existed. They told them this program existed in ways that they wouldn't object to, but made them culpable for hiding the existence of the program from the American people. This is why someone like Nancy Pelosi, who you wouldn't exactly think would be buddy buddy with George Bush, was completely okay in defending this kind of program, in fact. Later she said, Oh, well she had objections to the program that she wrote in a letter to the White House. But she never showed us the letter. She went, ""Oh well, that was classified."" Right? This is not to to bag on her individually. It's just, she's a great example in here and not named example everyone knows of how this process works."
Interviewer,"The White House will implicate certain very powerful members of Congress in their own criminal activity. Then when the White House gets in trouble for it, the Congress has to run cover for the white house. What happened was Congress passed an emergency law in 2007 called the Protect America Act, which should have been our first indication this is a very bad thing, because they never named a law something like that unless it's something terrible. What it did was it retroactively immunized all of the phone companies in the United States that had been breaking the law millions of times a day by handing your records over to the government, which they weren't allowed to do, simply on the basis of a letter from the president saying, ""Please do this.""."
Snowden,"These companies went, ""Look, now that we've been uncovered, now that we've been shown that we're breaking, or now that these journalists have shown that we've broken the law and violated the rights of Americans on a staggering scale that could bankrupt our companies, because we can be sued for this. We will no longer cooperate with you unless pass a law that says people can't sue us for having done this."" And so we get the Protect America Act."
Interviewer,Jesus.
Snowden,"Which they say is as an emergency. This is all public history too. You can look this up on Wikipedia. Then they go, ""It's an emergency law. We have to pass this now. We have to keep this program active. Bush is going to end the warrantless wiretapping program and continue it under this new authority where it's going to have some special level of oversight and these kinds of things eventually. But for now we just have to make sure people are safe."" Again, they go to fear. They say, ""If we don't have this program, terrorist attacks will continue. People will die. Blood on your hands, blood on your hands, blending your hands. Think of the children.""."
Interviewer,"Protect America Act passes. The companies get off the hook. The Bush White House gets off the hook. The Congress that was then sharing in a criminal culpability for authorizing or rather letting these things go by without stopping them then passes in 2008, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments of 2008 this is called the FAA FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Rather than stopping all of the unlawful and unconstitutional activities that the intelligence agency was doing, they continued it in different ways simply by creating a few legal hoops for them to jump through."
Snowden,"Now, this is not as go say, you know, these things aren't helpful at all. It's not to say they're not useful at all. It's important to understand when the government's response to any scandal, and this applies to any country, is not to make the activities of the person who was caught breaking the law, comply with the law, but instead make the activities of the person who is breaking the law, legal, right? They make the law comply with the agencies want to do rather than make the agencies comply with the law. That's a problem. That's what happened here."
Interviewer,"Now the intelligence community's powers actually grew in response to this scandal in 2008, because Congress was on the hook and they just wanted to move on and get this over with. There were objections. There were people who knew this was a bad idea, but it passed on. Now what the public took away from this, because a part of these laws, was a requirement that the Inspector General of all of these different intelligence community elements and the Director of National Intelligence submit a report saying this is what happened under that warrantless wiretapping program. This is how it complied with the law or how it didn't comply with the law, and basically look back at how this program was constituted, what it did, what the impacts and effects were. That was supposed to be the truth and reconciliation council."
Snowden,"Now, why am I talking about all this ancient history? Well, I'm sitting here in 2012 with a classified Inspector General's report, draft report from the NSA that names names, that says Dick Cheney, that says David Addington, this is Nancy Pelosi that says all these people who are involved in the program, the tick tock of how it happens. It says, the director of the NSA, that guy who was evacuating the building at the beginning of our podcast here, that guy was asked by the president of the United States if he would continue this program after being told by the White House and the Department of Justice that these programs were not lawful, that they were not constitutional. The president said, ""Would you continue this program on my say so alone knowing that it's risky, knowing that it's unlawful?"" He said, ""Yes sir, I will if you think that's what's necessary to keep the country safe.""."
Interviewer,"At that moment, I realize these guys don't care about the law. These guys don't care about the constitution. These guys don't care about the American people. They care about the continuity of government. They care about the state, right? This is something that people have lost. We hear this phrase over and over again, national security, national security, national security. We're meant to interpret that to mean public safety. National security is a very different thing from public safety. National security is a thing that in previous generations we referred to as state security. National security was a term that came out of the Bush administration to run cover for the fact that we were elevating a new secret police across the country."
Snowden,"What does it mean when, again, in a democracy, in the United States, the public is not partner to government? The public does not hold the leash of government any more, but we are subject to government, right? We are subordinate to government. We're not even allowed to know that it happened. Now in the book, I tell the fact that I had access to the unclassified version of this report back in Japan. What's interesting is the unclassified version of a report, and we've all seen this today with things like the Mueller report and all of the intelligence reporting that's happened in the last several years. When the government provides a classified report to the public, it's normally the same document, the unclassified version, the classified version are the same thing. It's just the unclassified version has things blacked out or redacted that they say, ""Oh, you're not allowed to know this sentence or this paragraph or this page or whatever.""."
Interviewer,"The document that the public had been given about the warrantless wiretapping program was a completely different document. It was a document tailor made to deceive and mislead the Congress and the public of the United States. It was effective in doing that. In 2012, what I realized was this is what real world conspiracies look like, right? It doesn't have to be a smoking man behind closed doors, right? It's lawyers and politicians. It's ordinary people from the working level to the management level who go, ""If we don't explain this in a certain way, we're all going to lose our jobs."" Or the other way, ""They go, we're, we're going to get something out of this if we all work together.""."
Snowden,"Civilization is the history of conspiracy, right? What is civilization, but a conspiracy for all of us to do better by working together. Right? But it's this kind of thing that I think too often we forget because it's boring as hell. I want all your listeners to go to the Washington Post, because this document that I discovered that really changed me has been published courtesy of the Washington Post. It's called the Inspector General's report on Stellar Wind. You can look at the actual document that I saw that was unredacted, right? I had no blacked out pages on mine. What I believe it shows, is that some of the most senior officials in the United States, elected and unelected, worked together to actively undermine the rights of the American people to give themselves expanded powers."
Interviewer,"Now in their defense, they said they were seeking these powers for good and just and noble cause, right?They say they were trying to keep us safe. That's what they always say. That's what every government says. That's no different than what the Chinese government says or the Russian government says. The question is, if they are truly keeping us safe, why wouldn't they simply just tell us that? Why wouldn't they have that debate in Congress? Why wouldn't they put that to a vote? Because if they were, and they could convince us that they were, they'd win the vote. Particularly, we all know the Patriot Act passed. One of the worst pieces of legislation in modern history passed. Why didn't we get a vote? I think if you read the report, the answer we clear. I'm sorry Joe. I went on for very long."
Snowden,"No, it was amazing. Don't apologize all. It's just completely fascinating that the continuation of this policy came down to one man and the president having this discussion. That is so ...."
Interviewer,It's much more.
Snowden,"... much more, but literally, the president ...."
Interviewer,"At the heart of it, yes. At the heart of it, in every expression of executive power, and by executive, we mean the White House here. The CIA, the NSA, the FBI, the DOJ, these guys exist as a part of the executive branch of government. In a real way, they work for the White House. Now there are laws and regulations and policies that are supposed to say they're supposed to do this and they're supposed to say they're not supposed to do that. When you look at federal regulations, when you look at policies as an employee of government, when you violate these policies, the worst thing that happens to you is you lose your job, because there's no criminal penalty for the violation of these laws. It's very easy for people who exist in these structures, particularly at the very top levels of these structures to go, ""Look, we have a given set of lawful authorities. These are defined very broadly to give us leeway to do whatever it is we think is proper and appropriate and just.""."
Snowden,"Now take that proper and appropriate and just from the perspective of any given individual, and any given president, now intersect that with what's good for them politically. That's where problems begin to arise. Now, the safety measure that's supposed to protect us from this in the US system and in any democracy, broadly is broadly is these people are supposed to be what are called public officials. That means we know their decisions. That means we know their policies. That means we know their programs and prerogatives and powers, what they are doing, both in our name and what they're doing against us. Because they are transparent to us, we the people, can then police their activities. We can go, ""I disagree with this."" We can protest it. We can campaign against it, right? We can try to become the president, do whatever."
Interviewer,"They are public officials and we are private citizens. They're not supposed to know anything about us, right? We, in relative terms, hold no power, and they hold all the power, so they have to be under the tightest constraints. We need to be in the freest circumstances. Yet the rise of the state secrets doctrine, this whole classification system that goes all the way back to last century about the middle of the last century, I believe, is when it really started getting tested in court. I think you know more about this in many cases than I do when you start talking about what happened in the FBI and the CIA and the NSA's old dirty work in the the 20th century, is they abuse their powers repeatedly and continuously. They did active harm to domestic politics in the United States."
Snowden,"The FBI was spying on Martin Luther King and trying to get Martin Luther King to kill himself before the Nobel Prize was going to be awarded. In fact, after MLK gave his a, I have a dream speech, two days later, the FBI classified him as the greatest national or I think it was the greatest national security threat in the United States. This is the FBI. This is the group that everybody's applauding today saying, ""Oh, these wonderful patriots and heroes."" Now. I'm not saying everybody in the FBI is bad. I'm not saying everybody at the CIA and NSA is bad. I'm saying that you don't become patriot based on where you work."
Interviewer,"Patriotism is not about a loyalty to to government. Patriotism in fact is not about loyalty to anything. Patriotism is a constant effort to do good for the people of your country, right? It's not about the government. It's not about the state. We'll get into loyalty later, because you know, I think one of the big criticisms against me that should be talked about is the go, ""Look, this guy is a disloyal. He broke an oath. He did whatever."" loyalty is a good thing when it's in the service of something good, but it is only good when it's in the service of something good. If you're loyal to a bad person, if you're loyal to a bad program, if you're loyal to a bad government, that that loyalty is actively harmful. I think that's overlooked."
Snowden,"Yeah, when you get back into this whole thing about where it came from, why it happened, how it could come out of just the small group and then they could slowly poison by implication, by complicity, by bringing them into the conspiracy and then having them not say anything about it, wider and wider body of people. Then once you've got enough people in on it, it's much easier to convince other people that it's legitimate. They can go, ""Look, we've got 30 people who know about this. None of them have objected to it. Why are you going to object to this?""."
Interviewer,"All of this derives from that original sin, which is in a democracy creating a system of government that is in fact a secret government, a body of secret law, a body of secret policy did us far what a legitimate government secrets could be. This is not say like government can have no secrecy at all. If the government wants to investigate someone without having them respond, we're talking traditional law enforcement. Sure. You're not going to tell this mobster, ""Hey, you know, we're going to start investigating you."" We the public don't need to know the names of every terrorist suspect out in the world, but we do need to know, again, the powers and programs, the policies that the government is asserting, at least the broad outlines of it. Otherwise, how can we control it? How do we know if the government is applying its authorities that are supposed to be granted to it by us if we don't know what it is that they're doing. This is the main thing and really the story behind the title, Permanent Record is look, Joe, when you were a kid, when I was a kid, when you were a teenager, what's the worst thing you ever said? Did you say anything you weren't proud of? Did you do anything that you weren't proud of? Something that today in the wokest of Twitterland you would get in trouble for."
Snowden,I'm sure. That's one of the horrible things about kids growing up today is that they do have all this stuff out there on social media forever. They can be judged horribly by something they did when they were 13.
Interviewer,"It's exactly that. Our worst mistakes, our deepest shames were forgotten, right? They were lost. They were ephemeral. Even the things we did get caught for it, they were known for a time, maybe they're still remembered by people who are closest to us, whether we like them or dislike them, but they were people connected to us. Now we're forced to live in a real way, naked before power. Whether we're talking about Facebook, whether we're talking about Google, whether we're talking about the government of any country, they know everything about us or much about us rather. We know very little about them. We're not allowed to know more. Everything that we do now lasts forever. Not because we want to remember, but because we're not allowed to forget."
Snowden,"Just carrying a phone in your pocket is enough for your movements to be memorialized, because every cell phone tower that you pass is keeping a record of that. AT&T keeps those records going back to 2008 under a program called Hemisphere. If you search for Hemisphere and AT&T, you'll get a story in the Daily Beast about it. AT&T keeps your phone records going back to 1983. If any of your listeners were born after 1983, born after me, or it might be 1987 excuse me, 1987. If they were born after 1987, and they're an AT&T customer or their calls cross AT&T's network, AT&T has every phone call they ever made, the record that it happened, not necessarily the content that's on the phone call."
Interviewer,"I mean the, let me turn this around for you Joe, cause I feel like I've just been giving a speech. When you look at this stuff, when you look at what's happening with government, when you look and see what's happening with the Trump White House, the Obama White House, the Bush White House, you could see this trend happening. When you look at what's happening with Facebook, when you look at what's happening with Google, when you look at the fact that you go to every restaurant today and you see people looking at phones. You get on a bus, you get on a subway, you see somebody sitting next to you in traffic, you see people looking at phones. These devices are connected all the time. Now people are getting Alexa, right? Now people have OK Google, they have Siri on their phones. They're in their house. They've always got these connected microphones. Where do you think this leads? What is it that gives you trust in the system, faith in the system? Just so we can start a conversation here. What strikes you about this?"
Snowden,"Well, it's completely alien. It's new. This is something that's unprecedented. We don't have a long human history of being completely connected via technology. This is something we're navigating right now for the first time. It's probably the most powerful thing that the human race has ever seen in terms of the distribution of information. There's nothing that even comes close to it in all of human history. We're figuring out as we go along. What you exposed is that not only are we figuring out as we go along, but that to cover their ass, these cell phone companies in cahoots with the government have made it legal for them to gather up all of your phone calls, all of your text messages, all of your emails, and store them somewhere, so that retroactively if you ever say anything they don't like or do something they don't like, they can go back, find that and use it against you."
Interviewer,"We don't know who they are. We don't know why they're doing it. We didn't know they could do it until you exposed it. The connection of human beings via technology is both amazing and powerful and incredible in terms of our access to knowledge, but terrifying in terms of the government's ability to track our movements, track your phone calls, track everything, and under the guise of protecting us from terrorists and protecting us from sleeper cells, protecting us from attacks. Look, if they really are protecting us from these attacks, that's great. There's no provision in the constitution that allows any of this. This is where it gets really squirrely because they're making up the rules as they go along. They're making up these rules, the way you're describing it, is a step by step. This has happened to protect their ass and keep themselves from being implicated in what has been a violation of our rights and our privacies and the Fourth Amendment."
Snowden,"Yeah, I mean, I think one of the things that everybody needs to understand when you look at these things and the reason we talked about before when I got this information, why I didn't just put it on the internet and people criticize me for this. They go, ""I didn't share enough information,"" because the journalists are gate keeping. They've got a big archive. They haven't published everything from it. I told them not to publish everything."
Interviewer,Why did you do that?
Snowden,They're actually following my instructions.
Interviewer,Why did you do that?
Snowden,"Because, so again, it gets back to legitimate secrets and illegitimate secrets. Some spying from my perspective, ""career spy"" is okay, right?"
Interviewer,Agreed.
Snowden,"If you have hacked a terrorist phone, and you're getting some information about that, useful."
Interviewer,Agreed. Yeah.
Snowden,"If you're spying on a Russian general in charge of a rocket division useful, right? There are lines and degrees in that where it's not useful. Now the examples that I just gave you, these are targeted. This is where you're spying on an individual. They're a known, named person that is being monitored for specific reason that is related ...."
Interviewer,"Hopefully, from a warrant."
Snowden,"... broadly to things that people ... Even for foreign intelligence and some indications, you don't need a warrant strictly. Although, I think they should have warrants for all of these investigations because they established a court for precisely this reason called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, right? There's not a judge in the world who wouldn't stamp a warrant saying, ""Hey, spy on Abu Jihad over here."" Right? If you want to a spy on another guy Boris Badenoff of the rocket division, that that's okay. They're going to go with that."
Interviewer,"Then you look at these edge cases in the archive that are provided to journalists that have been stories that have come down where they've spied on journalists, right? They've spied on human rights groups. These kinds of things, I think people miss. I'm going to throw up some slides here, so forgive me if this gets weird, and I put up the wrong ones. Since I came forward, this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the government says authorized these programs 15 different times was overruled by the first open courts to look at the program. These are federal courts here, that said, ""No, actually these programs are unlawful. They're likely unconstitutional.""."
Snowden,"When you start looking at the facts, you see even within the context of the very loose restrictions and laws that apply to the NSA and surveillance, they broke their own laws 2,776 times in a single year. Then you asked about that thing that motivates me, why I came forward. We had been trying as a country, before I came forward, to prove the existence of these programs legally. This is our means of last recourse in our system, right? We got the executive. We got the legislature. We got the judiciary. Right? Congress makes the laws. The executive's supposed to carry them out. The courts are supposed to play referee. The executive had broken the laws. Congress was turning a blind eye to the law. The courts were in, this is just months before I came forward going, ""Well, it does appear that the ACLU and Amnesty International,"" all of these human rights groups in nongovernmental organizations had established that these programs are likely unlawful. They likely exist. They're simply classified. The government responded with this argument that you just saw saying that, ""Well, it's a state secret if they do exist."" You the plaintiffs don't ...."
Interviewer,"It's a state secret if they do exist. You the plaintiffs don't have hard concrete evidence that they do exist and the government is saying, legally, you have no right to discover evidence from the government, right, documents, demand documents or demand an answer from the government as to whether or not these things exist because the government's just going to give it's standard, what they call glamor response, we can neither confirm nor deny that these things exist. Which leaves you out in the cold, which leaves the courts out in the cold."
Snowden,"The courts go, look, the government could be breaking the law here. Look, they could be violating the constitution here, but because you can't prove it, and because the government doesn't want to play ball, and the government says, if we were doing this, it would be legal and it would be necessary for national security or whatever. The court can't presume to know national security better than the executive because the courts aren't elected."
Interviewer,"And so this leads to this fundamentally broken system where, okay, the only way to have the courts review the legality of the programs is to establish the programs exist. But the programs are classified, so you can't establish the exist unless you have evidence. But providing that evidence to courts, to journalists, to anyone is a felony, right, that's punishable by 10 years per count under the espionage act. And the government has charged every source of public interest journalism who's really made a significant difference in these kinds of cases since Daniel Ellsberg, really going back to that, under the same espionage act. It's always the same law and there's no distinction to government between whether you've sold information to a foreign government for private benefit or whether you provide an information only to journalists for the public interest. And that's a fundamentally harmful thing I think. When you look at things that have come in the wake of this, we're talking about the the post 2013 court rulings that found what the government was doing was unlawful. You see the courts saying actually that leaks, or air quotes, leaks can actually be beneficial. Leak is used in the governance, and this is from a federal court, these are not exactly my biggest supporters. They are recognizing that although leak implies harm, it implies something that's broken, it's actually helpful. It's a leak that's letting in daylight, in this context, that is the only thing that allows the system to operate in a context where one year before I came forward, we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff didn't happen."
Snowden,"We had a hang on this famous exchange, which more than anything made me realize this was a point of no return because I've told you this, you've heard this, but if you haven't seen it, you might not believe me, right? Maybe I'm a sketchy guy, whatever. One of those senators I told you that objected to this stuff, that was doing the Lassie barks for all those years, Ron Wyden, was confronting the most senior spy in the United States, General James Clapper, who was then the director of national intelligence, right."
Interviewer,"There's no guy higher than him, the buck stops with him when it comes to intelligence. He's testifying under oath in front of Congress, right, but more broadly, in front of the public, this is televised. And Ron Wyden asked him a very specific question about a program mind you that Ron Wyden knows exists because he has security clearance, he sits on the intelligence committee, and he knows there's domestic mass surveillance and this is how it goes, this is how the top spy responds under oath."
Snowden,Mr. Wyden:.
Interviewer,"So, what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question, does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"
Snowden,Clapper:.
Interviewer,No sir.
Snowden,Mr. Wyden:.
Interviewer,It does not.
Snowden,Clapper:.
Interviewer,Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly.
Snowden,Mr. Wyden:.
Interviewer,All right.
Snowden,"So, that was a lie. Widen knew it was a lie, Clapper knew it was a lie, he actually admitted it was a lie after I came forward three months later. But he said it was the least untruthful thing he could think of to say in the context of being in the hot seat there."
Interviewer,"But what does it mean for a democracy when you can lie under oath to Congress, and the Congressman even knows you're lying to them, but they're afraid to correct you. And by the way, it wasn't a surprise, Widen gave him those questions 24 hours in advance, and he wrote a letter afterwards asking for Clapper to amend his testimony, right. Not even in the press conference, but just to say this was incorrect, whatever, so he could go through the legal process and show his fellow Congressman that there was a problem and that they needed to do it."
Snowden,"But all of that was refused to us. All of it was denied to us. And here I am sitting at the NSA, next to my buddies who I've talked to about these programs. I've gone, look at this, and they're laughing at it. I'm laughing at it. And it's not that we go, Oh ha ha, he's getting away with it. It's like, what are you going to do? These guys, they're bullshitters, that the system is built on lies. That even many people, many experts who have studied this, know are lies. But if you can't prove they are lies, how do you move beyond that? And that's really a question that has never been more relevant than I think it is today under the current White House."
Interviewer,"So, you're in this position where you have this information and you know that these surveillance systems are in place and they're unconstitutional, and you feel this deep responsibility to let the American people know about this, what makes you take the leap?"
Snowden,So this is covered extensively in the book because it took a long time.
Interviewer,I would imagine.
Snowden,"Yeah, right, exactly. People like to think it's like a cinematic moment where I find this golden document, like the stellar wind report, and that's the closest thing to a smoking gun, right, that exists. But look, if you found that, you can read that later, look at that and imagine yourself being like, oh, I'm going to go outside on the courthouse steps, and wave this thing, and burn my life to the ground, burn my family to the ground, I'm never going to be working again, I'm going to jail for the rest of my life. The question is, what would it take for you to light a match and burn your life to the ground?"
Interviewer,"For a long time, too long, the answer was nothing, and I'm ashamed of that. It took me so long to get over that hump because I was waiting for somebody else to do it. When I saw people like Ron Wyden on this, when I saw people like the court case that I showed before where people were actively challenging these programs, right? Journalists had the scent of it and there are a lot of people who are going to be in the YouTube comments or whatever and go, I knew this was happening, no you didn't."
Snowden,"Well, Bill Bimini-."
Interviewer,You had ... Bill Binney.
Snowden,"Excuse me, Bill Binney, he initially was the one that came out and spoke about this issue and i-."
Interviewer,"So, yeah, Bill Binney is part of, shall we say the group of early NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas Drake, Bill Binney, Kirk Weeby, I believe and Ed Loomis. And these guys all got their doors kicked in, they got harassed by the FBI. Tom Drake, who was a senior executive at the NSA, this is guy who had a lot to lose, was charged under the same law, it was the espionage act. And these guys who were doing it earlier, during the Bush administration, some of them were talking to the journalists, maybe it's alleged, I don't want to put them on the spot, maybe they deny, maybe they don't, leave that to them. But somebody somewhere was informing this reporting, right, that got into the New York times about the Bush era warrant less wiretapping program. And eventually journalist put this out there. People knew these capabilities existed."
Snowden,"But yeah, then there's the person in the YouTube comments who was like, we knew all about this, this is nothing new. And the thing is you can know about some programs and not know about others. You can have a suspicion, you can know with a certainty that this stuff is capable or is is possible, the capability exists. You can know that the government has done this stuff in the past, you can know they are likely to do it again, you can have all these indications, you can have them like the Jewel versus NSA case that's run by the EFF, which is about AT&T setting up secret rooms in there telecommunications facilities where they basically drag all the fibers for their domestic internet communications and phone communications into a room that's purpose built for the NSA and then they bring it out."
Interviewer,"But AT&T denies it's the NSA. The NSA denies that these things happen or that are done at all, right. And so this is the context. You say you know, and let me put it either way, maybe you do know, right, maybe you are a an academic researcher, maybe you're a technological specialist, maybe you're just somebody who reads all the reporting and you actually know, you can't prove it, but you know this is going on. But that's the thing in a democracy, the distance between speculation and fact, the distance between what you know and what you can prove to everybody else in the country is everything in our model of government, because what you know doesn't matter, what matters is what we all know. And the only way we can all know it is if somebody can prove it. If you can prove it, and if you don't have the evidence, you can't prove it."
Snowden,"And of course when we talk about the earlier stuff, right, like the more corporatized media, they've got a thousand incentives not to get involved in this stuff. They need access to the White House. They need these officials to sit down with them and give interviews, right, that's constant content that they need, that's access that they need. They need to be taken seriously. They need to be admitted to briefers. It is a codependent relationship. And so the only way to make sure people understand this broadly is if we all work together, right? If we collectively can establish a corpus of evidence, right, a body of facts that is so large and so persuasive it overcomes the natural and understandable resistance of these more corporatized media groups, it overcomes the political and partisan loyalties that all of these political factions in the country do. Where they go, it's my president, even if I don't like this stuff, even if I don't agree with this stuff, I don't want to say it exists. I want to deny it until it's proved in HD on video, signing the order to do this, that or the other because otherwise there's a chance my guy might not get reelected. And that's the only way this kind of stuff can happen."
Interviewer,"And the sad fact is the opportunities that we have to prove this, the moments in history where we do prove something, anything beyond a reasonable doubt are so few and so rare that they almost always only come from whistleblowers. And I think that's one of the problems that we have particularly in the climate movement. . Go ahead."
Snowden,"I'm sorry. Did you take any comfort from knowing that Obama, when he was running for office and in his hope and change website, he had provisions to protect whistleblowers, and provisions to reward people, right? I mean do you remember all that? I mean it was eventually redacted or eventually deleted it from the website, but that's."
Interviewer,"Yeah, it disappeared from the website."
Snowden,"Yes. But that was a big part of his program. What he was running on was that, when people were exposing unlawful activity, he was going to protect those people. Did you take any comfort in that?"
Interviewer,"Well, Obama also, during his campaign said, he campaigned actively against the warrant less wiretapping, the Bush administration because remember bushes in the scandal in the height of this on 2007, the election is coming up right after and Obama is saying, that's not who we are, that's not what we do. And yet, within a hundred days of him becoming the president, now he's sitting in that chair, rather than extinguishing these programs, he embraces them and expands them. ."
Snowden,Why do you think that is?
Interviewer,"I think it's actually again what we talked about earlier. First thing, every time a new president comes into the white house, they get their clearances, right. They get read into all this stuff. During the campaign they get clearances and they get read in on stuff. But when they finally become president, right, now they're the only people who can sign what these are called the covert action findings and things like that. Which are basically the intelligence community wants to assassinate somebody, they want to run this illegal program here, there or everywhere, and they can't do it because they are executive agencies without that top level executive sign off. So they got to open the vest, right. They got to get these guys on side."
Snowden,"And basically every president since Kennedy, they had been successful in what they call fearing up. Where as soon as they come in, they read you the litany of horribles. And they go, these are all the threats that we're facing, and let's be real, it is a dangerous world. It's not just all made up BS. Some of it is, right, where it's inflated, it's not that it's completely false but they make it sound more serious than it actually is. But there are real bad people out there who are trying to do real bad things and you have just gone through a hellish election because our electoral politics are so diseased."
Interviewer,"And now, after you've crawled through fire, you're already thinking four years ahead. How do I stay in this seat? And these guys are basically saying, if you don't do X, Y, and Z, this is going to fall on your lap. And the implication, which I don't think they actually say but every president knows, is these guys can undermine you to death. If you've got the IC against you, right, they can stonewall you, they can put out the stories that are going to be problematic for you everyday of your presidency."
Snowden,"And it's not that it's necessarily going to cast you out of the White House, but it's a problem that as president you very much don't want. So in the most charitable interpretation of this, you've got a new guy coming in, and in Obama's case, this is a pretty young guy. Doesn't focus in this kind of national security foreign policy stuff throughout his earlier career, he's more interested in domestic policy and always has been, that's actually one of the positive things to say about Barack Obama. He's just trying to make things better at home."
Interviewer,"And now suddenly they go, look, you need to worry about this country. You need to worry about this group that you've never heard of, you need to worry about this technology, you need to do all this stuff. And the only reason we can tell you this stuff, and the only thing dividing America and the abyss are these terrible, terrible programs, right, that are in fact wonderful things because they keep back the darkness."
Snowden,"And so here's the real problem, every president hears that and every president, first off, they've got so many other things to do is they just kind of nod their head and they'll go, I'll deal with this later in my administration, and this is one of the ironies. When I came forward in 2013, right, this is now Barack Obama, second term president. One of the responses that they had to the mass surveillance scandal was, yes, we think they went a little too far, this is after the initial thing where they went, nobody's listening to your phone calls, [crosstalk nobody can have perfect privacy and also have perfect security so we got to divide a line here between the constitution and what the government wants to do."
Interviewer,"But they said, we were going to get to it. We knew these programs were problematic, but if they just gave us more time, we would've fixed them. Maybe it's true, right. Seems awful convenient in hindsight throughout the entirety of the first term."
Snowden,"Well, it seems like what you would say if you got caught."
Interviewer,"Right. But look, if we're being the most generous, that we are here, the president is briefed on real and legitimate threats, and they scare the hell out of him."
Snowden,I'm sure.
Interviewer,"And we can all imagine being there, right? Those, those of us who remember what the world was like post 911, fear is a powerful thing. But the guys who are doing that briefing, they're no longer scared of it because they've been dealing with this for years. This is the oldest thing. They've given this briefing times before. People talk about the deep state, right. They talk about it like some conspiracy of lizard people, it's not that, it's something much simpler. The deep state is simply the career government. It's the people who are in the same offices, who outlive and outlast presidencies, right. They've seen Republicans, they've seen Democrats, they don't really care, and they give that same briefing again and again and they get good at it."
Snowden,"They know what they want, they know what this person is saying, where as the president, they don't know who these people are. These people have been there before the president, they're going to be there after the president, and so they give this very effective, very fear inducing speech, and then they follow it up with their asks, which are really demands just politely provided. And anyone in that position who is not an expert on this stuff, who is not ready for this trade off, and who you have to understand is a career politician is entirely used to the horse trading game, right. And go, I'll deal with this later, or not now, or what is the cost benefit here."
Interviewer,"And the intelligence community goes, if you give us what we want, no one will ever know about it because it's classified, it's obviously the easy answer. And maybe Barack Obama honestly did want to get to this later, but what we can say today is, for all the good that may have been done in that White House, this is an issue where the president went through two full terms and did not fix the problem, but in fact made it worse."
Snowden,"ll, it seems like the president has a job that's absolutely impossible and if you come across someone who has been in the position, like someone who's the head of an intelligence agency for a long time, and is very persuasive, and has some legitimate credentials that show that he's very good at his job, but he tells you this is important for national security, we need to keep these things in place, it doesn't seem like any one person can run the country and be aware of every single program that every single agency is implementing. It seems completely unrealistic. And the job itself, it doesn't seem like any person can do it adequately. And when it comes to something like this mass surveillance state, I could see a president being persuaded by someone who comes to him and says, this is why we need to do this."
Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, one of the things that I think is the underlying problem in everything that you just described, is the president has too much power."
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,"And because they have too much power, that means they have too much responsibility. And I don't think people understand, if they haven't lived outside the United States, if they haven't traveled or studied broadly just how exceptional the American presidency is. Most countries don't have a single individual with this level of power. It's really only the superstates and that may be by design perhaps, that's why they're super States. But when we look at complex advanced democracies that are more peaceful, they tend to have a more multi-lateral system that has more people involved in smaller portfolios. And a lot of this derives from just the size of the government."
Snowden,"Like you said, the president is responsible for basically everything in the executive branch, and the executive branch is basically every agency that actually does any work. And so, how do you correct for that without breaking it up where you have smaller ministers and ministries and things like that that have different levels of responsibility? Having a smaller government overall."
Interviewer,"Back in 1776, the federal government was pretty much a dream. We weren't even interested in having standing armies. The idea of an army that existed from year to year was a terrifying forbidding thing. And then when you moved this idea that we have a president, that they have these extraordinary powers, it's okay because the government is very small. The federal government especially is seen as the small and toothless and weak thing.."
Snowden,"Can you pause for one second? Pause for one second because my Air Pods are about to die and I'm going to swap over to another pair. These suckers are good for a couple hours, but we're two hours and 15 minutes here. We'll have a little bit of a weird audio issue with the last half of it but Jamie will take care of it."
Interviewer,"I wanted to talk about you, like where you are right now in your life and how you're handling this because you've been in exile for, how many years now?"
Snowden,It's been more than six years.
Interviewer,Six years.
Snowden,"June of 2013, yeah. I mean, well actually I left May, so."
Interviewer,"What is life like? Are you in constant hiding? I mean, what are the issues like?"
Snowden,"In the beginning, my operational security level as we would call it, was very high. I was concerned about being recognized, I was concerned about being followed, I was concerned really about very bad things happening to me because the government made it very clear that from their position I was the most wanted man in the world."
Interviewer,"They literally brought down the president of Bolivia, his aircraft, and would not let it depart as it tried to cross the airspace of Europe, not even the United States. They wouldn't let it leave until they confirmed I was not on board. So, yeah, that made me a little bit nervous. But you can't live like that forever. And although I was as careful as I could be, I still lived a pretty happily because I was an indoor cat to begin with, right. I've always been a technologist. I've always been pretty nerdy. So as long as I have a screen and an internet connection, I was pretty happy."
Snowden,"But in the years past, my life has become more and more open. Now I speak openly, I live openly, I go out, I ride the Metro, I go to restaurants. I go walks in the park."
Interviewer,How often do you get recognized?
Snowden,"So this is a funny thing is I'm almost never recognized. One of those things is I don't give Russian interviews because I don't want my face all over the news, which is nice because it just allows people to forget about my face and I can go about my life. But it's one of the weird things that I'm recognized a couple times a year, even when I'm not wearing my glasses in a museum, or a grocery store, or something like that, or out on the street just by somebody who I swear like these people are, you might've wrote a story about them, super recognizers the people who just have a great memory for faces because I can be wearing in hood and a jacket, it can have a scarf around my face like in the winter, and you can barely see my face and they'll come up to me and they're like, are you Snowden and I'm like, that's pretty impressive."
Interviewer,What do you say?
Snowden,"I'd say, yeah, it's nice to meet you. And yeah, I've never had a negative interaction from being recognized. But for me, because I'm a privacy advocate, I would much rather go unrecognized, I don't want to be a celebrity. But the other thing is, I'll get recognized in computer stores and I think there's just a mental association where people are like their brain when it's cycling through faces that it recognizes, it's going through the subset of nerdier people or something like that when you're in a computer store because for whatever reason, I'm recognized much more frequently when there's some technological locusts."
Interviewer,"So you're living freely, you had to learn Russian. Did you learn it-."
Snowden,"Yeah. I mean my Russian is still pretty crappy to my great shame because all of my life, all of my work is primarily in English, right."
Interviewer,"Now, you've talked about returning home if you could get a fair trial. Is that a feasible thing? A fair trial for someone like you. Is that even possible?"
Snowden,"Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, look, if we're being Frank, I think all of your audience knows, the chance of me getting a fair shake in the Eastern district of Virginia, a couple miles from the headquarters of the CIA is probably pretty slim because that's where they draw the jury pool from, right? But my objection here is on a larger principle, right? What happens to me is less important, right? If I spend the rest of my life in jail, that's less important than what I'm actually requiring the government to agree to, which is a single thing, right?"
Interviewer,"They say, face the music, face the music, and I'm saying, great, let's pick the song. The thing is, the law that I've been charged under, the one that all these whistleblowers have been charged on her, Thomas Drake, Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning, Daniel Hale the drone whistleblower who is in prison right now going through a trial that is precisely similar to what I would be facing. His lawyer is asking the court or telling the court that we want to tell the jury why he did what he did. That the government is violating laws, the government is violating human rights, that these programs are immoral, that they are unethical. This is what motivated this guy to do it and the jury should be able to hear why he did what he did, and the jury should be able to decide whether that was right or wrong."
Snowden,"And the government has responded to this whistleblower argument basically saying, ""We demand the court, forbid this guy from breathing the word whistleblower in court. He cannot talk about what motivated him. He cannot talk about what was revealed, why it was revealed, what the impacts and effects were, and he can't talk about whether the public benefited from it or was harmed by it because it doesn't matter.""."
Interviewer,"Now this might surprise a lot of people because to a lot of us, we think that's what a jury trial is. We think that's what a fair trial is. But the espionage act that the government uses against whistle blowers, meaning broadly here, the sources of journalism, is fairly unique in the legal system in that it is what's called a strict liability crime. A strict liability crime is what the government considers to be basically a crime worse than murder because if you murdered somebody, if you just, I don't know, beat Jamie with the microphone stand right now, you would be able to go to the court and say, it was self defense, right. You felt threatened, you were in danger for your life, even if you weren't, right. Even though you obviously weren't. Even if you are on tape, you could still argue that and the jury could go, you're full of crap, right? And they could convict you."
Snowden,"But if you were in fact acting in self defense, if the jury did in fact believe you, they could take that into consideration in establishing their verdict, right. Strict liability crimes forbid that. The jury is not allowed to consider why you committed a crime. They're only allowed to consider if you committed a crime. They're not allowed to consider if the murder was justified, they're only allowed to consider if the murder took place. And the funny thing in this case is that the murder that we're talking about is telling the truth."
Interviewer,"The espionage act in every case is a law the government exclusively uses against people who told the truth, right. That's what it's about in the context of journalism. They don't bring the espionage act against people who lied, then they would use fraud or some other statute. They say, the government is arguing in the context of whistle blowing, that telling a important truth to the American people by way of a journalist is a crime worse than murder. And I believe, and I think most Americans would agree, this is fundamentally in defensively wrong."
Snowden,"And so my whole argument with the United States government since the very beginning was, Ben, I'll be back for a jury trial tomorrow, but you have to agree to permit whistleblowers a public interest defense. It doesn't matter whether they are a whistleblower or not, it's just they argued, it's the jury that decides whether they are a whistleblower or not. They have to be able to consider the motivations of why someone did what they did. The government says, ""We refuse to allow that because that puts the government on trial, and we don't trust the jury to consider those questions.""."
Interviewer,"Wow. So you have had these conversations then, so this has been discussed?"
Snowden,"No, this is from the Obama administration. There's been no contact since the Trump administration because the government basically when they got to this point, they went, we have no good argument against this, and we will never permit this to happen. And again, I just want to make clear, this is not speculation, this is not me thinking, this is actively happening in the case of Daniel Hale right now, I hope you guys can pull up a graphic for it because this story just hit the papers like two or three weeks ago saying the government is forbidding this guy from making this argument."
Interviewer,"So, you're seemingly in a state of limbo then. They're not actively pursuing you. It seems if you're able to move around freely, they haven't discovered where you are, you're just free to live your life."
Snowden,"Well, yeah. I mean, it's one of these things where whether they know where I am or whether they don't know where I am, where I put my head on the pillow, it doesn't matter so much. I'm in Russia, right, and we should lean into that because I think people, they hear Russia particularly in the context of today's news, and you see what people are saying about Tulsa Gabbert and things like that. Any kind of a association, anytime your name appears in the same sentence, same paragraph, same story as the word Russia, it's considered a negative thing now."
Interviewer,"And don't get me wrong, I've been a longtime critic of the Russian government. I just actually had a major story written about me in a Russian state news outlet called RIA Novosti, you guys could probably pull it, it's only in Russian though. That saying, because I spoke favorably about a member of the Russian opposition Alexei Nevalny, which I wasn't even speaking positively about this guy I was saying, look, I think people have a right to express their opposition in a country."
Snowden,"... To express their opposition in a country, and they should be able to do that without fearing retaliation the future. Because the background here is this opposition figure has been a long time thorn in the Russian administration side, and they've just suddenly, magically, been accused of being foreign agents or something like that. And so everyone connected to this, which is like a big civil society body, had their doors simultaneously kicked in across the country and they're being investigated for some kind of corruption or something, it doesn't even matter."
Interviewer,"I said I oppose that, just like I was tweeting footage of ballot stuffing in the Russian elections, just like I've criticized the Russian president by name. I've criticized Russian surveillance laws. There's so many things again and again and again and again and again. But yeah, so look, it does not make my life easier to be trapped in a country that I did not choose. And people don't remember this. I was actually on route to Latin America when the US government canceled my passport, which trapped me in Russia. And for those who are interested, again, I wrote an entire book that has a lot of detail on this, but yeah, it's difficult to be a basically engaged in civil opposition to policies of the United States government at the same time as the Russian government. It's a hard thing, it's not a happy thing, but I feel like it's a necessary thing."
Snowden,"The problem is nobody wants to talk about that. Nobody wants to engage in that kind of nuance. Nobody wants to consider those kinds of conversations in the current world. People believe, and this is actually one of the worst things that western media does in the context of discussing Russia, is they create this aura of invincibility around the Russian president. They go, ""This guy's calling all the shots, he's pulling all the strings. This guy's in charge of the world."" And that's very useful for the Russian government broadly, because they can then take that and replay that on their domestic media and they're going to go, ""Look how strong we are. The Americans are afraid of us. The Chinese are afraid of is that everybody's afraid of us. The French are afraid of us. We are strong.""."
Interviewer,"There's no question that Russia's going to be interfering in elections. There's no question that America's going to be interfering in Russian elections, right? Nobody likes to talk about this. And again, I need to substantiate that now that I've said that, I've got an old note that I've signed a billion times. The New York Times published a story in the wake of this contested 2016 election where they looked into the history of electoral interference in Russia and the Soviet union, and they found in roughly 50 years, 36 different cases of election interference by Russia or the Soviets. This is not a new thing. This is something that always happens because that's what intelligence services do. That's what they think they're being paid for, which is a sad thing, but it's a reality, because we aren't wise enough to separate covert action from intelligence gathering."
Snowden,"But in that same study that they found 36 different cases by the Russians and the Soviets, they found 81 different cases by the US, and this was published by Scott Chain in the New York Times and both The Washington Post as well. But this is the thing. There is a way to criticize the Russian government's policies without criticizing the Russian people who are ordinary people who just want to have a happy life. They just want to do better. They want the same things that you do, right? And every time people go, ""Oh, Russia, Russia, Russia."" Every time people go, ""Russia bad."" Every time they go, ""Russia's doing this."" They go, ""Russia's doing that."" Russian people who have nothing to do with the government feel implicated by that. Do you feel like you're in charge of Donald Trump? Do you want to be ... Have Donald Trump's legacy around your neck?"
Interviewer,"Then people go, ""Oh, well, you could overthrow Donald Trump, you could overthrow Putin."" Can you really? Is that how it works? So, yeah, I mean, look, I have no affiliation. I have no love for the Russian government. It's not my choice to be here, and I've made it very clear I would be happy to return home-."
Snowden,"Is there any concern that they would deny you visa? I mean, how are you staying there?"
Interviewer,"It's a good question. So I have permanent residence. People think I'm under asylum, but I'm no longer ... It's like a a green card now. It's got to be renewed every three years. So yeah, sure. It's possible they could kick me out. And this was what the story I was telling you about before in Russian media was, they were saying the Russian government should take some action against me or I shouldn't be welcomed here, or I should go home. Because why is he criticizing the Russian government, when they're the people who are keeping Americans away?"
Snowden,Is that like the Russian version of Fox News? Is that what they have over there.
Interviewer,"I don't know enough about Russian media to tell you. I think it's supposed to be more like a Reuters or Associated Press, but hell by now. But the thing is this. What's the alternative, right? Yes. The Russian government could screw me, but they could screw me even if I didn't say anything. And so should I shut up and be quiet in the face of things that I think are injustices because it makes me safer? Well, a lot of pragmatic people will say, ""Yeah."" They say, ""You've done enough."" They say, ""You've done your part."" They say whatever, ""Be safe, live long, be happy."" But I didn't come forward to be safe. If I wanted to be safe, I'd still be sitting in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of money to spy on all of you. And nobody ever would have known about this, the system would have gotten worse. But the system, the world, the future gets worse every day that we don't do something about it."
Snowden,"Every day that we stay silent about all the injustices we see, the world gets worse, things get worse. And yeah, it's risky. Yeah, it's uncomfortable. But that's why we do it, because if we don't, no one else will. All those years I was sitting hoping for someone else to come forward and no one did, that's because I was waiting for a hero. But there are no heroes. There's only heroic decisions. You are never further than one decision away from making a difference. It doesn't matter whether it's a big difference, doesn't matter if it was a small difference because you don't have to save the world by yourself. In fact, you can't. All you have to do is lay down one brick. All you have to do is make things a little bit better in a small way so the other people can lay their brick on top of that or beside that. And together, step by step, day by day, year by year, we build the foundation of something better, but yeah, it's not going to be safe."
Interviewer,"But it doesn't matter because individually it's not me, whoever you are, that's the iron man. I don't care if you're the biggest doomsday prepper with cans full of beans. If the world ends, it's going to affect you. We make things better. We become safe together. Collectively, that is our strength. That is the power of civilization. That is the power that shapes the future. Because even if you make life great for you, you're going to die someday, you're going to be forgotten someday, your cans of beans are going to rot someday. You can make things safer, you can be more careful, you can be more clever, and there's nothing wrong with that. But at the end of the day, you have to recognize if you're trying to eliminate all risks from your life, what you're actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life. You're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes such that what you've lost is freedom. You've lost the ability to act because you're afraid. That's what got us into this mess."
Snowden,"That's a beautiful way to put it. Are you aware at all of the current state of surveillance, and what, if anything, has changed since your revelations?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, the big thing that's changed since I was ... In 2013 is now it's mobile first everything. Mobile was still a big deal, and the intelligence community was very much grappling to get its hands around it and to deal with it, but now people are much less likely to use a laptop than use a desktop than use, God, any kind of wired phone than they are to use a smart phone. And both Apple and Android devices unfortunately are not especially good in protecting your privacy. Think right now. You've got a smart phone, right? You might be listening to this on a train somewhere and in traffic right now, or you Joe right now, you've got a phone somewhere in the room, right?"
Snowden,"The phone is turned off, or at least the screen is turned off. It's sitting there, it's powered on. And if somebody sends you a message, the screen blinks to life. How does that happen? How is it that if someone from any corner of the earth dials a number, your phone rings and nobody else's rings? How is it that you can dial anybody else's number and only their phone rings? Every smartphone, every phone at all is constantly connected to the nearest cellular tower. Every phone. Even when the screen is off, you think it's doing nothing, you can't see it because radio frequency emissions are invisible. It's screaming in the air saying, ""Here I am, here I am. Here is my IMEI. I think it's individual manufacturers equipment identity, and IMEI, individual manufacturers, subscriber identity."" I could be wrong on the the breakout there, but the acronyms are the IMEI and the IMSI, and you can search for these things."
Interviewer,"They're two globally unique identifiers that only exist anywhere in the world in one place. This makes your phone different than all the other phones. The IMEI is burned into the handset of your phone. No matter what SIM card you change to, it's always going to be the same and it's always going to be telling the phone network. It's this physical handset. Then the IMESI is in your SIM card, right, and this is what holds your phone number. It's basically the key, the right to use that phone number. So your phone is sitting there doing nothing you think, but it's constantly shouting and saying, ""I'm here."" Who is closest to me that's a cell phone tower? And every cell phone tower with its big ears is listening for these little cries for help and going, ""Oh right, I see Joe Rogan's phone. I see Jamie's phone, I see all these phones that are here right now.""."
Snowden,"And it compares notes with the other network towers and your smartphone compares notes with them to go, ""Who do I hear the loudest?"" And who you hear the loudest is a proxy for proximity for closeness, distance. They go, ""Whoever I hear more loudly than anybody else, that's close to me."" So you're going to be bound to this cell phone tower and that cell phone tower is going to make a note, a permanent record saying, ""This phone handset with this phone number at this time was connected to me."" And based on your phone handset and your phone number, they can get your identity, because you pay for this stuff with your credit card and everything like that. And even if you don't, it's still active at your house overnight. It's still active on your nightstand when you're sleeping, it's still whatever."
Interviewer,"The movements of your phone are the movements of you as a person. And those are often quite uniquely identifying. It goes to your home, it goes to your workplace. Other people don't have it. Sorry. And anyway. It's constantly shouting this out and then it compares notes with the other parts of the network, and when somebody is trying to get to a phone, it compares notes of the network, compares notes to go, ""Where is this phone with this phone number in the world right now?"" And to that cell phone tower that is closest to that phone, it sends out a signal saying, ""We have a call for you, make your phone start ringing so your owner can answer it."" And then it connects it across this whole path. But what this means is that whenever you're carrying a phone, whenever the phone is turned on, there's a record of your presence at that place that is being made and created by companies."
Snowden,"It does not need to be kept forever. And in fact, there's no good argument for it to be kept forever. But these companies see that as valuable information, right? This is the whole big data problem that we're running into, and all this information that used to be ephemeral, where were you when you were eight years old? Where'd you go after you had a bad breakup? Who'd you spend the night with? Who'd you call after? All this information used to be ephemeral, meaning it disappeared like the morning dew. It would be gone. No one would remember it, but now these things are stored. Now these things are saved. It doesn't matter whether you're doing anything wrong, it doesn't matter whether you're the most ordinary person on earth, because that's how bulk collection, which is the government's euphemism for mass surveillance works."
Interviewer,"They simply collected all in advance in hopes that one day it will become useful. And that was just talking about how you connect to the phone network. That's not talking about all those apps on your phone that are contacting the network even more frequently. How do you get a text message notification? How do you get an email notification? How is it the Facebook knows where you're at? All of these things, these analytics, they are trying to keep track through location services on your phone, through GPS, through even just what wireless access points you're connected to, because there's a global constantly updated map. There's actually many of them of wireless access points in the world because just like we talked about, every phone has a unique identifier that's globally unique, every wireless access point in the world, right?"
Snowden,"Your cable modem at home, whether it's in your laptop, every device that has a radio modem has a globally unique identifier in it, and this is standard term, you can look it up and these things can be mapped when they're broadcasting in the air because again, like your phone says to the cell phone tower, ""I have this identifier."" The cell phone tower responds and says, ""I had this identifier."" And anybody who's listening, they can write these things down. And all those Google street view cars that go back and forth, right? They're keeping notes on whose wifi is active on this block. And then they build it into a giant map."
Interviewer,"So even if you have GPS turned off, as long as you're connected to wifi, those apps can go ""Well, I'm connected to Joe's wifi, but I can also see his neighbor's wifi here and the other one in this apartment over here and the other one in the apartment here."" And you should only be able to hear those four globally unique wifi access points from these points in physical space. The intersection in between the spreads, the domes of all those wireless access points, and it's a proxy for location and it just goes on and on and on. We could talk about this for four more hours. We don't have that kind of time."
Snowden,"Can I ask you this? Is there a way to mitigate any of this personally? I mean, shutting your phone off doesn't even work, right?"
Interviewer,"Well, so it does in a way, it's yes and no. The thing was shutting your phone off that as a risk is how do you know your phone's actually turned off? It used to be ... When I was in Geneva, for example, working for the CIA, we would all carry drug dealer phones, the old smart phones, the ... Or sorry, old dumb phones. They're not smart phones. And the reason why was just because they had the-."
Snowden,Removal battery.
Interviewer,"... Removable backs where you could take the battery out, right?"
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,"And the one beautiful thing about technology is if there's no electricity in it, if there's, there's no go juice available to it, if there's no battery connected to it, it's not sending anything. Because you have to get power from somewhere, you have to have power in order to do work. But now your phones are all sealed. You can't take the batteries out. So there are potential ways that you can hack a phone where it appears to be off, but it's not actually off. It's just pretending to be off. Whereas in fact, it's still listening in and doing all this stuff. But for the average person, that doesn't apply. And I've got to tell you guys, they've been chasing me all over the place. I don't worry about that stuff. And it's because if they're applying that level of effort to me, they'll probably get the same information through other routes. I am as careful as I can, and I use things like , I turn devices off, but if they're actually manipulating the way devices display, it's just too great a level of effort even for someone like me to keep that up on a constant basis. Also if they get me, I only trust phones so much, so there's only so much they can derive from the compromise. And this is how operational security works. You think about what are the realistic threats that you're facing that you're trying to mitigate and the mitigation that you're trying to do is, what would be the loss? What would be the damage done to you if this stuff was exploited? Much more realistic than worrying about these things that I call voodoo hacks, which are like next level stuff. And actually just a shout up for those of your readers who are interested in this stuff."
Snowden,"I wrote a paper on this specific problem. How do you know when a phone is actually off? How do you know when it's actually not spying on you? With a brilliant, brilliant guy named Andrew Bunnie Huang, he's an MIT PhD in, I think, electrical engineering called The Introspection Engine that was published in the Journal of Open Engineering. You can find it online and it'll go as deep down in the weeds, I promise you, as you want. We take an iPhone six, this was back when it was fairly new and we modified it so we could actually not trust the device to report its own state, but physically monitor its state to see if it was spying on you. But for average people, this is academic, that's not your primary threat. Your primary threats are these bulk collection programs. Your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to these cell phone towers."
Interviewer,"It's doing all of these things because we leave our phones in a state that is constantly on. You're constantly connected. Airplane mode doesn't even turn off wifi really anymore. It just turns off the cellular modem. But the whole idea is we need to identify the problem, and the central problem with smartphone use today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing at any given time. The phone has the screen off, you don't know what it's connected to, you don't know how frequently it's doing it. Apple and iOS unfortunately makes it impossible to see what kind of network connections are constantly made on the device and to intermediate them going, ""I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now."" You know, ""I don't want Google to be able to talk right now. I just want my secure messenger app to be able to talk. I just want my weather app to be able to talk, but I just checked my weather and now I'm done with it. So I don't want that to be able to talk anymore.""."
Snowden,"We need to be able to make these intelligent decisions on not just an app by app basis, but a connection by connection basis. You want ... Let's say you use Facebook, because for whatever judgment we have, a lot of people might do it. You want it to be able to connect to Facebook's content servers. You want to be able to message a friend, you want to be able to download a photograph or whatever, but you don't want it to be able to talk to an ad server. You don't want it to talk to an analytics server that that's monitoring your behavior, right? You don't want to talk to all these third party things."
Interviewer,"Because Facebook crams their garbage into almost every app that you download and you don't even know it's happening because you can't see, and this is the problem with the data collection used today is there is an industry that is built on keeping this invisible. And what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices, whether it's a phone, whether it's computer or whatever, more visible and understandable to the average person, and then give them control over it."
Snowden,"So if you could see your phone right now and at the very center of is a little green icon that's your handset or it's a picture of your face, whatever, and then you see all these little spokes coming off of it. That's every app that your phone is talking to right now or every app that is active on your phone right now, and all the hosts that it's connecting to. And you can see right now, once every three seconds your phone is checking into Facebook and you could just poke that app and then boom, it's not talking to Facebook anymore. Facebook's not allowed. Facebook speaking privileges have been revoked, right? You would do that."
Interviewer,"We would all do that. If there was a button on your phone that said, ""Do what I want but not spy on me."" You would press that button. That button does not exist right now. And both Google and Apple, unfortunately Apple's a lot better at this than Google, but neither of them allow that button to exist. In fact, they actively interfere with it because they say it's a security risk and from a particular perspective, they actually aren't wrong there, but it's not enough to go, ""We have to lock that capability off from people because we don't trust they would make the right decisions. We think it's too complicated for people to do this. We think there's too many connections being made.""."
Snowden,"Well, that is actually a confession of the problem right there. If you think people can't understand it, if you think there are too many communications happening, if you think there's too much complexity in there, it needs to be simplified. Just like the president can't control everything like that. If you have to be the president of the phone and the phone is as complex as the United States government, we have a problem guys. This should be a much more simple process. It should be obvious and the fact that it's not and the fact that we read story after story year after year saying, ""All your data's been breached here, this company is spying on you here, this company's manipulating your purchases or your search results, or they're hiding these things from your timeline, or they're influencing you or manipulating it in all of these different ways.""."
Interviewer,"That happens as a result of a single problem, and that problem is an inequality of available information. They can see everything about you, they can see everything about what your device is doing, and they can do whatever they want with your device. You, on the other hand, owned the device. Well, rather you paid for the device, but increasingly these corporations own it, increasingly these governments own it. And increasingly we are living in a world where we do all the work, we pay all the taxes, we pay all the costs, but we own less and less. And nobody understands this better than the youngest generation."
Snowden,"Well, it seems like our data became a commodity before we understood what it was. It became this thing that's insanely valuable to Google and Facebook and all these social media platforms. Before we understood what we were giving up, they were making billions of dollars. And then once that money is being earned and once everyone's accustomed to this situation, it's very difficult to pull the reigns back. It's very difficult to turn that horse around."
Interviewer,"Precisely because the money then becomes power, right?"
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,The information then becomes influence.
Snowden,"That also seems to be the same sort of situation that would happen with these mass surveillance states. Once they have the access, it's going to be incredibly difficult for them to relinquish that."
Interviewer,"Right. Yeah. No, you're you're exactly correct and this is the subject of the book. I mean, this is the permanent record and this is where it came from. This is how it came to exist. The story of our lifetimes is how intentionally, by design, a number of institutions, both governmental and corporate realized it was in their mutual interest to conceal their data collection activities, to increase the breadth and depth of their sensor networks that were sort of spread out through society. Remember, back in the day intelligence collection in the United States, even in , used to mean sending an FBI agent to put alligator clips on an embassy building or sending in a, somebody disguised as a workman and they put a bug in a building, or they built a satellite listening site. We called these foreign sat or foreign satellite collection. Or out in the desert somewhere they built a big a parabolic collector and it's just listening to satellite emissions. But these satellite emissions, these satellite links were owned by militaries. They were exclusive to governments, right? It wasn't affecting everybody broadly. All surveillance was targeted because it had to be."
Snowden,"What changed with technology is that surveillance could now become indiscriminate. It could become a drag net. It could become bulk collection, which should become one of the dirtiest phrases in the language if we have any kind of decency. But we were intentionally ... This was intentionally concealed from us, right? The government did it. They used classification. Companies did it. They intentionally didn't talk about it. They denied these things were going, they said, ""You agreed to this."" And you didn't agree to nothing like this. I'm sorry, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,"They go, ""We put terms of service page up and you click that."" You clicked a button that said, ""I agree."" Because you were trying to open an account so you could talk to your friends. You were trying to get driving directions. You were trying to get an email account. You weren't trying to agree to some 600 page legal form. That, even if you read, you wouldn't understand and it doesn't matter even if you did understand because one of the very first paragraphs in it said, ""This disagreement can be changed at any time unilaterally without your consent by the company."" They have built a legal paradigm that presumes records collected about us do not belong to us. This is one of the core principles on which mass surveillance from the government's perspective in the United States is legal, and you have to understand that all this stuff we talk about today, government says everything they do is legal right, and they go, ""So, it's fine.""."
Interviewer,"Our prospective as a public should be well, that's actually the problem, because this isn't okay. The scandal isn't how they're breaking the law. The scandal is that they don't have to break the law. And the way they say they're not breaking the law is something called the third party doctrine. A third party doctrine is a legal principle derived from a case in, I believe, the 1970s called Smith versus Maryland. And Smith was this knucklehead who was harassing this lady, making phone calls to her house. And when she would pick up, he'd just, I don't know, sit there, heavy breathing, whatever, like a classic creeper. It was terrifying this poor lady. So she calls the cops and says, ""One day I got one of these phone calls and then I see this car creeping past my house on the street."" And she got a license plate number."
Snowden,"So she goes to the cops and she goes, ""Is this the guy?"" And the cops, again, they're trying to do a good thing here. They look up his license plate number and they find out where this guy is. And then they go, ""Well, what phone number's registered to that house?"" And they go to the phone company and they say, ""Can you give us this record?"" The phone company says, ""Yeah, sure."" And it's the guy. The cops got their man. So they go arrest this guy and then in court his lawyer brings all this stuff up and they go, ""You did this without a warrant.""."
Interviewer,"Sorry, that was the problem was they went to the phone company and they got the records without a warrant. They just asked for it or they subpoenaed it, some lower standard of legal review and the company gave it to them and got the guy, they march him off to jail and they could've gotten a warrant. Right. But it was just expedience. They just didn't want to take the time, it was small town cops. You can understand how it happens. They know the guy's a creeper, they just want to get them off to jail."
Snowden,"So they made a mistake, but the government doesn't want to let go. They fight on this and they go, ""It wasn't actually ... They weren't his records. And so because they didn't belong to him, he didn't have the fourth amendment right to demand a warrant be issued for them. They were the company's records and the company provided them voluntarily and hence no warrant was required, because you can give whatever you want without a warrant as long as it's yours."" Now here's the problem. The government extrapolated a principle in a single case of a single known, suspected criminal who they had real good reasons to suspect was their guy, and use that to go to a company and get records from them and establish a precedent that these records don't belong to the guy, they belong to the company."
Interviewer,"Then they said, ""Well, if one person doesn't have a fourth amendment interest in records held by a company, no one does."" And so the company then has absolute proprietary ownership of all of these records about all of our lives. And remember, this is back in the 1970s. The internet hardly exists in these kinds of contexts. Smartphones don't exist. Modern society, modern communications don't exist. This is the very beginning of the technological era. And flash forward now 40 years, and they are still relying on this precedent about this one pervy creeper to go, ""Nobody has a privacy right for anything that's held by a company."" And so long as they do that companies are going to be extraordinarily powerful and they're going to be extraordinarily abusive and this is something that people don't get."
Snowden,"They go, ""Oh, well it's data collection, right? They're exploiting data."" This is data about human lives. It is data about people. These records are about you. It's not data that's being exploited. It's people that are being exploited. It's not data that's being manipulated, it's you that's being manipulated. And this is something that I think a lot of people are beginning to understand. Now the problem is the companies and the governments are still pretending they don't understand, or disagreeing with this, and this reminds me of something that one of my old friends, John Perry Barlow, who served with me at the Freedom of The Press Foundation, I'm the president of the board, used to say to me, which is, ""You can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep."" He said it's an old native American saying."
Interviewer,That's a great expression. That's a good way to ....
Snowden,Yeah.
Interviewer,"I think that's a good way to end this. Ed, thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate it. Please tell everybody the title of your book and it's available right now."
Snowden,"Sure. Yes it is. It's on shelves everywhere, at least until the government finds some other way to ban it. It is called Permanent Record and I hope you will read it. Thank you so much."
Interviewer,"I will read it and I think what you've done is incredibly brave and I think you're a very important part of history. I think when all is said and done what you did and what you exposed is going to change the way we view mass surveillance, change the way we view government oversight, and change the way we view the distribution of information. I really think it's very, very important, and it was an honor to talk to you, man. Thank you."
Snowden,"Oh, it was my pleasure. Thank you so much for having me on."
Interviewer,"Take care of yourself, man. Stay safe."
Snowden,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Interviewer,No. Don't stay safe.
Snowden,Don't stay safe.
Interviewer,Stay free. Open to possibilities. Take care.
Snowden,Take care.
Interviewer,"Mr. Snowden, did you sleep well the last couple of nights? Because, I was reading that you asked for a kind of police protection. Are there any threats?"
Snowden,"There are significant threats but I sleep very well. There was an article that came out in an online outlet called BuzzFeed where they interviewed officials from the Pentagon, from the National Security Agency and they gave them anonymity to be able to say what they wanted, and what they told the reporter was that they wanted to murder me. These individuals, and these are acting government officials, they said they would be happy, they would love to put a bullet in my head, to poison me as I was returning from the grocery store, and have me die in the shower."
Interviewer,"But, fortunately, you are still alive with us."
Snowden,"Right, but I'm still alive, and I don't lose sleep because I've done what I feel I needed to do. It was the right thing to do. And, I'm not going to be afraid."
Interviewer,"""The greatest fear I have,"" and I quote you, ""regarding these disclosures is nothing will change."" That was one of your greatest concerns at the time, but in the meantime there is a vivid discussion about the situation with the NSA. Not only in America but also in Germany and in Brazil, and President Obama was forced to go public and to justify what the NSA was doing on legal grounds."
Snowden,"What we saw initially in response to the revelations was sort of a circling of the wagons of government around the National Security Agency. Instead of circling around the public and protecting their rights, the political class circled around the security state and protected their rights. What's interesting is, though that was the initially response, since then we've seen a softening. We've seen the President acknowledge that when he first said ""we've drawn the right balance, there are no abuses,"" we've seen him and his officials admit that there have been abuses. There have been thousands of violations of the National Security Agency and other agencies, authorities, every single year."
Interviewer,Is the speech of Obama recently the beginning of a serious regulation?
Snowden,"It was clear from the President's speech that he wanted to make minor changes to preserve authorities that we don't need. The President created a review board from officials that were personal friends, from national security insiders, former Deputy of the CIA, people who had every incentive to be soft on these programs and to see them in the best possible light. But what they found was that these programs have no value, they've never stopped a terrorist attack in the United States, and they have marginal utility at best for other things. The only thing that the Section 215 phone meta-data program, actually it's a broader meta-data program of bulk collection, bulk collection means mass surveillance, program was in stopping or detecting a $8,500 wire transfer from a cab driver in California. And, it's this kind of review, where insiders go ""we don't need these programs, these programs don't make us safe. They take a tremendous amount of resources to run, and they offer us no value."" They go ""we can modify these."" The National Security agency operates under the President's executive authority alone. He can end, or modify, or direct a change in their policies at any time."
Interviewer,For the first time President Obama did concede that the NSA collects and stores trillions of data.
Snowden,"Every time you pick up the phone, dial a number, write an email, make a purchase, travel on the bus carrying a cell phone, swipe a card somewhere, you leave a trace. And, the government has decided that it's a good idea to collect it all. Everything. Even if you've never been suspected of any crime. Traditionally the government would identify a suspect, they would go to a judge, they would say we suspect he's committed this crime, they would get a warrant and then they would be able to use the totality of their powers in pursuit of the investigation. Nowadays what we see is they want to apply the totality of their powers in advance, prior to an investigaion."
Interviewer,"You started this debate. Edward Snowden is, in the meantime, a household name for the whistleblower in the age of the internet. You were working until last summer for the NSA, and during this time you collected, secretly, thousands of confidential documents. What was the decisive moment, or was there a long period of time, or something happening? Why did you do this?"
Snowden,"I would say sort of the breaking point is seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress. There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that, for me, really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs. The public had a right to know that which the government is doing in its name, and that which the government is doing against the public, but neither of these things we were allowed to discuss, we were allowed no, even the wider body of our elected representatives were prohibited from knowing or discussing these programs, and that's a dangerous thing. The only review we had was from a secret court, the FISA Court, which is a sort of rubber stamp authority."
Interviewer,"We're not talking only of the NSA as far as this is concerned. There is a multilateral agreement for cooperation among the services and this alliance of intelligence operations is known as The Five Eyes. What agencies and countries belong to this alliance, and what is its purpose?"
Snowden,The Five Eyes alliance is sort of an artifact of the post World War II era where the Anglophone countries are the major powers banded together to sort of cooperate and share the costs of intelligence gathering infrastructure.
Interviewer,"In many countries, as in America too, the agencies like the NSA are not allowed to spy within their own borders on their own people. So, the Brits for example, they can spy on everybody but the Brits. But, the NSA can conduct surveillance in England. So, in the very end they could exchange their data and it would be, they would be, strictly following the law."
Snowden,"If you ask the governments about this directly they would deny it and point to policy agreements between the members of the Five Eyes saying that they won't spy on each other's citizens. But, there are a couple of key points there. One is that the way they define spying is not the collection of data. The GCHQ is collecting an incredible amount of data on British citizens, just as the National Security Agency is gathering an enormous amount of data on US citizens. What they are saying is that they will not then target people within that data. They won't look for UK citizens or British citizens. In addition, the policy agreements between them that say British won't target US citizens, US won't target British citizens, are not legally binding. The actual memorandums of agreement state specifically on that that they are not intended to put a legal restriction on any government. Their policy agreements that can be deviated from or broken at any time. So if they want to spy on a British citizen, they can spy on a British citizen, and then they can even share that data with the British government that is itself forbidden from spying on UK citizens. So there is a sort of a trading dynamic there, but it's not, it's not open, it's more of a nudge and wink. And, beyond that, the key is to remember the surveillance and the abuse doesn't occur when people look at the data, it occurs when people gather the data in the first place."
Interviewer,How narrow is the cooperation of the German Secret Service BND with the NSA and the Five Eyes?
Snowden,"I would describe it as intimate. As a matter of fact, the first way I described it in our written interview, was that the German Services and the US Services are in bed together. They not only share information, the reporting of results from intelligence, but they actually share the tools and the infrastructure. They work together against joint targets in services. And, there's a lot of danger in this. One of the major programs that face abuse in the National Security Agency is what's called ""XKeyscore."" It's a front end search engine that allows them to look through all of the records they collect worldwide every day."
Interviewer,What could you do if you would sit so to speak in their place with this kind of instrument?
Snowden,"You could read anyone's email in the world. Anybody you got an email address for, any website you can watch traffic to and from it, any computer that an individual sits at, you can watch it, any laptop that you're tracking, you can follow it as it moves from place to place throughout the world. It's a one stop shop for access to the NSA's information. And what's more, you can tag individuals using ""XKeyscore."" Where, let's say I saw you once and I thought what you were doing was interesting, or you just have access that's interesting to me. Let's say you work at a major German corporation, and I want access to that network. I can track your username on a website, on a form somewhere, I can track your real name, I can track associations with your friends, and I can build what's called a fingerprint, which is network activity unique to you, which means anywhere you go in the world, anywhere you try to sort of hide your online presence, hide your identity, the NSA can find you. And, anyone who's allowed to use this, or who the NSA shares their software with, can do the same thing. Germany is one of the countries that have access to ""XKeyscore.""."
Interviewer,"This sounds rather frightening. The question is, does the BND deliver data of Germans to the NSA?"
Snowden,"Whether the BND does it directly, or knowingly, the NSA gets German data. Whether it's provided, I can't speak to until it's been reported, because it would be classified. And, I prefer that journalists make the distinctions, and the decisions, about what is public interest and what should be published. However, it's no secret that every country in the world has the data of their citizens in the NSA. Millions and millions and millions of data connections, from Germans going about their daily lives, talking on their cell phones, sending SMS messages, visiting websites, buying things online, all of this ends up at the NSA. And, it's reasonable to suspect that the BND may be aware of it in some capacity. Now, whether or not they actively provide the information, I should not say."
Interviewer,"The BND basically argues if we do this, we do this accidentally actually, and our filter didn't work."
Snowden,"Right. So, the kind of things that they're discussing there are two things. They're talking about filtering of ingest, which means when the NSA puts a secret server in a German telecommunications provider, or they hack a German router and they divert the traffic in a manner that let's them search through things, they're saying ""if I see what I think is a German talking to another German I'll drop it."" But, how do you know? You could say ""well, these people are speaking the German language, this IP address seems to be from a German company to another German company,"" but that's not accurate, and they wouldn't dump all of that traffic because they'll get people who are targets of interest, who are actively in Germany using German communications. So, realistically, what's happening is when they say ""there's no spying on Germans,"" they don't mean that German data isn't being gathered, they don't mean that records aren't being taken or stolen. What they mean is that they're not intentionally searching for German citizens. And, that's sort of a fingers crossed behind the back promise, it's not reliable."
Interviewer,"What about other European countries, like Norway and Sweden for example, because we have a lot of, I think, underwater cables going through the Baltic Sea."
Snowden,"So, this is sort of an expansion of the same idea. If the NSA isn't collecting information on German citizens in Germany, are they as soon as it leaves German borders? And, the answer is ""yes."" Any single communication that transits the internet, the NSA may intercept at multiple points. They might see it in Germany, they might see it in Sweden, they might see it in Norway or Finland, they might see it in Britain, and they might see it in the United States. Any single one of these places that a German communication crosses, it'll be ingested and added to the database."
Interviewer,"So, let's come to our southern European neighbors then. What about Italy? What about France? What about Spain?"
Snowden,It's the same deal worldwide.
Interviewer,"Does the NSA spy on Siemens? On Mercedes? On other successful German companies, for example, to prevail, to have the advantage of knowing what is going on in a scientific and economic world?"
Snowden,I don't want to preempt the editorial decisions of journalists.
Interviewer,Ok.
Snowden,"But, what I will say is there's no question that the US is engaged in economic spying. If there's information at Siemens that they think would be beneficial to the national interests, not the national security of the United States, they'll go after that information, and they'll take it."
Interviewer,"There is this old saying ""you do whatever you can do."" So, the NSA is doing whatever is technically possible."
Snowden,"This is something that the President touched on last year, where he said that just because we can do something, and this was in relation to tapping Angela Merkel's phone. Just because we can do something, doesn't mean that we should. And, that's exactly what's happened. The technological capabilities that have been provided, because of sort of weak security standards in internet protocols and cellular communications networks, have meant that intelligence services can create systems that see everything."
Interviewer,"Nothing annoyed the German government more than the fact that the NSA taped the private phone of the German Chancellor Merkel over the last 10 years, obviously. Suddenly this invisible surveillance was connected with a known face and was not connected with a kind of watery, shady terrorist background. Obama now promised to stop snooping on Merkel, which raises the question ""did the NSA tape already previous governments, including the previous chancellors, and when did they do that? And, how long did they do this for?""."
Snowden,"This is a particularly difficult question for me to answer, because there's information that I very strongly believe is in the public interest. However, as I've said before, I prefer for journalists to make those decisions in advance, review the material themselves, and decide whether or not the public value of this information outweighs the sort of reputational cost to the officials that ordered the surveillance. What I can say is we know Angela Merkel was monitored by the National Security Agency. The question is how reasonable is it to assume that she is the only German official that was monitored? How reasonable is it to believe that she's the only prominent German face who the National Security Agency was watching? I would suggest it seems unreasonable that if anyone was concerned about the intentions of German leadership, that they would only watch Merkel and not her aides, not other prominent officials, not heads of ministries, or even local government officials."
Interviewer,"How does a young man from Elizabeth City in North Carolina, 30 years old, get in such a position in such a sensitive area?"
Snowden,"That's a very difficult question to answer. In general, I would say it highlights the dangers of privatizing government functions. I worked previously as an actual staff officer, a government employee for the Central Intelligence Agency, but I've also served much more frequently as a contractor in a private capacity. What that means is, you have private for-profit companies doing inherently governmental work, like targeted espionage, surveillance, compromising foreign systems. And, anyone who has the skills, who can convince a private company that they have the qualifications to do so, will be empowered by the government to do that, and there's very little oversight. There's very little review."
Interviewer,"Have you been one of these classical computer kids sitting red eyed during the nights in the age of 12, 15, and your father was knocking on your door and saying ""switch off the light, it's too late now?"" Did you get your computer skills from that side? Or, when did you get your first computer?"
Snowden,"hahaha Right, right. I definitely have had a, shall we say, a deep informal education in computers and electronic technology. They've always been fascinating and interesting to me. hahaha The characterization of having your parents telling you to go to bed, I would say is fair."
Interviewer,"If one looks to the little public data of your life, one discovers that you, obviously, wanted to join in May 2004, the Special Forces to fight in Iraq. What did motivate you at the time? You know, Special Forces, looking at you in the very moment, means grim fighting, and it means probably killing. And, did you ever get to Iraq?"
Snowden,"No, I didn't get to Iraq. One of the interesting things about the Special Forces are that they're not actually intended for direct combat. They're what's referred to as ""a force multiplier."" They're inserted behind enemy lines. It's a squad that has a number of different specialties in it, and they teach and enable the local population to resist, or to support, US forces in a way that allows the local population a chance to help determine their own destiny. And, I felt that was an inherently noble thing at the time. In hindsight, some of the reasons that we went into Iraq were not well founded. And, I think did a disservice to everyone involved."
Interviewer,"What happened to your adventure then? Did you stay long with them? Or, what happened to you?"
Snowden,"No, I broke my legs when I was in training and was discharged."
Interviewer,So it was a short adventure in other words?
Snowden,It was a short adventure.
Interviewer,"In 2007 the CIA stationed you with a diplomatic cover in Geneva, in Switzerland. Why did you join the CIA by the way?"
Snowden,I don't think I can actually answer that one.
Interviewer,"OK, if it's what you have been doing there, forget it. But why did you join the CIA?"
Snowden,"In many ways I think it's a continuation of trying to do everything I could to prosecute the public good in the most effective way. And, it's in line with the rest of my government service where I tried to use my technical skills in the most difficult positions I could find in the world, and the CIA offered that."
Interviewer,"If we go back, Special Forces, CIA, NSA, it's not actually in the description of a human rights activist, or somebody who becomes a whistleblower after this. What happens to you?"
Snowden,"I think it tells a story, and that's, no matter how deeply an individual is embedded in the government, no matter how faithful to the government they are, no matter how strongly they believe in the causes of their government, as I did during the Iraq war, people can learn, people can discover the line between appropriate government behavior and actual wrongdoing. And, I think it became clear to me that that line had been crossed."
Interviewer,"You worked for the NSA through a private contractor with the name Booze Allen Hamilton, one of the big ones in the business. What is the advantage for the US Government, or the CIA, to work through a private contractor, to outsource a central government function?"
Snowden,"The contracting culture of the national security community in the United States is a complex topic. It's driven by a number of interests between primarily limiting the number of direct government employees at the same time as keeping lobbying groups in Congress, typically from very well funded businesses such as Booze Allen Hamilton. The problem there is you end up in a situation where government policies are being influenced by private corporations who have interests that are completely divorced from the public good in mind. The result of that is what we saw at Booze Allen Hamilton, where you have private individuals who have access to, what the government alleges were millions and millions of records that they could walk out the door with at any time with no accountability, no oversight, no auditing, the government didn't even know they were gone."
Interviewer,"At the very end you ended up in Russia. Many of the intelligence communities suspect you made a deal, classified material for Asylum here in Russia."
Snowden,"The Chief of the Task Force investigating me, as recently as December, said that their investigation had turned up no evidence, or indications at all, that I had any outside help, or contact, or had made a deal of any kind to accomplish my mission. I worked alone. I didn't need anybody's help. I don't have any ties to foreign governments. I'm not a spy for Russia, or China, or any other country for that matter. If I am a traitor, who did I betray? I gave all of my information to the American public, to American journalists, who are reporting on American issues. If they see that as treason, I think people really need to consider who do they think they're working for. The public is supposed to be their boss, not their enemy. Beyond that, as far as my personal safety, I'll never be fully safe until these systems have changed."
Interviewer,"After your revelations, none of the European countries really offered you asylum. Where did you apply in Europe for asylum?"
Snowden,"I can't remember the list of countries with any specificity because there were many of them. But, France, Germany were definitely in there, as was the UK. A number of European countries, all of whom, unfortunately, felt that doing the right thing was less important than supporting US political concerns."
Interviewer,"One reaction to the NSA snooping is in the very moment that countries like Germany are thinking to create national internets, an attempt to force internet companies to keep their data in their own country. Does this work?"
Snowden,"It's not gonna stop the NSA. Let's put it that way. The NSA goes where the data is. If the NSA can pull text messages out of telecommunication networks in China, they can probably manage to get Facebook messages out of Germany. Ultimately, the solution to that is not to try to stick everything in a walled garden, although that does raise the level of sophistication and complexity of taking the information. It's also much better simply to secure the information internationally against everyone, rather than playing 'let's move the data.' Moving the data isn't fixing the problem. Securing the data is the problem."
Interviewer,"President Obama, in the very moment, obviously doesn't care too much about the message of the leak. And, together with the NSA, they do care very much more about catching the messenger in that context. Obama asked the Russian president several times to extradite you. But Putin did not. It looks that you will stay to the rest of your life, probably in Russia. How do you feel about Russia in that context, and is there a solution to this problem."
Snowden,"I think it's becoming increasingly clear that these leaks didn't cause harm, in fact, they served the public good. Because of that, I think it will be very difficult to maintain sort of an ongoing campaign of persecution against someone who the public agrees serve the public interest."
Interviewer,"The New York Times wrote a very long comment, and demanded clemency for you. The headline ""Edward Snowden Whistleblower,"" and I quote from that, ""the public learned in great detail how the agency has extended its mandate and abused its authority."" And, the New York Times closes, ""President Obama should tell his aides to begin finding a way to end Mr. Snowden's vilification, and give him an incentive to return home."" Did you get a call in between from the White House?"
Snowden,"I've never received a call from the White House, and I am not waiting by the phone. But, I would welcome the opportunity to talk about how we can bring this to a conclusion that serves the interest of all parties. I think it's clear there are times where what is lawful is distinct from what is rightful. There are times throughout history and it doesn't take long for, either an American, or a German, to think about times in the history of their country where the law provided the government to do things which were not right."
Interviewer,"President Obama, obviously, is in the very moment not quite convinced of that, because he said to you are charged with three felonies. And, I quote, ""if you, Edward Snowden, believe in what you did, you should go back to America, appear before the court with a lawyer and make your case."" Is this the solution?"
Snowden,"It's interesting because he mentions three felonies. What he doesn't say is that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court to the public and convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. The Espionage Act was never intended, it's from 1918, it was never intended to prosecute journalistic sources, people who are informing the newspapers about information that's of public interest. It was intended for people who are selling documents in secret to foreign governments, who are bombing bridges, who are sabotaging communications, not people who are serving the public good. So, it's, I would say, illustrative that the president would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial."
Interviewer,"Why did you choose Hong Kong to go to and then tell them about US hacking on their research facilities and universities? How many sets of the documents you disclosed did you make, and how many different people have them? If anything happens to you, do they still exist?"
Snowden,"First, the US Government, just as they did with other whistleblowers, immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home, openly declaring me guilty of treason and that the disclosure of secret, criminal, and even unconstitutional acts is an unforgivable crime. That's not justice, and it would be foolish to volunteer yourself to it if you can do more good outside of prison than in it. Second, let's be clear"
Interviewer,I should have asked you this when I saw you but never got round to it........Why did you just not fly direct to Iceland if that is your preferred country for asylum?
Snowden,"Leaving the US was an incredible risk, as NSA employees must declare their foreign travel 30 days in advance and are monitored. There was a distinct possibility I would be interdicted en route, so I had to travel with no advance booking to a country with the cultural and legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained. Hong Kong provided that. Iceland could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current US administration."
Interviewer,"You have said HERE that you admire both Ellsberg and Manning, but have argued that there is one important distinction between yourself and the army private... Are you suggesting that Manning indiscriminately dumped secrets into the hands of Wikileaks and that he intended to harm people?"
Snowden,"No, I'm not. Wikileaks is a legitimate journalistic outlet and they carefully redacted all of their releases in accordance with a judgment of public interest. The unredacted release of cables was due to the failure of a partner journalist to control a passphrase. However, I understand that many media outlets used the argument that documents were dumped to smear Manning, and want to make it clear that it is not a valid assertion here."
Interviewer,"Did you lie about your salary? What is the issue there? Why did you tell Glenn Greenwald that your salary was $200,000 a year, when it was only $122,000 (according to the firm that fired you.)."
Snowden,"I was debriefed by Glenn and his peers over a number of days, and not all of those conversations were recorded. The statement I made about earnings was that $200,000 was my career high salary. I had to take pay cuts in the course of pursuing specific work. Booz was not the most I've been paid."
Interviewer,Why did you wait to release the documents if you said you wanted to tell the world about the NSA programs since before Obama became president?
Snowden,"Obama's campaign promises and election gave me faith that he would lead us toward fixing the problems he outlined in his quest for votes. Many Americans felt similarly. Unfortunately, shortly after assuming power, he closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge."
Interviewer,Define in as much detail as you can what direct access means. Can analysts listen to content of domestic calls without a warrant?
Snowden,"More detail on how direct NSA's accesses are is coming, but in general, the reality is this"
Interviewer,Define in as much detail as you can what direct access means. Can analysts listen to content of domestic calls without a warrant?
Snowden,"NSA likes to use domestic as a weasel word here for a number of reasons. The reality is that due to the FISA Amendments Act and its section 702 authorities, Americans' communications are collected and viewed on a daily basis on the certification of an analyst rather than a warrant. They excuse this as incidental collection, but at the end of the day, someone at NSA still has the content of your communications. Even in the event of warranted intercept, it's important to understand the intelligence community doesn't always deal with what you would consider a real warrant like a Police department would have to, the warrant is more of a templated form they fill out and send to a reliable judge with a rubber stamp."
Interviewer,"When you say someone at NSA still has the content of your communications - what do you mean? Do you mean they have a record of it, or the actual content?"
Snowden,"Both. If I target for example an email address, for example under FAA 702, and that email address sent something to you, Joe America, the analyst gets it. All of it. IPs, raw data, content, headers, attachments, everything. And it gets saved for a very long time - and can be extended further with waivers rather than warrants."
Interviewer,  good to see you again man good to see you thanks for having me.
Snowden, it's uh been like a year it's been like a year believe it or not you look exactly the same.
Interviewer, and the studio looks exactly the same you might be on another part of the world.
Snowden, no one knows yeah it's just uh my my apartment that i rent you know i i don't like to give out a lot of.
Interviewer, information about where i'm at and that kind of stuff so it's very smart a plain wool that i've got.
Snowden, the lights down low so it looks kind of a a nice gray at least i think it's nice i.
Interviewer, think it's beautiful it looks amazing uh first of all congratulations on the recent ruling.
Snowden, was a ninth district court of appeals is that what it was it said that what you exposed.
Interviewer, with the warrantless wiretapping was in fact illegal and there are many people that.
Snowden, are calling for you to be pardoned now yeah it's so much has happened this ruling this is actually not the first.
Interviewer, time the federal government has uh or the appeals courts have struck down.
Snowden, uh some of the federal surveillance programs as unlawful um but this one is really important.
Interviewer, because it happened uh from an appeals court it wasn't from a single judge it was from uh.
Snowden, a panel of judges um and what they had uh ruled was that the nsa's bulk collection.
Interviewer, of americans phone records uh was illegal and this is the very first um sort of.
Snowden, mass surveillance program that i and the journalists um really that the news was broken back in 2013 so this is.
Interviewer, a huge victory for privacy rights uh what it means is there was this provision of the patriot.
Snowden, act like remember the patriot act remember like a zillion years ago i do everybody was.
Interviewer, laying out patriotic patriotic your friend alex jones you know i think he was worried about that it's a.
Snowden, terrible name the there's a real problem with that name because if you're against the patriot.
Interviewer, act it's like against babies it's like like this is the pro-baby act but meanwhile pro-baby act.
Snowden, they get to look through your email you know what i mean it's like the word patriot is attached to that in a very.
Interviewer, disingenuous way like calling that the patriot act is it's really creepy that they could do they should have like.
Snowden, a number like bill a1 yeah you know you know what i'm saying so you can debate the merits of it it's.
Interviewer, just so much propaganda attached to that name like the patriot act.
Snowden, this is one of the funny things because it should be a warning for anybody who's in like.
Interviewer, you know just anywhere in the country and they hear on the news they're talking about like the save.
Snowden, puppies you know act uh there's actually one that's uh been they've been trying to push.
Interviewer, through recently which is basically outlawing meaningful encryption from the major internet.
Snowden, service providers like if facebook or google for whatever reason got out of bed in the morning and they.
Interviewer, actually wanted uh to protect your uh the security of your communications uh in a way that even they can't break.
Snowden, like right now uh google and facebook they do a great job.
Interviewer, keeping other people from spying on your communications but if google wants to rifle through.
Snowden, your inbox right if facebook wants to go through all your direct messages and give that to the federal government.
Interviewer, like you tap one button and boom they've got all of it happens every single day well.
Snowden, companies like facebook have recently realized this is a real problem for them uh because first off they get all these.
Interviewer, censorship demands um that you've seen uh where like there's.
Snowden, de-platforming requests and it happens in one country right like if the u.s government is allowed to decide what can.
Interviewer, and can't be said by this person on this platform or uh the u.s goes look we got a court.
Snowden, warrant they said uh a judge said we think this person's a criminal we want you to hand.
Interviewer, over everything you have on this person and they do it right facebook does this well guess who's next right the russian.
Snowden, government shows up at the door the next day the chinese government shows up the door the next day.
Interviewer, and if these companies don't play ball they get shut down in that country they can no longer.
Snowden, no longer operate and so the idea that a lot of them have uh that they've considered and this has.
Interviewer, actually become a bigger thing in the covid crisis where we start talking about like.
Snowden, contact tracing these companies want to know where everybody is at all the time so they can hand this over to medical.
Interviewer, authorities or whatever there's this idea called end to end encryption.
Snowden, which what it means is that when you send a message you know when billy sends a message to.
Interviewer, bobby billy and bobby both have the keys to unlock that message and it could be sent through facebook it.
Snowden, could be sent through google it could be posted you know on a bulletin board in the town square.
Interviewer, but without that key which the people who run the bulletin board right the the people who own the.
Snowden, bulletin board google facebook they don't have that key only the phones at the end the laptops at the end the.
Interviewer, people on those they're the only people who have the key so if somebody comes to.
Snowden, facebook and says we want to see that information facebook hands over the encrypted.
Interviewer, message right and facebook goes well here you go here's our copy but we can't read it.
Snowden, you can't either now you've got to actually do some work on the government side and go get that.
Interviewer, key yourself and then you can read it right but we can't read it.
Snowden, congress is trying to stop the basically proliferation of that basic and encryption technology and they're.
Interviewer, calling it like the child online predator act or something like that.
Snowden, where they say it's all about protecting uh the posting of like child exploitation.
Interviewer, material and really really horrible stuff but that's not actually what the law is about.
Snowden, the law is about making it easier for spies and law enforcement to reach deeper and deeper into your.
Interviewer, life with a simple warrant stamped by any court the funny thing is this never used to be.
Snowden, uh the way law enforcement worked in the united states i mean when you hear about a warrant.
Interviewer, what does that mean to you what can the cops get with a warrant well usually i think it means that they.
Snowden, can come in your house and search right the the the real issue with.
Interviewer, warrants in when it pertains to encryption like when you're talking about the child.
Snowden, safety act or whatever they're calling it anyone would say yes we have to stop.
Interviewer, child predators but the problem with having the ability to use something like that to stop.
Snowden, child predators in my eyes i i start thinking well if i really wanted to look into.
Interviewer, someone what i would do is i would send them some malware that would put child pornography on their computer and.
Snowden, then i would have all of the motive that i need to go and look through everything like.
Interviewer, say if they're if they were a political dissident if they were doing something against the government.
Snowden, and you were someone who was uh acting in bad faith and you decided okay we want to look into this guy but we.
Interviewer, don't have a warrant what what are the laws what what can we get away with it well.
Snowden, we have the child endangerment act and so because of that we're allowed to peer into anything.
Interviewer, but we just have to have motive so we have to well do we have motive all you'd have to do.
Snowden, is and we we both know this it's very easy to put something illegal on someone's computer if they're not.
Interviewer, paying attention it's very easy to install like you could send someone a text message that looks.
Snowden, like a routing number for a package they're going to get they click on that.
Interviewer, and then you what is that um what the israelis have uh pegasus right yeah you you've read up on this.
Snowden, yeah so well it's uh it's from brian fogle's new film the dissident which is.
Interviewer, uh about jamal khashoggi's murder and how the saudis used that to use they.
Snowden, actually tapped into jeff bezos's phone and that's where.
Interviewer, all of this is the suspicion is that that that's where all of those uh national enquirer photos came out and.
Snowden, all the attacks on him because they they had access to his actual phone through this so someone.
Interviewer, could easily get into your stuff if you're not paying attention.
Snowden, and then they could use you know whatever acts they've come up with whatever it's.
Interviewer, the patriot act or whatever act where they could just get into everything you're doing look at your.
Snowden, whatsapp messages look at your your facebook messages it's real sneaky and it's it's dangerous.
Interviewer, it's it's a dangerous precedent to set yeah i mean there's a lot to this let me go into some of that in a little depth.
Snowden, so you mentioned the nso group in their their pegasus malware set and this is very much a real thing like.
Interviewer, you're a well-read guy um this is like this company uh the ceo's name i think.
Snowden, is shalev julio um is uh run in israel it was previously owned.
Interviewer, uh actually by an american venture capital firm i believe they've been uh re-bought out.
Snowden, but it doesn't really matter their entire business is preying on flaws in the critical.
Interviewer, infrastructure of all the software running on the most popular devices in the world.
Snowden, the number one target right is the iphone and this is because the iphone as secure as it is relative to a lot of.
Interviewer, other phones is a monoculture right like if you if you have an iphone.
Snowden, you get these little software update notifications all the time that are like hey please update to the.
Interviewer, the most recent version of ios and that's a fabulous thing that's a wonderful thing for security.
Snowden, because the number one way that people's devices get screwed if it's not just through user error.
Interviewer, right like you entering your password somewhere you shouldn't it's like a fake site.
Snowden, it looks like gmail but it's not actually gmail you just gave the guy your password now he uses your password.
Interviewer, to log in but to actually break into a device is that it's not.
Snowden, patched right patch means getting these uh security updates these little code.
Interviewer, updates that fix holes that researchers found in the security device.
Snowden, well apple's really good about rolling these out all the time for everybody in the world the problem is.
Interviewer, basically all these different iphones right you got an iphone 6 you got an iphone 8 you got an iphone x you got an.
Snowden, iphone you know three whatever these are all running a pretty narrow band of uh.
Interviewer, software versions and so these guys go if they want to target for example android phones like google phones like a.
Snowden, samsung galaxy or something like that there's like a billion different phones made by a billion different people.
Interviewer, half of them are completely out of date but what it means is it's not one version of.
Snowden, software they're running it's like 10 000 and this is actually bad for security on the individual level.
Interviewer, but it's good for security in a very unusual way which is the guys who are developing the exploits.
Snowden, the guys like this nso group who are trying to find ways to break into phones they now have to have like.
Interviewer, 50 different handsets running 50 different versions of software they're all changing they've got different.
Snowden, hardware they've got different chip sets for like they've got different like all kinds of just.
Interviewer, technical variables that can screw up the way they attack uh your phone and then when they find one.
Snowden, it only works on like this samsung galaxy line it doesn't work on like the google.
Interviewer, pixel line or it doesn't work on like a nokia line or something like that whereas they realize if they find a way.
Snowden, to attack an iphone which is actually you know this is difficult this is really difficult stuff.
Interviewer, now it works against basically every iphone and who has iphones all the rich people.
Snowden, right all the important people all the lawmakers all the the guys who are in there.
Interviewer, so they've made a business on basically attacking the iphone and selling it to every two-bit thug uh.
Snowden, who runs a police department in the world you know they sell this stuff to saudi.
Interviewer, arabia they sell this to mexico and there's a group of researchers in canada uh working at a university called.
Snowden, the citizen lab and uh these guys are really like the best in the world at tracking what.
Interviewer, nso group is doing if you want to learn about this stuff the real stuff look up citizen lab and the nso group uh.
Snowden, and what they have found uh is all the people who are being targeted um by the nso group the classes of people.
Interviewer, the countries that are using this and you know it's not like the local police department in germany.
Snowden, trying to bust up you know a terrorism ring or something like that it's the mexican government spying on.
Interviewer, the head of the mexican opposition we're trying to look at human rights defenders who are investigating like.
Snowden, student disappearances or it's people like the friends and associates of jamal khashoggi.
Interviewer, uh who was murdered by the saudi government or it's people like dissidents in bahrain and.
Snowden, these like petro states uh these bad actors nationally will pay.
Interviewer, literally tens of millions of dollars each year just to have the ability to break into an iphone for a certain.
Snowden, number of times because that's how these guys uh do it they sell their business plan they go.
Interviewer, we'll let you break in any iphone uh just by basically sending a text message to this phone all you need to find is.
Snowden, the phone number or a person who's running an iphone uh and we will exploit something uh.
Interviewer, which will give you total if that happens to someone i'm sorry but if that happens to someone.
Snowden, could they just get a new phone and does the exploit is the exploit.
Interviewer, specific to their account or is the exploit on the the physical phone so the question or.
Snowden, the answer to this is it really depends on the exploit like the easiest uh forms of exploit or.
Interviewer, rather the easier types of exploits are where they send you a text message right and it'll be.
Snowden, like an imessage or something like that and it's got a link in it that'll be like oh gosh terrible news you know your.
Interviewer, buddy's father just died um and we're making funeral arrangements are you gonna be there.
Snowden, it's the day after tomorrow and when you click the link for the funeral arrangements it.
Interviewer, opens your web browser and the web browser on your phone is always the biggest most complicated.
Snowden, process in it right there's a zillion lines of code in this as opposed to an instant messenger where.
Interviewer, there's fewer lines of code in it and they'll find one thing in that where there's a flaw.
Snowden, that lets them feed instructions not just to the browser but basically escape the little sandbox.
Interviewer, that the browser's supposed to plan that's supposed to be safe where it can't do anything too harmful.
Snowden, and it'll run out of this sandbox and it'll ransack your your phone's like hard-wired.
Interviewer, operating system uh the the system image it'll like give them uh privileges to do whatever they want on your phone.
Snowden, as if they are you and then as if they have a higher level of privilege than you they have system.
Interviewer, level privileges to change the phone's operation permanently right and this.
Snowden, is the problem is on the phone you can replace the phone right and they'll lose access to that.
Interviewer, but if they've already used that to gain the passwords that you use to access you know your icloud or whatever.
Snowden, when they have controlled the phone they've already got your photo roll right they've already got your contact.
Interviewer, list they already have everything that you've ever put in that phone they already have all.
Snowden, your notes they already have all your files they already have everything that's in your message history right.
Interviewer, they can pull that out immediately and now not because they have.
Snowden, you know all your contacts and things like that they see that phone stop being active.
Interviewer, they know you've changed your phone number all they have to do is find the new phone number and then they can try.
Snowden, to go after you again the benefit is uh with that old style of attack.
Interviewer, if you get that message and you don't click that link you're somebody in a vulnerable class right.
Snowden, you've had these kind of attacks answered before it looks suspicious you don't know who this person is the.
Interviewer, number isn't right something like that and you save that link you don't click the link you don't do anything with that.
Snowden, link but you send it to a group like citizen lab uh they can basically use that link to.
Interviewer, basically use uh like a dummy phone like a sort of a trojan horse to go to the site.
Snowden, that would attack your phone and catch it and this is what the sort of process that all of their.
Interviewer, research is based on there are other different types of attacks that actually don't have these.
Snowden, defenses against them that are far more scary but the bottom line is can i stop you for a second.
Interviewer, what is citizen lab citizen lab you just said yeah the citizen lab is the name of this research group at the university in.
Snowden, canada uh who basically studies state-sponsored and corporate malware attacks against civil society.
Interviewer, it's ron run by a guy named ron dieber i believe you guys will have to fact check me on.
Snowden, that one i think he just published a book actually or is publishing a book about.
Interviewer, all of this but it's really they are the the world leaders uh in my opinion.
Snowden, in uh basically investigating these kind of attacks and exposing them it's true public service um.
Interviewer, let's go back to that one thing i asked you about warrants and you talked about the fact that like people could plant.
Snowden, evidence on things and then get motivation or um rather they could show probable.
Interviewer, cause right to the court to then investigate you um and then they can get everything.
Snowden, and you said you know you thought that uh a warrant man they can go and search your house and this is.
Interviewer, the kind of thing that we you know modern people are used to thinking of in the context of a warrant.
Snowden, cops go to a specific place looking for specific things uh that are elements of a crime.
Interviewer, now you know you you've heard all these things where like cops find a way to like stop somebody.
Snowden, and they like are like oh i smelled pot or whatever and they try to you know toss their car or whatever.
Interviewer, or plain sight doctrines where they open the door and the guy sits down talks and they go.
Snowden, you know i see a bong or something you know that's paraphernalia you're going to jail.
Interviewer, but uh until i think it was 1967 warrants in the united states could only be used.
Snowden, to gather two things they were called the fruits and instrumentalities of a crime which meant even if the cops.
Interviewer, knew you did it even if cops knew you you know rode the subway or worked for this company or.
Snowden, whatever they couldn't get all the company's records uh they couldn't if they existed.
Interviewer, uh get all the emails that you ever wrote they couldn't get your friend to turn over like an.
Snowden, exchange of letters that you had with this person the fruits of the crime were the things.
Interviewer, that they gained from it right if they robbed the bank the cops could get the sack of money the.
Snowden, instrumentalities were the tools that were used right like if you used dynamite or a crowbar or a getaway.
Interviewer, car they could seize all of those things uh but.
Snowden, the idea that the cops can get everything the idea that the fbi can get all these.
Interviewer, records you know all of these things your whole history is very much.
Snowden, a new thing and nobody talks about that today we we just presume it's normal we.
Interviewer, presume it's okay but between 1967 and today think about how many more.
Snowden, records there are about your life and how things like how you live private things about.
Interviewer, you that have nothing to do with criminality and everything to do with the intimacy.
Snowden, of of who you are and the fact that all of that now today is exposed and not just to.
Interviewer, let's say you love the us government let's say you you know you you are like throwing cookouts for your.
Snowden, local police department but every other government in the world too.
Interviewer, and we really need to ask ourselves how much information uh do the authorities of the.
Snowden, day need to do their job right how much do we want them to have how much is proper.
Interviewer, and appropriately and necessary and how much is too much and if we decide the cops shouldn't have.
Snowden, this if we decide the spies shouldn't have this well why in the hell should facebook or.
Interviewer, google or somebody trying to sell you nikes why should they have this yeah um and what's the answer to that.
Snowden, they shouldn't yeah i mean right but nobody wants to go backwards once you have gained a certain amount of.
Interviewer, access and you could justify that access like we're stopping crimes like the patriarch.
Snowden, and then which later the patriot act two which was even more overreaching once they have that.
Interviewer, kind of power they never go you know what we went too far.
Snowden, we we have too much access to your privacy and even if you've committed a crime we.
Interviewer, shouldn't have unrelated access to all these other activities that you're involved in.
Snowden, yeah and i mean that's exactly the thing about the whole save the puppies act right if it's got a name.
Interviewer, like that you gotta be like no there's something doesn't smell right here this is.
Snowden, this is this there's something bad in this and i mean this so this gets back to uh.
Interviewer, that uh initial topic of uh what what did the court decide right so we had the patriot act and the.
Snowden, patriot act was this giant law that had been been written long before 9 11.
Interviewer, it was just sitting on the shelf uh and the department of justice the fbi they knew they couldn't pass this they.
Snowden, knew nobody would live with it because it was an extreme expansion of government authority.
Interviewer, and then 9 11 happened right and that's really where it all started to go wrong that's where we got the rise of this new.
Snowden, authoritarianism that we see continuing in the united states today right like.
Interviewer, if you think and you know like you have problems with what's happening under donald trump but.
Snowden, you also had problems under like what was happening with obama and the expansion of the war on whistleblowing.
Interviewer, uh you had problems with the way drone strikes were going out of control you go well really where did this all.
Snowden, start right where did it start to go wrong personally i think 911.
Interviewer, was where we made a fundamental mistake and that was we were so frightened in the movement because we had had such an.
Snowden, extraordinary and rare terrorist attack uh succeed which by the way could have been present.
Interviewer, prevented and i think we discussed this in the last episode the congress you know they were they.
Snowden, were just terrified they said look intelligence services cops fbi whoever anything you want blank.
Interviewer, check here you go that was the patriot act and at the time groups like the american civil liberties.
Snowden, union they were like uh we are worried that this goes too far.
Interviewer, because god bless them that's what the american civil liberties union does and one of the provisions that they had.
Snowden, a problem with was this section 215 of the patriot act uh which i believe they were calling at the.
Interviewer, time the library records provision and what it said basically this tiny little little uh phrase.
Snowden, in the law said the fbi can basically get any records that it deems relevant to a.
Interviewer, counter on terrorism investigation under a warrant and the worst thing the aclu could.
Snowden, imagine was that these guys would go to the library and get what kind of books.
Interviewer, you're reading and like oh shock horror this is the worst thing these guys could do.
Snowden, and so they protested then they lost and this passed and it went on and lo and behold 10 years later.
Interviewer, we find out in 2013 they had used uh this provision that people were worried about just.
Snowden, going after individuals library records to instead get the phone records of not an individual not a group.
Interviewer, but everybody in the united states who was making calls on u.s telecommunications providers delivered.
Snowden, to the nsa daily by these companies right so no matter who you were no matter how innocent you.
Interviewer, were the fbi was getting these because they said well every phone call.
Snowden, is relevant to a counter-terrorism investigation and the court went finally you know this is seven years.
Interviewer, after 2013. then with guys that's too much if your definition of relevance is basically.
Snowden, anything anywhere all the time is relevant to a counter-terrorist investigation.
Interviewer, the question is what then is not relevant what is the limiting principle on this.
Snowden, what where is the end and this is a very important thing because even if it's not enough right.
Interviewer, even if this doesn't shut down all the programs the program was actually already stopped a few years ago.
Snowden, because of previous court decisions and changes in law the fact that the courts are finally uh.
Interviewer, beginning to look at these the the impacts of these sweeping new technologies that allow.
Snowden, governments to see all of these connections and interactions that we're having every day.
Interviewer, they're finally putting limits on it and that is i think transformative uh it is the foundation of what we will.
Snowden, see in the future will begin to be the first meaningful guarantees of privacy rights in the.
Interviewer, digital age now that you have been uh at least according to.
Snowden, this court exonerated or justified what what happens to you and what happens to what they've been doing.
Interviewer, and how how much of the breaks do they hit on this like how what changes does anything.
Snowden, change in the government's sweeping surveillance it's it's a great question i mean you.
Interviewer, would think uh when you get a court not even a first level.
Snowden, court but an appeals court that looks at these issues you know they're talking about serious stuff.
Interviewer, they're talking about counter-terrorism investigations by the way in the same thing.
Snowden, uh in the same decision they said the government has been arguing you know for 20 years.
Interviewer, now these programs were saving lives they were stopping terrorist attacks they said uh.
Snowden, you know first they said mass surveillance had stopped 54 terrorist attacks in the united states.
Interviewer, then they dropped it to seven and then they dropped it to one and the one terrorist attack uh or uh.
Snowden, terrorist conspiracy whatever that they said it did stop was this case that was just decided.
Interviewer, and the court found and this is important after looking at the government's classified.
Snowden, evidence so this is not just the court deciding on their own this is the government going look here's.
Interviewer, all the evidence that we have the top secret stuff the stuff that nobody can see please don't.
Snowden, you know say our program is ineffective or whatever the court looked at it and they went holy crap it did.
Interviewer, this invasion of hundreds of millions of americans privacy happening over the span of decades did.
Snowden, not make a difference in this case they said even if or even in the absence of this program.
Interviewer, if it hadn't existed the government had never done it they still would have busted this ring.
Snowden, because they were already closing in on them the fbi already had all the evidence they needed.
Interviewer, to get a warrant to get the records through traditional means and the fact the government had been.
Snowden, saying congress had been saying for years and years and years that this program was necessary.
Interviewer, uh the governor the court says that was misleading which is legalese for saying the.
Snowden, government's effing liars on this uh so that raises the question of okay like as you said.
Interviewer, well what now how does this change everything well it does mean the government has to stop.
Snowden, doing this particular kind of program directly but that program had already shut down.
Interviewer, and the government has a really great team of lawyers uh for every agency right the.
Snowden, doj has got lawyers the white house has lawyers the fbi has lawyers the nsa has lawyers and the cia has lawyers.
Interviewer, and the only thing these guys are paid to do all day is to look at basically these legal.
Snowden, opinions from the court that says all the ways the government broke the law and go huh.
Interviewer, is there any way we can just rejigger this program slightly so that we can dodge around that court.
Snowden, ruling to go all right you know uh the abuses are still happening.
Interviewer, but they're happening in a less abusive way and and then it's business as usual so this is always the process um.
Snowden, with the court's uh ruling against the government this is not an exceptional uh thing in the case of the you know.
Interviewer, it's nsa and cia what happens is when the government breaks the law.
Snowden, as the court has ruled them to do last week there is no punishment right there is no.
Interviewer, criminal liability uh for all the bastards at the head of the fbi the head of the nsa.
Snowden, um who were violating americans rights for decades those guys don't go to prison.
Interviewer, they don't lose their jobs they don't even see the inside you know smell the inside of a courtroom.
Snowden, where they're the ones wearing handcuffs and because of that it creates a culture of unaccountability of impunity right.
Interviewer, which means with each generation of government officials they study this they study the cases against them they.
Snowden, study where they won they study where they lost and what they do is they try to create.
Interviewer, exactly what just happened which is a system where they can break the law.
Snowden, for 10 years you know 2001 uh to 2013 basically and no one even knows that it's.
Interviewer, happening classification protects that right then eventually it gets exposed there's.
Snowden, a leak of course somebody blows the whistle on it right it becomes a scandal the government you.
Interviewer, know they'll disown this program they'll change the law there but somebody like the aclu.
Snowden, will sue the government and so the courts will finally be forced to look at these things but.
Interviewer, the wheels of justice turn slow right the government will try to put the brakes on it um.
Snowden, the plaintiffs the civil society organizations that are suing will have to gather evidence it's really.
Interviewer, difficult to do because the government's not providing anything it's all classified.
Snowden, and then basically it takes another five years another 10 years for the court to get to their verdict.
Interviewer, and then we have it but then nobody goes to jail right nobody actually faces serious consequences who is responsible.
Snowden, for the wrongdoing and so the cycle continues but having said that.
Interviewer, like it might feel disempowering might people might go oh we can't win but this is in the context of a system.
Snowden, where we lack accountability where the government does have a culture of impunity.
Interviewer, this is what winning looks like because things do get better the problem is they get better by.
Snowden, decades they get better by half centuries and centuries if you look at the united states you.
Interviewer, know 200 years ago 100 years ago things were objectively worse on basically every measure.
Snowden, the fact that we have to crawl to the future is a sad thing when we know it could be.
Interviewer, fixed very quickly by establishing some kind of criminal liability for people like.
Snowden, james clapper the former director of national intelligence who lied under oath to congress and the.
Interviewer, american people saying exactly this program didn't exist the nsa wasn't collecting any.
Snowden, information on millions or hundreds of millions of americans when in fact they were doing that every.
Interviewer, day obama did not fire him right obama did not charge him obama let him serve out.
Snowden, the end of his days and then retire happily but it's not an obama problem right.
Interviewer, we see the same kinds of abuses happening under the trump administration we saw the same kind of abuses.
Snowden, happening under the bush administration and the only way this changes um materially is if our government.
Interviewer, changes structurally right and that's kind of the issue that i think everybody in the country sees.
Snowden, when you look at the economy when you look at all the struggle when you look at all the class conflict and divide and.
Interviewer, the political partisanship that's happening today the problem isn't right like about this.
Snowden, law or this court ruling or this agency it's about inequality of opportunity of access.
Interviewer, uh even of privilege right i know people don't like talking about that it's uncomfortable for people like oh my.
Snowden, god you know are you like whatever but the reality is we have a few people in the country.
Interviewer, you know the jeff bezos the bill gates that own everything like 10 people owning half.
Snowden, the country and half the country owning nothing at all.
Interviewer, and this applies to influence right when you have that kind of disproportionality.
Snowden, uh of resources you have that kind of disproportionality of influence your vote means less your.
Interviewer, ability to change the law means less your access to the courts.
Snowden, means less and that's how we end up in the situation where we are today that's very disheartening well it.
Interviewer, doesn't have to be because the important thing is we can change it can we though i mean like what can we do.
Snowden, and what can anybody change this point to stop this overwhelming power that the government has to.
Interviewer, invade your privacy and to all the things that you exposed when you talk about how the particular.
Snowden, program that was in place has been shut down but all they do is manipulate it slightly do it so that.
Interviewer, you can argue in court that it's not the same thing that is a different thing come up with.
Snowden, other justifications for it and withhold evidence and then drag the process.
Interviewer, out for years and years and years and to for you to be so optimistic is really kind of spectacular considering the fact.
Snowden, that you've been hiding in another country allegedly we don't even know you might be in ohio.
Interviewer, we don't know you know we don't know like but but but you are essentially on the lamb and.
Snowden, for exposing something that has now been determined to be illegal so you are correct when you go.
Interviewer, back to obama's hope and uh what was his uh his website hope and change hope and change a big.
Snowden, part of hope and change was protecting whistleblowers do you remember that and that was all.
Interviewer, deleted later later on they were like yeah let's go back and take that  out we didn't know i didn't know what it.
Snowden, was like to actually be president back then i was just trying to get in there but the hope and.
Interviewer, change stuff was still there when you were being tried was still there when they were chasing you.
Snowden, and and and trying to find your location when the guardian article came out the hope and change  was still.
Interviewer, still online yeah and that's the fact that you're so optimistic even though you've been  over.
Snowden, royally i mean you are in my opinion you're a hero i really think that.
Interviewer, and i really and i really think that what what you exposed is hugely important for uh.
Snowden, the american citizens to understand that absolute power corrupts absolutely and these people.
Interviewer, had uh the ability to look into everything and they just still do they have the ability to look into.
Snowden, everything you're doing and the fact that through these years it literally stopped zero terrorist attacks.
Interviewer, zero so this sweeping overwhelming intrusion of your privacy had no impact whatsoever on your safety.
Snowden, well it wasn't about safety it was about power right they told us it was about safety that.
Interviewer, was again it's the save the puppies act um if you uh.
Snowden, if you see government saying all these things are for safety they're protecting you.
Interviewer, and they never establish the efficacy of it the chances are there it probably isn't.
Snowden, effective because you know the government leaks all the time um you know if they say.
Interviewer, uh we saved this person we did that you know whenever they're being criticized they go on tv and they.
Snowden, very seriously go oh that's classified and you know we can't expose that and you never hear of the successes we do.
Interviewer, because it's so important that they stay secret look i worked for the cia i worked for.
Snowden, the nsa that's  um when they do something great you know it's on the front page of the new york.
Interviewer, times by the end of the day because they're fighting for budget they're fighting for clout they're.
Snowden, fighting for authority they're fighting for new laws not constantly uh and so there are no real.
Interviewer, accomplishments that are in the shadows that they just don't tell us i mean very rarely think about when.
Snowden, we got bin laden right you know obama was like i want a press conference within the next.
Interviewer, 20 minutes and again this is not to bag on obama any president would do this um that's.
Snowden, just how it is now of course there are some uh secret successes but it's about.
Interviewer, stuff that no one cares about it's stuff that wouldn't win the political clout it's like.
Snowden, they gained an advantaged negotiating position on the price of shrimp and clove cigarettes which was.
Interviewer, actually one of the stories that came out of some kind of uh classified disclosure that i think.
Snowden, was from from wikileaks that kind of stuff it actually does happen right.
Interviewer, but we're never having a conversation of do you want to give up all of your privacy rights so that we.
Snowden, can get better prices on shrimp and clove cigarettes like that would be a very different.
Interviewer, political conversation than do you want to give up all of your privacy rights because if you don't your.
Snowden, children will die and you know you know it saved the puppies right.
Interviewer, exactly save the puppies 20 20. um so this this thing you ask about uh you know me.
Snowden, and optimism like i have been criticized relentlessly.
Interviewer, uh for being a naive optimist right um and my answer is that you don't do what i did unless you believe that.
Snowden, people can do better i took a very comfortable life you know i was living in hawaii with the woman.
Interviewer, that i loved i had to do basically no work but go in the office and read spy feeds about people uh you know all day.
Snowden, long um and i could have done that you know for the rest of my life quite happily.
Interviewer, would have been great um i set that on fire because i believed that what i saw was wrong and.
Snowden, i believe that people deserve to know about it and i believe that if people did know about it that things would.
Interviewer, change i did not believe it was going to save the world i did not believe.
Snowden, i was going to get you know a ticker tape parade and a pardon you know be welcomed with open arms there's actually.
Interviewer, if you watch citizen 4 which is the documentary from 2013 where i was meeting with reporters.
Snowden, laura poitras had the camera rolling in the room when we talked for the first time.
Interviewer, um i said you know the government's gonna say i harm national security i put.
Snowden, everybody in jeopardy they're gonna charge me under the espionage act uh and they really did try to destroy my.
Interviewer, life they tried to put me in prison forever and to this day they are still trying to.
Snowden, do uh the same thing that's just how it is you know this wasn't like.
Interviewer, even though even though yeah even though the the most recent ruling has showed that you were correct.
Snowden, and what they were doing was illegal and you exposed a crime yeah well i mean this is this is a.
Interviewer, a continuing story in 2013 uh you know when this first came out uh president obama went out on stage uh.
Snowden, you know because he was getting singed in the press and said uh you know uh take it from me.
Interviewer, nobody is listening to your phone calls uh even though nobody says just metadata yeah nobody said they were.
Snowden, listening to your phone calls it wasn't like they had headsets on uh you know 300 plus million people in.
Interviewer, the united states you'd have to have computers do that um but what they did do was they collected.
Snowden, the records of your phone calls and to an analyst an intelligence analyst that's.
Interviewer, more very valuable than the transcripts your phone calls we care less.
Snowden, about what you said on the phone then who you called when you called them what else you were.
Interviewer, doing what your phone was doing right the websites that you would access the cell phone towers they were connected to.
Snowden, all of those things that metadata creates what's called the social graph your pattern of life.
Interviewer, it says based on when your phone becomes active in the morning when you start calling people when you start browsing.
Snowden, when you check your you know twitter feed you're scrolling on instagram whatever.
Interviewer, that's when you wake up when it stops that's when you go to sleep we see where you are we see where you.
Snowden, live we see who you live with all of those things right that's just from metadata you don't need the content.
Interviewer, of your communications i don't need to see what picture you posted on instagram.
Snowden, to know you're awake and active and you're communicating with this person uh at this phone this place this.
Interviewer, area code this ip address you know this version of software whether they're using android or ios you know all of.
Snowden, these things and now as we get smartphones as your cars.
Interviewer, begin connecting to the internet uh it's just richer and richer and richer data i don't know where i was going with that.
Snowden, sorry i got off topic but um the the bottom line is things get better.
Interviewer, they get better slowly all right sorry now obama was saying you know nobody listens to.
Snowden, your phone calls right that was june 2013. by january of 2014 giving a state of the union address.
Interviewer, he went although he could never condone what i did the conversation that i started has made us stronger as a nation.
Snowden, he was calling for the end of this program the passage of a new law called the usa freedom act another save.
Interviewer, the puppies act uh which was better than the thing it was replacing but still really bad.
Snowden, um and he did that not out of the goodness of his heart he did that because the court in.
Interviewer, december of 2013 had ruled these programs were unlawful and likely unconstitutional.
Snowden, and this is again it's not an obama thing it's a power thing this is how the system works right.
Interviewer, but year by year step by step things get better we make progress a little bit at a time and the fact that.
Snowden, someone is suing the fact that the aclu is bringing this case and we should thank them for that.
Interviewer, for years which is a difficult and expensive proposition with no guarantee of success.
Snowden, means that we have stronger privacy result rights seven years later as a result that.
Interviewer, doesn't mean we save the world that doesn't mean we relax we sit down on the couch you know.
Snowden, there's the golden sunset that's not how life works it is a constant struggle.
Interviewer, but when we do struggle when we do stand up we believe in something so strongly we don't.
Snowden, merely believe in it uh but we risk something for that belief uh we work together and we.
Interviewer, pulled the species forward an inch at a time we move away from that swamp of impunity.
Snowden, and unaccountability uh into a future where hey maybe not just a little guy.
Interviewer, breaks the law and goes to jail but maybe a senator maybe an attorney general.
Snowden, maybe a president right and that would be a very good precedent to have.
Interviewer, do you wonder whether or not someone will use you as a political chess piece.
Snowden, at this point and decide i mean i i believe if correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty.
Interviewer, sure you have overwhelming support of the general public most people believe that what you did.
Snowden, was was a good thing for america and that you are in fact a patriot i i think the vast majority people.
Interviewer, and the people that i've talked to i have talked to a few people that disagree with that.
Snowden, they're misinformed they were misinformed about what you did and what information you were leaked or whether.
Interviewer, or not people's lives were put in danger because of that and i had to explain.
Snowden, the whole chain of events and where the information actually was how it was leaked and what you had.
Interviewer, done to protect people there's there's a could you plea please explain.
Snowden, that because it wasn't just that the information was dumped yeah so i mean this is really the.
Interviewer, subject of our our our last conversation goes on for three hours but i wrote a book.
Snowden, yeah but i just would just so this will stand alone i'm yeah i'll go through it so uh the idea and.
Interviewer, this is the subject of my first book permanent record which was why i came on last year and actually.
Snowden, uh just this week the soft cover came out so it's more affordable for people who didn't want to get it.
Interviewer, before um is this story right it's who i am where i came from why i did this.
Snowden, how and what it meant i didn't just reveal information i gave it to journalists right.
Interviewer, these journalists were only given access to the information on the condition that they would publish.
Snowden, no story simply because it was newsworthy or interesting right they weren't going to click bait classified.
Interviewer, documents they would only publish stories if they were willing to make an independent.
Snowden, institutional judgment and stand by it that it was in the public interest that this be known right.
Interviewer, and then as an extraordinary measure on top of that before they publish the stories right and this is.
Snowden, not me publishing things putting them out on the internet or blog or something which i could have done would have been.
Interviewer, very easy uh it's not me telling them what to write or not to write they're.
Snowden, doing this the guardian the washington post you know der spiegel they are then going to the united states.
Interviewer, government in advance of publication and giving the government a chance an adversarial opportunity to.
Snowden, argue against publication to go you guys don't get it you know snowden's a liar these documents are.
Interviewer, false or he's not lying and yes these are true but these programs are effective they're.
Snowden, saving lives whatever and here's what we can show you to convince you please don't publish this.
Interviewer, or leave out this detail and in every case i'm aware of that process was followed and that's why.
Snowden, now in 2020 remember we're seven years on from 2013. the government has never shown a single example of any harm that.
Interviewer, has come as a result of the publication of these documents back in 2013 the revelation of mass surveillance.
Snowden, and it's that's what i wanted to bring yeah and i mean it's unscientific uh but i've seen polls.
Interviewer, run on twitter uh very recently uh in the last few weeks when this pardon question came out.
Snowden, where 90 like 90 plus percent of people were in favor of a pardon and that's crazy.
Interviewer, uh even in 2013 when we were doing well you know it was like 60 percent um in favor among young people but it.
Snowden, was like 40 percent for older people but that's because the government was on tv every sunday you know bringing these.
Interviewer, uh cia suits going uh who were there with their very stern.
Snowden, faces going oh this caused great damage and cost lives and everything like that but those arguments stopped being.
Interviewer, convincing when seven years later after they told us and the sky is falling.
Snowden, the atmosphere never catches fire right the oceans never boil off we're still alive.
Interviewer, uh and i i think people can see through that and that was again this exactly what you said people.
Snowden, don't know this history uh that that 10 percent who are against it.
Interviewer, and actually a lot of the 90 who are even in favor of it um they don't know the details it wasn't.
Snowden, well covered by the media at the time it was all about this person said that that person said that is it true is it false.
Interviewer, you know sort of uh they were playing on character.
Snowden, they were trying to make a drama out of it and that's a big part of why i wrote permanent record.
Interviewer, uh and it's been tremendously gratifying to see people connect to it and actually this.
Snowden, uh you know i mentioned it uh we talked on on twitter when we were talking about the possibility of having.
Interviewer, this conversation and i was like i looked back at our first conversation we had.
Snowden, and it's had like 16 million views man that's for a three hour conversation uh i like set.
Interviewer, and then probably an equal amount of people just listen to it in audio right and that that was just for one.
Snowden, clip on youtube there were smaller clips like talking about cell phone surveillance and that.
Interviewer, was like another 10 million views 77 000 comments uh the book on amazon has.
Snowden, thousands of reviews it's got a 4.8 rating which like by the number of people and how.
Interviewer, it's rated that's one of the best autobiographies according to ordinary people the.
Snowden, audience in like years and to see that after these years of attacks.
Interviewer, to me is evidence that despite all these news guys uh at night going well senator you know.
Snowden, uh no one really cares about privacy these days these kids with their facebooks and.
Interviewer, their instagrams uh you know people do care what they're actually feeling is kind of.
Snowden, what you got to earlier with like this sensation that nothing changes like even when we win we lose but the.
Interviewer, thing is you've got to have a broader view of time you've got to look at the sweep of.
Snowden, history rather than the atmosphere of the moment because right now yes things are very.
Interviewer, bad and even if you love donald trump because i know some of your viewers do.
Snowden, you got to admit a lot of things in the world suck right now a lot of things in the country.
Interviewer, suck right now but the thing is they only get better if somebody does the hard work to make.
Snowden, them better and there's no magic wand there's no happy ending right life is not that.
Interviewer, simple but together we can make it better and we do that through.
Snowden, struggle do you uh has there been any discussion about someone pardoning you.
Interviewer, has there been i mean this was the question initially that led to this but i wanted you to expand on what would.
Snowden, actually went down but has there been any discussion about you being pardoned or someone using you as.
Interviewer, like i said a political chess piece because you it would be a smart thing and if anybody.
Snowden, has had a problem with the intelligence community it is donald trump i mean he's the only president in our in.
Interviewer, any memory that has had open disagreements and been openly disparaging of the intelligence.
Snowden, community well that's not true it was jfk but that didn't go very well that's right.
Interviewer, i forgot about that good point yeah that that went terrible for him uh for trump for trump it actually seems.
Snowden, to be a positive in some strange way um if anybody is going to pardon you i would imagine.
Interviewer, that would be the guy so this idea of like the political bargaining chip has actually been used in a different.
Snowden, way uh there was the idea um and it's funny because this was actually promoted by all these like cia.
Interviewer, deputy directors and whatnot who were responsible for these abuses of americans rights.
Snowden, who were writing opinion pieces in the newspaper and they were like you know what if vladimir putin you know sends.
Interviewer, snowden to trump as like an inauguration gift wouldn't that be terrible for him and.
Snowden, they were like intent you know um but i don't think when we talk about this stuff uh.
Interviewer, i i don't think there's anything i can do to control one of the things people have asked is like would i accept.
Snowden, a pardon uh from donald trump and i think that apprehends what a pardon is and how it.
Interviewer, works uh pardon's not a contract a pardon is not something that you agree to.
Snowden, uh pardon is a constitutionally enumerated power i think it's article two section two um.
Interviewer, where the reason that it exists uh is basically a check on the laws and the judiciary.
Snowden, uh where the laws as written become corrosive to the intention of them and this is something that i.
Interviewer, think actually is meaningful you know people are like are you gonna ask uh donald trump for a pardon and the.
Snowden, answer is is no um but i will ask for pardon for terry albert and daniel hale and.
Interviewer, reality winner and all the other american whistleblowers who have been treated.
Snowden, unfairly by this system the whole thing that brought this up was two weeks ago some journalists.
Interviewer, asked the president like oh you know what do you think about snowden are you going to pardon him.
Snowden, and he said he seemed to be thinking about it he heard i have been treated very unfairly.
Interviewer, that's accurate because it's impossible to get a fair trial uh under the espionage act which.
Snowden, is what i've been charged under and every american whistleblower since daniel ellsberg in the 1970s has been.
Interviewer, charged under this law the espionage act which makes no distinction between someone.
Snowden, who is stealing secrets and selling them to foreign governments which neither i nor any of these other.
Interviewer, people have done and giving them freely to journalists to advance the public interest of the.
Snowden, american people rather than the private interests of these spies you know.
Interviewer, individually and this is the kind of uh this is the kind of circumstance for which.
Snowden, the pardon power exists where the courts and judges will not or cannot end a fundamentally unfair and abusive.
Interviewer, circumstance in the united states either because they're uh fearful of being criticized of soft on.
Snowden, terrorism or whatever uh or because the law prohibits them from doing so the the problem with the.
Interviewer, espionage act is it means you can't tell the jury why you did what you did.
Snowden, you cannot mount what's called a public interest offense where you say hell yeah i broke the law.
Interviewer, i took a classified document and i gave it to the journalist and the journalist published it and then it went to the.
Snowden, courts and the court said this guy was right the government was breaking the law.
Interviewer, in the courts if i were you know in in prison today uh as reality winners in prison today or.
Snowden, rather daniel hale uh who revealed uh government abuses related to the drone program or.
Interviewer, terry albury who revealed problems with uh racial policies in the fbi.
Snowden, how they were being abused um when these guys are on trial all of that stuff is forbidden from.
Interviewer, being spoken daniel ellsberg's lawyer uh asked daniel ellsberg.
Snowden, why did you do it in court in open court under oath you know why did you publish or provide.
Interviewer, journalists the pentagon papers and the prosecutor said objection objection he can't say that.
Snowden, and the judge said sustained fine he can't say it and his attorney looked at the judge like he was crazy and said.
Interviewer, i've never heard of a trial where the jury is not allowed to hear.
Snowden, why uh a defendant did what they did and the judge said well you're seeing one now.
Interviewer, and this is why the pardon power exists well that's what's so creepy about something like the espionage espionage.
Snowden, act if if you can't even establish a motive you can't even explain.
Interviewer, that you were doing this for the american people that there's a real precedent that should be set for for.
Snowden, this kind of thing especially in regards to what you're being charged with which has now been determined.
Interviewer, that you were exposing something that was in fact illegal and this is it's it's it's an incredibly.
Snowden, un-american thing it's it's very un-american it really is but this is it's.
Interviewer, disturbingly so i mean we see these kind of injustices happening in the united states every day and it's not about the.
Snowden, espionage act specifically i mean you see with drug charges you see it with civil forfeiture.
Interviewer, asset forfeiture where like you know they take an old lady's car because her nephew was selling weed or something.
Snowden, like that and there's no way for her to get it back whether we're talking civil whether.
Interviewer, we're talking federal whether we're talking um sorry civil or criminal whether we're.
Snowden, talking federal or state we see where the system of laws in the united states.
Interviewer, is letting people down constantly uh but the question becomes how do we fix this how does that get addressed and.
Snowden, you know you can mount a national campaign you can try to change the law but as we talked about.
Interviewer, before unless you're unless you're jeff bezos unless you're bill gates that's very difficult to do.
Snowden, but the governor can pardon people for state crimes the president can pardon people for federal crimes but we have.
Interviewer, not developed a compassionate culture that actually looks at this.
Snowden, like every president has abused their pardon power or their pardon authority to sort of let.
Interviewer, their cronies off the hook we've seen this president we've seen in the previous presidents.
Snowden, sure but it is very difficult to establish an understanding among average people uh.
Interviewer, that it's actually okay for presidents to use this power more liberally when particularly we're talking about.
Snowden, non-violent offenses when we're talking about things uh that have not you know uh they're not.
Interviewer, that controversial but they are being controversialized because of the political atmosphere of partisanship.
Snowden, where everything has to be criticized for political advantage from one side or the other everything's become a football.
Interviewer, well particularly in your case when you're talking about polls that show 90 percent of people support you being.
Snowden, pardoned and this recent ruling that what you exposed was illegal.
Interviewer, i wonder how much the president actually knows about your case you know because it's a good question i.
Snowden, mean he's famous for barely paying attention in briefings and.
Interviewer, you know i mean i just i can't imagine that in 2013 this was fully on his radar where he.
Snowden, investigated it and read all the documents and really got deep into it i i can't imagine he really.
Interviewer, knows everything that went down i bet he hasn't seen citizen four i mean i bet i.
Snowden, sure i really you know what i mean listen if i had his number i really.
Interviewer, would um and i i do know people who know him and i am going to communicate that.
Snowden, uh after this conversation i think that would be i literally think that would win him a.
Interviewer, tremendous amount of political favor i really do i think particularly at this point in time.
Snowden, where people are really look if there's ever a time where people are fed up about the overreaching.
Interviewer, power of government it's during this pandemic lockdown you know for good or for bad whether.
Snowden, it's incorrect or incorrect people are very frustrated right now with power.
Interviewer, they're very frustrated right now with the draconian measures that some states have put in place to keep people from.
Snowden, working and and their eyes keep people safe and all this.
Interviewer, would contribute to the motivation to uh to pardon you because i think that it would show people that the president.
Snowden, actually does agree that there have been some overreaches and in your case not just an overeat but a miscarriage of.
Interviewer, justice a disgusting unamerican overreach i think when you ask this question about.
Snowden, like how much does he know about the case it's fair to say.
Interviewer, not a lot because he's intentionally being misadvised by his advisors you've had the attorney.
Snowden, general william barr who says he would be you know vehemently opposed to a pardon for me.
Interviewer, uh his secretary of state mike pompeo has literally i i think said i should be killed john bolton at least said i.
Snowden, should be killed um and you know i i think when this conversation first came up a couple.
Interviewer, weeks ago mike pompeo probably hid every pen in the white house because he's trying to make sure things like.
Snowden, this don't happen i think there are a lot of people uh who try and control the president.
Interviewer, but this whole question about you know uh what's right for me uh what's right for.
Snowden, the president in terms of political advantage is is the wrong question this is why i.
Interviewer, haven't been advocating for pardon i didn't ask for a pardon from obama i did ask for a.
Snowden, pardon for chelsea manning which we didn't get but we did get clemency uh and that's an important.
Interviewer, thing because what we need is we need for pardons to be made not as.
Snowden, a question of political advantage uh but as a decision taken on uh to further the public interest and.
Interviewer, this is why i say pardon you know all of these previous whistleblowers uh.
Snowden, uh thomas drake john kiriakou terry albury reality winner daniel hale there are many names daniel ellsberg.
Interviewer, right he wasn't convicted so he got out but these people deserve recognition as the patriots who stood up and took a.
Snowden, risk for the rest of us that they are look at the the current cases right that don't.
Interviewer, even require an exercise of the pardon at the party but julian assange right now today.
Snowden, is in court in the uk fighting an extradition trial to the united states for those who don't remember.
Interviewer, this is the guy who's the head of wikileaks right and he really fell out of favor.
Snowden, in 2016 because he published the hillary emails and everything like that or podesta emails.
Interviewer, but he's not being charged for that the extradition trial has nothing to do with that.
Snowden, actually the us government uh under william barr right the current attorney general is.
Interviewer, trying to extradite this guy and put him in prison for the rest of his life for the best.
Snowden, work that wikileaks ever did that has won awards in every country basically around the planet including.
Interviewer, the united states which is the iraq and afghanistan war logs right.
Snowden, detainee records in guantanamo bay things that are about explicit war crimes and abuses of power.
Interviewer, torture and people who were killed who should have been killed violations of use of force protocols and all of these.
Snowden, things right and this could all be made to go away if william barr the attorney general simply.
Interviewer, dropped the charges and he should why isn't he well julian assange has literally been.
Snowden, tortured i mean the guy was locked in that embassy for how many years with no.
Interviewer, exposure to daylight just completely trapped and you've seen videos of him skateboarding.
Snowden, around the the embassy he looks like he's going crazy in there and now he's in jail and on trial.
Interviewer, the whole thing is it's so disturbing because you know when it boils down to like what.
Snowden, what did he do that is illegal what did he do that people disagree with that people the.
Interviewer, united states disagree with in terms of the citizens well he he exposed her horrific.
Snowden, crimes he exposed things that were deeply uh that were that the united states citizens are deeply opposed to.
Interviewer, and the fact that that is something that you in this country can be uh prosecuted for that they would.
Snowden, try to extradite you and and drag you from another country they'd kick him out of the embassy and.
Interviewer, bring him back to the united states to try him for that it seems like we're talking about some kangaroo court it.
Snowden, seems like we're talking about some some dictatorship where you know you have.
Interviewer, these uh no protection of freedom of speech no protection under the first amendment.
Snowden, no no protection under the the rights of the press it's just it's so disturbing that there are.
Interviewer, workarounds for our constitution our bill of rights that are.
Snowden, with that we all just agree to just accept that this is happening there's no riots in the streets for this.
Interviewer, there's no no one's up in arms that they're trying to extradite julian assange no no.
Snowden, no one i mean it's not in the news like for whatever reason the mainstream news has.
Interviewer, barely covered it over this uh his current court proceedings in the in the uk well i think a lot of this.
Snowden, comes down to the fact that uh they see julian assange by this day i mean the a lot of the.
Interviewer, mainstream media the broadcast outlets as a partisan figure now and it's really sad because.
Snowden, the most dangerous thing about the charges against julian assange is if they extradite julian assange if.
Interviewer, julian assange is convicted he's charged under the espionage act the same act that i'm charged under the same.
Snowden, thing that all these whistleblowers are charged under but he is not a source the way as.
Interviewer, abusive as these espionage act charges have run in the last 50 years is the government.
Snowden, had sort of a quiet agreement they never charge the press outlets they never.
Interviewer, charge the new york times they never charge the washington post they don't charge the journalists they.
Snowden, charge their sources they charge the chelsea mannings right they they charge the edward snowden's.
Interviewer, they charge the thomas drake's the daniel ellsbergs but the press they're left alone they.
Snowden, are breaking that agreement with the julian assange case assange is not the source he is merely a.
Interviewer, publisher he runs a press organization people like oh julian assange is not a journalist.
Snowden, he's not whatever there is no way you can make that argument in court.
Interviewer, in a way that will be defensible particularly given what we've talked about with the government and how.
Snowden, careful they are to avoid prior uh court precedents and to work around it and create you know obscure.
Interviewer, legal theories that are legal fictions everyone knows they're a lie everyone knows these.
Snowden, theories are false but under the law you know they bend just enough that they can pass the.
Interviewer, argument through and get the conviction they want you cannot convict julian assange.
Snowden, the chief editor and publisher of wikileaks under the espionage act without exposing.
Interviewer, the new york times the washington post cbs abc nbc you know cnn fox whoever to the same kind of charges under this.
Snowden, president and every coming president and i think people don't think about that.
Interviewer, that that is disturbing you know another thing that's disturbed well there's many things that are disturbing.
Snowden, about this case but another thing that's been disturbing was he was a guy who the left supported.
Interviewer, up until 2016 and then it became inconvenient right it was great then when he's.
Snowden, dragging yes clinton it's not so great right right when.
Interviewer, when the the footage was revealed from the uh uh i i believe it was a helicopter.
Snowden, that showed it was uh collateral murder remember that video that was collapsing out.
Interviewer, in iraq yeah it was a very helicopter in iraq firing on two reuters journalists uh yes.
Snowden, local militants or something yes exactly um that was the left's he was the darling of the left i mean.
Interviewer, they were all free julian assange and it's just it's so interesting how that narrative can.
Snowden, shift so completely to all of a sudden he's a puppet of russia and that's what it became in 2016 and.
Interviewer, that propaganda stuck and people who were pro julian assange before.
Snowden, now all of a sudden i i've i've seen these people say  julian assange like.
Interviewer, that guy he's a puppet of russia i'm like like how much have you looked into this.
Snowden, it's amazing how that kind of propaganda when you just get.
Interviewer, the surface veneer of the the the whatever the narrative there that is they're trying to push how well it.
Snowden, spreads that all these people who were these educated.
Interviewer, left-wing people now all of a sudden were anti-wikileaks and i'm like do you not remember how.
Snowden, this whole thing got started it was the iraq war which we all opposed do not remember.
Interviewer, this whole  lie about the weapons of mass destruction that got us into this crazy.
Snowden, war and then julian assange and wikileaks exposed so much of this and yet here we are.
Interviewer, in 2016 it turns up on its head and now he's a puppet of russia and wikileaks is bad because.
Snowden, inconveniently the information that he released damaged hillary clinton's campaign.
Interviewer, yeah i i think a lot of it comes down to people forgetting uh what principles are and why they're important yes right um.
Snowden, you can hate julian assange you can think julian assange is a puppet of russia you can think he's the worst.
Interviewer, person on earth right he's a reincarnation of hitler or stalin or whatever.
Snowden, and still realize that convicting him harms you it harms your society it harms your children's future.
Interviewer, people forget about this and today is a world where everything's become partisan but the aclu cut their teeth they they.
Snowden, made their reputation on defending a nazi march through a jewish neighborhood.
Interviewer, and this is because it's about uh the right to assembly the right to freedom of speech you do not have a.
Snowden, right to be free from offense right there is no uh constitutional right to a safe space.
Interviewer, but that doesn't mean you do nothing that doesn't mean you have no opinion that doesn't mean you have no political.
Snowden, power what it does mean is that you have to recognize that.
Interviewer, everyone has the right to their own opinion even terrible opinions what we have to.
Snowden, protect is the speech is the platform is the assemblies the association is the process.
Interviewer, that allows us to understand and recognize and identify when people did break the law when they.
Snowden, did harm others to go to a fair trial where the jury can consider why they did what they did.
Interviewer, what they did and not just whether it was legal or illegal but whether it was moral or.
Snowden, immoral whether it was right or whether it was wrong and whether they are the lowest person.
Interviewer, you know the the most ordinary citizen in the country or the highest elected official hold them to.
Snowden, the same standard of behavior the same rule of law whereas today you know we call them uh.
Interviewer, public officials and private citizens but with the all of the surveillance all of the data collection.
Snowden, uh people in power commercially or governmentally they know everything about us and we know nothing.
Interviewer, about them uh we break the smallest law we go to jail we get a fine we get screwed we.
Snowden, can't get a job we can't get a loan uh but if they you know flagrantly abuse their office.
Interviewer, their authority uh they get a pass they go on the speakers circuit you know it's it's all uh sunshine and rainbows.
Snowden, for them uh and the way we change these things is remembering our principles of being.
Interviewer, willing to stand and defend them it's also instinctual for people to be partisan.
Snowden, and it's tribal it's a tribal thing and in this day and age people are rabidly partisan and the rejection of.
Interviewer, nuance is so disturbing to me and it's so disturbing that a lot of this happens from the left now.
Snowden, whereas the left used to be all about freedom of speech the aclu is i mean it's just you you automatically.
Interviewer, think of the liberal people when you think of the aclu but.
Snowden, the academy just for the record is a non-partisan organization yes but supported overwhelmingly.
Interviewer, certainly by by left-wing people um i mean obviously they are nonpartisan but.
Snowden, but people are so partisan today that this rejection of nuance it's it's so it's so easy for people.
Interviewer, to look at things as left versus right and ignore all of the sins of their team and concentrate on defeating the other.
Snowden, side and it seems to be a giant part of the problem today.
Interviewer, so much so that people are in favor a lot of people are in favor of de-platforming people.
Snowden, that just simply disagree with them and i want to talk to you about that because that seems to be a gigantic issue.
Interviewer, not seems to be it is a gigantic issue with social media whether it's with twitter or youtube or.
Snowden, many things um in fact unity 2020 is uh something that.
Interviewer, my friend my friend brett weinstein uh is putting together this idea that we should look.
Snowden, across both parties for people that are reasonable and rational people and look at what.
Interviewer, we agree with rather than simply sitting on on partisan policy uh on on party lines and only voting.
Snowden, you know blue across the board or red across the board and let's look at reasonable people from.
Interviewer, both sides whether it's dan crenshaw and tulsi gabbard or who whoever it is that are they represent different.
Snowden, parties but they're both reasonable people let's get them together and have these communications.
Interviewer, they were banned from twitter they were simply ban banned from twitter for simply saying.
Snowden, reject both trump and biden look for a third choice.
Interviewer, so this is not there's nothing offensive about what they did in fact they're they're encouraging.
Snowden, choice they're encouraging this idea that we don't have to be a two-party system.
Interviewer, that in fact even though we have had libertarian and green parties we kind of look at it like  it's.
Snowden, like a protest vote if you vote green party you know you're not going to elect that person.
Interviewer, for president it's kind of like we tolerate it but when someone like ross perot came around.
Snowden, it threw a monkey wrench into the gears and became very dangerous for both sides because the republicans lost a lot of.
Interviewer, votes and that's how bill clinton got into office and george h.w bush did not get a second term directly.
Snowden, because the influence of ross perot so they changed the requirements for getting into the.
Interviewer, debates and everything became very different and very more complicated after that.
Snowden, the fact that they would that twitter would be willing to ban unity 2020 specifically because they're.
Interviewer, calling for people to walk away from this idea that you have to either vote.
Snowden, for trump or biden and trying to get mainstream acceptance of a potential third party candidate.
Interviewer, is extremely disturbing but deep platforming in general i think is extremely disturbing because.
Snowden, it's a slippery slope if you decide that someone has views that are.
Interviewer, opposite of yours and they bother you those views bother you and you could do whatever you can to get.
Snowden, them off of a platform it's very dangerous because someone from the right who gains power or.
Interviewer, someone from an opposing party that gains power if they get into a position of power in.
Snowden, social media if they own gigantic social media company like twitter or youtube.
Interviewer, and they decide in turn to go after people that agree with your ideology well then we.
Snowden, have a freedom of speech issue and you're you're literally supporting the suppression of freedom of speech.
Interviewer, if you're supporting deep platforming people on social media and i've always thought that the answer.
Snowden, to someone saying something you disagree with or something someone saying.
Interviewer, something you vehemently oppose is a better argument that's what they it's supposed to be yeah it's supposed.
Snowden, to be you should expose the problems and what they're doing and i'm seeing so many people.
Interviewer, particularly on the left that are happy when people get de-platformed and people that just are.
Snowden, just are contrary to their perspective contrary to their ideology and it's it's i think it's very dangerous.
Interviewer, and it's too easy it's too easy to accept it's in this this goes back to what you're.
Snowden, saying this partisan viewpoint that we have today fiercely rabidly partisan.
Interviewer, in a way that i've never seen in my life yeah i i think the question of d platforming.
Snowden, this is one of the the central issues of our time that's really overlooked and it's under-appreciated uh.
Interviewer, so many people on both sides are in favor of this uh when it's somebody they don't like.
Snowden, right yes the central issue is this do we want.
Interviewer, companies deciding what can and cannot be said do we want governments.
Snowden, deciding what can and cannot be said if the answer is yes uh it is a very different kind of society than.
Interviewer, we have had traditionally i do think we need to understand uh where this impulse came from.
Snowden, how it came to be and why it seemed reasonable and a lot of people forget this and it came from isis.
Interviewer, if you remember the islamic state it was all over youtube they were all over twitter they were all over facebook.
Snowden, and they were literally burning people alive in cages they were beheading people you know pushing people off.
Interviewer, buildings just horrible stuff um and that raises a tough question for a lot of these.
Snowden, companies now it's very easy to make the argument that all right this is a direct call for.
Interviewer, violence this is literally uh supporting terrorism um and as a private company we have no.
Snowden, obligation to let people use our platforms therefore we're closing their accounts.
Interviewer, right we're shutting this off we're erasing it we can do whatever we want it's our website don't like it leave.
Snowden, um constitutionally there's no uh freedom of speech issue implicated there because the.
Interviewer, constitution restrains the federal government and the state governments.
Snowden, in certain circumstances not private companies but once that precedent had been established.
Interviewer, uh that they would do this for isis they started going well what about these other people uh what about these things.
Snowden, that could be construed as calls to violence okay what if they're not violence at all.
Interviewer, what if it's harassment what if it's abuse what if it's racism what if it's you know criminality what if it's drug.
Snowden, culture what if it's pornography what if it's whatever and there will always be more what ifs.
Interviewer, and the categories of prohibited speech will constantly expand so we need to ask.
Snowden, ourselves well who is best placed to make those decisions about what can and cannot be said.
Interviewer, traditionally the access to broadcast was limited you had radio you had tv if you didn't.
Snowden, have that you had the soapbox on the corner right or the local university uh the.
Interviewer, coffee shop and somebody owned those places or somebody ran those places.
Snowden, you know the college president would say this person would be invited to speak this person wouldn't be invited to speak.
Interviewer, um and i actually think it's right and proper for people to be able to protest.
Snowden, speakers to say this person shouldn't speak at our college but i think the college.
Interviewer, itself the institution has to be willing to make value judgments about why.
Snowden, they invite certain people to speak and if that person is very unpopular speaker if that person is uh.
Interviewer, representing a viewpoint that is not well supported by the college uh if it's not necessarily what students.
Snowden, want to hear but the administration believes like the faculty believes.
Interviewer, that it's something students should hear isn't that why we have universities we don't go to class.
Snowden, to learn you know necessarily like you don't go to a literature course to read the things that you want to read.
Interviewer, you just go home and read those yourself you go to study a curriculum to something else you want to benefit from.
Snowden, the experience from the perspectives of others the question that people have is how.
Interviewer, does this expand into the wider audience right what happens when you move beyond universities what happens when you move.
Snowden, to news broadcast what happens when you move to the internet what happens when everyone everywhere can.
Interviewer, broadcast and this is where i think things get really tricky not can people say what they want as.
Snowden, long as they're not advocating violence or whatever i don't think this should be a difficult issue.
Interviewer, but this gets complicated when you have things like youtube's next video suggestion.
Snowden, algorithm because the idea of universal uh speech universal ability to broadcast.
Interviewer, is exactly as you said well what is the counter for this you've got freaking nazis on the internet and i'm.
Snowden, not talking like whatever the guy's got a trump sticker on his truck i'm talking.
Interviewer, goose stepping you know swastika bearing actual freaking nazi um you have those people out there on.
Snowden, the internet calling for violence calling for all these terrible things and normally the way you deal.
Interviewer, with this even in the case of something like isis you drag them onto the platform you.
Snowden, discredit their ideas before the world because if you don't if you drive them underground if you.
Interviewer, make them you know this this faction that's you know hanging out at a radical mosque.
Snowden, or you know they're hanging out the hardware store if they're freaking nazis or whatever.
Interviewer, there are uh places where you create its own community that is sheltered from other perspectives.
Snowden, it's sheltered from other ideas and that is where extremism thrives where it cannot be.
Interviewer, challenged where it cannot be exposed for what it really is.
Snowden, but when you've got youtube going oh you like nazi a how about nazi b how about nazi c right.
Interviewer, these people never get exposed to counter speech and this is where things get tricky.
Snowden, well it also gets tricky when you decide that someone is saying something that's offensive.
Interviewer, and you remove them from the platform and then you open the door for other things being offensive things.
Snowden, that maybe aren't offensive to you the the slope gets slippery and then you have wrong speak you have.
Interviewer, you have newly dictated language that you have to use you have new restrictions on.
Snowden, ideologies things you're not allowed to espouse i mean twitter will ban you for dead naming.
Interviewer, someone they will ban you for life meaning if you transition to be a woman and you call yourself edwina and i call.
Snowden, you edward you i will be banned for life with no recourse.
Interviewer, which is madness it's matt because i can call you  face and no one has a problem with it yeah.
Snowden, you know what i'm saying i could call you a terrible i could i could call you that and there's no.
Interviewer, problem but if i you choose a name that used to accurately represent you.
Snowden, as a different gender because this is some new incredibly important distinction that.
Interviewer, we've decided it takes precedence over everything else including it's it's more significant.
Snowden, than insults more significance than a demeaning of i'd call you a.
Interviewer, i could demean your intellect all those things are fine but if i choose to call you by a name that used.
Snowden, to actually accurately represent you when you were a different gender or when you.
Interviewer, identified with a different gender because of today's political climate that is grounds for banning you for life.
Snowden, it shows you how incredibly slippery censorship can get.
Interviewer, because i would have never imagined that if you said to me 10 years ago well when someone becomes a transgender.
Snowden, person 10 years 10 years ago if you said this to me if someone becomes a transgender person you.
Interviewer, call them by their original name you could be banned from social media for life i'm like get the  out of here.
Snowden, they'll never get to that no one's going to be that unreasonable that's crazy because you could call some.
Interviewer, people so many disparaging and insulting names but you can't say their name that isn't even insulting.
Snowden, dead naming that's what it's called so it just shows you dead naming of today you agree with that today that opens up.
Interviewer, the door for all kinds of crazy  five years from now 10 years from now if we still get more and more.
Snowden, rabidly politically polarized and we are our idea of pc culture gets more and more extreme.
Interviewer, you're you're in you're on a greased hill and if you decide to give up a little.
Snowden, ground the slide is imminent i i think this is like you can argue on that axis.
Interviewer, um but i think incrementalism and the failures of imagination going you know 10 years ago we couldn't imagine this.
Snowden, would have been abandonable offense is the wrong way to go about it because if you go back to the founding of the.
Interviewer, country saying you know women should have the right to vote black people should have.
Snowden, the right to vote you know that was unimaginable that would get you equivalently d platform not welcomed to.
Interviewer, the the speaking community or whatever sure but those are positive and inclusive things right i'm.
Snowden, not saying uh right i'm associating these directly i'm talking about the principle here.
Interviewer, uh because you can attack these things in that direction go oh you know this doesn't seem right but remember it's.
Snowden, twitter making these rules it's youtube making visuals there's not a court making these rules.
Interviewer, um and anybody technically today can decide who and can and can't uh who can and cannot speak on their.
Snowden, platforms the question is what should we do what kind of culture should we promote.
Interviewer, how should we have these conversations and how should we make them available and i think civility is not too much to.
Snowden, ask people generally as you say you know calling people  or whatever is completely normal.
Interviewer, um on the internet and that's not really gonna get you banned from anywhere uh and now you have all of these.
Snowden, companies sort of uh contorting themselves to fit into these blocks to not uh or.
Interviewer, sort of anger all of these different demographics but if we truly want to have.
Snowden, a global broadcast a public commons the question i think that's more important here is.
Interviewer, not so much uh what should and should not be banned because that's accepting the premise of.
Snowden, banning it's how do we create an inclusive uh platform where everyone can talk and.
Interviewer, even strictly and harshly disagree with each other without it coming down to name calling.
Snowden, without trying to dox people without trying to uh basically dog whistle them or screw.
Interviewer, them or hurt them or harm them however now look i am not above calling people bad names on the internet.
Snowden, i've said terrible things i grew up on the internet right i was an  right and we all were and the.
Interviewer, thing is the worst things that we say at any moment today.
Snowden, they are permanent the internet never forgets right so when you say these things and you know.
Interviewer, there's a young audience listening right now to to like everything.
Snowden, um and they think it's cool they think it's funny or they don't think it's cooler they don't think it's funny.
Interviewer, but they think they shouldn't be the platform for it they they they're edgy you know they push the lines or whatever.
Snowden, they get that out there and they start emulating this behavior they start saying mean things they start saying.
Interviewer, cruel things i did it myself right not in this context but in whatever the equivalent would be you know.
Snowden, 20 years ago um and that's there are going to be consequences for that they're going to.
Interviewer, be judged by that whether they should or should not whether it is right or wrong because as.
Snowden, you said there's so much tribalism today and i think we have to create positive examples i think you're right.
Interviewer, the deplatforming is a huge issue it is a tremendous issue right but we should think about what it is.
Snowden, that we're actually uh fighting against and i don't think like trans issues or whatever uh.
Interviewer, when it comes down to basically civility is the hill to die on because i think there's better arguments.
Snowden, well i i certainly think we should encourage civility there's no no doubt about it what i'm.
Interviewer, getting at is that the idea that you can be banned for life for that.
Snowden, is it's preposterous i think civility is one of the most important things our culture could ever promote.
Interviewer, and i and i think it's very difficult to promote civility online because the anonymous aspect of there's.
Snowden, no accountability internet interaction right there's no accountability there's you're not getting social cues from.
Interviewer, people it's just a completely different world when you're interacting with people.
Snowden, especially for kids you know i mean if you had given me the internet when i was 15.
Interviewer, years old i would have said the most horrific things to people for sure and i'm sure many 15 year old.
Snowden, kids are doing exactly that right now i think the more we can encourage civility.
Interviewer, the better we all are in all aspects of our life whether it's it person to person face to face or.
Snowden, online i try very hard to only say things online.
Interviewer, that i would say to someone's face and if you uh online now i do not interact with people in any way.
Snowden, shape or form that's negative i don't do it i don't i don't believe in it i treat it.
Interviewer, the same way if it's avoidable i avoid it and i i think that's incredibly important.
Snowden, but this does an important point which is i mean what it really gets to the core of the.
Interviewer, issue failures of civility the fact that people say bad things that people don't have accountability that.
Snowden, there are you know there's a whole spectrum of people out there from angels to devils right there's.
Interviewer, ordinary people and even the best of people have bad days and say terrible things.
Snowden, for sure we're all we do need people to have some responsibility for having a thicker skin you know hey.
Interviewer, look guys i've had people literally advocating my murder right like that just torture and.
Snowden, murder literally horrible things yeah yeah i've seen it in years.
Interviewer, um and the people that i've blocked on my twitter account are the ones who are posting about like.
Snowden, bitcoin scams that are like you know send me five bitcoins um i'm not saying this is the example to.
Interviewer, emulate uh what it is though is we have to recognize.
Snowden, that some people aren't worth engaging some people aren't worth listening to um it's a lesson right but that doesn't.
Interviewer, mean necessarily that you take their voice entirely yes i i i most certainly agree with that.
Snowden, in in terms particularly in terms of de-platforming my question to you about this is and i've raised this.
Interviewer, question many people and i really haven't got a satisfactory answer do you.
Snowden, think that things that get so huge like twitter uh or facebook or even youtube.
Interviewer, do they become a basic right is it like the utilities is it like electricity and water is like.
Snowden, the ability to communicate online seems to me a core aspect of what it means to be a human.
Interviewer, being with a voice in 2020. and i don't think it's as simple as removing someone.
Snowden, from twitter is simply a company uh exercising their right to have whatever they want on their platform.
Interviewer, i think when it gets as big as twitter is i think we've passed into a new realm and i think we.
Snowden, need to acknowledge that whether it's twitter or youtube or facebook or what have you.
Interviewer, i mean and i think it should be very difficult to remove someone from those platforms.
Snowden, and i think it should probably involve some sort of a trial i mean this is much.
Interviewer, uh this is a really really tough issue it's much larger than just d platforming because what we're really.
Snowden, talking about is the internet is a public utility right the internet is water and power um.
Interviewer, and its ability to shape culture right right um when you talk about something like.
Snowden, you know twitter and the size when the president is basically directing uh policy.
Interviewer, from twitter uh it's clear sometimes threatening countries that is our laws were not.
Snowden, designed with that in mind and unfortunately we have a legislature that's just fundamentally broken.
Interviewer, uh this gets back to the the electoral system which you talked about earlier you know most countries in the world.
Snowden, have a wide swath of parties they're not this two-party binary system where it's just.
Interviewer, two groups largely new corporatist groups that are just handing power back and forth the president changes.
Snowden, but the actual lawmakers the actual structure behind the president the advisors.
Interviewer, are largely from the same cohorts we we don't have that legislative we don't have that.
Snowden, governmental structure that allows us to adapt in a way that truly represents i think the broadest.
Interviewer, spectrum of public opinion in a way uh that allows us to respond to changes in technology in a meaningful.
Snowden, way which is what's left us stranded today where these companies are are sort of.
Interviewer, deciding things for themselves it's because there is a vacuum uh of legislation.
Snowden, now there's a question do we want legislation people on different spectrums from authoritarian.
Interviewer, to libertarian here will go we want lots of legislation we want no legislation um but there is a push and there has.
Snowden, been a push in congress for years actually since the 90s uh with the communications decency act and the first.
Interviewer, crypto war uh where the government was treating um the ability to encrypt your.
Snowden, communications to to make them secret uh or private as you communicate with people online they were treating.
Interviewer, that as a weapon and saying you couldn't export this code without getting a.
Snowden, license from the government and all kinds of craziness but the communications decency act the.
Interviewer, idea that there would be obscenity regulations the some years ago you may remember a.
Snowden, scandal involving backpage which was like a variant of craigslist that had a lot of.
Interviewer, prostitution ads on it um government has been trying more and more.
Snowden, uh to say these kind of things can be done on the internet these kind of things can be said on the internet these.
Interviewer, kind of things can't be said on the internet and they have been doing this largely.
Snowden, under the guise i would argue of the commerce clause right the federal government where they get the.
Interviewer, constitutional authority to regulate what we say and do businesses wherever well they go well the internet is global.
Snowden, it's international therefore it's interstate commerce and so we're going to regulate this.
Interviewer, as if you're you know shipping bushels of corn from iowa to florida but it's it's a little bit different.
Snowden, than that and i think uh what we need to recognize is that the internet.
Interviewer, is a utility and people uh individuals uh and corporate entities you should be criminally liable.
Snowden, for the things that they do online that means if they have caused enough harm that you're willing to put them in.
Interviewer, prison they've stolen from someone they have destroyed some piece of infrastructure.
Snowden, they have caused harm to someone uh you know somebody died or they plotted a murder or whatever.
Interviewer, you take them through the courts you try them on this the jury considers what they did they consider why they did they.
Snowden, considered the evidence and then you you uh let the trial system the traditional system that we've had.
Interviewer, for thousands of years uh worked this kind of stuff out or at least hundreds of.
Snowden, years um but when you get the government and you get officials in.
Interviewer, congress you get officials you know whatever the local department of this country or that country you know.
Snowden, russia's got a telecommunications censorship bureau china's got one france germany the.
Interviewer, united states all of these guys i have different regulatory authorities whether it's the fcc in the united.
Snowden, states or ra's comrades or in russia and you cannot substitute their judgment for the judgment of a jury for the.
Interviewer, judgment of the people and the public broadly and i think it's dangerous that we're.
Snowden, trying to have the government pick winners and losers when whether you win or lose.
Interviewer, determines whether or not you can engage with the world whether you can have a public presence uh.
Snowden, on the internet because the internet is real life today yeah it is and.
Interviewer, could it be that the option would be to extend the first amendment rights to the.
Snowden, internet in general and to if you want to run a social media platform.
Interviewer, you know other than what we're talking about putting people in danger doxxing people threatening people's lives.
Snowden, doing things that can cause direct harm to people but the ability to express yourself in controversial ways.
Interviewer, should shouldn't we extend first amendment protections to social media platforms i i think.
Snowden, this is a a much more complicated question than it appears because you get into the.
Interviewer, whole thing of obligation of service there is uh like there was a cause celebrate on.
Snowden, the right actually that would seem like a similar issue.
Interviewer, i remember there was the cake shop somewhere where they didn't want to serve.
Snowden, like a same-sex marriage thing uh and again this gets back to civility um but some people are they have a very.
Interviewer, strong fundamental uh belief here that these people shouldn't be able to do this that or the.
Snowden, other and if you impose that uh on them that requirement on them they've got to serve.
Interviewer, you know whatever their uh business is to these people that they don't like or that they don't agree with there's a.
Snowden, compulsion of service there you start doing this with the internet and then there's a completely different.
Interviewer, com country you know let's say there's a website in belgium.
Snowden, that's now bound by american laws that's bound by this twitter can't ban this person even.
Interviewer, though uh they're against them it seems like isn't that a different argument though because.
Snowden, all these companies were talking about twitter facebook and youtube are all based in america.
Interviewer, now i agree imposing american first amendment rights on the country particularly if the u.s starts changing.
Snowden, laws but this is the interesting thing about internet companies is they can right.
Interviewer, would that be their loophole yeah would that be their loophole to get out of that just selling.
Snowden, right but i mean it's it's more fundamentally um we have to recognize either as a.
Interviewer, society we can compel people to standards of civility or we can't and we need to decide uh how.
Snowden, we handle that because that's what all of these tie around right um and i think we have.
Interviewer, forgotten uh in many ways just we're not teaching people the golden rule well enough because we are all.
Snowden, angry we are all in competition and the funny thing is.
Interviewer, uh the guy on the right who's poor and living in a trailer uh is not much different than you know.
Snowden, the hippie on the left who's scrounging out of dumpsters you know uh and and raising their black flag to go.
Interviewer, to a protest they act like they could not be more different but their economic.
Snowden, circumstances could not be more similar and the reality is it's you know the the government uh the.
Interviewer, the lawmakers and the business owners that are setting them at odds and we are all getting lost in our own ideological.
Snowden, differences uh and losing sight of the things that actually tie us together and that if we.
Interviewer, worked together maybe we could change in a more meaningful way and the more people you meet the more.
Snowden, people you talk to you more you realize how malleable people really are and about how.
Interviewer, so many of these ideological perspectives that they they so rabidly subscribe to they've adopted.
Snowden, because it allows them to be accepted by their community by whatever.
Interviewer, neighborhood they're in or whatever group of people they hang out with and they choose to.
Snowden, adopt these uh these ideas about how the world is and so many of those people just don't.
Interviewer, experience people that are are different from them i mean that that is the case with racism that's the case.
Snowden, with homophobia that's the case with many of the issues that people have with.
Interviewer, other folks is that they just don't know people from those other groups and they haven't experienced you know.
Snowden, they haven't walked a mile in their shoes as it were i i think civility should be encouraged as.
Interviewer, much as possible also though i'm a comedian and i i talk a lot of  and that's in in.
Snowden, the sense of humor like you can miss and it's been done against me many times.
Interviewer, where they've taken things i've said in jest and put them in quotes completely out of context and it looks.
Snowden, horrible because that's not what it that's not the way it was intended.
Interviewer, and it was intended in humor now if you do have laws that not just encourage civility.
Snowden, but uh mandate civility you're gonna have a real problem with humor because you're basically gonna cut cut.
Interviewer, the ankles out of comedy um not that i'm saying that all humor has to be mean and vicious it doesn't.
Snowden, but some of the best is well it's also about saying things that can't be said you know yes yes saying things that.
Interviewer, can't be said um i i think there's a there's a giant problem.
Snowden, with uh online censorship today i i i think it's one of the biggest problems of our era and i do think it is because.
Interviewer, there is a massive slippery slope um and i do uh agree with you about the cake people.
Snowden, you know that that was a a big issue was that cause celebrate the right of these people they should have.
Interviewer, the right a lot of people felt to not make a cake for someone who is doing.
Snowden, who is doing something they think is immoral right being uh involved in a gay relationship but.
Interviewer, there's also the problem of sensationalizing these things because the people that.
Snowden, did find those people that didn't want to make those cakes they went to a bunch of people that.
Interviewer, agreed to make the cake first they went and tried to find someone who didn't want to make that cake.
Snowden, and then they turned it into a big story now even though i i just think i mean i think you should.
Interviewer, make a cake for gay people because there's nothing wrong with being gay but i think the people that made that.
Snowden, decision to not make that i feel bad for them i feel bad that they're they're bigoted in that way and.
Interviewer, that it's such a foolish thing to care who someone is in love with whether it's the.
Snowden, same sex or an opposite sex but also i think it's weird that someone wants to go around and try to find.
Interviewer, someone who won't make a cake for them who wants to go from cake place to cake place to cake place.
Snowden, until i go aha i found a bigot like and then make a big deal out of it like you know you're you're searching for.
Interviewer, victimhood i mean there's an argument that that's uh.
Snowden, i mean that that's one way to look at it another way to look at it is that's activism.
Interviewer, uh they're searching for injustice right yeah i agree yeah this is the thing like.
Snowden, what is right and wrong this is this is what people forget uh is changing constantly when we're.
Interviewer, talking about public opinion because public opinion is changing constantly and this is why.
Snowden, doing right by people it's so sad that we've lost sight of this uh basic impulse to do unto others as.
Interviewer, you would have them do unto you uh yes because when you talk about the internet.
Snowden, when you talk about de-platforming when you talk about humor as you said you know people are going.
Interviewer, back and they're looking at your jokes they're putting them in quotes there's a different context you're being attacked.
Snowden, by it uh something you said uh looks bad there's there's things that.
Interviewer, uh you've said things that i've said things that the person listening right now have said.
Snowden, that they believed that they meant that they said ten years ago that they said one year ago that they said three.
Interviewer, weeks ago that they no longer believe that they've abandoned that they've been persuaded.
Snowden, otherwise they've changed their mind on and this was one of the central themes in.
Interviewer, in the book permanent record um is we are no longer allowed to forget our worst mistakes.
Snowden, right they're there they haunt us they're used against us they're weaponized.
Interviewer, uh and this society has become aware of this and activists on all sides have become aware of this.
Snowden, uh immediately they use this to try to attack people on the other side of any issue.
Interviewer, that they don't like to go after their credibility to go after their character and what we are losing in that.
Snowden, conflict and this is a rational strategy on the part of both sides in the moment because they realize there.
Interviewer, is a real political advantage to be gained you can get people cancelled uh very easily nowadays but the the.
Snowden, thing is when we make everyone we pin everyone to their worst moment.
Interviewer, when we do away with the concept of forgiveness we we do away with the potential for growth for change.
Snowden, for persuasion and this gets back to those those rat holes of.
Interviewer, extremism on on uh youtube on twitter on everywhere else where they start.
Snowden, self reinforcing uh and eventually reaching the bottom of the hole at the worst of the worst with everybody.
Interviewer, else who's been canceled too and part of that is because they can't climb out or they think they can't climb.
Snowden, out and there's a question how do we resolve that.
Interviewer, one of the nice things about the the pre-internet society was as bad as you were as ignorant.
Snowden, as uh a racist as exploitative as whatever you don't like right as that person that character was.
Interviewer, they could find something new they could read a book they could meet someone they could change their mind.
Snowden, and even if nobody in their town would ever forgive them rightly in some cases because they had done.
Interviewer, something truly terrible something truly unforgivable they could leave they could move to a.
Snowden, different town they could move to a different state and that history would not follow them they could.
Interviewer, reinvent themselves and they could become someone truly honestly better.
Snowden, instead of being married to their prior ignorance that is a very important thing because.
Interviewer, we all are in a constant state of growth if you're not you you're really making some.
Snowden, fundamental errors with your life we're all in this constant state of.
Interviewer, accepting and acquiring new information gaining new perspectives learning from our mistakes.
Snowden, and if unless you're dr manhattan unless you're some person who's not making any mistakes.
Interviewer, and you just have this all-knowing vision of the world you're a finished product.
Snowden, like please if you are share that with everybody else but most of us are not most of us are in.
Interviewer, this weird state of being a human being on earth where everyone is trying to figure it out in this incredibly.
Snowden, imperfect world incredibly imperfect society the the everything from.
Interviewer, the structure the economic structure to the societal stuff everything down to the very last things.
Snowden, everything's imperfect and the idea should be that we're all communicating to try to.
Interviewer, grow together and that we're learning together and it's one of the more interesting things.
Snowden, about interacting with people online is that you can get different perspectives and if you.
Interviewer, can let go of your ego and if you can let go of your preconceived notions you can learn.
Snowden, things about the way other people see and feel and think about the world that could change and enhance.
Interviewer, your own ideas and i think that that's it's important that we not just accept.
Snowden, the fact that people are growing and getting better and improving.
Interviewer, but that we encourage it we encourage it and we reward it and i i think that's one of the.
Snowden, interesting things that we're struggling with i mean you see this in the context of police violence.
Interviewer, you you see this uh in the context of mass surveillance you see this in the context of cancer.
Snowden, culture you see this everywhere one of the interesting things about this surveillance machine.
Interviewer, that has been built around us the the sort of architecture of oppression the turnkey tyranny.
Snowden, as i describe it um so much is known about every person regardless of how innocent or how guilty.
Interviewer, they are it's all in there you know the files are waiting to be accessed the the data.
Snowden, just needs to be collated it's it's just waiting to be requested and analyzed and used.
Interviewer, what this means like there there's this old idea of the panopticon right um which is you you create.
Snowden, a prison that is circular and in the middle of it there's this great tower right that rises way up and at the.
Interviewer, very top of the tower there's a mirrored glass room that the warden.
Snowden, sits in and no prisoner knows where the warden is looking because the warden can see out but they can't see in.
Interviewer, and so everyone believes that they are watched and so the idea is that no one will.
Snowden, misbehave because they're all afraid uh that they'll be retaliated against for breaking the rules or whatever.
Interviewer, but what we have seen as this surveillance machine has been built is we all realize uh.
Snowden, intuitively and intuitively innately inherently in ourselves even if we don't recognize it even we.
Interviewer, don't speak to it we witness it in the news every night there are records of wrongdoing.
Snowden, criminality in government the highest and lowest levels of our government uh corporations and uh.
Interviewer, you know prominent uh figures in society breaking the rules ordinary people jaywalking littering you.
Snowden, know uh polluting small-scale petty stuff all of that somewhere there is a record.
Interviewer, of but in almost all cases it's not punished.
Snowden, what has happened is we have broken the chain of accountability between knowledge of wrongdoing uh.
Interviewer, and consequence for wrongdoing and this happened without a vote it happened without our participation we.
Snowden, weren't asked uh whether this was okay but i think in some way that is beginning to change the moral character.
Interviewer, of people and what we need to do starting with the top rather than the bottom because china's trying to do the.
Snowden, reverse they're going all right well there's a simple solution to this let's just start screwing.
Interviewer, everybody who breaks the rules instantly and immediately you know you got a social credit score.
Snowden, you you protested so you're going off to a camp you know whatever.
Interviewer, um but imagine uh what it would mean if we saw people where now any official the minute they are.
Snowden, guilty of the slightest infraction that immediately is exposed in the press they go on trial they go on all this.
Interviewer, stuff they're ruined they're disgraced um but it turns out every other member of.
Snowden, congress is going to court in the same week because everybody is in violation of something somewhere.
Interviewer, we all have some measure of guilt large or small even if we're completely innocent.
Snowden, because you know our legal code is so complex there's no way you can make it through a week without.
Interviewer, breaking some kind of rule about you can't wear a green hat on tuesday but if this happened if there was.
Snowden, accountability for fractions of the rules any time an infraction of the rules was.
Interviewer, witnessed the laws would change instantly to enshrine the right to privacy.
Snowden, because the people in power wouldn't want to lose their position of power they would not want to lose this.
Interviewer, position and suddenly when they have skin in the game they would realize oh everybody.
Snowden, deserves this um and i i think there's just something interesting to that i haven't thought this out.
Interviewer, all the way fully so this could be you know i give give me some slack here but i think.
Snowden, this is really what has changed um we have built a panopticon but what sits at the top of it is a.
Interviewer, computer uh that computer witnesses everything we do in reality it's a.
Snowden, distribution of computers they're owned by many people an answer to many people.
Interviewer, but it does not yet judge us for us judge us for it and what is happening is the audience society the people have.
Snowden, realized that they can see through this computer they can see through the panopticon from a certain.
Interviewer, angle a certain degree in a certain direction any given time the cops that have been you know.
Snowden, monitoring all of us for years right they've got surveillance and drones and stuff that they couldn't.
Interviewer, imagine they imagined in generations prior but now every person on the street.
Snowden, has a smartphone with a camera too and the cops are being witnessed for the first time and now people are.
Interviewer, trying to impose upon them the same judgment that has classically been imposed upon.
Snowden, us and this i think is one of the uh dynamics that the changes that is leading to this increasing.
Interviewer, conflict in society is when you realize that the people that throughout you know uh.
Snowden, your generation's youth were told in hollywood and stories are our common shared national myths.
Interviewer, you know the government's the good guys the fbi's are going to get the gangsters and.
Snowden, terrorists and things like that they're the best of the best the fact that they are people too.
Interviewer, they're not only fallible but in some cases you know small-minded and vicious they are political they are partisan.
Snowden, the same way everyone else is people start questioning power and how it is used the.
Interviewer, basic legitimacy the way it impacts our lives what the limits of it should be but people yet have not realized.
Snowden, uh one of the responses to this should be a limitation on the amount of power the government.
Interviewer, has or rather not just government but institution institution is a concept right government or corporation.
Snowden, um the powers of institutions should be limited to interfere in our lives instead what they are trying to do both.
Interviewer, sides you know blue team red team whatever they're squabbling they're fighting over.
Snowden, who has their hands on the trigger who gets to aim the weapon.
Interviewer, rather than should the weapon exist are you talking about police violence when you're when you're saying these.
Snowden, things that's a part of it yes it's it's every direction but police.
Interviewer, violence is very much the public part of it we see right now yeah that seems to be one of the most.
Snowden, complex uh abuses of power because the the kind of power that you give.
Interviewer, someone when you allow them to be a police officer is literally the power to end life.
Snowden, it's not just the power to kick you off twitter it's the power to decide this this person who's just a regular.
Interviewer, person no different than you or i with all sorts of problems in their own life and.
Snowden, stresses and strains and a disproportionate amount of strain and stress for the actual job that they.
Interviewer, do it means a spectacularly stressful position to be in life but yet you give them.
Snowden, the ability to literally with a finger pull end someone's life i think that's being.
Interviewer, exposed in a way that we've because of these cell phone cameras and because of uh.
Snowden, social media it's being exposed in a way that we no one ever would have ever dreamed.
Interviewer, uh imaginable before and exposing how almost impossible it is to have that position as a human being.
Snowden, and i mean this the position of power like that over folks and just to have a.
Interviewer, regular person with a normal psychology and and not some incredibly brilliant zen.
Snowden, master who's in charge of uh you know overseeing drug crimes.
Interviewer, or pulling people over or or you know assault or whatever it is it's it it i don't know the solution to.
Snowden, that i you know there's all sorts of things at play.
Interviewer, ignorance foolishness racism anger but at the end of the day it's about a human being's.
Snowden, ability to have a massive amount of power by law over other human beings which is always.
Interviewer, going to be a problem it's just going to be a problem yeah i mean i.
Snowden, i think we've known about this you know there's aphorisms that go back a zillion years you know.
Interviewer, absolute power corrupts absolutely um you know you give a monkey a stick the first thing he's going to do is he's.
Snowden, going to look for something to hit with it but this is also one of the things you.
Interviewer, asked earlier about like how i can be hopeful how i can be idealistic when i.
Snowden, see the scale of the problems the challenges the rate against us when i understand not just that mass.
Interviewer, surveillance exists but i understand the mechanics of it i understand how systemic it is.
Snowden, i understand the resources behind it that want to prevent the change of it and instead want to entrench it and.
Interviewer, expand it to make it more powerful and have more influence over the direction of our.
Snowden, lives down to this basic stuff about you know we are told.
Interviewer, the cops are the best among us people sign up to be cops i genuinely believe because they want to serve and protect.
Snowden, more so than they just want to be the big tough cop guy and some people say you know that's.
Interviewer, naive some people say that's petty but i i think it's different i think the reason that i feel this way.
Snowden, the reason that i am okay with seeing how much we fail uh seeing how much incivility and.
Interviewer, violence and and just ignorance that we have in the world today is.
Snowden, is i have a lower expectation of the individual at the moment but a higher appreciation for their.
Interviewer, potential and the reality is we are all inherently flawed.
Snowden, i'm a terrible person uh and i i think in a lot of ways uh you are not as good.
Interviewer, as you want yourself to be but i know that i have become a better person with time.
Snowden, you have become a better person with time i think we all have and we all can or those of us who.
Interviewer, have not could if they chose to or if they had guidance or if they had love or.
Snowden, friendship or someone who cared and directed them and helped them become better.
Interviewer, uh yeah and that's i mean that is the story of human history because we were all the.
Snowden, monkey and then we found a stick uh we could use it to beat somebody or we could use it to build a bridge but if.
Interviewer, you look around at the world today there's a hell of a lot of bridges there are in the i think in terms of.
Snowden, police brutality there's very few reasonable solutions that seem to be actionable.
Interviewer, seem to be something that you could just put into play right away in terms of like how do.
Snowden, you how do you deal with these violent encounters that police officers often have with people.
Interviewer, how do you deal with the ptsd that i believe a vast majority of these police officers suffer from.
Snowden, completely stressed out every time they pull someone over it could be the end of their life they.
Interviewer, might not go home to their families they really don't know and i think there's also a bunch of them that.
Snowden, are emotionally and psychologically unqualified for the job to begin with and then here we are.
Interviewer, uh with these calls in america at least to defund the police which i think is even more ridiculous i.
Snowden, think if anything they need more funding and more training and a more stringent uh process of elimination of.
Interviewer, removing people that aren't qualified for that job because i believe very few people.
Snowden, actually are qualified i think there's great police officers out there i really do and i think.
Interviewer, most of them most of the interactions that people have with police officers aren't horrible but there's enough of.
Snowden, those horrible ones that are captured on video that we have this bias towards these.
Interviewer, negative results that we see over and over again and we don't take into account the full.
Snowden, data set we're not taking into account all the interactions that people have with police officers because those.
Interviewer, aren't documented what we're getting in front of our face day in day out are the terrible.
Snowden, interactions and um i don't see nor do i hear a real workable way of improving this um you you get.
Interviewer, people that are either calling to defund the police or you're calling for people to.
Snowden, support police officers that's all you hear i i from a few people like jocko willink.
Interviewer, you see uh really great suggestions that they should be treated the same way they.
Snowden, treat navy seals where you're spending literally 20 of your time training.
Interviewer, and you're going through psychological training you're going through uh actual real world uh.
Snowden, situations where you're you're going over what's the correct protocol and how to.
Interviewer, handle certain situations and i i think it's it's a giant problem in our society today and.
Snowden, i think that's an understatement that every time someone gets shot that shouldn't have gotten shot.
Interviewer, particularly if it's a person of color it becomes a a gigantic flash point uh for our.
Snowden, society well let me challenge you on that a little bit because i mean.
Interviewer, we can we can have civil disagreements in the way uh you know that's that's why we have.
Snowden, discussion i think there are things that we can do uh that don't require you know the idea.
Interviewer, of shutting down every police department i i think that's sort of.
Snowden, far beyond what people talk about when we they talk about defunding the police i think.
Interviewer, the most common sense uh measure that is being discussed and it's not being discussed as uh broadly in terms of like.
Snowden, the mainstream news it should be is ending police unions right now why do we talk about that.
Interviewer, um this gets back to the same thing that we talked about earlier with the court cases and the government you know they.
Snowden, get caught doing something wrong but there's no consequence.
Interviewer, right and people learn from that each generation learns from the cases prior right it's in training and people learn.
Snowden, rules things like that the reason a lot of police violence occurs.
Interviewer, um even if it's not all it's not again there's there's no magic wand we wave that saves the world.
Snowden, is the lack of accountability uh we know there are cops and even cops say this right uh there.
Interviewer, are cops out there who aren't good people uh there are cops out there who have used their authority.
Snowden, uh there are you know really tragic cases uh where a cop has done something.
Interviewer, straight up criminal and they have faced no meaningful consequences as a result maybe they lost.
Snowden, their job right but if it was anybody else they would have gone to prison.
Interviewer, and so there's a question of how do we remediate this in a way that.
Snowden, preserves the legitimate interest of you know police officers as a class but it also preserves the rights of the.
Interviewer, people who are being policed in by your own admission at least some cases.
Snowden, people who are abusing their authorities and again i'm not saying all cops are bad or anything like that.
Interviewer, but if we recognize there are abuses and this is a class that is invested as you said with the power over life and.
Snowden, death we have to be willing as a society and the people occupying this position have.
Interviewer, to be willing to assume a higher standard of accountability than ordinary people right.
Snowden, and if we can agree on that everything else follows from it i think we don't want to have.
Interviewer, a gun-toting immunized class walking among us and i think even you know police.
Snowden, officers among themselves at least would recognize this.
Interviewer, but it is rational for them to resist this from the interests of their class they're in a privileged position.
Snowden, why would they give that up the same way our spies are in a privileged position why would they give that up but as a.
Interviewer, society we exist to ask more and you raise valid points right there's cops out there.
Snowden, go up to a dark car in the middle of the night they're afraid they're not going to make it home to their family.
Interviewer, that's reasonable and legitimate right but being a police officer is a dangerous position that people have.
Snowden, signed up to we give our police officers every advantage that could be given to them today.
Interviewer, i can tell you from having lived all around the world uh there's no cops in the world uh that are.
Snowden, kitted out like cops in america are like the you know these these guys look like.
Interviewer, you know something from a sci-fi movie um and if there is a kind of well some of.
Snowden, them do some some of them are going to riot and look there's good cops out there.
Interviewer, um i had a lot of interactions with cops as a young man uh that were nothing but positive uh.
Snowden, it's not that police as an idea are the enemy it is the system that is rotten and i.
Interviewer, think even honest cops recognize that the system is funnily been mentally broken.
Snowden, the question is not or the question from their side should not be can we stop reform because if they are.
Interviewer, if that's their position i think they're doing the public a disservice and i think to themselves they know.
Snowden, they're doing a disservice it's how do we handle this appropriately how do we handle this.
Interviewer, in the right way and if there's cops out there who legitimately have served you know they've been out there for years.
Snowden, they've been exposing themselves to danger to keep people safe at night they've done a good job uh and they.
Interviewer, don't want to walk the beat anymore that should certainly be an option that's available to them and from.
Snowden, my perspective as not a cop uh but i think when you look at um the the state of law enforcement in the.
Interviewer, united states that very much is an option you know do they want to work on dispatch do they want to work on.
Snowden, investigation they want to be cross-trained in forensics there are ways.
Interviewer, uh that we can end issues or at least mitigate some of the issues that we see with.
Snowden, policing today uh without saying cops are the worst people in the world and without saying.
Interviewer, you know these guys should be above the law well i don't think anybody's saying they should be.
Snowden, above the law but but factually to you so your feelings are excuse me i said factually today.
Interviewer, like as a matter of fact whether we like to or not you gotta admit in most cases cops are.
Snowden, bulletproof well i don't know i don't think i agree with that i mean if you you look at what.
Interviewer, happened in the george floyd case obviously they were caught on camera so we're.
Snowden, we're fortunate we got to not fortunate but we got to see what happened.
Interviewer, and they reacted accordingly you're you're what you were saying before you started.
Snowden, this though was that we need to stop police unions right and that but do you think police unions aren't.
Interviewer, only around to protect people from the consequences of.
Snowden, uh terrible policing they're also to provide health insurance and and reasonable amounts this is a great.
Interviewer, argument for everybody to have health insurance oh for sure yeah no i agree.
Snowden, i think health insurance is a i think it's a fundamental right of being a human being in a.
Interviewer, in a civilized society i think it should be treated the same way we treat the fire department.
Snowden, i think it should be something that we we all agree we should pay into because it.
Interviewer, benefits all of us i mean i just think uh if if we are a community and that's what.
Snowden, uh really a country is supposed to be we're supposed to be a large community.
Interviewer, wouldn't we want to protect the most vulnerable members of that community that if you have a small knit family and.
Snowden, something happens to someone in the family everybody chips in to help that person.
Interviewer, you know the that's what i think health insurance should be i think it should be.
Snowden, an important part of a culture of a community of a group of human beings that decide.
Interviewer, they're all on the same team we have to take care of the most vulnerable people i mean i think that.
Snowden, across the board and i mean that's really the argument that i'm making for how we want our police to be.
Interviewer, when i say you know cops are bulletproof i don't mean in the literal sense there are a.
Snowden, lot of cops who have given their lives uh to stop very bad people and we should honor them we should provide for their.
Interviewer, families but the way that we do that is providing a better society that's more fair to.
Snowden, police by being more fair to everyone right as long as as long as we've got any.
Interviewer, occupation that has it it's really this simple as long as we have an occupation.
Snowden, that is invested with exceptional authority they must be investigated invested with.
Interviewer, a extraordinary standard of accountability it's that simple from my perspective.
Snowden, like it doesn't have to be a terrible thing it doesn't have to be aggressive attack but it's this basic principle.
Interviewer, today in the world of business in the world of government in the world of policing anywhere you.
Snowden, look right it's a common issue what we have is a disproportionate allocation of influence.
Interviewer, a disproportionate allocation of economic resources disproportionate economic or a.
Snowden, disproportionate allocation of authority without an equal allocation of responsibility.
Interviewer, well i i think we both agree on that and i think we also both agree that it's not a shock.
Snowden, that a disproportionate amount of criminal activity exists in a place where there's a.
Interviewer, disproportional amount of poverty sure and a disproportionate yeah i mean this is an and very few.
Snowden, economic opportunities i mean this is something people don't that is a real problem.
Interviewer, but you're exactly right i mean when you talk about yes uh where terrorist movements arise from.
Snowden, when you talk about where criminal groups uh really thrive it's where there is poverty.
Interviewer, uh poverty breeds desperation uh desperation breeds anger uh and resent and and sadly due to the.
Snowden, nature of our species uh that in many cases inevitably tends toward violence.
Interviewer, uh if we want to solve the uh uh which are criminality right uh because people forget terrorism is a.
Snowden, crime it's very grave crime but it's still a crime uh we have to go to the core.
Interviewer, causes yeah and you know we were talking about this previously on a different show.
Snowden, in regards to the way people reacted to the pandemic in terms of economic support to businesses and.
Interviewer, trillions of dollars that were allocated to all these various businesses to try to stimulate them and keep them active.
Snowden, and and alive and keep people working and my thought was like.
Interviewer, imagine if that same attention to detail had been to impoverished neighborhoods if they had decided.
Snowden, like listen there's obviously a disproportionate amount of crime and poverty.
Interviewer, in these neighborhoods we've got to figure out a way to lessen that burden and strengthen.
Snowden, those neighborhoods and in a real simplistic way of putting it the way i've always said.
Interviewer, if you want to make america great you want less losers right what's the best way to have less.
Snowden, losers have more people with an opportunity to succeed.
Interviewer, more people who grow up in an area where it's actually safe where there's economic.
Snowden, possibilities where you're you're you're given more access to education.
Interviewer, more access to health care more access to counseling more access to uh community centers.
Snowden, any kind of support that you could possibly give people that gives them more of an opportunity to get by in life.
Interviewer, and that this is something that we've conveniently ignored this this this need to strengthen.
Snowden, these core and significant areas of our culture but yet we do when something comes along.
Interviewer, like a pandemic that might close down business and already thriving economic businesses.
Snowden, i think we should have put i think a long time ago we should have put similar resources and attention into.
Interviewer, these impoverished neighborhoods that have been impoverished for decades.
Snowden, and a lot of it because of slavery and a lot of it because of redlining laws and jim crow laws and.
Interviewer, all the things that happen after slavery there's so many areas of our country that just don't get better and we don't.
Snowden, do anything about it and we just assume that these cr these crime-ridden areas will remain that way.
Interviewer, forever and they send cops there and then the you you see the videos of the.
Snowden, interactions the cops have with people and it just creates more and more anger and more and more frustration without.
Interviewer, any real uh so some sort of uh socially responsible.
Snowden, action by by the government and some some sort of a program where it's explained to people.
Interviewer, explain to the general public how this is going to benefit everyone that we will have less crime that we.
Snowden, will have more opportunity we will have more people that are that are educated and empowered.
Interviewer, entering into the workforce will have more competition they'll strengthen the country as a whole.
Snowden, it'll be better literally for every one of us and that this is something that they.
Interviewer, didn't pursue and they haven't pursued in this country forever.
Snowden, well i mean this is this gets back to that the question that i was asking earlier.
Interviewer, it's one that i ask myself you know when you look at all the problems of today and you know for for somebody who's.
Snowden, focused on privacy and surveillance issues it's easy to be reminded every day of.
Interviewer, how deep in the hall we are where did these things really you talked earlier about like a greased.
Snowden, hill where where did the incline increase where did things start to really go wrong.
Interviewer, because they've always been going wrong in in in some area again that's our burden uh we've got to.
Snowden, make things better because they're never going to be good enough uh where we start but in.
Interviewer, recent decades things have gone bad and i think it goes back to patriot act and you ask about economy you talk about.
Snowden, poverty you talk about opportunity how do we fix this everybody is rehabilitating him now as.
Interviewer, this you know nice little old guy painting his feet in the bathtub uh.
Snowden, but the patriot act george bush in the iraq war um and the policy of endless war that is.
Interviewer, continuing sadly today it's a bipartisan thing continued under obama.
Snowden, continued under trump um we have spent trillions of dollars trillions of dollars uh.
Interviewer, killing far away people who literally going by the statistics are more likely to be non-combatants than combatants i.
Snowden, think um collateral damage is a real thing and even if.
Interviewer, every one of those people was someone we didn't like uh was the level of effort was the level.
Snowden, of resources that we invested in it uh was the cost to our national soul worth whatever it is we can be said.
Interviewer, to have gained uh and i think the answer is that we have been.
Snowden, uh generationally diminished not by that president alone but by the policies that that administration.
Interviewer, uh popularized that had been embraced and continued uh by the administration since until we.
Snowden, learned that lesson um we you me everyone else will have an obligation.
Interviewer, uh to try and change things to return us to a better path i i agree with you and i also think.
Snowden, there's a real good argument that there's certain aspects of technology that have been implemented.
Interviewer, in in terms of like warfare and how we deal with terrorism that you could say short term perhaps.
Snowden, might have eliminated some targets but i would argue long term probably encouraged more people towards.
Interviewer, radical fundamentalism particularly drones when i tell people the.
Snowden, efficacy of drone attacks and how many people who are killed by drone attacks what.
Interviewer, i've gone into with people that really haven't focused on it the amount of people that are innocent that are killed.
Snowden, by drones and the the vast majority of that being the case.
Interviewer, that when you're dealing with a hundred drone deaths it might be like 84 of them are innocent like imagine.
Snowden, that being anything else imagine if the police did that if you know they prevented crime by.
Interviewer, killing 84 percent completely innocent people you would say that's insane like we have to stop that.
Snowden, immediately but because it's done with a robot that flies through the sky remotely from nevada by some guy with an.
Interviewer, xbox controller and he's launching missiles into some sort of a.
Snowden, a car convoy that we've accepted this and i think there's a real argument.
Interviewer, that that is it's being accepted because of the remote aspect of it because we don't we don't see it we.
Snowden, don't feel it it seems distant and even seems distant from the person that's holding.
Interviewer, the remote control they're saying that the people that are doing that that are responsible for operating these drones.
Snowden, are experiencing a new level of ptsd and a very severe form of it.
Interviewer, many of them they're they're haunted by the idea of what they've done and the fact that.
Snowden, even though their own hands have done it they weren't there to see it it's some sort of a bizarre disconnect.
Interviewer, and that they're murdering literally who knows what percentage but it's a very high percentage of innocent people.
Snowden, now this gets us back to uh what i was talking about in in calling for the pardon of these.
Interviewer, different whistleblowers um this is the core issue of daniel hale daniel hale is an american who i believe.
Snowden, is still on trial they have yet to be convicted but the government is going to.
Interviewer, bury this man if they get the chance for revealing abuses in the drone program and the failures of.
Snowden, the drone program uh and this also gets you know you talk about this question of efficacy and.
Interviewer, percentages we we talk about mass surveillance uh just last week this was covered.
Snowden, nowhere in media that i've seen so far in a prominent way i think the washington.
Interviewer, post uh wrote an article but it you know it was buried it wasn't like a front page.
Snowden, a1 sort of top of the fold splash on the fisa court a lot of people have heard about the fisa court.
Interviewer, because the relationship to the trump thing um i hope one of your guys who works in.
Snowden, production can pull out uh you know a headliner front page or the the the twitter thread.
Interviewer, from elizabeth coyteen i think it's at liza goyten who went through this it was published and declassified.
Snowden, version of the fisa uh reauthorization for last year where the court goes through every year.
Interviewer, and the fbi submits this request for basically a blanket surveillance warrant that they can use.
Snowden, on all these different people for all these different um sort of categories of behavior that they.
Interviewer, want to monitor and the fisa court reauthorizes this annually um.
Snowden, and in this uh annual review they look at is the system functioning is it.
Interviewer, effective were the rules broken uh and uh one of these experts i think she worked at the brenner.
Snowden, brennan center for justice um correct me and edit me out if i'm wrong here but.
Interviewer, um there were thousands of cases in the last year thousands of cases where the fbi looked.
Snowden, people up under uh the aegis of a fisa warrant right and this is like a mass warrant.
Interviewer, that's used for multiple people instead of one for everyone else and we know how bad.
Snowden, these fisa warrants can be and over the course of thousands of cases.
Interviewer, the court found that they had been unjustified in uh looking up these people's.
Snowden, background in all but seven cases i think it was seven cases out of thousands.
Interviewer, and this is uh where it's at we have created a procedural state a bureaucratic state.
Snowden, an uh automated system for policing and i mean that broadly don't just mean you know guys in.
Interviewer, in in in shiny shoes on the ground with a pistol on their waist uh i'm talking about is it platform.
Snowden, behavior and speech on twitter i'm talking about is it surveillance behavior both domestically.
Interviewer, against american citizens and abroad around the world we are trying to create a system.
Snowden, that observes everyone and judges everyone in a way that we already know is not fair it is not used properly it.
Interviewer, is not used appropriately it is not used effectively and i believe uh does more harm than.
Snowden, good and why are we trying to create a system that sees everything we do and judges us.
Interviewer, which is effectively trying to invent god uh when we know that it is a dark and.
Snowden, vengeful one we need to think about the kind of technologies that we are putting in.
Interviewer, place that rule us but we do not effectively control.
Snowden, well i think there has to be repercussions when you're talking about that where all.
Interviewer, case seven of them the court said oh yes the fbi broke the rules routinely they did it all the time.
Snowden, uh so we're gonna go ahead and reauthorize this for next year here's your rubber stamp come back in you know.
Interviewer, 12 months exactly but what i'm saying is i think we as a society need to demand repercussions for these.
Snowden, overreaches because it's it's it is a violation of law.
Interviewer, and if it's a violation of law with no consequences then it's not then they're we're not talking about law.
Snowden, anymore we're talking about nonsense we're talking about things you could just get away with it really is it's a.
Interviewer, king class it's someone could just get away with things what's the law it doesn't make any sense.
Snowden, or a law that's only enforced against the powerless but not against the powerful.
Interviewer, right particularly if you or me or jamie had done the same thing we would for sure be in jail for a violation of.
Snowden, privacy for invading someone's privacy for for doing something that is against the law.
Interviewer, if we were tried we would be convicted we would wind up doing time or pay some extraordinary fine we would.
Snowden, be in real trouble is my point but they're not in any trouble at all that you cannot have that.
Interviewer, we can't have that in a society because if you have that ability to completely bypass.
Snowden, and any liability and any responsibility for a violation of law then we've created two classes of human beings.
Interviewer, we've created uh human beings that are the governed and then we've created human beings that.
Snowden, are the governors and the governors are exempt and that's not that's not government.
Interviewer, anymore now you're into some you're in a monarchy you're in some craziness yeah you're yes.
Snowden, you're rulers and the ruled and you can't have that we can't have that because.
Interviewer, of what you said earlier absolute power corrupts absolutely that is absolute power.
Snowden, there's no repercussions whatsoever for violating laws that can greatly impact people's lives in a negative way.
Interviewer, that's crazy you can't have that we can't have that and we need to agree.
Snowden, as human beings particularly now because of the age that we live in and the access to information that we enjoy.
Interviewer, we're aware of this acutely it's obvious it's it's right in front of our faces and it's one of the many reasons why i.
Snowden, think you should be exonerated well i think you should be pardoned i mean you you've exposed this and you've.
Interviewer, opened people's eyes to this the the exponential increase in people's understanding and appreciation.
Snowden, for that based on your work and what the guardian put out and and and.
Interviewer, how you exposed all that it's changed the conversation it's changing and it needs to be changed.
Snowden, and the repercussions needs to be changed as well well thank you you know i i guess.
Interviewer, there's not much more uh to say than that but i hope uh one day i will be able to come back um.
Snowden, if i want to see you in real life man i'll come on the show and be in the same room for once yeah.
Interviewer, well hopefully covert will be gone then well i'll test you first we'll test each other first yeah yeah um.
Snowden, but listen i said it before i really do believe this i think i think you're a hero and i think that what you've done.
Interviewer, history will be kind to you you know um they will look back on what what has been done to you.
Snowden, and i i think our government is on the wrong side of history i really do believe that.
Interviewer, and uh i i think if people really did know know the facts and particularly the way.
Snowden, you uh explained it earlier about how the information was distributed.
Interviewer, and and the way it was handled ethically and morally you did the best you possibly could have.
Snowden, done with that situation and i think it's a it's an incredibly bold move that you've.
Interviewer, done and and i i feel like uh the time has come i really do and i i hope i hope.
Snowden, i hope trump listens to this i really do i hope he listens to this and i hope he he understands also what a a political.
Interviewer, piece it would be i mean this is a a massive if he pardoned you i think you would be.
Snowden, a a a massively positive move for his own the way the you know the united states citizens.
Interviewer, view him well i hope what we see uh under this administration or any other but certainly we don't have to wait much.
Snowden, longer for is ending the war on whistleblowers because as much as i would like to come home as much as i would like to see recognition.
Interviewer, uh from the system uh that there are times when the only thing you can do is tell the truth and that should not be a crime.
Snowden, it's not about me it's about what happens to all of us it's what happens to the system and it's how we restore.
Interviewer, or rather realize the ideal of a country that we were always told we had uh but in reality we have never been as.
Snowden, good as what we dreamed but we're getting closer and the way we do that is by admitting where we werewrong.
Interviewer, and doing better thanks so much for having me on again i i really appreciate thanks for being on.
Snowden, man those words and that mentality are what make you a hero and your actions so i appreciate you very much man.
Interviewer, thanks so much stay free brother you too my friend take care.
Snowden,"Intelligence agencies do have a role to play, and the people at the working level at the NSA, CIA, or any other member of the IC are not out to get you. They're good people trying to do the right thing, and I can tell you from personal experience that they were worried about the same things I was."
Interviewer,Recently several threats have been made on your life by the intelligence community. Are you afraid for your life? Thoughts?
Snowden,"It's concerning, to me, but primarily for reasons you might not expect. That current, serving officials of our government are so comfortable in their authorities that they're willing to tell reporters on the record that they think the due process protections of the 5th Amendment of our Constitution are outdated concepts. These are the same officials telling us to trust that they'll honor the 4th and 1st Amendments. This should bother all of us. The fact that it's also a direct threat to my life is something I am aware of, but I'm not going to be intimidated. Doing the right thing means having no regrets."
Interviewer,what's the worst and most realistic harm from bulk collection of data? Why do you think it outweighs national security?
Snowden,"The worst and happening-right-now harm of bulk collection, which again, is a euphemism for mass surveillance, is two-fold. The first is the chilling effect, which is well-understood. Study after study has show that human behavior changes when we know we're being watched. Under observation, we act less free, which means we effectively *are* less free. The second, less understood but far more sinister effect of these classified programs, is that they effectively create ""permanent records"" of our daily activities, even in the absence of any wrongdoing on our part. This enables a capability called ""retroactive investigation,"" where once you come to the government's attention, they've got a very complete record of your daily activity going back, under current law, often as far as five years. You might not remember where you went to dinner on June 12th 2009, but the government does. The power these records represent can't be overstated. In fact, researchers have referred to this sort of data gathering as resulting in ""databases of ruin,"" where harmful and embarrassing details exist about even the most innocent individuals. The fact that these records are gathered without the government having any reasonable suspicion or probable cause justifying the seizure of data is so divorced from the domain of reason as to be incapable of ever being made lawful at all, and this view was endorsed as recently as today by the federal government's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight board. Fundamentally, a society in which the pervasive monitoring of the sum of civil activity becomes routine is turning from the traditions of liberty toward what is an inherently illiberal infrastructure of preemptive investigation, a sort of quantified state where the least of actions are measured for propriety. I don't seek to pass judgment in favor or against such a state in the short time I have here, only to declare that it is not the one we inherited, and should we as a society embrace it, it should be the result of public decision rather than closed conference."
Interviewer,How should the community of states react to the new information concerning surveillance? What actions have to be made?
Snowden,"We need to work together to agree on a reasonable international norm for the limitations on spying. Nobody should be hacking critical-to-life infrastructure like hospitals and power stations, and it's fair to say that can be recognized in international law. Additionally, we need to recognize that national laws are not going to solve the problem of indiscriminate surveillance. A prohibition in Burundi isn't going to stop the spies in Greenland. We need a global forum, and global funding, committed to the development of security standards that enforce our right to privacy not through law, but through science and technology. The easiest way to ensure a country's communications are secure is to secure them world-wide, and that means better standards, better crypto, and better research."
Interviewer,"The Ecuadorean Consul in London, Fidel Narvaez, lost his job after his helping you to safety was spun. Message for his family?"
Snowden,"Fidel is an incredibly brave individual, and he did everything that was possible to ensure that the rights of someone he had never met would be protected. He could have turned away from a tough decision, but instead of letting my situation become someone else's problem, he did what he thought was right. That kind of commitment to doing the right thing, even knowing it could get you in trouble, is something the world needs more of."
Interviewer,Under what conditions would you agree to return to the U.S.?
Snowden,"Returning to the US, I think, is the best resolution for the government, the public, and myself, but it's unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws, which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myselfThe hundred-year old law under which I've been charged, which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest, and forbids a public interest defense. This is especially frustrating, because it means there's no chance to have a fair trial, and no way I can come home and make my case to Maybe when Congress comes together to end the programs the PCLOB just announced was illegal, they'll reform the Whistleblower Protection Act, and we'll see a mechanism for all Americans, no matter who they work for, to get a fair trial."
Interviewer,Do you think that the Watchdog Report by Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board will have any impact at all?
Snowden,"I don't see how Congress could ignore it, as it makes it clear there is no reason at all to maintain the 215 program. Let me quote from the official report""Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government's efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.""."
Interviewer,what in your opinion is the appropriate extent of US national security apparatus? Surely some spying is needed?
Snowden,"Not all spying is bad. The biggest problem we face right now is the new technique of indiscriminate mass surveillance, where governments are seizing billions and billions and billions of innocents' communication every single day. This is done not because it's necessary, after all, these programs are unprecedented in US history, and were begun in response to a threat that kills fewer Americans every year than bathtub falls and police officers, but because new technologies make it easy and cheap. I think a person should be able to dial a number, make a purchase, send an SMS, write an email, or visit a website without having to think about what it's going to look like on their permanent record. Particularly when we now have courts, reports from the federal government, and even statements from Congress making it clear these programs haven't made us any more safe, we need to push back. This is a global problem, and America needs to take the lead in fixing it. If our government decides our Constitution's 4th Amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures no longer applies simply because that's a more efficient means of snooping, we're setting a precedent that immunizes the government of every two-bit dictator to perform the same kind of indiscriminate, dragnet surveillance of entire populations that the NSA is doing. It's not good for our country, it's not good for the world, and I wasn't going to stand by and watch it happen, no matter how much it cost me. The NSA and the rest of the US Intelligence Community is exceptionally well positioned to meet our intelligence requirements through targeted surveillance, the same way we've always done it, without resorting to the mass surveillance of entire populations. When we're sophisticated enough to be able to break into any device in the world we want to (up to and including Angela Merkel's phone, if reports are to be believed), there's no excuse to be wasting our time collecting the call records of grandmothers in Missouri."
Interviewer,Was the privacy of your co-workers considered while you were stealing their log-in and password information?
Snowden,"With all due respect to Mark Hosenball, the Reuters report that put this out there was simply wrong. I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers."
Interviewer,do you think it's a shame that #Obama gave his #NSA speech before his Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board reported?
Snowden,"The timing of his speech seems particularly interesting, given that it was accompanied by so many claims that ""these programs have not been abused."" Even if we accept the NSA's incredibly narrow definition of abuse, which is ""someone actually broke the rules so badly we had to investigate them for it,"" we've seen more instances of identified, intentional abuse than we have seen instances where this unconstitutional mass phone surveillance stopped any kind of terrorist plot at all, even something less than an attack. To back that up with the government's own numbers, according to the NSA Inspector General, we've seen at least 12 specific, intentional cases of ""abuse"" by the NSA. In contrast, the federal government's independent PCLOB report on the NSA's mass phone surveillance today (which stated the NSA has spied on at least 120,000,000 American phones under this program) said this"
Interviewer,What do you think about Obama's whistleblowing protection act?
Snowden,"One of the things that has not been widely reported by journalists is that whistleblower protection laws in the US do not protect contractors in the national security arena. There are so many holes in the laws, the protections they afford are so weak, and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing. If I had revealed what I knew about these unconstitutional but classified programs to Congress, they could have charged me with a felony. One only need to look at the case of Thomas Drake to see how the government doesn't have a good history of handling legitimate reports of wrongdoing within the system. Despite this, and despite the fact that I could not legally go to the official channels that direct NSA employees have available to them, I still made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co-workers, supervisors, and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen. The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled, but no one was willing to risk their jobs, families, and possibly even freedom to go to through what Drake did. My case clearly demonstrates the need for comprehensive whistleblower protection act reform. If we had had a real process in place, and reports of wrongdoing could be taken to real, independent arbiters rather than captured officials, I might not have had to sacrifice so much to do what at this point even the President seems to agree needed to be done."
Interviewer,"How quickly can the NSA, et. al. decrypt AES messages with strong keys Does encrypting our emails even work?"
Snowden,"As I've said before, properly implemented strong encryption works. What you have to worry about are the endpoints. If someone can steal you keys (or the pre-encryption plaintext), no amount of cryptography will protect you. However, that doesn't mean end-to-end crypto is a lost cause. By combining robust endpoint security with transport security, people can have much greater confidence in their day to day communications."
Interviewer,Do you think it is possible for our democracy to recover from the damage NSA spying has done to our liberties?
Snowden,"Yes. What makes our country strong is our system of values, not a snapshot of the structure of our agencies or the framework of our laws. We can correct the laws, restrain the overreach of agencies, and hold the senior officials responsible for abusive programs to account."
Interviewer,Can you explain why there's a need for multiple leadership models?
Snowden,"I think because you have multiple situations. So under conditions of certainty where you can apply constraint, you can control by constraints. You can have a very directive style of leadership. On the other hand, if the situation becomes highly uncertain, then there isn't a previous plan that you can rely on, you need people to actually have the right sort of experience, to make some intuitive decisions but also to carry people with them in following that decision. Now those are very different styles in my HBR article, we identified four different general styles of leadership and you could look at subsets of those."
Interviewer,So different situations which call for different models to use in there?
Snowden,"Yes and I think this is not the one size fits all and you see this in the management literature. So you get a leader who has been in the right place at the right time and succeeded. They then assume they have a general model that will work for many other contexts. For example, you get the mayor of New York first time it ever happens to do the right thing in the crisis, he then writes a book about leadership but he can't even get on the Republican short list. So the trouble is we abstract from the single context into a general model and that's not going to work, right? If you look at historical models of leadership, and this actually links to brain facility, there's a difference between leading the tribe and holding the wisdom of the tribe let alone asking naive questions to the leaders of the tribe. So even within a collective construct; there are different models of leadership."
Interviewer,"For those not familiar with the Cynefin, can you briefly explain it?"
Snowden,"Cynefin works off three ontologies so it talks about ordered systems with a high level of constraint where you've got predictability and it divides those into two obvious where everybody knows what the constraints are, everybody buys into then and complicated where experts understand the situation (and you have to trust them) or analysis is necessary to understand what to do."
Interviewer,Can you explain what makes the chaos state temporary?
Snowden,"Well, because it's very difficult for anything to be unconstrained. If you get a crisis, somebody will impose order pretty damn fast. If you look in randomness in chemistry, you get some order within nanoseconds, some sort of structure will emerge. So if I hold something in that state it takes a lot of energy. Like nuclear fusion, the energy to maintain the magnets to hold the plasma is more than the energy you get out of it. So we use chaos for example for distributed decision support and for innovation but it's a very structured process because to create randomness, it takes a lot of energy."
Interviewer,That's why it will self organize?
Snowden,"I mean you can fall into it by accident and then it's catastrophic but sooner or later, somebody will impose constraints pretty damn fast."
Interviewer,Can you give some examples of how the Cynefin framework can be used to keep the user requirements?
Snowden,"Well, that's what we're working on at the moment so what are we doing? We have user requirements against known needs (for example going back a few years we were writing a computer program to actually automate a double entry bookkeeping). In Cynefin terms, that's obvious."
Interviewer,What are the benefits of using this Cynefin approach for capturing the requirements?
Snowden,"You radically reduce the costs in terms of wastage. If you go to any agile conferences, people talk about high levels of failure, now there are two responses to that. One is to accept it, the other is to say, well, maybe it's because we haven't allowed enough ambiguity early on."
Interviewer,It's both for reducing waste in your process but also speeding up the process?
Snowden,"Yes and I think it's more a lean approach to waste as well. So by moving programmers closer to user stories, that's kind of like the lean principle in operation."
Interviewer,Can you elaborate about the key steps that are needed to scale Agile methods to cross an organization?
Snowden,"Well step number one is do not go anywhere near a pyramid planning scheme like SAFe. It's a backwards step. I think the issue on the scaling in the complex system is you scale by decomposition and recombination not by aggregation. So one of the things we're doing for example is take strategic needs, operational needs and technology capabilities, capturing those in real-time, emerge them together in fitness landscapes to see where they start to cluster together and so that scaled by decomposition reactive recomposition."
Interviewer,trains run on tracks and the last thing you want is tracks in a complex system.
Snowden,I'm talking about top-down enablement of bottom-up actions. So the role of top is to create constraints and relax constraint as needed and then dynamically allocate resources where in patterns of success emerge; you don't do that through micromanagement.
Interviewer,Is it like setting the conditions top down and then filling it in bottom up?
Snowden,"Yes but you also need real-time feedback loops. so we are working at the moment to allow executives to ask questions to the whole work force in five minutes and represent the results as a fitness landscape. So you're talking about much more into connectivity and much more necessary ambiguity. Lots of leadership models say that you should remove ambiguity and be very clear, we're saying that if you're in complex, you should actually increase the ambiguity because decreasing the ambiguity is a bad idea, it means you miss things you need to see."
Interviewer,Is this the same kind of thinking that you see in antifragility?
Snowden,"Yes. I have mixed feelings about Taleb all right? He's one of the best of the popular authors, 'Surprise by chance', is a brilliant book, Black Swan less so. Antifragility for me is a sub section of resilience. I think the trouble is he wants to make antifragility unique instead of making a hugely valuable contribution to the field as a whole. Resilience is surviving with continuity of identity at the time. Systems which become stronger when they fail are sub-function of that and not the totality."
Interviewer,What are your thoughts on sustainable change? How can leaders make it happen?
Snowden,They need to know when to apply directive leadership and when they need to change the constraints. There's times where you take control and we have whole models on this
Interviewer,"I recognize the styles of leadership. I'm working with teams all around the world, which are translating my books and I usually start off with giving them as much freedom as they want and usually at some point in time, they say, ""Okay, but we need a little bit more direction, we need a little bit more telling us what to do and then we find a way for that until we get to a point and they say, ""Okay, well we can do this ourselves, so can you back off.""."
Snowden,"In traditional models the apprentices will become a journeymen at which point they teach. Then some of the journeyman will become masters. Experience and peer interaction is key. You can't reduce it to simplistic training courses, competence models and airport books.. That approach is dangerous, and we are seeing it in Design Thinking, management development and many fields, as it is trying to codify an artisan process which cannot be codified. They are trying to reduce something which takes two or three years to understand into a two week training course. That's criminal."
