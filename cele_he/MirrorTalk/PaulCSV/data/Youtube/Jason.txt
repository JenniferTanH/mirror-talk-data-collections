Paul is literally one of the most

helpful individuals to founders in the

last decade he has helped over 600

startups launch through Y Combinator and

he's been a tireless supporter of

entrepreneurs he had a really great

heartfelt honest discussion for almost

an hour at the launch festival and he

put it out there he was super honest

about stuff very blunt but also very

joyful I mean the guy is a real Mensch

he's a tremendous entrepreneur and a

tremendous you know supportive of

entrepreneurs a great writer to which I

really respect if you can really

crystallize your thoughts as a writer I

think that's something special in the

world so I have a great deal of respect

all right I'm really thrilled to have

our next fireside chat here he's a

legend and perhaps nobody has supported

more entrepreneurs certainly nobody

supported more entrepreneurs in the last

nine years than this individual please

welcome the co-founder of Y Combinator

program

my brother join me okay so let's get

right to it there's been some changes at

Y Combinator yeah that you timed

perfectly before this speaking gig thank

God to make sure we have to get that

announcement done by the by before the

launch conference thank you kidding

exactly what exactly is the announcement

and and how does it change why comment

oh my god

and your role yeah here's a picture you

can throw up you know who you know who

that is that Sam Altman Alexis Steve

Huffman and Justin and Emmett from

twitch Wow and everybody in that picture

now works for Y Combinator in some way

except Steve Huffman that's amazing

what yours that that's the first batch

that is the first summer that is

probably a demo of Reddit judging by

where the way people are standing that

is probably a demo of an early version

of Reddit and I see you kept the same

shirt and you know it might it might

well be actually is that nine years ago

that's that's the summer of 2005 yeah in

Boston yeah in Cambridge and Sam almond

all they on the left with the blue shirt

who did you pooped yeah which was the

first really mobile location-aware

product yeah kinda sad people didn't

want to broadcast their locations people

want to consume location but they don't

want to supply it interesting and now

you've made him the president of Y

Combinator yeah he is gonna be the boss

I'm not running the show anymore it's

Sam's show now and why is that we just

tired after nine years and 600 startups

yeah he do have I think you said in your

piece that you thought he would do a

better job why well what you're thinking

Y Combinator is gonna have to grow right

we grow as the number of startups grows

when the number of startups has been

growing um

and Y Combinator it's like this it

started out you saw what it was like it

was just that what that was in my

kitchen that picture and now we've got

like ten full time partners maybe 20

people total and I mean no exactly six

hundred and thirty two startups we

funded it's turned into this

and I'm no good at running giant things

Sam however is gonna be good at running

a giant thing and are you going to be

involved every day or a couple of days

or to be determine because that was

something that I think a lot of people

weren't clear about you said you're

gonna do office hours I'm gonna do

office hours with the startups but I

don't do office hours every day right so

probably I'll end up doing office hours

a couple days a week that will probably

be enough to talk to everybody in each

batch and other than that I'm not doing

anything I'm not reading applications

I'm not doing interviews I'm not

worrying about all the hideous internal

crap that takes up the time of most

organizations it yeah the founders in

each batch they see me at office hours

and as far as they're concerned that's

what I do that's about a tenth of what I

do I spend all the rest of my time

dealing with random crap associated with

any anything of any size so now I won't

so it'll look the same to the founders

right but it will feel very different to

me yeah so when you started it and you

were in your apartment I mean what was

the origin I mean why did you start Y

Combinator for those folks who don't

know the origin story in the well I

wrote something about this so if you go

to Google and search for how YC started

yeah I actually wrote down the story of

how it started but really I mean what I

say in that is the reason it started was

a combination of me feeling guilty but I

hadn't gotten around to doing any angel

investing yet and also that Jessica was

talking to this VC fund about becoming

their VP of Marketing and the VCS were

taking so long to make up their minds I

said fuck'em we'll just start our own

thing right so if that VC fund in Boston

had not been so typically slow-moving Y

Combinator would never have existed and

how did you get those first six

companies or whatever it was in the

first eight eight companies

how did you convince them to come on

this journey with was a pretty easy

thing right because when Y Combinator

first started this is something a lot of

you

don't realize when y combinator first

started it was a summer program for

undergraduates that was that was the

idea and so compared to a summer job

where you'd have to like go work in a

cubicle and like maybe get up earlier

than you would like to you and work on

not what you would want with people you

don't want to worked with right compared

to a regular summer job it was a great

deal you just go to Cambridge work on

whatever you want with whoever you want

and we like you know pay you money and

give you give you dinner once a week um

so we got lots of applications you got

more than we expected hundreds of

applications but in that first batch

were Sam Walton who started looped

reddit was in that first batch Kiko

which was started by the founders he

went on to start justin.tv a a k-8 which

all in that first batch Aaron Swartz was

in that first batch to you yeah what was

Aaron's project what was it called

infogami it was called infogami and it

was kind of tumblr I remember yeah and

it merged with reddit what was that you

were one company what was what was Aaron

like um precocious he had sort of made

at that point I think he was 18 and he

had sort of made a career of being

precautious up till that point right he

sort of had decided he had realized like

most kids don't realize this but he had

realized like when he was probably about

13 or so he was sort of very

obstreperous he never wanted to do what

he was supposed to um and he would

realized that like he could just sort of

start acting like an adult and maybe no

one would stop him he yeah and so he

like didn't go to high school and he

made money by writing code he just

started acting like a grown-up right

yeah like and he'd realized that

essentially kids don't realize this but

they're all kept in place by a bunch of

dotted lines that aren't real

and they could just like start acting

like a grown-up and no one is gonna come

away with submachine guns and black ski

masks and drag them away right um so he

was one of the few people who realized

he could cross the dotted line and when

you look at his untimely death and sort

of what happened with him

how do you reconcile it I mean what how

do you feel about it that's a personal

question but Aaron Aaron and the federal

government were not very evenly matched

right like those guys are a bunch of

humorless an Aaron was

sort of an innocent

um I don't know innocent it's not quite

the right word to use for him because he

was a pretty scheming innocent but

anyone who's had small children could

understand that scheming and innocent

can be combined yeah and that's what he

was like in some ways he was it's weird

in some ways he did approaches in some

ways he was like right right in some

ways he was like an adult when he was 13

and in some ways he was still a child

when he was 25 right um but I think I

think like the federal government just

like the federal government they assume

that everyone is al Qaeda right you know

and so they just like hit you with

everything they got which turns out to

be a lot and then he discovered he had

sort of bitten off more than he could

chew

yes Scott Walker is a great attorney who

is also a tireless supporter of startups

I've known Scott for a long time he's

partnered with me to bring you this

program for years now and he runs a

boutique law firm that specializes only

in startups all of his attorneys come

from those bigger firms but they prefer

to be at a boutique firm when they don't

have to ratchet up the hours and try to

destroy startle through these crazy

legal bills no he does something

different he gives flat fees for all the

different things you have to do it your

startup whether its incorporation

employment agreements or you're selling

your company he's a true man he truly

focuses on the founders and he makes

himself available in the same way I try

to make myself available or Paul Graham

makes himself available to founders he's

a really great guy go ahead and give him

a call for one five nine seven nine nine

nine nine eight that's right call Scott

ed Walker at four one five nine seven

nine nine nine nine eight or visit

Walker corporate law comm and he's very

easy to get in touch with Scott at

Walker corporate law and you just put

Jason in the subject line and I

guarantee you he will respond quick

and he will be an incredible advocate of

your startup I've gotten so many great

great responses back from people I've

referred to Scott over the years so he's

just a tremendous tremendous supporter

of startups go ahead and thank Scott ed

Walker on Twitter and follow him really

great guy really great team over there I

can't give them any bigger endorsement

they've been a great partner of the

program they do a great job for startups

everybody I sent over there is pleased

what more do you need to know let's get

back thanks Scott and let's get back to

this incredible fireside chat with Paul

Graham so you brought Y Combinator the

next sort of seminal moment I guess was

bringing Y Combinator to the valley

leaving Boston yeah how did you come to

that decision Addis / of the moment you

know what happened I went to foo camp I

went to foo camp after over the first Y

Combinator batch and I thought wow it's

so much better here uhm the start the

streets are paved with the corpses of

startups you know the weather so nice

what I thought was actually someone is

gonna start the Y Combinator of Silicon

Valley and it better be s so we thought

we had better go out here and plant the

flag and also like Boston in the winter

is not as nice as Silicon Valley it's

not like this in Boston so we decided

and Jessica was freaking right because

like we had just figured out how to make

this thing work and I said you know what

let's move across the country and do the

next batch in Silicon Valley right and

she's like what and the reason we ended

up in Mountain View was because our

friend Trevor had a building there and

the only way we could get a building on

such a short with like such short notice

is to take over part of his but even so

that first dinner we had to tell all the

founders not to touch the walls because

the paint was still wet the first dinner

and when people applied we said on the

application form we don't know where

it's gonna be you're applying for this

thing and you don't know whether it's

going to be in Cambridge or Silicon

Valley so let us know if either of those

problem for you prior to my Combinator

the only incubators that really existed

I know it's you don't consider an

incubator really but it was a class of

incubators in the first ball thank you

Bader's yeah they the model or were you

the this the anti model of no no no they

were definitely not the model they were

like the model of what not to do right

so the early version that most people

here probably never even knew what the

incubators and the bubble were like but

they were their idea was they would do

all your funding ever right Y Combinator

is just supposed to be first gear and

then you go off and raise money on at

the market at market rates from whoever

these things in the 90s the idea was it

would it was almost like you were a

subsidiary of the incubator they would

like you would operate out of their

building and they wouldn't have your you

wouldn't have to have an accountant

because their accountant would manage

your money right and they would like

give you a lot of money and take like 30

40 percent of the company yeah you know

80 90 percent or that yeah they were

gonna really control you and and that

model seemed to me and yes like work out

of their building right very much like

an employee um that model seemed to me

because I had the advantage of having

been a founder and so I could ask myself

would I have done that

no right it's like an adverse selection

filter right you do things like that how

do we not get the best ah yeah yeah I

was always in the beginning now the

funny thing is the word incubator has

changed nobody even remembers those

stupid things in the news now it means Y

Combinator so now on our FAC it says are

you an incubator and I'm like no no

we're not an incubator except now as

people who use the word we are yeah

meaning if the word has changed I'm the

only one who remembers the old stupid

yeah so we should probably give in and

agree to be called an incubator so how

did you define what the program was in

the early days was it strictly the

constraint of the summer session yes yes

the reason nobody even a lot of people

probably don't realize this a lot of

people who even start these things

probably don't realize this but the

reason it's three months is because that

was summer vacation right and it turned

out there were a lot of things we got

right three months turned out to be just

about right

and so we kept the three months and

having dinner once a week which was not

modeled on the Society of fellows at

Harvard it's a group of people who were

all grad students and sort of went off

and did their research and then once a

week but you get together for dinner

that turned out to be good to you

getting speakers to come having demo day

at the end that was something I think we

only decided to have demo day about

halfway through we're getting to the

enemy thought maybe we should put on

some sort of event where these guys

present to investors so we and demo day

is now a misnomer nobody does demo as a

demo day right um

the presentations are two and a half

minutes but you know the name was

already established by that point did

you all a bunch of accidents all a bunch

of accidents that turned out to be good

is there a moment at which you thought

this is going to scale to what it has

become today which is in just nine or

eight years is kind of like an

institution nine short years Jesus they

don't feel well I mean yeah that's why

you gave the president's lot of yeah I

think I'm supposing it's been very long

for you but nine years is not a long

time you know to build an institution uh

was there a point where I thought I

could get this big yes yes cuz I

remember Steven Levy I don't know if I

don't know if this was the first batch

of the third so I'm not sure but I think

about about halfway through the first

batch I'm a very optimistic person right

and so you show me an Altair basic I see

Microsoft right right um

so pretty early on during YC because I

was ridiculously optimistic I imagined

that it would become sort of what it in

fact I imagined probably would become

even bigger than it has become today but

that doesn't mean I was correct she's

wildly optimistic by Nature

it wasn't like in the five like planned

to make it riot it's more like I had

these crazy imagined futures that turned

out to be correct but they shouldn't

have been where did you come up with the

deal as it were you know six percent for

15 K or 21 K whatever it is it was based

on what a lot of what we did was based

on the

funding we got for our startup via web

so we had this guy who was the husband

of my painting teacher at Harvard and he

was a lawyer he gave us $10,000 and got

us incorporated and like set up as a

company and taught us a little bit about

business he didn't know much about

startup specifically but he sort of knew

about business like I knew nothing about

business um like nothing and he was on

our board and sort of saved us from

stepping in a bunch of dog poops along

the way a bunch of land mines actually

be more accurate um and so I remembered

thinking later

boy what a good deal for Julian he got

10% of this company for $10,000 and then

I realized wait a minute without him we

would never have made it so it was a

good deal for us too and when you like I

thought wow that's a good deal for both

so 10% seemed a bit much yeah so we

didn't ask for 10% I think originally

used to ask for 6% and then along along

the way it became 7 and the reason we

invested the amount of money we did is

cuz I asked Robert he was a professor at

MIT

how much MIT grad students got his

stipends for the summer and it was

$2,000 a month so that's what we did

$6,000 per founder for the summer

because we knew you could live on that

in Cambridge yeah so all of these things

that people think you put a people

wonder where these sort of devices come

from they come from that sort of summer

yeah of summer school basically yeah

like a summer job a summer program you

you've seen 600 of these startups now

some pattern recognition happens yeah

and about the smallest things it's weird

when you have 632 data points the

patterns you can see or astonishing yeah

so what are some of them that are some

of them my god yeah I think about

thousands of things yeah but what are

the ones that matter the ones that

matter

okay well founders have to get along

okay if the founders hate each other

you're in big trouble right how often

does that happen once or twice a very

often um

I mean like do you guys realize that

Apple had three founders not two right

yeah there's a lot of companies that

have more founders than you realize so

there's founder conflicts or like you

don't know how good you are how good

friends you are with somebody until you

try to start a start-up with them so

you've got to have a good relationship

between the founders that's why it's

that's why it works so badly when you

have a start-up that's started by some

dude in the business school who has this

idea for some startup and then he goes

and find some like 20 year old meek

undergraduate computer science major to

realize his vision right and that is the

founding team and you know and these

guys come in for the interviews and the

guy says Arthur you know I was

quarterback with my college team you

know this is my co-founder he's like and

you know we asked him a question and he

looks nervously at the business dude to

see if he's allowed to answer right are

you gonna whip me afterwards if I say

stuff right that's like that kind of

like if you go into a Y Combinator

interview and one of you looks in terror

at the other one before answering the

questions that's one of our secret tells

right or say if you roll your eyes at us

while your co-founder is speaking right

actually happened works if you stand up

your co-founder like if you don't show

up for the interview and you asked and

we ask the guy where's your co-founder

Eisel I don't know he was supposed to be

here right these are all happens

literally yes it all happened

yeah um what do you do in an instance

where you know you have two people who

are brilliant you know to use the Apple

you know metaphor I mean woz and Jobs

obviously brilliant in different ways

and they just can't get along one has to

win in order for the startup to survive

one has to bow out how do you even

broach that conversation you have to

have a mechanism for doing anything one

of them has to leave

well--we're because not necessarily

because in the best startups what

happens is each founder is king of their

own domain so in Apple like the wat was

was like he was not a super forceful

person but he did not let Steve Jobs

change anything about the Apple one

computer like there was one thing he

wanted to change I think like fewer

expansion slots and woz said no hey

that's nothing like Steve knew Steve

Jobs knew where the limits were so

Steve's like but wise didn't give a damn

about the business stuff so Steve Jobs

was off selling the thing and was built

it and they were each masters of their

own domain that's that that's the model

that works that's how you have multiple

people who are each extremely effective

and not step on one another's toes you

do as a rule multiple founders is that

true or do you you mean we prefer to

fund startups with more than one founder

correct

oh yes yes have you ever done single

founder startups we have the result in

them we have funded some single founder

startups the most successful well okay

so there's a bunch of weird cases like

drew Houston of Dropbox was a single

founder when he had filled out the

application form but we told him it

would be really good if you got a

co-founder and so between getting

invited to interviews and the interview

just like two weeks he got a rash right

um so that worked out really well and

then the most successful startup that is

run by a single founder now is pebble

smiley yeah it sure but though that was

two people when they came to YC and one

of them left ah right so but like single

founders who've been single founders all

the way through God I mean they always

get other people and I never know if

their co-founders are just employees

there's a lot of equity yeah you know so

I don't recommend it though got a

co-founder when people walk up to me and

say legs start blabbing to me about

their idea I'm like no no who's your

co-founder that's what I care about

Dropbox is the most successful on a

valuation level

of any why cause I have this week as of

this week ten billion dollars change

yeah so that's a super unicorn and

you've had a couple of others Airbnb I

guess would be considered a unicorn in

the new parlance I would say Airbnb is

value is comparable to drop boxes

valuation and value are not the same

thing right like if a company hasn't

raised money for a year or two and

they're growing like 5x a year right

they could two years of not raising

money at 5x a year their value is off by

25 X X right right um so you got to

watch out for going for treating

evaluation as value I would say Dropbox

and Airbnb or our peers than their

stripe and stripe is also yeah yeah did

you know in the case of those three that

they were very very very very special

what did you just think they were

special enough to accept they were all

there the they were all no brainers at

the interview they were all cases where

in the interview we didn't even have to

think about it right um we decide

whether to fund people or not

immediately after the interview we have

to because we do 20 interviews a day

like we won't even remember the first

people in the morning by the end of the

day well so we have to decide while our

memory is fresh and the good ones that

we talked to people for 10 minutes and

the good ones were like looking we have

you know after all these years we can

just look at each other and sort of send

signals by our eyes right this person is

in right right we're looking at each

other like these people are in or or

sometimes we're looking at each other

like oh my god

how long can ten minutes last right

right um but if there's if there's

borderline cases and then there's cases

where definitely yes and definitely no

halfway through the interview and

Dropbox

Airbnb and stripe we're all like we

didn't even need the full ten minutes I

remember that I mean I didn't predict

that they would end up being worth

billions of dollars you know why because

you cannot predict that that is

unpredictable it's not like there was

some data there that I didn't see it's

actually indeterminate you know and I

back when drew Houston applied drew

Houston zapped location for Y Combinator

is on

line and back when he applied we used to

still ask this stupid question that we

no longer ask which is if someone wanted

to buy you right after why see how much

would you take right

and if Drew's answer was a lot less than

10 billion dollars I don't remember what

it was it was probably like a million or

two or something like that maybe even

less it was this turned out to be a

stupid question that obviously predicted

nothing as you can see yeah so just as

well we took it out but a lot of these

companies that end up being worth

billion billions of dollars they only do

that because the M&A people that

potential acquirers are stupid enough to

not pick them off early right hey speed

we all need our applications to be fast

and reliable I'm busy I'm the CEO of the

company I want to know what's going on

with the servers because I know through

watching Marisa and Larry Page at Google

just absolutely crush it by having the

fastest services in the world and the

most stable services they build a lot of

trust with their audience well New Relic

is the tool that you need a CEO or CTO

to monitor the performance of your

applications and let me tell you a

little story we were launching a little

startup named inside.com a month ago and

we had a tremendous technical difficulty

something was going wrong on our servers

so I emailed like at 9 o'clock at night

hey listen we have a lot of users coming

in tens of thousands of people are

rushing the front door and our servers

are questioned we can't figure out why

the database servers going off the

charts my boys and girls over there boom

they just gave me all the all the

licenses they need we put it on all our

servers and all of a sudden it was very

clear we had some kind of problem with

our database and it turned out when

people were scrolling up through inside

com it was firing off the voting

mechanism which was then flooding

flooding our database and pinning the

server and making this service unusable

for everybody else and it was like God

came down from heaven and pointed his

finger at the problem that would have

taken us a week to figure out thanks to

New Relic it's literally as good as god

I mean how much more do I have to sell

these people

it's a powerful application performance

tool Nike Warby Parker Airbnb Comcast

and AT&T used it we use it here and I

get this beautiful email every week that

shows me how fast there

things going so I can have like a

top-level perspective on I have to get

in the weeds every day and we love it go

personally thank at New Relic go ahead

and thank them on your Twitter handle

for supporting independent media like

this week in startups okay let's get

back to the rest of this amazing

interview with mr. Paul Graham of Y

Combinator let's talk about this sort of

period of supreme growth what was the

largest class size you guys ever had in

when you hit that 80 the whole industry

was like whoa there was this a year

where I think we iced we have 68 in the

current batch right not that much

different it's not that much the demo

day is still gonna be pretty tiring but

there was this year where I think the

industry because of the massive success

Y Combinator was sort of like this

promising thing over here but then

something happened in the same year you

hit 80 and then oh the $250,000 like

uncapped node or something 200 150 150

50 but it hit at the same time did it

and everybody got that note it was like

the same year or something yeah that

year was that the year it got too big it

might have been I don't remember I don't

remember when when all these things

happened because all these people have

internet connections everyone in the

audience got the answer and I don't what

did you feel absolutely perspective

skidded feel like it was getting too big

because I thought when I saw it like oh

my god 2012 was the batch that we said

was too big right huh um and I don't

know what the rest of the world was

thinking I don't care what they think

but it felt big to us because as we

later realized we embodied an N squared

algorithm up till the summer 2012 YC did

not have any kind of sharding every

partner had to know what every startup

was doing and when a partner when the

startups this was embodied in the office

our software when a start-up requested

office hours they did not specify the

partner was not

monistic when someone posted office

hours they was just FIFO right now just

get whoever was sitting in the queue the

longest and we I can't believe we were

all computer science people and we made

this mistake so obviously and the

squared

duh duh I mean when we realized when you

looked him you thought like why did this

batch suck so bad why did we hate our

life right like there there were

startups like halfway through the batch

I still didn't know what they were doing

um

and we were asking what went wrong it

was so obvious a little bit too much to

do yeah well no no because it was N

squared specifically like it would be no

problem having that many partners deal

with that many startups right so long as

they were sharted so then we redesigned

why I seem to be sharted and it has been

ever since and it works just fine like

68 no problem right yeah each partner

has no no it's not each partner we have

three silos three silos each one

overseen by a group of partners so

basically it's like three little Y

Combinator's and we know little Y

Combinator works right sobs problem no

what about the everybody gets this note

because that was a first in the industry

as well yeah did that I remember you

writing I think that it cost a little

bit of a problem of fighting over the

money and got the money and whatever

with the bad startups the bad startups

it used to be the bad startups they

would just like drift away right right

didn't work it was like a divorce where

weren't where there was like a large

fortune at stake Hey ah $150,000 is a

lot of money let us remember right like

$150,000 for most people it's like a

house right um in a lot of parts in this

country so so like they would fight over

the money like one guy would leave and

he would say and I'm - I want my $75,000

is $75,000 it was the company's but then

he wouldn't leave you know got it oh

what a disaster and so the notes still

exist but in a smaller form now 80 80 80

you know I thought of getting rid of it

I thought of getting rid of it entirely

um because it was like a big a big pain

to organize and I thought of getting rid

of it and so I pulled the startups and

said did this money help you

like 80% of them said yes it had helped

them significantly like oh all right

we'll keep it yeah so we kept it we made

it smaller and when you look at the

those meetings what else when you're in

that decision meeting do you think

actually comes out of it that you know

the signaling that is correct and then

one of this what's the signaling what

name is out of it and the signaling

that's correct yeah we wouldn't you're

signaling you mean how to work that we

have fun yeah how do you know how to

fund and then are there signals that

you've gotten wrong consistently that

you've switched like reverse course on

you know saying like you thought this

type of person is unfunded well that the

crazy jock from the Brit Business School

but they you know you know what actually

there are some cases where that crazy

jog actually could do it well it's true

we have a bunch of MBAs now there Quincy

will our MBAs in yeah well that's what

you get if you stay at business school

long enough yeah when an MBA comes in on

the application I mean you know so many

the products that we see today or

companies are driven by product people

when you see MBA does that make

everybody go uh not automatically not

automatically cuz rescale for example

the founder of the CEO of rescale has an

MBA but he also has a huge amount of

domain expertise in the aircraft

industry right he's not just some sort

of finance dude right um so no we don't

automatically discriminate against MBAs

specifically that like the MBA has an

idea and then he goes and finds a hacker

that he never knew before

he's like eight years younger you know

and like lives in a box and his in his

house um so let's see are there things

either are you asking are there things

we used to well you used to look at and

say you know I used to not want to

accept these people but now we accept

them like hackers you know uh you've

been since you're a developer yourself

very developer centric now

businesspeople maybe now you let

nonprofits in I mean what what signals

have changed for you over the years very

I'll tell you the one probably the one

thing

is people who are very smart but that's

it right people who are really smart but

ineffectual we used to think we used to

we used to have more faith in brains

yeah it turns out it turns out like you

can be surprisingly stupid if you're

sufficiently determined right and

actually you can you can anyone can tell

this empirically I mean I'm sitting

right here Paul they know they know but

you're talking about it like there are

some parts of America where there's a

lot of rich people and they're not very

smart right like there are some some

parts of Manhattan and Florida and LA

right like like you don't have to be

super smart if you're if you're really

fearsomely effective at its nature what

is the most important thing for start-up

just to focus on now you've looked at

600 of them you've seen them fail you've

seen you know them there's a meta answer

to that I mean the most important thing

for startups to do is to focus ah right

because there's so many things you could

be doing one of them is the most

important if you should be doing that

and not any of the others right so you

should not be grabbing coffee with

investors right when you want to raise

money you shift into fundraising mode

and you go and raise money you do not

like promiscuously meet with investors

in the middle of the day when you should

be working simply because they like sent

you an email saying hey let's grab

coffee right um and there's there's like

a thousand things you could be doing and

only one of them is the most important

you do the most important thing it's

like optimizing software there is

something that is currently the

bottleneck to making the software faster

you work on that right and that's a lot

of what we do it why see we like figure

out we just like sit down with people

and just like look at all the things

they could be doing and ask them which

one is the most important they know the

answer in their head they just don't ask

themselves this question and then I'm

like okay so why aren't you doing that

you're like oh gosh I don't know I guess

we could do and

being a Y Combinator company now means

you're gonna drowned an opportunity to a

certain extent

you mean funding funding attention I

mean it won't automatically get you

customers I mean it'll automatically get

you customers if you're making something

for startups sure and so it's that's you

know a lot of the companies we fund are

yeah and we're getting we're starting to

have this sort of little GDP 8na where

companies are building stuff for other

companies but we've funded but if it's

some consumer thing it's not

automatically gonna get you users now

all right a couple of controversial

statements that have I think got you in

a little bit of hot water and I think

actually quite unfairly to be totally

honest but you said something about

people's accents you know if they can't

present properly if people can't

understand them if people can't

understand an entrepreneur that is a

difficult thing for the entrepreneur to

raise money right but you've got kind of

barbecued a little bit by that what

people thought you were a xenophobe yeah

confirm you've had many people in the

program from many different countries

from any firm I am an immigrant myself

yes so you're not a Xena Floyd in

America so when you get barbecue like

that is the best yeah I mean I get the

sense that that was particularly unfair

how did you feel when you were sort of

getting attacked relentlessly do you

think that just comes with the territory

of building something as successful as Y

Combinator no actually I think what's

going on is there's there's a new

phenomenon which is and on Twitter

especially actually what I was watching

is it was sort of like being bitten by

some fascinating it was like being an

entomologist and being bitten by some

fascinatingly horrible bug like while

the bugs biting you and you're thinking

ouch that hurts you're also thinking

whoa what an unusual bug that's

interesting right um and so I think

what's going on is basically the

internet if you heard built fires you

know like if you build a bunch of if you

put a bunch of logs and a sort of teepee

like shape it'll just like burn like

crazy and if you just like sit them next

to each other won't burn at all right

and so the Internet is now out of shape

where fire spreads really fast right

right because the

things like Twitter and so some meme can

get out there and if it's there's sort

of you know the idea of linkbait yeah

well there's sort of like indignation

bait right right

um and so and something can get out

there and everybody you know like that's

this is this must stop

right right and they're starring and

retweeting it without ever being the

original sources that's what I think is

happening that's what I think that was

that was what it was I think like there

was there's this this landmine exists

yeah right so be careful what you say

and it just happened like I stepped on

it right right and then gender is the

other one your co-founder is a female

yes and other and wife not that's a

founder and wife yeah and you've had a

decent number of female startups and you

act 24 percent in this batch in this

batch you actively work on this issue

but they also grabbed a quote from you

in isolation and said you thought that

wasn't just isolation they took a word

out of that one yeah and you you guys

are important word well how do you feel

about females in technology and sort of

promoting diversity and those kind of

issues in your own words well um it's

half the population right so if if more

women started startups that could

produce an awful lot more startups right

since we want to scale in fun more

startups you know like even if people

like honestly I would have to I would

have to like want to lose money right

against women starting startups so of

course I want more women to start

startups I want everybody to start

startups and women are half of everybody

right and you're accepting many more and

you're doing a female founders

conference yeah you're actually taking a

lot of steps to try to be extremely open

and helpful maybe even by the way the

female founders conference was something

we were already working on before that

whole controversy erupted right yeah we

can't make too big of a deal of it

because it's March first it's like in a

week so where do you see ten years from

now

Y Combinator I mean if you went from six

people in your kitchen to 650 startups

in nine years like

yeah so you guys sit around yeah do you

get 632 to be exact you guys sit around

and think the next 10 years or do you

think let's get through the next class

well what you want to do is you want to

simultaneously you want to mostly focus

on what to do now but you want to know

what general direction you're heading in

it's you sort of inch forward you know

you're inching south rather than north

right um I'm certainly hoping Y

Combinator will grow a lot but really

you shouldn't be asking me what's gonna

happen in the future you should be

asking Sam well yeah he'll be here next

year to talk about it I remember I don't

know what I don't know what he's

planning except in the most general

terms I mean the most general terms it's

gonna grow and does that mean multi-city

maybe or I'll be eventually yeah

something you haven't done and not in

the short term yeah maybe eventually and

what do you think of the change in the

funding environment I mean we have so

many more angel investors right now the

market is so bullish on startups you had

people come in and and give these notes

to everybody yeah it's a pretty robust

market does it worry you you think it's

a great thing what do you think about

funding it's a great thing and I'm

worried it's gonna stop yeah hey um

price is what I tell people is like

prices are high right valuations are

high that's not the same thing as a

bubble a bubble is a very specific

version of prices are high it's prices

are high because people feel like they

can sell this overpriced thing to a

greater fool later right right so you

can't really get a bubble without a

bubble in the public markets and it

doesn't seem there it's one of those yet

so like it's really just like I mean

prices go up and down sort of like a

sine wave and then like weird uh prices

seem high right and so that means

they're probably gonna go down somewhat

in the future and that's what I tell

startups and it has gone down a little

bit I think it maybe was two years ago

it seemed like I saw a lot of Y

Combinator startups in the uncapped 15

million you know kind of you know range

and stuff like that

gmass patch I feel like the valuations

were the highest ever well I don't know

for sure what um do you advise him in

what were the range what would you

advise them on what they should do

valuation wise and yes

not for I mean not as a knot in a

blanket statement because I depends on

the start up some right we're like Oh

thirty million will be no problem for

you guys another like if anybody wants

to give you money you should take it

right so there's what is the range now

of these you know the range of

valuations the people have raised money

at well currently you said it was very

high in the most recent batch who was in

the most recent - I mean it's nineteen

batches they all blur together certainly

like there's probably somebody in the

last batch she was at least 50/50 coming

in right after YC yeah I think so I mean

they're certainly happy that company

that was had been worked on for a year

then join YC because you do see that

sometimes - somebody comes into YC and

they've been working on it for a little

while some of them yes some of them no

but that's not correlated with that's

like how far along people are when they

come to YC it is not very well

correlated with how they end up doing

even immediately after YC like Airbnb

Airbnb had been launched for a year

before they came to YC but they would

have been launched in like we're sort of

flatlined right right um so there's not

a pattern there there's no pattern there

let's talk a little bit about growth as

we wrap up here startups want to grow it

seems like one of the things Y

Combinator really teaches people is how

to grow stuff what what do you think the

secrets of growing startups are well in

terms of techniques you've got to start

with you got to start with a small

intense fire so you have to if you're

suppose you're the Apple one right you

have to find I mean I think they made

something like 500 of those things right

yeah so all I had to do is like find 500

people to buy these computers and they

launched Apple Apple yeah so you gotta

find a small number of people it's

necessarily gonna be a small number of

people you can't find you could there's

it's impossible to make something that a

large number of people want a lot so

you've got to find people who want what

you're making a lot

and that's necessarily gonna be a small

number and that's okay that's how these

giant things get started right you don't

have to do any better than Apple and

Facebook just goes 500 true fans found

that your fan whatever it is I mean if

it's a mobile app it might not be a 500

it might be five thousand right but

you've gotta you gotta know who those

first users are and how you're gonna get

them and then you just sit down and you

just have a party with those first few

users and you just focus entirely on

them and you make them super super happy

right like there's a start-up in the

current batch that it's making a new

mobile email client right and their beta

group has one user Sam Altman their goal

is to just make Sam Altman happy and

when they like send Sam Altman is like

uses email a lot on the go he's

sufficiently demanding that if they mate

and he knows what all the other options

are - yeah

so he's sufficiently demanding that if

they make him happy they've they've sort

of used him it's like the positive for a

mold right they can now look they like

could make lots of people happy um and

that's sufficient right so all one of

the things we tell startups in these

extreme cases where you could just like

make one user happy is act like you're a

consultant act like Sam has hired you to

make an email app just for him all you

have to do is mix am happy it can say

Sam Altman at the top of the screen

that's okay yeah hey just so long as you

make Sam feel that he would be bummed if

you stopped working on this that's the

test right not like your friend say oh

yeah it's good I'll use it right like

they have to be bummed if you stop

working on it so what startups in the in

these 19 sessions have gone away that

you most miss etherpad etherpad I

remember etherpad

yeah if your dad still exists Google

Docs no no no it's like an open source

open source project but it was like a

Google Docs kind of I think we have

funded etherpad four times I like that

idea so much right and in smash had yep

etherpad sty pee well was there a fourth

one you might add

at least I mean at least collaborative

writing real time real time real time

like you type and other people are

typing in the same document um so boy

whoever the fourth one is if I they're

gonna be mad at me if I don't remember

the name but so it goes um that's one of

those ideas I just that's gonna happen

right it's Google Wave who away was a

good idea well they just like they just

launched it like new coke or something

you know if they had launched it like a

startup it's like here look there's this

little thing that doesn't matter the

problem they said is like this is gonna

change everything

right they made a fake video yeah right

what does it do I don't know everything

um like if it does everything it does

nothing

um and they should have just like

launched it is this apparently

inconsequential thing right and then

everyone have said hey this is much more

than a simultaneous typing thing yeah

that's could replace the web like yeah

yeah what didn't you accept that you

should have accepted well um

you must have the anti portfolio the

area there is what we say we're not

gonna talk about we say we're gonna keep

it confidential at people apply um well

if they're that successful they're gonna

be pretty flattered that you would well

I don't know I haven't talked about him

so far but there are pretty there's I'll

tell you an easy algorithm for figuring

them out right we there are a bunch of

other things like Y Combinator ah and

when people get rejected by us they

often get accepted by one of the others

alright so a Center in or something like

that could have gone to one grid or

something like that yes Bernie you know

I've just picked techstars as biggest

win I think yeah we changed our

application process after that to have

so a particular application that might

have been recently mentioned was only

read by one partner Robert Morris who

was really harsh and he like gave them

such a bad grade that they sunk to the

bottom of the queue no one else ever saw

them and his comment was just spam

company oh yeah

so now we changed our procedure after

that to double no one has ever anyone

that Robert gives a bad grade to you I

would go and look at as well hey just to

me

you guys have so many people reading

applications that could never happen you

have like ten people reading

applications what do you think of Google

under Larry Page Google under Larry Page

I find it indispensable yeah what do you

think if I want to look for things on

the Internet

it's Google all the way well more like

Google corporate I mean so not Google

search but Google buying six robotic

companies Google self-driving car DX

yeah I think they're trying to be Bell

Labs or you know belt whatever Bell Labs

is now um and that's great I think

that's great but they're not just

sitting there like you know trying to

turn up the screws on advertisers or

something like that

Apple under Tim Cook I have an iPhone um

I'm really bummed they funded that

patent troll Rock yeah yeah yeah like

Isis bummer that when I heard that news

I actually for the first time ever like

thought like maybe I don't want to have

an Apple computer anymore you know I

feel like that was probably wished upon

them by Steve Jobs I don't know the

origins of that but I feel like that was

way that was probably something that

like Steve decided and they were kind of

stuck with because they've spent so

money on so much on it but like and that

and then I now feel ambivalent about

Apple in a way I never did before I

think they crossed the line with that

and they're being really quiet about it

no one's talking about Rockstar so let's

talk about Rockstar everybody and what a

sucky thing to do

they just waddle defunded a patent troll

yeah like have you ever been to the

website of Rockstar

like the kid the copy on that page um

it's a work of like art you

know like like the guy who ever wrote

that stuff was like like they told him

just like you know channel some evil

dictator propaganda it's like a Bond

villain right yeah and the guy who it's

probably some nice guy who wrote that

and he was probably like I can't believe

this this is like this is like like some

guy stroking a cat on his lap you know

yeah

and Facebook you know had a billion

people I mean how do you look how do you

look at your relational men they've got

a lot of employees not I mean in a way

basis they are creating the content they

are employees

it's a carriage um Facebook I mean

startups depend a lot on their founders

and Mark Zuckerberg has infinite energy

and Drive and cleverness so I wouldn't

worry about Facebook yeah and and how

about like everybody else they read the

news about whatsapp and they thought

that's ridiculous to pay 19 bill it's

ridiculous that 19 the white SAP is

worth 19 billion dollars a month I

thought I read it like as if someone had

measured the atomic weight of whatsapp

and it turned out to be higher than I

thought

right really what's half is worth 19

billion dollars that's interesting

because who knows better these random

people chattering on forums I won't

mention any names right were like

Zuckerberg himself who like knows all

the numbers and is actually betting this

money right people like it must be worth

19 billion dollars if if Zuckerberg was

willing to pay 19 billion dollars for it

because he is no idiot right yeah so

congratulations on the newfound freedom

and a couple of days off a week it's

gonna be antastic for you it's not the

time it's the attention it's that I

won't have to think about Y Combinator

all the time right in order to build

something like this you have to give up

like a lot of cycles there's this funny

like the thing the quote of mine that

people quote the most is that one about

how you can't do a good job that's

something without thinking about it in

the shower in the morning I'm like every

time I see this on Twitter I'm like ah

every time every doll I think about in

the shower in the morning is y

combinator

right it's taken over my brain now I'm

gonna get my brain back I'll take two

showers every morning I'll be so psyched

oh you uh you think you'll ever do your

own startup again no no never

why I always say you are encouraging

people and telling them I have to start

side on in a mine right hey it's just

not worth money start a startup but it's

not worthy you might be starting a

startup is the most efficient way to do

it but starting a start-up hurts like I

mean you would expect it to there's a

conservation law there

like you shouldn't expect starting a

startup to be the great way to get money

and to like feel really easy and good

like like that would be great wouldn't

it yeah it feels great and it's the

easiest way to make a large amount of

money yeah the quickest way yeah yeah

felicitous yes and we we don't try and

like we don't tell founders any other

it's painful right if it's not a certain

amount of painful you're probably not

trying hard enough

well that's as good a notice any to stop

on ladies and gentlemen Paul Graham that

was awesome well done well done
