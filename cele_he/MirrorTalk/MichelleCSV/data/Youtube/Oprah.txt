tonight good to see you

well welcome to my home thanks for

having me here my farewell interview at

the First Lady of the United States

Michelle Obama inside the White House

when did you feel the most tested her

reflections after eight years on the

world's stage but let me just tell

America this is hard for future plans we

should go clamping and for thoughts on

the election would you ever run for

office a basket and our new

president-elect

this past election was challenging for

me as a citizen plus that's innate you

hear fancy me hey hope and whether or

not you achieve that eight years ago I

was standing with hundreds of thousands

of people in Chicago in awe of this

electrifying moment we all were

witnessing millions of people around the

globe cheered United in hope for Barack

Obama the first African American elected

president of the United States his wife

Michelle our nation's first African

American first lady stood by his side of

course like so many Americans was hard

to believe this was happening in our

lifetime

as the famed historian Doris Kearns

Goodwin reminded us people will be

writing about this moment for hundreds

of years

and now as she prepares to leave the

White House its Michelle Obama who's on

the precipice of her own exciting next

chapter

at first reticent to step into the role

of candidate's wife the rise of the

first lady as a political force because

this right now is the greatest country

on Earth has pundits wondering about her

next move this is Obama is not only a

woman to watch in American politics but

also considered the coolest first lady

in US history

I remember being here eight years ago

mm-hmm I was doing an interview for a

magazine we're actually sitting in this

very room

we took our shoes off we we did and you

were talking about the girls schedules

and trying to figure all that out and I

left you know thinking and feeling the

weight of it all like the weight of the

legacy that you all were carrying the

responsibility so I want to know has

that weight lifted or has it just

shifted you know it's it's lifted I mean

you know let's let's be honest I mean

you know there is there's no way to

describe what it feels like to open up

the paper every day and know that almost

every headline is your husband's

responsibility at some level mm-hmm

anywhere in the world any major problem

any major issue falls on the laps of the

commander in chief and that is a weight

that is is indescribable and now that

it's time for us to move on yeah that

weight has lifted a bit not completely

because the work isn't done until the

president-elect takes the oath of office

but knowing that we've made it this far

and we've survived and in many ways I

believe we've thrived mm-hmm

there is a weight that's lifted mm-hmm

was there a time where you thought this

period would make or break you when did

you feel the most tested you know I I

think I tend to push the challenges this

is a defense mechanism that I've had

throughout my life you know the bad

stuff I just don't hold on to you know I

mean so if we were to sit here and you

were to read through some of that stuff

I'd be like oh yeah that's all oh I

forgot all about that it's like oh yeah

I think I was kind of mad but I think

the way I handle things and I you know I

can't I think we as women do it we as

black women better be able to do it

because there's so much that comes at us

all the time and every day in subtle

that could tear your soul apart if you

let it but my mother always taught me

girl you better keep it moving you know

you got to brush it off and I think I've

grown up doing that so the challenge is

yeah there are times that you know

frustrated me you know this this past

election was challenging for me as a as

a citizen to watch an experience it was

painful had you originally planned to go

out or was there a moment where you

decided I'm gonna no well they didn't

campaign they always asked me yeah party

my husband people you know there isn't

an important election that has gone by

where they didn't ask you a they didn't

ask you know the question for me is just

always what and how how is the structure

I've said this before if I'm out there

if I leave this house and leave my girls

how do I know that this will have impact

I don't want to just be out there just

to be out there um but I'm always asked

so I you know that was something that

people were kind of dancing around the

subject okay we're going to ask the

first lady if she'll go out and you know

you could see people dancing around the

subject but it was pretty clear that you

know you want eated yeah yeah after the

primaries were or that you know they

wanted us all to do as much as we could

so there seemed to be something that

happened to you during this particular

campaign I think was in New Hampshire

there was a level of urgency and

dynamism that we had not seen before

that seemed to be coming from a

different space that wasn't just

political well this was the context of

that speech was unique mm-hmm

we saw this candidate actually bragging

about sexually assaulting women and I

can't believe that I'm saying that a

candidate for president of the United

States has bragged about sexually

assaulting women and I have to tell you

that I

can't stop thinking about this it has

shaken me to my core in a way that I

couldn't have predicted you know to have

a candidate for the presidency speaking

in such terms about women as I said was

not it was not a normal thing

so my response you know in light of what

I was seeing from my female staff what I

was hearing from my daughters their

reaction to it for me required a

different kind of response you know you

can't just stand before people and just

give a regular political speech I mean I

was scheduled to go out on stump right

after this was happening and the

question was well do I just go out there

and talk like that act like that didn't

happen well god that's not true that's

not honest and that's something that

Barak and I have always tried to be in

this office is honest you know so that

people feel like when we say something

we do mean it mm-hmm you know um so in

that time there was no way that I could

be out on the campaign trail and not

address how that was making not just me

feel we could feel that you had been

shaken too yeah well not because a lot

of people had been shaken to their core

and still are they are still feeling the

reverberations of that kind of caustic

language so I heard that on election

night

you can't believe everything you read

yeah please don't wait wait I read I

read that on election night you went to

bed

yes and did not know the results until

the next morning you know we absolutely

I look I don't I do not like the

back-and-forth the process of politics I

don't like to hear pundits chit-chattin

a man and I don't like it so you had

awakened enough November 9th and you

were told yeah I got up and I looked at

my my iPhone mm-hmm

and I saw it and what was your first

thought well pretty much you know you

kind of saw the tea leaves I kind of

felt helping by the time you went to bed

he's in bed good sense he I was getting

myself ready for either outcome you know

so mentally I'd already kind of digested

it

before I actually read it you know so

this is what why it's important to

understand for all the people out there

they have to understand that as I've

said time and time again words matter

and they matter most to our kids our

young people and the words that we say

moving forward all of us it matters

which is one of the reasons why Barack

and I are so supportive of this

transition because no matter how we felt

going into it it is important for the

health of this nation that we support

the commander-in-chief wasn't done when

my husband took office but we're going

high and this is what's best for the

country so we are going to be there

for the next president and do whatever

we have to do to make sure that he is

successful because if he succeeds we all

succeed when you say it wasn't done for

your husband for his presidency what do

you mean by that that there were people

who did not support his presidency there

were people in Congress there were

leaders in Congress who did not support

his presidency which was not something

that was good for the country was good

for politics but it wasn't good for the

country

um and that wasn't the right that way to

approach it when someone is cruel or

acts like a bully you don't stoop to

their level know our motto is when they

go low we go high

so in this when they go low we go high

that is that went viral now everybody

repeats it it's now one of the most

famous quote I just want people to act

on it okay so I want to know what that

meat is like what does that look like in

the reality of this time it looks like

so many things but you know it goes back

to words matter what we say how we

behave we are modeling to the next

generation so if we want maturity we

have to be mature if we want a nation

that feels hopeful then we have to speak

in hopeful terms we have to show love

and empathy if we want smart leaders

then we have to be smart voters you know

we cannot vote from a place of fear we

have to vote from a place of openness so

we have to we have to model what we want

and that's what you're saying you're

doing mm-hm

so what was it like when the Trump's

came to visit it was very pleasant it

was very pleasant I mean it was a

wonderful visit because this is a really

great job you know we did you have any

advice for it

this is you know I didn't we didn't we

talked about the kids but you know my

offer to Milania was you know you really

don't know what you don't know until

you're here so the door is open as I've

told her and as Laura Bush told me um

you know and as other first lady's told

me so I'm not new in this going high

thing I mean I'm modeling I'm modeling

what was done for me by the bushes and

Laura Bush was nothing but gracious and

helpful and her team was right there for

my team all throughout this entire eight

year process and your team is doing the

same we will do whatever they need to to

help them succeed so that's one of the

things I said to Melania when you get to

a place when you can digest all this and

you have questions because you know you

don't have questions you know the day

after the election it's just sort of

like yeah you're looking

on the house it's like well what do you

want to know it's like I don't know what

I should know and I knew that so my door

is open and that that was really the

nature of the the meeting coming up

let's stop there yeah

what did you say plus let let's not

forget I just didn't wake up first lady

and later that was one of those things

that you just sort of think day you

don't even know me



so how are you feeling right now you're

packing up you're not physically packing

yourself well yeah I do a lot of

pointing

I'm not like boxing boxing things but

I'm doing a lot of but even when you're

pointing you even when you're pointing

cuz this happened to me when I was

leaving Chicago you come across things

and it's like oh I remember that I

remember that well a lot of the books

you know books because we're going going

through like my sign book from Nelson

Mandela yes that's not being packed up

anywhere I'm gonna carry that with me I

don't don't touch that book you know we

have a lot of photo books and I think

you actually saw one I saw one of the

photo books just now coming oh just

imagine we do those all the time we do

them as you do look every year for your

staff we do it every year Brock does one

for his team for his entire senior team

we do one for family members sort of

laying out the year that the girls had

you know that's kind of a good Christmas

gift for grandma and godmothers and all

that sort of stuff and when you look

through those especially when the girls

were so little they were just looking

through this year I was looking at your

staff what I sent just looking through

the book of this year mm-hmm so many

events from college signing day going to

have tea and lunch from the Queen so

many meaningful school trips there so

there's meaning and yet as I was going

through the pages so much laughter oh

gosh yeah we're the happy side of the

White House meaning and laughter yeah no

no that was one of the things that I

told my team when we first came in it's

like we we because of the weight that

the president has because of especially

when he first came into office and we

were dealing with a financial collapse

that was unprecedented most people don't

remember that

um the country was little remember and a

lot choose to forget exactly exactly

that we're on the brink of financial we

were on the brink and we entered an

unprecedented recession and you're

dealing with people losing their homes

and we're in about their jobs and

on and on and on and we sort of felt

like we need to be substantive but we

also need to have a little levity you

know Americans need a little joy and we

were the joy masters and you did that in

this house because sitting here in this

house which represents many things first

and foremost a seat of power but it was

very clear that the image of you and

your family rocked the world and then

you literally flung the doors open to

everybody from every walk of life every

ethnicity every kind of celebration we

wanted to change things up here in the

White House hope it from the moment she

moved in First Lady Michelle Obama made

it her mission to redefine the White

House as a more inclusive House of the

people he wanted to open the doors

really wide so a bunch of different

folks who usually don't get access to

this place she created an atmosphere of

warmth by celebrating all cultures hello

everyone knows let's animal Barack first

lady's openness and acceptance led to a

flood of firsts on the White House staff

the first man to ever serve as social

secretary to the White House the first

openly transgender staff member was

hired and for the first time in history

mrs. Obama opened a White House family

dining room to the public there she

placed an expressionist painting by Alma

Thomas the first work of art by an

african-american woman inside the White

House it seemed that you all did that

purposefully absolutely yeah absolutely

and what why was that a priority because

images experiences can be life-changing

particularly for our kids and so many

kids from so many backgrounds never get

to do this kind of thing I mean you

think of all the kids who live miles

away in Anacostia who never get to set

foot on that South Lawn who never get

invited into these doors

and you know experience the magic that

is the white house I thought of that the

night all the Girl Scouts were out on

them yeah yeah you know and it's not

just kids locally but kids all over the

the country all over the world and quite

frankly I love the look on their faces

you know I mean some of it is selfish

yes because well you know the joy is

gonna say the joy when somebody else

feels something again right and for many

young people you know getting to sit in

the state dining room and talk in the

musicians and you know eating from our

China and sitting in the East Room and

listening the Alexander Hamilton private

performance I mean to see the joy the

tears the you know we've changed their

lives forever and so yeah that was

purposeful that was necessary author

Peter Slevin wrote this for the BBC

about the unprecedented challenges that

you faced he said first ladies arrive in

the White House without a playbook they

have no official duties no salary no

official jobs let's stop there yeah

what did you say first ladies arrive in

the wake up okay yet the critics are

ready to pounce from every point on the

compass more so with the first

african-american first lady in a country

that is anything but post-racial so you

arrived here with great expectations and

there were comments being made then and

since that you said knock you back a bit

what allowed you to stand in your own

truth and find your way being a grown-up

you know you know being you know I

always said it to myself

I this would be really hard if I were 20

or 30 and that's why I look at these

young celebrities and I just feel for

them because you have to be grown-up

enough to know your self in this and

that just takes time that's you know of

course I had great parents and I have a

husband who loves me I have people all

around me who affirm me look that helps

but just being straight-up grown-up

helps because you know

over the course of a professional career

and let us not forget I just didn't wake

up first lady I mean I went to law

school I practice law I work for the

city I ran a non profit

I was an executive at a hospital I've

been in the world I've worked in every

sector and you don't do that without

coming up against some stuff you know

having your feelings hurt having people

say things that aren't true

you know and it's not just about race I

mean you know it's just life Hitchin so

over the course of living you learn how

to protect yourself in it you learn how

to take in what you need and get rid of

the stuff that's clearly not true you

know so I have a very good sense of who

I am and my view to this stuff has

always been like it's always a challenge

it's like oh you think that I'll show

you cuz I'm gonna work so hard and I'm

gonna be so on it yeah that my actions

will speak for themselves and I don't

have to say anything

coming up when you were labeled that

angry black woman was that one of the

things that knocked you back and later

would you ever run for office



it made me wonder well does how are

people seeing me or you might remember

the onstage celebratory fist bump

between me and my husband after a

primary when that was referred to as a

terrorist fist jab and over the years

folks have used plenty of interesting

words to describe me once that I

exhibited exhibited a little bit of

uppity ism another notice that I was one

of my husband's cronies of color cable

news charmingly referred to me as

Obama's baby mama this is what

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wrote do you

see that I did I like you know when I

read that means I know you don't

three pieces by rats one you should I

read that one that was a pencil that

this was in the New York Times recently

and she said because she said what she

thought and because she smiled only when

she felt like smiling and not constantly

and vacuously America's cheapest

caricature was cast on her the angry

black woman mm-hmm that's what she said

she said it well and she said it well

but that was one of the most beautiful

things I read about you I thought she

summed it up for all of us but when you

were labeled that angry black woman was

that one of the things that knocked you

back and it's one of those things that

you just sort of think day you don't

even know me yeah you know I mean you

just sort of feel like wow where did

that come from yeah you know and that's

the first blowback could you think well

that is so not me but then you sort of

think well this isn't about me this is

about the person or the people who write

it you know I mean that that's just the

truth it's like I always used to say

it's just so it's so much about that and

then you start thinking oh wow mm we're

so afraid of each other you know color

wealth these things that don't matter

still play too much of a role in how we

see one another and it's sad because the

the thing that least defines us as

people is the color of our skin it's the

it's the size of our bank account none

of that matters you know this yes of

course you know our it's our values it's

how we live our lives and that was the

blowback and then I thought okay well

let me live my life out loud so that

people can then see and then judge for

themselves you know how does it laugh

out loud don't dial it back

don't apologize dilute it don't

apologize for it it speaks for itself

so Malia was 10 and Sasha was 7

there were itty bittys and I remember

one of the things that you said when I

interviewed you eight years ago here you

said either our stay here will make or

break them

Michelle calls the girls sasha and malia

her proudest achievement she often said

they're just two little girls trying to

figure it out

fifteen-year-old Sasha is in her second

year of high school

the Obamas plan to stay in Washington DC

until she graduates 18 year old Malia

will walk in her parents footsteps as a

freshman at Harvard University next fall

were there moments were you thought they

might be broken

that's a good question you know I was so

vigilant about this um I was I always

had my ear to the ground I mean I talked

about this that the first year was

really you know while we were doing work

laying the foundation I'm on our

initiatives I mean I was really just

cautiously making sure that they felt

normal that they felt good um and I

think they were okay now in the teenage

years this is the time when you know

kids start to bristle against all kinds

of authority imagine being 18 17 16 15

and you've got at least eight men with

guns driving you around walking into

your parties not letting you ride in

your friends cars I mean there were

those tensions for sure that we had to

sort of work through but as I reminded

my girls it's like these aren't problems

okay or they'll ease theirs I'm very

high class these are very high class

rooms much security

so memes Barack and I because of where

we come from we just couldn't sympathize

with there it's like girl you live in

the White House you you're not gonna get

to complain about this coming up where

do you think your greatest impact as

first lady has been and later the next

family that comes in here their lives

will be turned upside down

you



with every song too long

every laugh and daring style choice the

power of Michelle Obama's personality

and authenticity has made her a pop

culture icon why I'm in a bar yes

whining about this work is there

anything you wanted to do as a person

you baby yeah how to do some cool things

like you know open a window as with all

of the first lady's work there is a

purpose behind all the fun exercise is

not al the fresh approach shined a light

on the initiative she felt most

passionate about like healthy eating

everyone should have a healthy breakfast

oh not me

military families and one very near to

my heart educating girls all over the

world so when you get here

mm-hmm everybody beats with you and what

is going to be your initiative it feels

like everything that you did came out of

a personal space it felt like it was a

real thing for you right do you think he

moved the needle on childhood obesity

yes yes I do I think we have I think and

the we started talking about it exactly

well the the when I first announced that

we were gonna be working on childhood

obesity I mean there were a number of

people from all sides of the aisle you

know they're feminists who thought well

what's she doing out in the garden a

woman who went to Harvard she should be

doing X Y s everybody had their serve

this is too light this isn't a real

issue or this is too weighty she'll

never have be able to move the needle it

was it was a little bit of everything

which is another reason why you can't

take any of it seriously because

everybody had something to say right I

will take you the moment to get that

that I can't pay attention to whatever

yeah I knew that coming in you did cuz

just as a professional you know that if

you want to get anything done you

can't do everything and you're not gonna

please everybody exactly you change the

conversation really for the way we

looked at our military after teaming up

with Jill Biden yeah that has been one

of the greatest honors that we've had

Jill came to this issue differently than

I because she is a blue star mom Beau

wasn't the military so we're just funny

how we and interesting I should say how

we came to this issue from different

vantage points but I always say every

American should spend some time in a

military community yes I was going to

ask you what being with those military

families um how did that enhance or

enlighten your perspective I mean I knew

you knew a lot going in right going into

this yeah it was important to have them

as my inspiration because it made any

challenges that we were looking at here

in the White House with our chandeliers

and our Butler's and our you know gowns

and all that any complaints that I might

have paled it was it seemed silly when I

looked at some of these families you

know dealing with their 8th and 9th

deployment you know with family members

coming back in these the average

military kid goes to eight nine ten

schools over the course of their

childhood and these kids are resilient

these families are brave they do not

complain so when I would spend time in

those communities I think I'm not

complaining about nothing I'm gonna

figure out how we live these people up

how we tell their stories you know I get

a little worked up that so you have to

just sort of calm on death so what do

you think your greatest impact as first

lady has been greatest impact that's

hard to say that's one of those sort of

I'm really good and let me tell you how

you know I probably the greatest is just

one of the greatest things when I see

young women particularly

african-american women but young women

generally seeing somebody educated

strong outspoken just seeing that on a

regular basis it's exactly what I said

on the way here in the car you

then what did you say I said you're just

being here being who you are being

yourself and allowing the rest of us to

see that made us feel that whatever it

is you were we couldn't be that we

couldn't be in the White House but we

wanted a little bit of that for

ourselves coming up let me just tell

America this is hard

Plus hope and whether or not you achieve

that

you

I have to ask you this because when

everybody found out I was gonna be

interviewing you this question came up

and I ever sang in no weevils oh it's

not gonna happen but the people

seriously think that you are gonna run

for office yeah yeah I don't I think

some people think it's seriously and

some people are just you know they're

just hopeful and that's good hope is

good but um yeah just that reaction

would you ever run for office I have to

ask it no no County office no I I look

that's one thing I don't do I don't make

stuff up I'm not coy I haven't proven

that I I'm pretty direct if I were

interested in it I'd say it I don't

believe in playing games you know it's

not something I would do but it also

speaks to the fact that people don't

really understand how hard this is and

it's not something that you Kali really

just sort of asked a family to do again

maybe cuz we got it wrong or we think we

got it wrong so it's like well now you

do it you just go back in there and do

it you're the closest thing to that so

you do it um but let me just tell

America this is hard it's a hard job I

set it on the campaign trail it requires

a lot of sacrifice it is a weighty thing

and it's not something that you even

look to one family to take on at that

level

you know for that long of a period of

time it uses enough and 16 years would

be right let's just you know 16 years I

wouldn't do that to my kids yeah because

what people don't understand is that you

run their lives stop at any age I mean

the next family that comes in here every

person in that family every child every

grandchild their lives will be turned

upside down in a way that no American

really understands and it's not for us

to complain about it and so you don't

hear complaints but it is a truth an

actuality

that there is a weight to it yeah so the

Democratic Party has not asked you to

run for anything

no no conversations I'm not having

conversations no a conversation is like

two - a two-way street I don't know what

they're talking about but I'm not

talking back you're not gonna be talking

back

no no so your husband's administration

um every everything the election was all

about hope do you think that this

administration achieved that yes I do

because we feel the difference now yeah

see now we're feeling what not having

hope feels like you know hope is

necessary it's it's a necessary concept

and Barack didn't just talk about hope

hope because he thought it was just a

nice slogan to get votes I mean he and I

and so many believe that if you what

else do you have if you don't have hope

yeah what do you give your kids if you

can't give them hope you know our

children respond to crises the way they

see us respond you know it's like the

toddler that bumps his head on the table

and they look up at you to figure out

whether it hurts and if you're like oh

my god they're crying but if you're like

you know what babe it's okay it's okay

and I feel that way about the nation I

feel that Barack has been that for the

nation in ways that people will come to

appreciate having a grown up in the

White House who can say to you in times

of crisis and turmoil hey it's going to

be okay let's remember the good things

that we have let's look at the future

let's look at all the things that we're

building all of this is important for

our kids to stay focused and to feel

like their work isn't in vain that their

lives aren't in vain what do we do if we

don't have hope Oprah what do we do we

don't have hope is

is cute oh hey you here

fancy meeting Hey hope and whether or

not you achieved that absolutely I was

making that same point listen you ain't

gonna see you how are you thanks for

stopping behind Russ

we were talking about hoping whether or

not your administration achieve that

absolutely absolutely I feel hopeful

what are you most hopeful about now the

next generation okay

the next generation you know we've

talked about this history moves in

cycles and what lasts is the impact what

we've done has had in people's minds and

hearts that's a and that continues I

want to ask you this so she change to be

our first lady yeah we love her the

approval ratings you can tell but she

was always your first lady yeah yeah

what surprised even you about the way

she took on this mantle of first lady

ISM you know we all knew she was

brilliant and cute and strong and a

great mom but I think the way in which

romantic marriage was a dramatic and

welcome change for the first couple

living in the White House during the

last eight years cameras often captured

the intimacy the devotion the joy and

mutual respect that is sustained their

24-year marriage

did you and the president become closer

during this time yeah yeah cuz this

could hurt a marriage or hurt we can't
