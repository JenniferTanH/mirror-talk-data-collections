Q: Does every company need to be on social media?


Mark: Yes. Not every company needs to post on social, but they need to be acutely aware of what is being said about them.

If you want to get even more advanced, try setting up an integration between Facebook or Twitter with Zendesk, Groove, or any other help desk software you have using the platform Zapier. This way you're support team can automatically be notified in one place whenever a new comment is made on one of your social media accounts

Q: What's the biggest mistake you see marketers making today?


Mark: Chasing trends rather than thinking through what the best solution is for any given product.

Marketers who are quick to jump on trending channels like Snapchat or in app advertising, might come to realize that while a specific channel might be all the craze at the moment, it might not be the most effective avenue for new customer acquisition.

To discover what the best avenue would be best suited for your business, I'd recommend honing in on a core traction channel before looking around for new ideas.

Q: What's one piece of advice you'd give to entrepreneurs trying to scale a business quickly?


Mark: Sales cures all.

Q: Whatâ€™s the #1 marketing tool that's made the biggest difference in any of your businesses over the past 2 years?

Mark: 2 years ago it was influencers, now it's organic video.

Q: Can you clarify what you mean by organic video?

Mark: Telling stories on video that include your company and what it does.

So if you are riveter, one of my shark tank companies , it would be a video on their website and distributed about the military wives who make their products.

It's a compelling story and it tells the company's story.
