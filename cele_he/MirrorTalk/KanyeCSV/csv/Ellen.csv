Interviewer,"You send things out on Twitter and sometimes, like Kim has said and I'll tell you this also, I don't know if she's told you this along with not wanting more children but Kim has said.."
Kanye,I'm fine to just practice.
Interviewer,"That's all you get to do. Kim said there should be a board of directors that goes through your tweets. Like, when you have an idea you give them to Kim and a bunch of people and they go, Okay, you can tweet that or No, you cannot tweet that. Do you think you should have a board of directors?"
Kanye,Absolutely not.
Interviewer,No?
Kanye,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Everything you tweet, you think have you regretted anything you've tweeted?"
Kanye,Nope.
Interviewer,"Nothing, never? You don't go, Maybe I should have thought about that a little longer?"
Kanye,What's the point of thinking?
Interviewer,"What's the point of thinking.. Well, sometimes I understand, but sometimes there is a point to thinking. And then you tweeted out that you want Mark Zuckerberg to give you $53 million. In hindsight, should of that have gone on Facebook?"
Kanye,Yes.
Interviewer,Yes.
Kanye,"I could've put that on Facebook, now I understand why he didn't hit me back."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,I understand that Zuckerberg doesn't use Twitter.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"Even though I have had dinner with him and his wife and told them about how I wanted to help the world and he said he'd help me and then blah, blah, bla, like.. and that's how it feels though, you know? It's like the pursuit of happiness, like it's like, you're trying to sell this bone density machine or something. You know, like in that movie. I feel that if I had more resources, I could help more people. I have ideas that can make the human race existence, within our 100 years, better. Period. Fuck the paparazzi, whatever perception you have of me, starting with the truth, starting with- starting with what everyone's thinking. Start there.. put some dope shit with it."
Interviewer,"Ok, I'm with you on -."
Kanye,"'Ye is in the building! Put your motherfucking hands in the air right now! Put your hands in the air right now! Yeah, okay."
Interviewer,"I'm with you on the truth part. When you say put some dope shit with it. Give me one example, the ideas, 'cause maybe someone watching will give you the money."
Kanye,"We're in a renaissance period. We're in a place where people are, like, multi-disciplined artists. Like Steve McQueen that directed 12 Years a Slave; he was considered to just be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar. We're not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life. So the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put into my music, I put them into shoes and they worked."
