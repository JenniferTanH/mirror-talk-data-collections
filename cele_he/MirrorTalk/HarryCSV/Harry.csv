name,line
Albus Dumbledore,I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
Minerva McGonagall,"Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
Albus Dumbledore,"I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad."
Minerva McGonagall,And the boy?
Albus Dumbledore,Hagrid is bringing him.
Minerva McGonagall,Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall."
Albus Dumbledore,"No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go."
Minerva McGonagall,"Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are..."
Albus Dumbledore,The only family he has.
Minerva McGonagall,This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
Albus Dumbledore,Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
Albus Dumbledore,"There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all."
Albus Dumbledore,Good luck...Harry Potter.
Petunia Dursley,Up. Get up.  Now!
Dudley Dursley,"Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!"
Petunia Dursley,"Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!"
Vernon Dursley,"Happy birthday, son."
Petunia Dursley,"Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything."
Harry Potter,"Yes, Aunt Petunia."
Petunia Dursley,I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
Vernon Dursley,"Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!"
Harry Potter,"Yes, Uncle Vernon."
Petunia Dursley,"Aren't they wonderful, darling?"
Dudley Dursley,How many are there?
Vernon Dursley,Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
Dudley Dursley,Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!!
Vernon Dursley,"Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year."
Dudley Dursley,I don't care how big they are!
Petunia Dursley,"Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?"
Petunia Dursley,This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
Vernon Dursley,"I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in."
Dudley Dursley,Make it move.
Vernon Dursley,Move!
Dudley Dursley,MOVE!
Harry Potter,He's asleep!
Dudley Dursley,He's boring.
Harry Potter,"Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  Can you...hear me?  It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
Dudley Dursley,"Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!"
Dudley Dursley,Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
Snake,Thanks.
Harry Potter,Anytime.
Man,SNAKE!
Dudley Dursley,"Mum, mummy!"
Petunia Dursley,AHH!
Dudley Dursley,"Mum, help! Help me!"
Petunia Dursley,"My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!"
Petunia Dursley,It's all right. It's all right.
Harry Potter,Ow!
Vernon Dursley,What happened?!
Harry Potter,"I swear I don't know!  One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!"
Vernon Dursley,There's no such thing as magic!
Petunia Dursley,"Awww, smile.  Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings."
Vernon Dursley,Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life.
Harry Potter,"Will I have to wear that, too?"
Petunia Dursley,"What, you? Go to Smeltings?"
Vernon Dursley,Ha!
Petunia Dursley,"Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong.  And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it."
Harry Potter,But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.
Petunia Dursley,It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post.  Go!
Vernon Dursley,"Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk."
Dudley Dursley,Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!
Harry Potter,"Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
Vernon Dursley,Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
Vernon Dursley,No more mail through this letterbox.
Petunia Dursley,"Have a lovely day at the office, dear."
Vernon Dursley,Shoo! Go on!
Vernon Dursley,"Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
Harry Potter,Because there's no post on Sunday?
Vernon Dursley,"Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one.  No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-"
Dudley Dursley,AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop!
Vernon Dursley,"Go away, ahh!"
Dudley Dursley,What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
Vernon Dursley,Give me that! Give me that letter!
Harry Potter,Get off! Ahh!
Vernon Dursley,Ahh!
Harry Potter,They're my letters! Let go of me!
Vernon Dursley,That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
Dudley Dursley,"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!"
Harry Potter,"Make a wish, Harry."
Vernon Dursley,Who's there? Ahh!
Rubeus Hagrid,Sorry 'bout that.
Vernon Dursley,"I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.  Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
Dudley Dursley,I-I-I'm not Harry.
Harry Potter,I-I am.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself.  Words and all. Heh."
Harry Potter,Thank you!
Rubeus Hagrid,"It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?"
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, who are you?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts."
Harry Potter,"Sorry, no."
Rubeus Hagrid,"No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
Harry Potter,Learned what?
Rubeus Hagrid,"You're a wizard, Harry."
Harry Potter,I-I'm a what?
Rubeus Hagrid,"A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little."
Harry Potter,"No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah."
Harry Potter,"Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
Vernon Dursley,"He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we'd put a stop to this rubbish!"
Harry Potter,You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
Petunia Dursley,"Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you."
Harry Potter,Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Rubeus Hagrid,A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
Petunia Dursley,We had to tell him something.
Rubeus Hagrid,It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
Vernon Dursley,He'll not be going!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?"
Harry Potter,Muggle?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Non magic folk.  This boy's had his name down ever since he was born!  He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore."
Vernon Dursley,I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me."
Dudley Dursley,Ahh!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic."
Harry Potter,Okay.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.  Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?"
Harry Potter,"First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Essential bit of equipment, Harry."
Harry Potter,"One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon."
Harry Potter,But you like a dragon?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood."
Harry Potter,"All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?"
Rubeus Hagrid,If you know where to go.
Tom,"Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
Tom,Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
Man,"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
Witch,"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last."
Quirinus Quirrell,Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
Harry Potter,"Oh, nice to meet you."
Quirinus Quirrell,"F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh."
Harry Potter,Goodbye.
Rubeus Hagrid,"See, Harry, you're famous!"
Harry Potter,"But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
Boy,"It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it's the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet."
Harry Potter,"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
Harry Potter,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
Goblin,And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil.  Oh, and there's something else as well.  Professor Dumbledore gave me this.  It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which."
Goblin,Very well.
Griphook,"Vault 687. Lamp, please.  Key please."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?"
Griphook,Vault 713.
Harry Potter,"What's in there, Hagrid?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
Griphook,Stand back.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
Harry Potter,I still need...a wand.
Rubeus Hagrid,"A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.  No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long."
Harry Potter,Hello? Hello?
Garrick Ollivander,"I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious."
Harry Potter,"Sorry, but what's curious?"
Garrick Ollivander,"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar."
Harry Potter,And...who owned that wand?
Garrick Ollivander,"Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great."
Rubeus Hagrid,Harry! Harry! Happy birthday!
Harry Potter,Wow.
Rubeus Hagrid,"You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
Harry Potter,"He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
Rubeus Hagrid,"First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
Harry Potter,Maybe if you wrote it down?
Rubeus Hagrid,"No, I can't spell it. All right.  Voldemort."
Harry Potter,Voldemort?
Rubeus Hagrid,Shh!!
Rubeus Hagrid,"It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. 'Cept you."
Harry Potter,Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
Harry Potter,What happened to...to You-Know-Who?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived."
Rubeus Hagrid,"What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
Harry Potter,"Platform 9 and 3/4? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 and 3/4. There's no such thing...is there?"
Man,Sorry.
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, excuse me."
Guard,"Right on your left, ma'am."
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 and 3/4?"
Guard,"9 and 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?"
Molly Weasley,"It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course."
Harry Potter,Muggles?
Molly Weasley,"Come on. Platform 9 and 3/4 this way! All right, Percy, you first."
Molly Weasley,"Fred, you next."
George Weasley,"He's not Fred, I am!"
Fred Weasley,"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother."
Molly Weasley,"Oh, I'm sorry, George."
Fred Weasley,I'm only joking. I am Fred.
Harry Potter,Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-
Molly Weasley,"How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous."
Ginny Weasley,Good luck.
Ron Weasley,"Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full."
Harry Potter,"No, not at all."
Ron Weasley,"I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley."
Harry Potter,I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
Ron Weasley,"So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the..."
Harry Potter,The what?
Ron Weasley,Scar...?
Harry Potter,Oh
Ron Weasley,Wicked.
Woman,"Anything off the trolley, dears?"
Ron Weasley,"No, thanks, I'm all set."
Harry Potter,We'll take the lot!
Ron Weasley,Whoa!
Harry Potter,Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
Ron Weasley,"They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
Harry Potter,"These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
Ron Weasley,"It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.  Watch it!  Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
Harry Potter,I got Dumbledore!
Ron Weasley,I got about 6 of him.
Harry Potter,"Hey, he's gone!"
Ron Weasley,"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?"
Harry Potter,A little.
Ron Weasley,Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Harry Potter,Yeah!
Ron Weasley,Ahem. Sun-
Hermione Granger,Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
Ron Weasley,No.
Hermione Granger,"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
Ron Weasley,"Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
Hermione Granger,"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
Ron Weasley,I'm...Ron Weasley.
Hermione Granger,"Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello, Harry."
Harry Potter,"Hey, Hagrid."
Ron Weasley,Whoaa!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me."
Ron Weasley,Wicked.
Minerva McGonagall,"Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup."
Neville Longbottom,Trevor!  Sorry.
Minerva McGonagall,The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.
Draco Malfoy,"It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
Harry Potter,"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
Minerva McGonagall,We're ready for you now. Follow me.
Hermione Granger,"It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History."
Minerva McGonagall,"Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words."
Albus Dumbledore,"I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."
Minerva McGonagall,"When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."
Hermione Granger,"Oh, no. Okay, relax."
Ron Weasley,"Mental that one, I'm telling you."
Sorting Hat,"Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!"
Minerva McGonagall,Draco Malfoy.
Sorting Hat,SLYTHERIN!
Ron Weasley,There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
Minerva McGonagall,Susan Bones.
Harry Potter,Ahh!
Ron Weasley,"Harry, what is it?"
Harry Potter,"Nothing... nothing, I'm fine."
Sorting Hat,Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!
Minerva McGonagall,Ronald Weasley.
Sorting Hat,Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!!
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter.
Sorting Hat,"Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?"
Harry Potter,Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Sorting Hat,"Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?"
Harry Potter,Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
Sorting Hat,"Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!"
Fred Weasley,We got Potter! We got Potter!
George Weasley,We got Potter! We got Potter!
Minerva McGonagall,"Your attention, please."
Albus Dumbledore,Let the feast...begin.
Harry Potter,Wow.
Seamus Finnigan,I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
Harry Potter,"Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
Percy Weasley,"Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house."
Harry Potter,What's he teach?
Percy Weasley,Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell's job for years.
Ron Weasley,Ahh!
Nearly Headless Nick,Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
Bloody Baron,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Girl,"Look, it's the Bloody Baron!"
Percy Weasley,"Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?"
Nearly Headless Nick,"Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied."
Ron Weasley,I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!
Nearly Headless Nick,I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
Hermione Granger,Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
Nearly Headless Nick,Like this.
Ron Weasley,Ahh!
Percy Weasley,"Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you."
Boy,"Ravenclaws, follow me. This way."
Percy Weasley,"This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change."
Percy Weasley,"Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on."
Neville Longbottom,"Seamus, that picture's moving!"
Ron Weasley,"Look at that one, Harry!"
Harry Potter,I think she fancies you.
Girl,"Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?"
Man in a painting,Welcome to Hogwarts.
Girl,Who's that?
The Fat Lady,Password?
Percy Weasley,"Caput Draconis.  Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on."
Girl,"Oh, wow."
Percy Weasley,"Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."
Ron Weasley,"Whew, we made it. Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?"
Ron Weasley,That was bloody brilliant.
Minerva McGonagall,"Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time."
Harry Potter,We got lost.
Minerva McGonagall,Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
Severus Snape,"There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
Harry Potter,"I don't know, sir."
Severus Snape,And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?
Harry Potter,"I don't know, sir."
Severus Snape,"Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter?"
Harry Potter,"Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her."
Severus Snape,"Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek."
Seamus Finnigan,"Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum.  Eye of rabbit, harp string hum..."
Harry Potter,What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Ron Weasley,"Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-"
Ron Weasley,Ah. Mail's here!
Harry Potter,Can I borrow this?  Thanks.
Seamus Finnigan,"Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!"
Hermione Granger,"I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something."
Neville Longbottom,"The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten."
Harry Potter,"Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
Rolanda Hooch,"Good afternoon, class."
Class,"Good afternoon, Madam Hooch."
Rolanda Hooch,"Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon.  Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!"
Class,Up!
Harry Potter,Wow.
Draco Malfoy,Up!
Rolanda Hooch,With feeling!
Hermione Granger,Up. Up. Up. Up.
Ron Weasley,"Up!!  Ooh!  Shut up, Harry."
Rolanda Hooch,"Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end.  When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2..."
Neville Longbottom,Oh...
Rolanda Hooch,Mr. Longbottom.
Girl,"Neville, what are you doing?"
Students,Neville...Neville...
Boy,"We're not supposed to take off, yet."
Rolanda Hooch,M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!
Neville Longbottom,AHH!
Rolanda Hooch,Mr. Longbottom!
Neville Longbottom,Down! Down! Ahhhh!
Harry Potter,Neville!
Neville Longbottom,Help!!!
Rolanda Hooch,Come back down this instant!
Neville Longbottom,AHH!
Neville Longbottom,Help!
Rolanda Hooch,Mr. Longbottom-!
Neville Longbottom,Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh!  Oh. Ah...help!  Ahh!
Rolanda Hooch,"Everyone out of the way!  Come on, get up."
Girl,Is he alright?
Neville Longbottom,Owowowow.
Rolanda Hooch,"Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get.  Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch."
Draco Malfoy,"Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse."
Harry Potter,"Give it here, Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,"No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.  How 'bout up on the roof?  What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot."
Harry Potter,"Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
Draco Malfoy,"Is that so?  Have it your way, then!"
Boy,"Good job, Harry!"
Boy 2,"Oh, that was wicked, Harry."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter?  Follow me.
Quirinus Quirrell,An iguana s-such as this is...
Minerva McGonagall,You wait here.
Quirinus Quirrell,... an essential in-gredient.
Minerva McGonagall,"Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?"
Quirinus Quirrell,"Oh. Y-yes, of course.  And the vampire b-bat..."
Minerva McGonagall,"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
Nearly Headless Nick,Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well.
Ron Weasley,Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
Harry Potter,"A century, according to McGonagall."
Fred Weasley,"Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
Ron Weasley,"Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters."
George Weasley,"Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch."
Fred Weasley,Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally...
George Weasley,But they'll turn up in a month or two!
Ron Weasley,"Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!"
Harry Potter,But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
Hermione Granger,You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
Ron Weasley,"Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
Harry Potter,I-I didn't know.
Ron Weasley,"I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
Harry Potter,Who doesn't?
Ron Weasley,Ahh!
Harry Potter,What's happening?
Hermione Granger,"The staircases change, remember?"
Harry Potter,Let's go this way.
Ron Weasley,Before the staircase moves again.
Harry Potter,Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Hermione Granger,We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
Harry Potter,Let's go.
Ron Weasley,It's Filch's cat!
Harry Potter,Run!
Harry Potter,Quick! Let's hide though that door!
Harry Potter,It's locked!
Ron Weasley,"That's it, we're done for!"
Hermione Granger,"Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in."
Ron Weasley,Alohomora?
Hermione Granger,"Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
Argus Filch,"Anyone here, my sweet?  Come on."
Hermione Granger,Filch is gone.
Ron Weasley,Probably thinks this door's locked.
Hermione Granger,It was locked.
Harry Potter,And for good reason.
All,AHHHHHHH!
Ron Weasley,What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
Hermione Granger,"You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
Ron Weasley,"I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!"
Hermione Granger,It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
Harry Potter,Guarding something?
Hermione Granger,"That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!"
Ron Weasley,She needs to sort out her priorities!
Oliver Wood,"Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls.  This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.  The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops.  With me so far?"
Harry Potter,I think so. What are those?
Oliver Wood,"You better take this.  Careful now, it's comin' back.  Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh."
Harry Potter,What is that?
Oliver Wood,"Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch."
Harry Potter,I like this ball.
Oliver Wood,"Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
Harry Potter,What do I do with it?
Oliver Wood,"You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
Harry Potter,Whoa.
Filius Flitwick,"One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers?  Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone."
All,The swish and flick.
Filius Flitwick,Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.
Draco Malfoy,Wingardium Levio-saaa.
Ron Weasley,Wingardrium Leviosar!
Hermione Granger,"Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar."
Ron Weasley,"You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on."
Hermione Granger,Wingardium Leviosa.
Filius Flitwick,"Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!"
Seamus Finnigan,Wingard Levosa.
Filius Flitwick,"Well done, dear."
Filius Flitwick,Whooaaa! Ooh.
Harry Potter,"I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
Ron Weasley,"It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
Harry Potter,I think she heard you.
Harry Potter,Where's Hermione?
Neville Longbottom,Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
Quirinus Quirrell,TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!  Thought you ought to know.
Albus Dumbledore,"SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!  Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
Girl,"Hufflepuff, this way!"
Boy,Stay together!
Percy Weasley,"Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert!"
Harry Potter,How could a troll get in?
Ron Weasley,Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes.  What?
Harry Potter,Hermione! She doesn't know!
Ron Weasley,I think the troll's left the dungeon!
Harry Potter,It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Harry Potter,"Hermione, move!"
Hermione Granger,Help! Help!
Ron Weasley,"Hey, pea brain!"
Hermione Granger,Ahhh! Help!
Harry Potter,"Whooa! Whoa, whoa!"
Ron Weasley,Ew.
Harry Potter,"Whoa, whoa whoa!"
Harry Potter,Do something!
Ron Weasley,What?
Harry Potter,Anything! Hurry up!
Hermione Granger,Swish and flick!
Ron Weasley,Wingardium Leviosa!  Cool.
Hermione Granger,Is it...dead?
Harry Potter,I don't think so. Just knocked out.  Ew. Troll bogies.
Minerva McGonagall,"Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
Ron Weasley,"Well, what it is..."
Harry Potter,"Well, what it is..."
Hermione Granger,"It's my fault, Professor McGonagall."
Minerva McGonagall,Miss Granger?
Hermione Granger,I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
Minerva McGonagall,"Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you.  For sheer dumb luck."
Quirinus Quirrell,Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh.  Ahh! Hehe....
Harry Potter,Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
Ron Weasley,"Mind you, I mean, we did save her life."
Harry Potter,"Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her."
Ron Weasley,What are friends for?
Ron Weasley,"Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
Hermione Granger,"Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
Harry Potter,I'm not hungry.
Severus Snape,"Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin."
Harry Potter,That explains the blood.
Hermione Granger,Blood?
Harry Potter,"Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
Hermione Granger,But why would anyone go near that dog?
Harry Potter,"The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
Hermione Granger,So you're saying...
Harry Potter,That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
Hermione Granger,"Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
Harry Potter,But I-I never get mail.
Ron Weasley,Let's open it.
Harry Potter,It's a broomstick!
Ron Weasley,"Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  It's a Nimbus 2000!"
Harry Potter,But who...?
Oliver Wood,"Scared, Harry?"
Harry Potter,A little.
Oliver Wood,That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
Harry Potter,What happened?
Oliver Wood,"Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later."
Lee Jordan,"Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!"
Neville Longbottom,Gryffindor!
Lee Jordan,The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
Rolanda Hooch,"Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you."
Lee Jordan,"The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game."
Lee Jordan,The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
Lee Jordan,Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor!
Harry Potter,Yes!  Whoa!
Rubeus Hagrid,Well done!
Lee Jordan,Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
Ron Weasley,Yay!
Seamus Finnigan,Yay!
Harry Potter,Yes!
Lee Jordan,Another 10 points to Gryffindor!
Gryffindors,Yay!
Marcus Flint,Give me that!
Marcus Flint,Take that side!
Harry Potter,Whoa! Whooa!
Rubeus Hagrid,What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
Hermione Granger,It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Ron Weasley,Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
Hermione Granger,Leave it to me.
Ron Weasley,"Come on, Hermione!"
Hermione Granger,Lacarnum Inflamarae.
Man,Fire! You're on fire!
Severus Snape,What? Oh!
Ron Weasley,Go!
Rubeus Hagrid,Go go go!
Rubeus Hagrid,Looks like he's gonna be sick!
Lee Jordan,He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Rolanda Hooch,Gryffindor win!
Draco Malfoy,No!
Rubeus Hagrid,Yes!
Hermione Granger,Whoo-hoo!
Crowd,Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!
Rubeus Hagrid,Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
Harry Potter,Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
Rubeus Hagrid,Who told you 'bout Fluffy?
Ron Weasley,Fluffy?
Hermione Granger,That thing has a name?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the.."
Harry Potter,Yes?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is."
Harry Potter,"But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
Rubeus Hagrid,Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Hermione Granger,"Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking."
Harry Potter,Exactly.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel."
Harry Potter,Nicholas Flamel?
Rubeus Hagrid,I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that.
Harry Potter,Nicholas Flamel.  Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Hermione Granger,I don't know.
Ghosts,Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas...
Harry Potter,Knight to E5.
Ron Weasley,Queen to E5.
Hermione Granger,That's totally barbaric!
Ron Weasley,That's wizard's chess.  I see you've packed.
Hermione Granger,See you haven't.
Ron Weasley,"Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there."
Hermione Granger,"Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
Ron Weasley,We've looked a hundred times.
Hermione Granger,Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas.
Ron Weasley,I think we've had a bad influence on her.
Ron Weasley,"Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
Ron Weasley,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
Harry Potter,"Happy Christmas, Ron.  What are you wearing?"
Ron Weasley,Oh. My mum made it.  It looks like you've got one too.
Harry Potter,I-I've got presents?
Ron Weasley,Yeah!
Ron Weasley,There they are.
Harry Potter,Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.
Ron Weasley,What is it?
Harry Potter,It's some kind of cloak.
Ron Weasley,"Well, let's see then, put it on."
Ron Weasley,Whoa!
Harry Potter,My body's gone!
Ron Weasley,I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak.
Harry Potter,I'm invisible?
Ron Weasley,They're really rare.  I wonder who gave it to you?
Harry Potter,There was no name. It just said use it well.
Harry Potter,Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
Argus Filch,Who's there?!  I know you're in there. You can't hide.  Who is it? Show yourself!
Quirinus Quirrell,Severus...I-I thought...
Severus Snape,"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
Quirinus Quirrell,W-what do you m-mean?
Severus Snape,You know perfectly well what I mean.  We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
Argus Filch,"Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed."
Harry Potter,Mum?  Dad?
Harry Potter,"Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
Ron Weasley,Why?
Harry Potter,"There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
Harry Potter,"Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
Ron Weasley,I only see me.
Harry Potter,"Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
Ron Weasley,"That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
Harry Potter,How can it? Both my parents are dead.
George Weasley,"Do you like yours, Ron?  Ron?"
Ron Weasley,I'll be right back.  Want to play chess?
Harry Potter,No.
Ron Weasley,We go and visit Hagrid?
Harry Potter,No.
Ron Weasley,"Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror."
Albus Dumbledore,"Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
Harry Potter,"So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live."
Harry Potter,"Hi, Hedwig."
Hermione Granger,Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.
Ron Weasley,I'm ready! Ask me any question.
Hermione Granger,"All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
Ron Weasley,...I forgot.
Hermione Granger,"And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?"
Ron Weasley,Copy off you?
Hermione Granger,"No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell."
Ron Weasley,That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us!  Dumbledore again!
Ron Weasley,Leg-Locker Curse?
Harry Potter,Malfoy.
Ron Weasley,"You have got to start standing up to people, Neville."
Neville Longbottom,How? I can barely stand at all!
Seamus Finnigan,I'll do the counter-curse!
Neville Longbottom,"No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!"
Seamus Finnigan,"I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back!"
Harry Potter,I found him!
Ron Weasley,"'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark"" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945,'"
Harry Potter,Go on.
Ron Weasley,"'-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'"
Harry Potter,I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
Hermione Granger,Follow me!
Neville Longbottom,"Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?!"
Hermione Granger,I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Ron Weasley,This is light?
Hermione Granger,"Of course! Here it is!  ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"""
Ron Weasley,The what?
Harry Potter,The what?
Hermione Granger,"Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."""
Ron Weasley,Immortal?
Hermione Granger,It means you'll never die.
Ron Weasley,I know what it means!
Harry Potter,Shh!
Hermione Granger,"""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!"
Harry Potter,Hagrid!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today."
Harry Potter,We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
Hermione Granger,We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
Ron Weasley,We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
Rubeus Hagrid,Oh.
Harry Potter,We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
Rubeus Hagrid,Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
Harry Potter,What?
Rubeus Hagrid,"You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today."
Harry Potter,Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?
Hermione Granger,"Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments."
Rubeus Hagrid,"That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.  Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that.  Oh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"
Harry Potter,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
Rubeus Hagrid,That? It's a ... its um...
Ron Weasley,"I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact."
Hermione Granger,Is that...a dragon?
Ron Weasley,That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert."
Harry Potter,Norbert?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?  Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Ohh!  Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that?"
Harry Potter,Malfoy.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, dear."
Harry Potter,Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
Ron Weasley,"It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows."
Harry Potter,I don't understand. Is that bad?
Ron Weasley,It's bad.
Minerva McGonagall,Good evening.
Minerva McGonagall,"Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
Harry Potter,50?!
Minerva McGonagall,"Each.  And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
Draco Malfoy,"Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us."""
Minerva McGonagall,"No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates."
Argus Filch,"A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming.  You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.  A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
Rubeus Hagrid,Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Hermione Granger,"Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?  What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all."
Argus Filch,"Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you."
Draco Malfoy,The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!
Argus Filch,"There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.  Nighty-night."
Rubeus Hagrid,Right. Let's go.
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, what's that?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
Ron Weasley,Okay.
Rubeus Hagrid,"And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,Okay. Then I get Fang!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward."
Draco Malfoy,You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
Harry Potter,"If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
Draco Malfoy,"Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
Harry Potter,"What is it, Fang?"
Draco Malfoy,HELP!!!!!
Firenze,"Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you."
Harry Potter,But what was that thing you saved me from?
Firenze,"A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life."
Harry Potter,But who would choose such a life?
Firenze,Can you think of no one?
Harry Potter,Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
Firenze,Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
Harry Potter,The Philosopher's Stone.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?"
Firenze,"Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck."
Hermione Granger,"You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
Harry Potter,"But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back."
Ron Weasley,"But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?"
Harry Potter,"I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight."
Ron Weasley,And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
Hermione Granger,"Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched."
Hermione Granger,"I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
Ron Weasley,"Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?"
Harry Potter,My scar. It keeps burning.
Hermione Granger,It's happened before.
Harry Potter,Not like this.
Ron Weasley,Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Harry Potter,I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!  Oh. Of course!
Hermione Granger,What is it?
Harry Potter,"Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like?"
Rubeus Hagrid,I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
Harry Potter,"The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
Harry Potter,And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
Rubeus Hagrid,I shouldn't have told you that. Where you going?! Wait!
Harry Potter,"We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
Minerva McGonagall,I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
Harry Potter,He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
Minerva McGonagall,How do you know ?
Harry Potter,Someone's going to try and steal it.
Minerva McGonagall,"I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly."
Harry Potter,"That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
Hermione Granger,And with Dumbledore gone
Severus Snape,"Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
Hermione Granger,Uh...we were just...
Severus Snape,You want to be careful. People will think you're  up to something.
Hermione Granger,Now what do we do?
Harry Potter,We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
Harry Potter,Trevor.
Ron Weasley,"Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!"
Neville Longbottom,"Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?"
Harry Potter,"Now, Neville, listen. We were"
Neville Longbottom,No! I won't let you!  You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you.
Hermione Granger,"Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus."
Ron Weasley,"You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary."
Harry Potter,Let's go.  Sorry.
Hermione Granger,Sorry.
Ron Weasley,"It's for your own good, you know."
Hermione Granger,Ow! You stood on my foot!
Ron Weasley,Sorry.
Hermione Granger,Alohomora.
Ron Weasley,Wait a minute...he's.... Sleeping.
Harry Potter,Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.
Ron Weasley,Uh. It's got horrible breath!
Harry Potter,We have to move its paw.
Ron Weasley,What?!
Harry Potter,"Come on!  Okay. Push!  I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.  If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
Hermione Granger,The harp. It stopped playing.
Ron Weasley,Ew! Yuck! Ugh.
Harry Potter,Jump! Go!
Ron Weasley,"Ahh!  Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
Harry Potter,Whoa!  Oh. Ahh!
Hermione Granger,"Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
Ron Weasley,"Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!"
Ron Weasley,Hermione!!
Harry Potter,Hermione!!
Ron Weasley,Now what are we gonna do?!
Hermione Granger,Just relax!
Harry Potter,Hermione! Where are you?!
Hermione Granger,Do what I say. Trust me.
Ron Weasley,Ahh! Harry!
Ron Weasley,Harry!
Hermione Granger,Are you okay?
Harry Potter,"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
Ron Weasley,Help!
Hermione Granger,"He's not relaxing, is he?"
Harry Potter,Apparently not.
Ron Weasley,Help! Help me!
Hermione Granger,We've got to do something!
Harry Potter,What?
Hermione Granger,Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.
Ron Weasley,Help!
Hermione Granger,"Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumus Solem!"
Ron Weasley,Ahhh!
Harry Potter,"Ron, are you okay?"
Ron Weasley,Yeah.
Harry Potter,Okay.
Ron Weasley,Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
Harry Potter,Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
Hermione Granger,What is that?
Harry Potter,I don't know. Sounds like wings.
Hermione Granger,Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
Harry Potter,"They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door."
Hermione Granger,What's this all about?
Harry Potter,I don't know. Strange.
Ron Weasley,"Alohomora!  Well, it was worth a try."
Hermione Granger,Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
Ron Weasley,We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.
Harry Potter,There! I see it!  The one with the broken wing!
Hermione Granger,"What's wrong, Harry?"
Harry Potter,It's too simple.
Ron Weasley,"Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
Ron Weasley,This complicates things a bit!
Harry Potter,Catch the key!
Ron Weasley,Hurry up!
Hermione Granger,I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
Harry Potter,Where are we? A graveyard.
Ron Weasley,This is no graveyard.  It's a chessboard.
Harry Potter,There's the door.
Hermione Granger,Now what do we do?
Ron Weasley,"It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight."
Hermione Granger,What happens now?
Ron Weasley,"Well, white moves first, and then...we play."
Hermione Granger,"Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
Ron Weasley,"You there! D-5!  Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
Ron Weasley,"Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game."
Harry Potter,Wait a minute.
Ron Weasley,"You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
Harry Potter,"No, Ron! No!"
Hermione Granger,What is it?
Harry Potter,He's going to sacrifice himself!
Hermione Granger,"No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!"
Ron Weasley,"Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you.  Knight...to H-3."
Ron Weasley,Check.
Ron Weasley,Ahhhh!
Harry Potter,"RON!  NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
Hermione Granger,"You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are."
Harry Potter,Not as good as you.
Hermione Granger,"Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
Harry Potter,"You?  No. I-it can't be. Snape, h-he was the one-"
Quirinus Quirrell,"Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
Harry Potter,"But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
Quirinus Quirrell,"No, dear boy. I tried to kill you.  And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse."
Harry Potter,Snape was trying to save me?
Quirinus Quirrell,I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
Harry Potter,Then-then you let the troll in.
Quirinus Quirrell,"Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again.  He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone, never.  Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?"
Voldemort,Use the boy.
Quirinus Quirrell,"Come here, Potter. Now!  Tell me... what do you see?  What is it?  What do you see?"
Harry Potter,I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the House Cup.
Voldemort,He lies.
Quirinus Quirrell,Tell the truth! What do you see?!
Voldemort,Let me speak to him.
Quirinus Quirrell,"Master, you are not strong enough."
Voldemort,I have strength enough for this.
Voldemort,"Harry Potter, we meet again."
Harry Potter,Voldemort.
Voldemort,"Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket."
Voldemort,Stop him.  Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Harry Potter,Never!
Voldemort,"Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!"
Harry Potter,You liar!
Voldemort,Kill him!
Quirinus Quirrell,Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic?
Voldemort,Fool! Get the stone!
Albus Dumbledore,"Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
Harry Potter,Admirers?
Albus Dumbledore,"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
Harry Potter,Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Albus Dumbledore,Fine. They're both just fine.
Harry Potter,"But, what happened to the Stone?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
Harry Potter,"But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
Albus Dumbledore,"He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
Harry Potter,"How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
Albus Dumbledore,"Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something."
Harry Potter,"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
Harry Potter,What is it?
Albus Dumbledore,"Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax."
Harry Potter,"All right there, Ron?"
Ron Weasley,All right? You?
Harry Potter,All right. Hermione?
Hermione Granger,Never better.
Albus Dumbledore,"Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points!  In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.  First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!"
Hermione Granger,We're tied with Slytherin!
Albus Dumbledore,"And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom!  Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order!  Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
Rubeus Hagrid,Yes!
Seamus Finnigan,Neville!
Lee Jordan,Yeah! We won!!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up."
Hermione Granger,"Come on, Harry."
Harry Potter,One minute.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja?  This is for you."
Harry Potter,"Thanks, Hagrid."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh. Go on...on with you.  Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
Harry Potter,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
Rubeus Hagrid,"I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh?  Off you go."
Hermione Granger,"Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
Harry Potter,I'm not going home. Not really.
Harry Potter,"I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon... "
Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter!
Harry Potter,Now you've done it.
Petunia Dursley,He's in there. Vernon... 
Vernon Dursley,"I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird it'll have to go."
Harry Potter,But she's bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
Vernon Dursley,"Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!"
Harry Potter,But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends...  not one...  all summer.
Dudley Dursley,Who'd want to be friends with you?
Vernon Dursley,"I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
Petunia Dursley,"Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive."
Vernon Dursley,"Which should be any minute! Ahem... Now let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be... ?"
Petunia Dursley,"... in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home."
Vernon Dursley,"Good! And- and Dudley, you will be... ?"
Dudley Dursley,I'll be waiting to open the door!
Vernon Dursley,Excellent! ... And you... ?
Harry Potter,"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist."
Vernon Dursley,"Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!"
Vernon Dursley,Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
Dobby,"Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
Harry Potter,Who are you?
Dobby,"Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf."
Harry Potter,"Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
Dobby,"Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?"
Harry Potter,Why don't you sit down?
Dobby,"S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho...  Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo... "
Harry Potter,"Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything."
Dobby,"Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
Harry Potter,You can't have met many decent wizards then.
Dobby,"No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!"
Harry Potter,"Stop, Dobby!"
Dobby,Bad Dobby!
Harry Potter,"Dobby, shh!"
Dobby,Baaad Dobby!
Harry Potter,"Dobby, please stop!"
Vernon Dursley,"Ohh, don't mind that! It's just the cat."
Dobby,Bad Dobby. Bad Dobby!
Harry Potter,"Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
Dobby,"Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
Harry Potter,Your family?
Dobby,"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here... ooh...  But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
Harry Potter,What terrible things? Who's plotting them?
Dobby,Ooo...  er...  can't...  say...  argh...
Harry Potter,"Ok, I- understand. You can't- say."
Dobby,"Don't make me talk, I Errr... "
Harry Potter,"Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
Dobby,Bad Dobby.
Vernon Dursley,So when they arrive at the ninth hole... 
Harry Potter,Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
Dobby,Let me go!
Harry Potter,"Get in there, and keep quiet!"
Vernon Dursley,What the devil are you doing up here?
Harry Potter,I- I was just
Vernon Dursley,You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
Harry Potter,Sorry.
Vernon Dursley,"One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! And fix that door!"
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir...  See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got friends!"
Dobby,Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?
Harry Potter,"Well, I expect they've...  been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?"
Dobby,"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
Harry Potter,"Give me those, now!"
Dobby,No! Ahh! Ooh... 
Harry Potter,"Dobby, get back here!"
Harry Potter,"Dobby, please, no!"
Dobby,Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school!
Harry Potter,I can't. Hogwarts is my home!
Dobby,"Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good."
Vernon Dursley,"... it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said ""Look at all that water."" A-and the second plumber said, ""Yes, and that's just the top of it!"""
Vernon Dursley,I'm so sorry! It's my nephew- he's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs!
Vernon Dursley,You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
Harry Potter,Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
Ron Weasley,"Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!... "
Ron Weasley,You'd better stand back. Let's go!
Petunia Dursley,Oh!
Vernon Dursley,"Now, what the hell's he doing? Potter!"
Dudley Dursley,Dad! What's going on?
George Weasley,"Go, go, go, go!"
Dudley Dursley,"Dad, hurry up!"
Ron Weasley,Come on.
Fred Weasley,Come on.
Ron Weasley,"Come on, Harry! Hurry up!"
Vernon Dursley,"Petunia, he's escaping!"
Harry Potter,Ahh- ahh!
Ron Weasley,I've got you Harry!
Vernon Dursley,Come here!
Harry Potter,Let go of me!
Vernon Dursley,"Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere!"
Harry Potter,Get off!
Ron Weasley,Drive!
Fred Weasley,Right.
George Weasley,Right!
Vernon Dursley,No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
Petunia Dursley,Aaah!
Dudley Dursley,Aaah!
Dudley Dursley,Dad!
Vernon Dursley,Oh...  Damn.
Fred Weasley,"Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on."
Ron Weasley,Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?
George Weasley,"Yeah, Mum would never know."
Ron Weasley,"It's not much, but it's home."
Harry Potter,I think it's brilliant
Molly Weasley,"Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear."
Ron Weasley,"They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!"
Molly Weasley,"Well, you'd best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go."
Ginny Weasley,"Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
Molly Weasley,Yes dear. It was on the cat.
Harry Potter,Hello. W-what did I do?
Ron Weasley,Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying really.
Arthur Weasley,"Morning, Weasleys."
Fred Weasley,"Morning, Dad."
George Weasley,"Morning, Dad."
Ron Weasley,"Morning, Dad."
Molly Weasley,Morning Arthur!
Arthur Weasley,What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
Harry Potter,Raids?
Ron Weasley,"Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating."
Arthur Weasley,Well now. Aah! And who are you?
Harry Potter,"Oh, sorry sir. I'm Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
Arthur Weasley,"Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
Molly Weasley,This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Arthur Weasley,Did you really? How'd it go? Did you
Fred Weasley,"Oh, it... "
George Weasley,"Oh, it... "
Ron Weasley,"Oh, it... "
Harry Potter,"Oh, it... "
Molly Weasley,Arthur!
Arthur Weasley,"I mean... that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
Harry Potter,"Oh, umm... "
Molly Weasley,"Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?"
Percy Weasley,Errol... 
Ron Weasley,He's always doing that.
Percy Weasley,"Oh look, it's our Hogwarts letters. And they've sent us Harry's as well."
Arthur Weasley,"Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man."
Molly Weasley,"Oh, no."
Fred Weasley,"This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive."
Molly Weasley,We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Molly Weasley,"Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear."
Ron Weasley,"But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
Harry Potter,Floo powder?
Molly Weasley,"Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go...  That's it."
Ron Weasley,Diagon Alley!
Molly Weasley,"You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it, mind your head. That's right. Now take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly."
Harry Potter,'Diaganilly.'
Molly Weasley,"What did he say, dear?"
Arthur Weasley,'Diaganilly.'
Molly Weasley,I thought he did.
Other,"Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha... "
Witch,"Not lost are you, my dear?"
Harry Potter,"I'm fine, thank you. I- I was just... "
Other,Come with us. We'll help you find your way back.
Harry Potter,No! Please!
Rubeus Hagrid,Harry?
Harry Potter,Hagrid!
Rubeus Hagrid,What do you think you're doing down 'ere? Come on!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don' want no one ter see you there. People'll think you were up to no good."
Harry Potter,"I was lost, I hang on. What were you doing down there, then?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Me? Oh, I was...  um...  I was lookin' for Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' all the school cabbages."
Hermione Granger,Harry! Hagrid!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello, Hermione!"
Hermione Granger,"Oh, it's so good to see you!"
Harry Potter,"Well, it's great to see you, too!"
Hermione Granger,What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.
Harry Potter,I definitely need to remember that one.
Rubeus Hagrid,"You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it, then."
Hermione Granger,Ok! Bye!
Harry Potter,Thank you. Bye.
Hermione Granger,Come on! Everyone's been so worried.
Other,Harry...  Harry Potter... 
Molly Weasley,"Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far... "
Other,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart."
Molly Weasley,Ah! Here he is!
Ron Weasley,Mum fancies him.
Photographer,"Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet."
Gilderoy Lockhart,It can't be- Harry Potter?
Photographer,"Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,...  which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving...  with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
Molly Weasley,"Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron."
Draco Malfoy,"I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
Ginny Weasley,Leave him alone.
Draco Malfoy,"Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend."
Lucius Malfoy,"Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter...  Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
Harry Potter,Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
Lucius Malfoy,"Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name... or very foolish."
Hermione Granger,Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
Lucius Malfoy,"And you must be...  Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see... red hair...  vacant expressions...  tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys."
Arthur Weasley,"Children, it's mad in here! Let's go outside."
Lucius Malfoy,"Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
Arthur Weasley,Lucius.
Lucius Malfoy,"Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it."
Arthur Weasley,"We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
Lucius Malfoy,Clearly. Associating with Muggles...  and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work.
Draco Malfoy,See you at school.
Arthur Weasley,10:58! Come on! Come on!
Molly Weasley,The train will be leaving any moment!
Arthur Weasley,"Fred, George, Percy you first!"
Molly Weasley,Okay.
Arthur Weasley,"After you, dear."
Molly Weasley,"Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry!"
Harry Potter,Let's go.
Harry Potter,Aah!
Ron Weasley,Whao!
Station guard,Oy! What do you two think you're doing?
Harry Potter,Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?
Ron Weasley,I don't know. The gateway's sealed its self for some reason.
Harry Potter,The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it!
Ron Weasley,"Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!"
Harry Potter,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Ron Weasley,The car... 
Harry Potter,"Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
Ron Weasley,"Uh, right. Okay."
Ron Weasley,Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!
Harry Potter,"Well come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train."
Ron Weasley,Okay.
Harry Potter,Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Ron Weasley,We can't be far behind.
Harry Potter,Do you hear that?
Ron Weasley,We must be gettin' close.
Harry Potter,Hold on... 
Harry Potter,Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!
Ron Weasley,Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!
Harry Potter,Wha-aahhh!
Ron Weasley,Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!
Harry Potter,I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
Harry Potter,I think we found the train.
Ron Weasley,Yeah.
Ron Weasley,Welcome home.
Harry Potter,Up! Up!
Ron Weasley,It's not working! Ahhhh!
Harry Potter,Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
Ron Weasley,Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh...  Aahh!
Harry Potter,Ahh!
Ron Weasley,Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!
Harry Potter,Be thankful it's not your neck.
Ron Weasley,What's happening?
Harry Potter,I don't know.
Whomping Willow,Argg!
Harry Potter,Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Ron Weasley,Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Ron Weasley,Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!
Harry Potter,Aaaahhhh!
Ron Weasley,Aaaahhhh!
Harry Potter,Come on! Go! Fast!
Harry Potter,Ahh!
Ron Weasley,Ahh!
Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, you OK? The car! ... Dad's gonna kill me."
Harry Potter,"See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree...  clearly someone doesn't want me here this year."
Argus Filch,"Well, take a good look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hm. Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
Severus Snape,You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Ron Weasley,"Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
Severus Snape,"Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is... "
Albus Dumbledore,... They are not.
Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
Severus Snape,"Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--"
Albus Dumbledore,"I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
Ron Weasley,"We'll go and get our stuff, then."
Minerva McGonagall,"What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
Ron Weasley,"You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
Minerva McGonagall,"Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
Pomona Sprout,"Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!"
All,"Good morning, Professor Sprout!"
Pomona Sprout,"Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger."
Hermione Granger,"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it."
Pomona Sprout,"Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot... "
All,Aah! Ooh!
Pomona Sprout,Got it? And...  now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Neville Longbottom,Uhh... 
Pomona Sprout,"Uh, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs."
Seamus Finnigan,"No, ma'am, he's just fainted."
Pomona Sprout,"Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up!"
Other,There's Nearly-Headless-Nick!
Nearly Headless Nick,"Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater."
Percy Weasley,"Hello, Sir Nicholas!"
Ron Weasley,"Huhh...  Say it, I'm doomed."
Harry Potter,You're doomed.
Collin Creevey,"Hi, Harry!  I'm Colin Creevy! I'm in Gryffindor, too!"
Harry Potter,"Oh- Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
Dean Thomas,Ron? Is that your owl?
Students,"Ha-ha...  Ha, ha."
Ron Weasley,"Bloody bird's a menace. Oh, no!"
Seamus Finnigan,"Look, everyone! Weasley's got himself a Howler!"
Neville Longbottom,"Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible."
Howler,"RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. Thhhhbt!"
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...  me! Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-times winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award- but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Huh, huh, huh...  hee, hee...  Now- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might...  provoke them!"
Seamus Finnigan,Cornish pixies?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Freshly caught Cornish pixies!
Seamus Finnigan,"Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha... "
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnigan, but pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them, ha! Come on now- round them up, round them up, they're only pixies!"
Pixie,Just stay there!
Neville Longbottom,Ah! Aaah! Aaah! Aah- aah!
Neville Longbottom,"Hey, get me down!"
Hermione Granger,Get off me!
Harry Potter,Stop! Stop! Hold still!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Peskipiksi pesternomi!
Pixie,"Hee, hee, hee!"
Pixie,Yeeee-haw!
Pixie,Wheee!
Gilderoy Lockhart,I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage!
Ron Weasley,What do we do now?
Hermione Granger,Immobulus!
Neville Longbottom,Why is it always me?
Oliver Wood,"I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are gonna train earlier, harder, and longer. What- I don't believe it! Where do you think you're goin', Flint?"
Marcus Flint,Quidditch practice.
Oliver Wood,I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
Marcus Flint,"Easy, Wood. I've got a note."
Ron Weasley,Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
Oliver Wood,"""I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker."" You've got a new Seeker. Who?"
Harry Potter,Malfoy?
Draco Malfoy,That's right. And that's not all that new this year.
Ron Weasley,Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
Marcus Flint,A gift from Draco's father.
Draco Malfoy,"You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
Hermione Granger,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
Draco Malfoy,"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"
Ron Weasley,"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!"
Students,"Ha, ha, ha!"
Draco Malfoy,"Ha, ha!"
Hermione Granger,"You okay, Ron? Say something!"
Other,Ooh! Ugh! Yech!
Collin Creevey,"Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
Harry Potter,"No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let's take him to Hagrid's."
Harry Potter,He'll know what to do.
Students,"Ha, ha, ha... "
Draco Malfoy,"Ha, ha... "
Rubeus Hagrid,"Wo, this calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothin' to do but wait'll it stops, I'm afraid."
Harry Potter,Ah! Oh...  Okay.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Better out than in. Who's Ron tryin' to curse, anyway?"
Harry Potter,"Malfoy. He called Hermione, ... um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means."
Hermione Granger,He called me a Mudblood.
Rubeus Hagrid,He did not!
Harry Potter,What's a Mudblood?
Hermione Granger,"It means ""dirty blood."" Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation."
Rubeus Hagrid,"See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call ""pure blood."""
Harry Potter,That's horrible!
Ron Weasley,It's disgusting.
Rubeus Hagrid,"And it's codswallop, to boot. ""Dirty blood."" Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less. More ter the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can' do. Come here...  Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute...  eh?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Harry, Harry, Harry...  Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
Harry Potter,Not really.
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
Basilisk,"Come, come, come to me. Come to me!"
Harry Potter,What?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Sorry?
Harry Potter,That voice.
Gilderoy Lockhart,Voice?
Harry Potter,Didn't you hear it?
Gilderoy Lockhart,"What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun. Heh, heh."
Harry Potter,Spooky.
Basilisk,Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you. Let me kill you. Kill! Kill!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Harry Potter,Did you hear it?
Ron Weasley,Hear what?
Harry Potter,That voice.
Hermione Granger,Voice? What voice?
Harry Potter,I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just
Basilisk,It's time.
Harry Potter,It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
Ron Weasley,Kill?
Hermione Granger,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
Harry Potter,Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that.
Ron Weasley,I don't like spiders...  What's that?
Hermione Granger,'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened...  enemies the heir...  beware.' It's written in blood.
Harry Potter,"Oh, no...  It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris."
Students,Ahhh! What's that?
Poppy Pomfrey,Oh!
Draco Malfoy,"'Enemies of the heir beware!' You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
Argus Filch,"What's going on 'ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are you... Mrs. Norris? You've... murdered my cat."
Harry Potter,No. No.
Argus Filch,I'll kill ya...  I'll kill ya!
Albus Dumbledore,"Argus! Argus, I...  Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except...  you three."
Other,"Ravenclaws, follow me!"
Albus Dumbledore,"She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
Albus Dumbledore,"But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say... "
Argus Filch,Ask him. It's him who's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Harry Potter,"It's not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
Argus Filch,Rubbish!
Severus Snape,"If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
Hermione Granger,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said... "
Severus Snape,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
Harry Potter,When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Albus Dumbledore,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
Argus Filch,My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
Albus Dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution...  to all."
Hermione Granger,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
Harry Potter,Strange?
Hermione Granger,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just...  strange."
Harry Potter,"Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
Ron Weasley,Are you mad?
Hermione Granger,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
Man in a painting,"She's right, you know."
Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. ""One, two, three. Vera verto."""
Ron Weasley,Ahem. Vera verto!
Students,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha... "
Minerva McGonagall,"That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
Hermione Granger,"Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about... the Chamber of Secrets?"
Minerva McGonagall,"Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
Ron Weasley,Three guesses who.
Minerva McGonagall,"Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, ""pure-bloods."" Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
Hermione Granger,Muggle-borns.
Minerva McGonagall,"Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
Hermione Granger,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Minerva McGonagall,"Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster."
Ron Weasley,D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Hermione Granger,Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
Harry Potter,"Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
Hermione Granger,"The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
Ron Weasley,Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Hermione Granger,If you're talking about Malfoy.
Ron Weasley,"Of course. You heard him! 'You'll be next Mudbloods,'"
Hermione Granger,"I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
Harry Potter,"Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
Ron Weasley,Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Hermione Granger,"Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
Hermione Granger,"Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'"
Ron Weasley,"Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
Hermione Granger,Yes.
Ron Weasley,Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything.
Hermione Granger,Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.
Harry Potter,"Well, how long will it take to make?"
Hermione Granger,A month.
Harry Potter,"A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
Hermione Granger,I know. But it's the only plan we've got.
Students,Yeah! Come on Slytherin!
Lee Jordan,Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
Marcus Flint,Yeah! Yeah!
Draco Malfoy,"All right there, Scarhead?"
Oliver Wood,"Watch yourself, Harry!"
Harry Potter,Wood! Look out!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That's been tampered with, that has!"
Ron Weasley,I'll stop it.
Hermione Granger,No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!
Draco Malfoy,"Training for the ballet, Potter?"
Draco Malfoy,"You'll never catch me, Potter!"
Hermione Granger,Let's go.
Lee Jordan,Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
Hermione Granger,Finite incantatem!
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Hermione Granger,Are you okay?
Harry Potter,"No, I think my- I think my arm's broken."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
Harry Potter,"No, not you."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Oh, poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. Now, this...  won't hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!"
Students,Oh! Ooh! Ugh!
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,... "
Other,Ohh! Uhh!
Gilderoy Lockhart,"... you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken."
Rubeus Hagrid,Broken? There's no bones left!
Students,Uh-huh-ugh!
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Much more flexible, though."
Draco Malfoy,"Uhh, uhhh... "
Poppy Pomfrey,"Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back... "
Hermione Granger,"You will be able to, won't you?"
Poppy Pomfrey,"Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
Harry Potter,Ugh!
Poppy Pomfrey,"Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
Harry Potter,Uh!
Basilisk,Kill. Kill...  Time to kill!
Dobby,Hello!
Harry Potter,Dobby?
Dobby,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
Harry Potter,It was you...  You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
Dobby,"Indeed. Yes, sir."
Harry Potter,You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Dobby,At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---
Harry Potter,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Dobby,"Uhuh...  Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
Harry Potter,"You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
Dobby,Uh-huh-huh...  Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
Harry Potter,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Dobby,"Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin... uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh... "
Harry Potter,Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Dobby,"This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
Harry Potter,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Dobby,Ah! I shouldn't have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
Harry Potter,"Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?"
Dobby,"Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe."
Harry Potter,"No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
Poppy Pomfrey,Put him here. What happened?
Albus Dumbledore,There's been another attack.
Minerva McGonagall,"I think- do ya know- I think he's been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker... "
Minerva McGonagall,"What can this mean, Albus?"
Albus Dumbledore,It means... that our students are in great danger.
Minerva McGonagall,What should I tell the staff.
Albus Dumbledore,"The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
Hermione Granger,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Ron Weasley,Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he's taught Draco how to do it.
Hermione Granger,Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Ron Weasley,"Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?"
Hermione Granger,Heh...  No. No one ever comes in here.
Ron Weasley,Why?
Hermione Granger,Moaning Myrtle.
Ron Weasley,Who?
Hermione Granger,Moaning Myrtle.
Ron Weasley,Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Moaning Myrtle,"I'm Moaning Myrtle! I wouldn't expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huh... aaaah!"
Hermione Granger,She's a little sensitive.
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Gather 'round, gather 'round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry- you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
Severus Snape,Expelliarmus!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Whoaah!
Hermione Granger,Do you think he's all right?
Ron Weasley,Who cares?
Gilderoy Lockhart,"An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
Severus Snape,"Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah...  Let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
Severus Snape,"Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Good luck, Potter."
Harry Potter,"Thank you, sir."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Wands at the ready.
Draco Malfoy,"Scared, Potter?"
Harry Potter,You wish.
Gilderoy Lockhart,"On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One, two--"
Draco Malfoy,Everte statium!
Hermione Granger,Oh!
Vincent Crabbe,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
Harry Potter,Rictusempra!
Gilderoy Lockhart,I said disarm only!
Draco Malfoy,Serpensortia!
Severus Snape,"Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
Harry Potter,Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
Severus Snape,Vipera evenesca.
Justin Finch-Fletchley,What are you playing at?
Ron Weasley,You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?
Harry Potter,I'm a what?
Hermione Granger,You can talk to snakes.
Harry Potter,"I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
Hermione Granger,"No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
Harry Potter,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin.
Ron Weasley,"Oh, that's what you said to it!"
Harry Potter,You were there! You heard me!
Ron Weasley,I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
Harry Potter,I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
Hermione Granger,"I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
Ron Weasley,"Exactly! Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
Harry Potter,But I'm not...  I can't be.
Hermione Granger,"He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
Students,
Harry Potter,I'll see you back in the common room.
Basilisk,Blood... I want blood... They all must die. Kill...  Kill...  Kill! Time to kill.
Argus Filch,"Caught in the act! I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words."
Harry Potter,No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don't understand!
Minerva McGonagall,Oh!
Harry Potter,Professor...  I swear I didn't!
Minerva McGonagall,"This is out of my hands, Potter."
Minerva McGonagall,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon.
Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore?
Sorting Hat,"Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
Harry Potter,I...  I-I was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
Sorting Hat,"Yes, you were particularly difficult to place. But, I stand by what I said last year-- you would have done well in Slytherin."
Harry Potter,You're wrong.
Sorting Hat,Umm... 
Albus Dumbledore,Harry?
Harry Potter,"Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!"
Albus Dumbledore,Hagrid.
Rubeus Hagrid,"In fact, I'd be prepared ter swear it in front o' the Ministry of Magic!"
Albus Dumbledore,Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, of course you don't, and...  Oh...  Oh, right. Well, I'll, umhum. I'll just wait outside, then."
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Harry Potter,"You don't think it was me, Professor?"
Albus Dumbledore,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you...  But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
Harry Potter,"No, sir. Nothing."
Albus Dumbledore,"Very well, then. Off you go."
Hermione Granger,Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
Harry Potter,Crabbe and Goyle.
Hermione Granger,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
Ron Weasley,How?
Hermione Granger,"I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
Ron Weasley,Whose hair are you ripping out then?
Hermione Granger,"I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode, Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these."
Ron Weasley,Ahem... 
Harry Potter,"Ron, maybe I should do it?"
Ron Weasley,Yeah. Right.
Harry Potter,Wingardium leviosa. Here they come.
Vincent Crabbe,It's good right? Ah...  Cool!
Vincent Crabbe,Ummm... um.
Gregory Goyle,Ummm... um.
Ron Weasley,How thick could you get?
Harry Potter,Come on. Let's get 'em.
Hermione Granger,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves...  Add the hairs.
Ron Weasley,Ugh- essence of Crabbe.
Hermione Granger,Cheers!
Ron Weasley,I think I'm gonna be sick!
Hermione Granger,Me too.
Harry Potter,Ughh!
Ron Weasley,Uh...  Harry?
Harry Potter,Ron!
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell!
Harry Potter,We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Ron Weasley,Uh...  Bloody hell.
Harry Potter,Excellent.
Ron Weasley,But where's Hermione?
Hermione Granger,I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me!
Harry Potter,"Hermione, are you okay?"
Hermione Granger,Just go. You're wasting time!
Harry Potter,Come on.
Harry Potter,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
Ron Weasley,Okay.
Percy Weasley,Excuse me.
Ron Weasley,"What are you doing d- uh, I mean...  What are you doing down here?"
Percy Weasley,"I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?"
Ron Weasley,Uhh... 
Harry Potter,I'm... 
Draco Malfoy,"Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?"
Harry Potter,Ah- um...  Reading.
Draco Malfoy,Reading?
Harry Potter,Uh-huh.
Draco Malfoy,"I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
Percy Weasley,"Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,"Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"
Ron Weasley,Ahem... Stomachache.
Draco Malfoy,"You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
Harry Potter,You're wrong!
Draco Malfoy,What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Harry Potter,Harry Potter?
Draco Malfoy,"Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin!"
Harry Potter,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
Draco Malfoy,"You know I don't Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd."
Harry Potter,It's his...  stomachache. Calm down.
Ron Weasley,S- scar.
Harry Potter,Hair!
Draco Malfoy,Hey! Where are you going?
Ron Weasley,That was close!
Harry Potter,"Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!"
Hermione Granger,Go away!
Moaning Myrtle,"Ahh! Wait till you see. It's awful! He- ha, ha, he- hee!"
Harry Potter,Hermione? A- are you OK?
Moaning Myrtle,Aaah!
Hermione Granger,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face.
Moaning Myrtle,"Hee, ha, ha!"
Ron Weasley,Look at your tail!
Moaning Myrtle,"Ha, ha, ha!"
Ron Weasley,Have you spoken to Hermione?
Harry Potter,"She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls...  What's this?"
Ron Weasley,Yuck!
Harry Potter,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
Moaning Myrtle,"Oooh, oooh, ooooh, huh, huh. Come to throw something else at me?"
Harry Potter,Why would I throw something at you?
Moaning Myrtle,"Don't ask me! Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me."
Ron Weasley,"But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you."
Moaning Myrtle,Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it! Ten points if you get through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!
Harry Potter,"But, who threw it at you, anyway?"
Moaning Myrtle,"I don't know, I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the Ubend thinking about death - aah - and it fell through the top of my head. Uhhuh. Whoo-oooh-whoooo... "
Harry Potter,'Tom Marvolo Riddle.'
Harry Potter,'My name is Harry Potter.'
Diary,"Hello Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle."
Harry Potter,'Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?'
Diary,Yes.
Harry Potter,'Can you tell me?'
Diary,No. But I can show you. Let me take you back fifty years ago... 
Harry Potter,Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
Albus Dumbledore,Riddle! Come.
Tom Riddle,Professor Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,Dumbledore?
Albus Dumbledore,"It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
Tom Riddle,"Yes, Professor. I- I suppose I- I had to see for myself if the rumors were true."
Albus Dumbledore,"I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true."
Tom Riddle,"About the school, as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?"
Albus Dumbledore,"I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
Tom Riddle,Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--
Albus Dumbledore,Is there something you wish to tell me?
Tom Riddle,"No, sir. Nothing."
Albus Dumbledore,"Very well, then. Off you go."
Tom Riddle,"Good night, sir."
Rubeus Hagrid,Let's get yeh out of there.
Tom Riddle,"Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but--"
Rubeus Hagrid,You can't! You don't understand.
Tom Riddle,The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
Rubeus Hagrid,It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!
Tom Riddle,"Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
Rubeus Hagrid,No!
Tom Riddle,"Stand aside, Hagrid!"
Rubeus Hagrid,No!
Tom Riddle,Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!
Rubeus Hagrid,Aragog! Aragog!
Tom Riddle,"I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled."
Harry Potter,Hagrid! Haagriid!
Harry Potter,Woah!
Harry Potter,It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
Hermione Granger,It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
Ron Weasley,"We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
Harry Potter,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
Hermione Granger,Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
Ron Weasley,"That'll be a cheerful visit! ""Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"""
Rubeus Hagrid,"Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would ya?"
Harry Potter,No!
Ron Weasley,No!
Hermione Granger,No!
Harry Potter,"W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, It's a- Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin' to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit o' growing up to do. But, once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin' after yourselves. All right? Hmm."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hello, Neville!"
Neville Longbottom,"Harry- I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!"
Hermione Granger,It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.
Ron Weasley,"Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
Harry Potter,And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
Oliver Wood,"Alright, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a"
Fred Weasley,"And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
Oliver Wood,"Well, that too. Professor McGonagall."
Minerva McGonagall,This match has been cancelled.
Oliver Wood,We can't cancel Quidditch.
Minerva McGonagall,"Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see."
Minerva McGonagall,"I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
Ron Weasley,Hermione!
Minerva McGonagall,"She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
Harry Potter,No.
Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. ""All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions."" I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
Harry Potter,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
Ron Weasley,But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
Harry Potter,I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again.
Rubeus Hagrid,Who's there? Hello? Hello?
Harry Potter,What's that for?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah...  It doesn't matter- come on inI just made a pot o' tea."
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
Rubeus Hagrid,I'm fine! I'm alright.
Harry Potter,Did you hear about Hermione?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ'."
Harry Potter,"Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"What you had to understand about that is  Quick under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both o' you...  Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
Albus Dumbledore,"Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we... ?"
Rubeus Hagrid,Of course! Come in! Come in.
Ron Weasley,"That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
Cornelius Fudge,"Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry's got to act."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!"
Albus Dumbledore,"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
Cornelius Fudge,"Albus look, Hagrid's record is against him. I've got to take him."
Rubeus Hagrid,Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
Cornelius Fudge,"I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
Lucius Malfoy,"Already here, Fudge? Good... "
Rubeus Hagrid,What're you doin' here? Get outta my house!
Lucius Malfoy,"Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
Albus Dumbledore,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
Lucius Malfoy,"The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Yeh can' take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! You mark my words, there'll be killin's next!"
Lucius Malfoy,You think so?
Albus Dumbledore,"Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
Lucius Malfoy,Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
Cornelius Fudge,"Come, Hagrid...  Well?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone'll need to feed Fang while I'm away."
Cornelius Fudge,Good boy.
Ron Weasley,"Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!"
Harry Potter,"Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
Ron Weasley,What?!
Harry Potter,You heard what Hagrid said; 'Follow the spiders.'
Ron Weasley,"They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies?"""
Ron Weasley,"Harry, I don't like this...  Harry, I don't like this at all!"
Harry Potter,Shush!
Ron Weasley,Can we go back now?
Harry Potter,Come on!
Aragog,Who is it?
Harry Potter,Don't panic.
Aragog,Hagrid? Is that you?
Harry Potter,We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?
Aragog,Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
Harry Potter,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
Aragog,That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Harry Potter,Then you're not the monster.
Aragog,"No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler."
Ron Weasley,Harry.
Harry Potter,"Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
Aragog,We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
Harry Potter,But have you seen it?
Aragog,"I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
Ron Weasley,Harry!
Harry Potter,What?
Ron Weasley,Ahh- hhh... 
Harry Potter,"Well, thank you. We'll just... go."
Aragog,"Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid."
Ron Weasley,Can we panic now?
Ron Weasley,Know any spells?
Harry Potter,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
Ron Weasley,Where's Hermione when you need her?
Harry Potter,Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!
Harry Potter,Whoah!
Ron Weasley,Whoah!
Ron Weasley,Glad we're out of there! Ah- Aaaah!
Harry Potter,Arania exumai!
Ron Weasley,Thanks for that.
Harry Potter,Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
Harry Potter,Aah!
Ron Weasley,Aah!
Harry Potter,Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
Ron Weasley,The flying gear's jammed!
Harry Potter,Come on! Pull!
Ron Weasley,I'm trying!
Ron Weasley,"Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
Harry Potter,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Harry Potter,"Wish you were here Hermione. We need you...  now, more than ever."
Ron Weasley,What's that?
Harry Potter,"Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
Harry Potter,"'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!"
Ron Weasley,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
Harry Potter,"Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. And Hermione... had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
Ron Weasley,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
Harry Potter,The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. 'Spiders flee before it.' It all fits!
Ron Weasley,But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
Harry Potter,"Hermione's answered that, too."
Ron Weasley,Pipes? It's using the plumbing!
Harry Potter,"Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
Ron Weasley,Moaning Myrtle.
Minerva McGonagall,"All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
Minerva McGonagall,"As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
Gilderoy Lockhart,So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?
Severus Snape,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
Gilderoy Lockhart,My m-moment?
Severus Snape,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
Minerva McGonagall,"Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Very well- ah- I'll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready."
Poppy Pomfrey,"Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
Minerva McGonagall,Ginny Weasley.
Ron Weasley,'Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.' Ginny... 
Harry Potter,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
Harry Potter,"Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go."
Ron Weasley,What about my sister?!
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
Ron Weasley,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a... 
Harry Potter,You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Books can be misleading!
Harry Potter,You wrote them!
Gilderoy Lockhart,"My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!"
Harry Potter,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
Ron Weasley,Is there anything you can do?
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I'd never have sold another book. In fact, ah... I'm ah... going to have to do the same to you."
Harry Potter,Don't even think about it.
Moaning Myrtle,"Oh! Who's there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
Harry Potter,To ask you how you died.
Moaning Myrtle,"Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
Harry Potter,Who was it Myrtle?
Moaning Myrtle,"I don't know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh... But they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and...  I died."
Harry Potter,Just like that? How?
Moaning Myrtle,"I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes... over there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo... "
Harry Potter,"This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
Ron Weasley,"Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
Harry Potter,Hesha- Hassah.
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah...  There's no need for me to stay."
Harry Potter,"Oh, yes there is! You first."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Now, boys what good will it do?"
Ron Weasley,Better you than us.
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Um... but... obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It's really quite filthy down here."
Harry Potter,All right. Let's go.
Moaning Myrtle,"Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee."
Harry Potter,Uh... thanks Myrtle.
Harry Potter,Aaah!
Ron Weasley,Aaah!
Ron Weasley,Ugh!
Harry Potter,"Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
Ron Weasley,Go on.
Harry Potter,This way.
Ron Weasley,What's this?
Gilderoy Lockhart,It looks like a...  snake.
Harry Potter,It's a snakeskin.
Ron Weasley,"Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
Gilderoy Lockhart,"The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"
Ron Weasley,Harry! Harry!
Harry Potter,"Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
Ron Weasley,I'm fine!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Uhh...  Hello. Who are you?
Ron Weasley,Um... Ron Weasley.
Gilderoy Lockhart,"Really? And uh, who- who am I?"
Ron Weasley,Lockhart's memory charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is!
Gilderoy Lockhart,"It's an odd sort of place this, isn't it? Do you live here?"
Ron Weasley,No!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Really? Well?
Ron Weasley,What'll do I do now?
Harry Potter,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!
Ron Weasley,OK.
Harry Potter,Hesha- Hassah.
Harry Potter,"Ginny...  Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
Tom Riddle,She won't wake.
Harry Potter,"Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not... ?"
Tom Riddle,"She's still alive, but only just."
Harry Potter,Are you a ghost?
Tom Riddle,"A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
Harry Potter,"She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk."
Tom Riddle,It won't come until it's called.
Harry Potter,"Give me my wand, Tom."
Tom Riddle,You won't be needing it.
Harry Potter,"Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!"
Tom Riddle,"I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry Potter,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!
Tom Riddle,"It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
Harry Potter,But why?
Tom Riddle,"Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
Harry Potter,"But, why did you want to meet me?"
Tom Riddle,"I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
Harry Potter,"Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
Tom Riddle,It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Harry Potter,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Tom Riddle,"He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
Harry Potter,"Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
Tom Riddle,"Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target...  has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?"
Harry Potter,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Tom Riddle,"Voldemort is my past, present, and future."
Harry Potter,You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
Tom Riddle,"Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Tom Riddle,Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Harry Potter,He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
Tom Riddle,"So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine."
Tom Riddle,"Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
Tom Riddle,"No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
Tom Riddle,"Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very...  much...  alive!"
Harry Potter,Ginny-
Tom Riddle,"Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do...  especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
Harry Potter,Ginny... 
Ginny Weasley,"Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and...  Harry, you're hurt!"
Harry Potter,"Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough...  Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Amazing! This is just like magic!
Albus Dumbledore,"You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
Ron Weasley,"Yes, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
Ron Weasley,"Yes, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
Ron Weasley,"Thanks, sir!"
Albus Dumbledore,"And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry...  first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um...  second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
Harry Potter,"It's just...  You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
Albus Dumbledore,"I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
Harry Potter,Voldemort transferred some of his powers...  to me?
Albus Dumbledore,"Not intentionally, but yes."
Harry Potter,So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
Albus Dumbledore,"It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
Harry Potter,Because I asked it to.
Albus Dumbledore,"Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
Harry Potter,Godric Gryffindor.
Albus Dumbledore,Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Harry Potter,Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys
Dobby,Um-humm... 
Lucius Malfoy,"I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned!"
Albus Dumbledore,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
Lucius Malfoy,Ridiculous!
Albus Dumbledore,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
Lucius Malfoy,How dare you?!
Albus Dumbledore,I beg your pardon?
Lucius Malfoy,"My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, yes."
Lucius Malfoy,And? Who was it?
Albus Dumbledore,Voldemort.
Lucius Malfoy,Ah!
Albus Dumbledore,"Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
Lucius Malfoy,I see.
Albus Dumbledore,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
Lucius Malfoy,"Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
Harry Potter,Don't worry. I will be.
Lucius Malfoy,"Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
Dobby,Ahh! Oow!
Harry Potter,"Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
Harry Potter,Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
Lucius Malfoy,Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
Harry Potter,"Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
Lucius Malfoy,"You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
Harry Potter,Open it.
Lucius Malfoy,Dobby?
Dobby,Master has given Dobby a sock!
Lucius Malfoy,What? I didn't give.
Dobby,Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
Lucius Malfoy,You've lost me my servant!
Dobby,You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Lucius Malfoy,Advada.
Lucius Malfoy,"Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
Dobby,Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
Harry Potter,Just promise me something.
Dobby,"Anything, sir!"
Harry Potter,Never try to save my life again.
Other,"Welcome back, Sir Nicholas!"
Nearly Headless Nick,Thank you!
Other,"Good evening, Sir Nicholas!"
Nearly Headless Nick,Good evening!
Other,"Good to see you, Sir Nicholas!"
Nearly Headless Nick,Thank you! Hello! Hermione! Welcome back!
Hermione Granger,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas!"
Neville Longbottom,Harry- it's Hermione!
Ron Weasley,"Uhh-um...  Welcome back, Hermione."
Hermione Granger,It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!
Harry Potter,"Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn't have done it without you."
Hermione Granger,Thanks.
Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention, please?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled."
Hermione Granger,"Oh, no!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that aif it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o' course, I woulduh- I'd still be you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say 'Thanks.'"
Harry Potter,"Well, there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
Rubeus Hagrid,Oh!
Students,Yeah! Yeah!
Harry Potter,Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima!
Petunia Dursley,"Harry! Harry! Harry, open the door! Marge! How lovely to see..."
Harry Potter,"Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form."
Vernon Dursley,What is it?
Harry Potter,Nothing. School stuff.
Vernon Dursley,"Later perhaps, if you behave."
Harry Potter,I will if she does.
Marge Dursley,"Oh, you're still here, are you?"
Harry Potter,Yes.
Marge Dursley,"Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. Damn good of my brother to keep you. He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh? Give us a kiss! Come on! Up, up!"
Vernon Dursley,Take Marge's suitcase upstairs!
Harry Potter,Okay.
Marge Dursley,"Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh."
Vernon Dursley,"Can I tempt you, Marge?"
Marge Dursley,"Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. A bit more. Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs. Just a bit more. That's a boy! Mm! You wanna try a little drop of brandy? A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh? What are you smirking at? Where did you send the boy, Vernon?"
Vernon Dursley,St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Marge Dursley,"Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?"
Harry Potter,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times."
Marge Dursley,"Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?"
Petunia Dursley,Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.
Marge Dursley,"And a drunk too, no doubt?"
Harry Potter,That's a lie!
Marge Dursley,What did you say?
Harry Potter,My dad wasn't a drunk!
Marge Dursley,"Oh, don't worry Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip."
Vernon Dursley,I think it's time you went to bed.
Marge Dursley,"Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up. Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup."
Harry Potter,Shut up! Shut up!
Marge Dursley,"Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- Vernon! Vernon! Vernon, do something!"
Vernon Dursley,"Ow! Ripper! Ow! Ripper, get down, boy! Down! Ripper, stop it! Stop! I've got you, Marge! I've got you! Hold on, hold on! Get off!"
Marge Dursley,Don't you dare!
Vernon Dursley,Sorry!
Petunia Dursley,"Oh, Vernon!"
Vernon Dursley,"Oh, God! Marge! Please! Marge! Come back! You bring her back! You bring her back now and you put her right!"
Harry Potter,No! She deserved what she got! Keep away from me.
Vernon Dursley,You're not allowed to do magic outside school.
Harry Potter,Yeah? Try me.
Vernon Dursley,They won't let you back now. You've nowhere to go.
Harry Potter,I don't care. Anywhere's better than here.
Stanley Shunpike,"Welcome to the Knight Bus... emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. What you doing down there?"
Harry Potter,I fell over.
Stanley Shunpike,What you fall over for?
Harry Potter,I didn't do it on purpose.
Stanley Shunpike,"Well, come on, then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. What you looking at?"
Harry Potter,Nothing.
Stanley Shunpike,"Well, come on, then. In. No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in. Come on. Come on. Move on, move on, move on."
Stanley Shunpike,"Take her away, Ern."
Shrunken head,"Yeah, take it away, Ernie. It's going to be a bumpy ride."
Stanley Shunpike,What did you say your name was again?
Harry Potter,I didn't.
Stanley Shunpike,Whereabouts are you headed?
Harry Potter,The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Stanley Shunpike,You heard that Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Shrunken head,The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup... make sure you eat it before it eats you.
Harry Potter,But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
Stanley Shunpike,"Muggles? They don't see nothing, do they?"
Shrunken head,"No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel. Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock! Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, three and a half... two, one and three quarters. Yes!"
Harry Potter,Who is that? That man.
Stanley Shunpike,"Who is that? Who is...? That is Sirius Black, that is. Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black. He's a murderer. Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it."
Harry Potter,How did he escape?
Stanley Shunpike,"Well, that's the question, isn't it? He's the first one that done it. He was a big supporter of... You-Know-Who. I reckon you've heard of him."
Harry Potter,Yeah. Him I've heard of.
Shrunken head,"Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock. They're getting closer, Ernie. Ernie, they're right on top of us! Mind your head. Hey, guys? Guys? Why the long faces? Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. The Leaky Cauldron. Next stop, Knockturn Alley."
Tom,"Ah, Mr. Potter, at last."
Stanley Shunpike,"Take it away, Ern."
Shrunken head,"Yeah, take it away, Ernie!"
Tom,: Room 11.
Harry Potter,Hedwig.
Cornelius Fudge,": Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself."
Cornelius Fudge,"As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So that's that... and no harm done."
Tom,: Pea soup?
Harry Potter,"No, thank you. Minister?"
Cornelius Fudge,Yes?
Harry Potter,I don't understand.
Cornelius Fudge,Understand?
Harry Potter,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Cornelius Fudge,"Come now, Harry the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... for blowing up their aunts. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... was very, very irresponsible."
Harry Potter,"The state of things, sir?"
Cornelius Fudge,We have a killer on the loose.
Harry Potter,"Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me?"
Cornelius Fudge,"Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty... of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room."
Harry Potter,Hedwig.
Cornelius Fudge,"Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... wander."
Maid,Housekeeping. I'll come back later.
Ron Weasley,"I'm warning you, Hermione. Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy."
Hermione Granger,"It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? It's in his nature."
Ron Weasley,A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair.
Hermione Granger,"That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy."
Ron Weasley,Harry.
Hermione Granger,Harry.
Harry Potter,Egypt. What's it like?
Ron Weasley,"Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself."
Hermione Granger,You know the Egyptians used to worship cats?
Ron Weasley,Along with the dung beetle.
Fred Weasley,Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
George Weasley,Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
Ron Weasley,I haven't shown anyone.
Fred Weasley,"': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium."
George Weasley,"': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium."
Molly Weasley,Harry.
Harry Potter,Mrs. Weasley.
Molly Weasley,"Good to see you, dear."
Harry Potter,Good to see you.
Molly Weasley,You got everything you need?
Harry Potter,Yes.
Molly Weasley,Yes? All of your books?
Harry Potter,"Yeah, it's all upstairs."
Molly Weasley,All of your clothes?
Harry Potter,Everything's there.
Molly Weasley,Good boy.
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter.
Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley.
Arthur Weasley,"Harry, wonder if I might have a word?"
Harry Potter,"Yeah, sure."
Arthur Weasley,Hermione.
Hermione Granger,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
Arthur Weasley,Looking forward to a new term?
Harry Potter,Yeah. It should be great.
Arthur Weasley,"Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger."
Harry Potter,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
Arthur Weasley,"What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
Arthur Weasley,"Do you know why? Thirteen years ago, when you stopped..."
Harry Potter,Voldemort.
Arthur Weasley,Don't say his name.
Harry Potter,Sorry.
Arthur Weasley,"When you stopped You-Know-Who... Black lost everything. But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. And in his mind... you are the only thing that stands in the way... of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why... he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you."
Harry Potter,And kill me.
Arthur Weasley,"Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... you won't go looking for Black."
Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Molly Weasley,"Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him!"
Harry Potter,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... I lost control.
Ron Weasley,Brilliant.
Hermione Granger,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled."
Harry Potter,I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
Ron Weasley,I still think it was brilliant.
Hermione Granger,Come on. Everywhere else is full.
Ron Weasley,Who do you think that is?
Hermione Granger,Professor R.J. Lupin.
Ron Weasley,Do you know everything? How is it she knows everything?
Hermione Granger,"It's on his suitcase, Ronald."
Ron Weasley,Oh.
Harry Potter,Do you think he's really asleep?
Hermione Granger,Seems to be. Why?
Harry Potter,I gotta tell you something.
Ron Weasley,Let me get this straight. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Hermione Granger,"But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him."
Ron Weasley,"Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic."
Harry Potter,"Thanks, Ron."
Hermione Granger,Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet.
Ron Weasley,What's going on?
Harry Potter,I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.
Hermione Granger,"Ouch, Ron. That was my foot."
Ron Weasley,There's something moving out there. I think... someone's coming aboard.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell! What's happening?
Hermione Granger,"Harry. Harry, are you all right?"
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Remus Lupin,"Here, eat this. It'll help. It's all right. It's chocolate."
Harry Potter,What was that thing that came?
Remus Lupin,"It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better."
Harry Potter,What happened to me?
Ron Weasley,"Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something."
Harry Potter,And did either of you two... you know... pass out?
Ron Weasley,"No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again."
Harry Potter,But someone was screaming. A woman.
Hermione Granger,"No one was screaming, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,"Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor."
Hermione Granger,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
Draco Malfoy,"Potter. Is it true you fainted? I mean, you actually fainted?"
Ron Weasley,"Shove off, Malfoy."
Harry Potter,How did he find out?
Hermione Granger,Just forget it.
Albus Dumbledore,"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light."
Seamus Finnigan,"Fortuna Major. Here, listen. She just won't let me in. Fortuna Major."
The Fat Lady,"No, no, no. Wait, wait. Watch this. Oh, amazing! Just with my voice."
Harry Potter,Fortuna Major.
The Fat Lady,"Yes, all right. Go in."
Harry Potter,Thank you.
Harry Potter,"She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
Seamus Finnigan,"She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
Ron Weasley,". Green. That's a monkey. What is that? You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again. Hey, Neville, try an elephant."
Seamus Finnigan,"Ron, catch."
Ron Weasley,I will.
Seamus Finnigan,I think we have a winner.
Ron Weasley,"Oh, don't try one of them. Oh, no. Look at him. His face."
Sybill Trelawney,"Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you must look beyond."
Hermione Granger,What a load of rubbish.
Ron Weasley,Where did you come from?
Hermione Granger,Me? I've been here all this time.
Sybill Trelawney,"You, boy... Is your grandmother quite well?"
Neville Longbottom,I think so.
Sybill Trelawney,"I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Pity. Broaden your minds. Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond? I think you are."
Ron Weasley,Sure.
Sybill Trelawney,Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.
Ron Weasley,"Oh, yeah. Um... Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it."
Sybill Trelawney,"Give me the cup. Oh, my dear boy. My dear... you have the Grim."
Other,"The Grin? What's the Grin? Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim. Taking form of a giant spectral dog. It's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen... of death."
Ron Weasley,You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Hermione Granger,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject."
Ron Weasley,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
Hermione Granger,A fair few.
Ron Weasley,Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You have to be in two classes at once.
Hermione Granger,Don't be silly Ron. How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future!.
Rubeus Hagrid,"That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. I got a real treat for you today. A great lesson. So follow me. Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. And open your books to page 49."
Draco Malfoy,Exactly how do we do that?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me."
Draco Malfoy,"Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom."
Neville Longbottom,I'm okay. Okay.
Hermione Granger,I think they're funny.
Draco Malfoy,"Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Really Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes."
Harry Potter,"Shut up, Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,D-Dementor! Dementor!
Hermione Granger,Just ignore him.
Ron Weasley,You're supposed to stroke it.
Neville Longbottom,Yeah.
Rubeus Hagrid,Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak.
Ron Weasley,"Hagrid, exactly what is that?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! I think he may let you ride him now."
Harry Potter,What?
Rubeus Hagrid,Come on.
Harry Potter,"Hey, hey, hey!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak."
Ron Weasley,"That was wicked, Harry!"
Draco Malfoy,"Oh, please."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well done, well done. How am I doing me first day?"
Harry Potter,"Brilliant, professor."
Draco Malfoy,"Yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Malfoy, no... No! Buckbeak! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature!"
Draco Malfoy,It's killed me! It's killed me!
Rubeus Hagrid,Calm down! It's just a scratch!
Hermione Granger,Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.
Rubeus Hagrid,I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
Draco Malfoy,Oh You're gonna regret this.
Rubeus Hagrid,Class dismissed!
Draco Malfoy,You and your bloody chicken!
Pansy Parkinson,"Does it hurt terribly, Draco?"
Draco Malfoy,"It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm. I couldn't do homework for weeks."
Ron Weasley,"Listen to the idiot. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?"
Harry Potter,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
Hermione Granger,Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.
Seamus Finnigan,He's been sighted! He's been sighted!
Ron Weasley,Who?
Seamus Finnigan,Sirius Black!
Hermione Granger,Dufftown? That's not far from here.
Other,"You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? With dementors at every entrance?"
Seamus Finnigan,Dementors? He's already slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again?
Other,That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Remus Lupin,"Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?"
Dean Thomas,"That's a boggart, that is."
Remus Lupin,"Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?"
Hermione Granger,No one knows.
Ron Weasley,When did she get here?
Hermione Granger,Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so...
Remus Lupin,"So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. After me. Riddikulus!"
All,Riddikulus!
Remus Lupin,Very good. A little louder and very clear. Listen: Riddikulus!
All,Riddikulus!
Draco Malfoy,This class is ridiculous.
Remus Lupin,"Very good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a boggart is laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Uh... Neville, would you join me, please? Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?"
Neville Longbottom,Professor Snape.
Remus Lupin,Sorry?
Neville Longbottom,Professor Snape.
Remus Lupin,"Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. And I believe you live with your grandmother."
Neville Longbottom,"Y-Yes but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either."
Remus Lupin,"No... it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind."
Neville Longbottom,She carries a red handbag...
Remus Lupin,"We don't need to hear. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One, two, three. Think, Neville, think."
Neville Longbottom,Riddikulus!
Remus Lupin,"Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line! Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! Wand at the ready, Ron, wand at the ready."
Ron Weasley,Riddikulus!
Remus Lupin,"Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady."
Parvati Patil,Riddikulus!
Remus Lupin,"And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful! Here! Riddikulus! Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back. That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing."
Minerva McGonagall,"Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter."
Argus Filch,"Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put."
Harry Potter,"But professor I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
Minerva McGonagall,"I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word."
Harry Potter,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
Harry Potter,"Professor, can I ask you something?"
Remus Lupin,"You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort."
Harry Potter,I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
Remus Lupin,I'm very impressed. That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise.
Harry Potter,Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman... screaming.
Remus Lupin,Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power.
Harry Potter,I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.
Remus Lupin,"The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much."
Ron Weasley,"Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never did got a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though. You heard it's the most..."
Harry Potter,The most haunted building in Britain. Yeah I know. What's going on?
Ron Weasley,Probably Neville forgotten the password again.
Neville Longbottom,Hey!.
Ron Weasley,"Oh, you're there."
Percy Weasley,"Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! Get back, all of you. No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched."
Ginny Weasley,The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Ron Weasley,Serves her right. She was a terrible singer.
Hermione Granger,"It's not funny, Ron."
Percy Weasley,"Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. Be quiet."
Albus Dumbledore,Make way.
Percy Weasley,The headmaster's here.
Albus Dumbledore,"Come on, move."
Percy Weasley,You heard. Move!
Albus Dumbledore,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
Argus Filch,"There's no need for ghosts, professor. The Fat Lady's there."
Percy Weasley,Mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy! Come back here!
Albus Dumbledore,Keep moving!
Albus Dumbledore,"Dear lady, who did this to you?"
The Fat Lady,"Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black!"
Albus Dumbledore,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
Argus Filch,"I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery, sir. But there's nothing there."
Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, thank you."
Filius Flitwick,"The third floor's clear too, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,Very good.
Severus Snape,"I've done the dungeons, headmaster. No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle."
Albus Dumbledore,I didn't really expect him to linger.
Severus Snape,"Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... completely undetected?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Quite remarkable, yes."
Severus Snape,Any theories on how he managed it?
Albus Dumbledore,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
Severus Snape,You may recall... prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... about your appointment of Professor...
Albus Dumbledore,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.
Severus Snape,What about Potter? Should he be warned?
Albus Dumbledore,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud."
Severus Snape,Turn to page 394.
Harry Potter,"Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?"
Severus Snape,"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. Turn to page 394."
Ron Weasley,Werewolves?
Hermione Granger,"But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks."
Severus Snape,Quiet.
Ron Weasley,When did she come in? Did you see her come in?
Severus Snape,"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an Animagus and a werewolf? No one? How disappointing."
Hermione Granger,"Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind."
Severus Snape,"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?"
Ron Weasley,"He's got a point, you know."
Severus Snape,"Five points from Gryffindor. As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it."
Harry Potter,"Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow."
Severus Snape,"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term werewolf... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were... which means man, and wolf. Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf..."
Hermione Granger,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
Albus Dumbledore,Arresto momentum!
Ron Weasley,"He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
Fred Weasley,Peaky? What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.
George Weasley,"Yeah, come on Ron, let's walk you off the astronomy tower and see what you look like."
Harry Potter,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
Hermione Granger,How are you feeling?
Harry Potter,"Oh, brilliant."
Fred Weasley,"You gave us a right good scare there, mate."
Harry Potter,What happened?
Ron Weasley,"Well, you fell off your broom."
Harry Potter,Really? I meant the match. Who won?
Hermione Granger,"Umm... no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them off."
Ron Weasley,"There's something else you should know too. When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... Well..."
Remus Lupin,I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. Is there no chance of fixing it?
Harry Potter,"No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? I mean, more than everyone else?"
Remus Lupin,"Listen. Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. The dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of."
Harry Potter,"I'm scared, professor."
Remus Lupin,Well I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
Harry Potter,I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that dementor on the train go away.
Remus Lupin,There was only one that night.
Harry Potter,But you made it go away.
Remus Lupin,"I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest."
Argus Filch,"Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!"
Harry Potter,"Guys, let me go."
Fred Weasley,"Clever, Harry."
George Weasley,"But not clever enough. Besides, we've got a better way."
Harry Potter,I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
Fred Weasley,We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down.
George Weasley,We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down.
Fred Weasley,Oh. Bless him.
Harry Potter,"Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
George Weasley,"Now, Harry."
Fred Weasley,Come and join the big boys.
George Weasley,Come and join the big boys.
Harry Potter,What are you doing?!
Harry Potter,What's this rubbish?
Fred Weasley,What's this rubbish? he says. That there it's the secret to our success.
George Weasley,It's a wrench giving it to you believe me. But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
Fred Weasley,"George, if you will."
George Weasley,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Harry Potter,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
George Weasley,We owe them so much.
Harry Potter,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... No. Is that really...?
Fred Weasley,Dumbledore.
George Weasley,In his study.
Fred Weasley,Pacing.
George Weasley,Does that a lot.
Harry Potter,So you mean this map shows...
Fred Weasley,Everyone.
Harry Potter,Everyone?
George Weasley,Everyone.
Fred Weasley,Where they are.
George Weasley,What they're doing.
Fred Weasley,Every minute.
George Weasley,Of every day.
Harry Potter,Brilliant! Where did you get it?
Fred Weasley,"Knicked it from Filch's office, of course. First year."
George Weasley,"Now listen, there are seven secret passageways... out of the castle. We'd recommend"
Fred Weasley,This one.
George Weasley,This one.
Fred Weasley,The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
George Weasley,It'll lead you straight to Honeyduke's seller.
Fred Weasley,You best hurry. Filch is heading this way.
George Weasley,"Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:"
Fred Weasley,"Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it."
George Weasley,"Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it."
Other,"Now, how much do you want? Delicious."
Hermione Granger,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
Ron Weasley,Twice.
Hermione Granger,Do you want to move a bit closer?
Ron Weasley,To the Shrieking Shack?
Ron Weasley,"Actually, I'm fine here."
Draco Malfoy,"Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in uh... one room?"
Ron Weasley,"Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,"Uh, Not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors."
Hermione Granger,Hope you don't mean yourself!
Draco Malfoy,How dare you talk to me! You filthy little mudblood! Who is that? Don't stand there! Do something!
Vincent Crabbe,What?
Ron Weasley,"What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?"
Draco Malfoy,Get out of the way! Move!
Vincent Crabbe,Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Ron Weasley,"Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny."
Ron Weasley,Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
Hermione Granger,But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
Ron Weasley,Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Hermione Granger,"Oh, Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her."
Ron Weasley,That's not true!
Cornelius Fudge,Professor McGonagall!
Minerva McGonagall,Cornelius!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Allow me, minister."
Cornelius Fudge,"Oh, Hagrid..."
Rubeus Hagrid,Sorry about that.
Cornelius Fudge,"Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good."
Rosmerta,It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... into my pub every other night!
Cornelius Fudge,We have... We have a killer on the loose!
Rosmerta,Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here?
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter.
Rosmerta,Harry Potter?
Cornelius Fudge,Come.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Shrunken head,No underage wizards allowed in today! Shut the damn door!
Hermione Granger,So rude.
Ron Weasley,Thick heads.
Shrunken head,Thick heads?! How dare they! Who are they calling thick heads? Young whippersnappers!
Rosmerta,Nobody's going to come to a pub where they're gonna get scared out of their wits. Why?
Minerva McGonagall,"Professor Dumbledore does not want dementors around the place, I can assure you."
Rosmerta,"Now, tell me what this is all about."
Minerva McGonagall,"Well. Now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... You remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who!"
Cornelius Fudge,"Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!"
Rosmerta,Peter Pettigrew?
Minerva McGonagall,"Yes, little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black."
Rosmerta,"Ah, I remember him. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. But what happened?"
Minerva McGonagall,"Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters... and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black."
Cornelius Fudge,Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else.
Minerva McGonagall,"Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead."
Cornelius Fudge,And now he wants to finish what he started.
Minerva McGonagall,Mhmm.
Rosmerta,I don't believe it.
Cornelius Fudge,"Ah, that's not the worst of it."
Rosmerta,What could be worse?
Minerva McGonagall,This: Sirius Black was... and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!
Hermione Granger,"Ron, look! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Harry, what happened?"
Harry Potter,"He was their friend... and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
Remus Lupin,"Harry. There you are. You came. Are you sure about this, Harry? You know this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level."
Harry Potter,I'm sure.
Remus Lupin,"Well, everything's prepared. Now, the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you ever hear of it? No? Well... A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory."
Remus Lupin,"Can you do this? Yes. Very well. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Explore your past. Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up. Lose yourself within it. Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum."
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum.
Remus Lupin,Very good. Shall we? Wand at the ready.
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect...
Remus Lupin,"Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better."
Harry Potter,That's one nasty dementor.
Remus Lupin,"Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?"
Harry Potter,The first time I rode a broom.
Remus Lupin,That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.
Harry Potter,"There's another. It's not... happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt... but it's complicated."
Remus Lupin,Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
Harry Potter,Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!
Remus Lupin,"Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!"
Harry Potter,I think I've had enough for today.
Remus Lupin,"Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something."
Harry Potter,I was thinking of him. And Mom. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real. But it's the best I have.
Hermione Granger,Beautiful day.
Ron Weasley,Gorgeous.
Ron Weasley,Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!
Harry Potter,Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
Hermione Granger,Ronald has lost his rat.
Ron Weasley,I haven't lost anything! Your cat killed him!
Hermione Granger,Rubbish.
Ron Weasley,"Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone."
Hermione Granger,"Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!"
Ron Weasley,Your cat killed him!
Hermione Granger,Did not.
Ron Weasley,Did.
Hermione Granger,Didn't.
Hermione Granger,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, first off, the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there. And then I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you."
Hermione Granger,And then?
Rubeus Hagrid,"And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius."
Harry Potter,They're not sacking you!
Rubeus Hagrid,"No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!"
Ron Weasley,Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. I don't wanna tap-dance!
Harry Potter,You tell those spiders Ron.
Ron Weasley,"Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them..."
Rosmerta,Peter Pettigrew?
Minerva McGonagall,Little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black.
Cornelius Fudge,"Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!"
Ghost,Put that light out!
Harry Potter,Sorry.
Ghost,"Watch it there, boy."
Ghost,We're trying to sleep here!
Ghost,"Yes, we are."
Harry Potter,Mischief managed. Nox.
Severus Snape,Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
Harry Potter,I was sleepwalking.
Severus Snape,"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
Harry Potter,"My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
Severus Snape,Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets! What's this?
Harry Potter,Spare bit of parchment.
Severus Snape,Really? Open it. Reveal your secrets. Read it.
Harry Potter,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Severus Snape,Go on.
Harry Potter,And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.
Severus Snape,"Why, you insolent little..."
Remus Lupin,Professor!
Severus Snape,"Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk... in the moonlight, are we?"
Remus Lupin,"Harry, are you alright?"
Severus Snape,"That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
Remus Lupin,"Oh, I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night."
Ghost,Are you deaf? Put that light out!
Remus Lupin,"Come in. I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... is a map to you?"
Harry Potter,"No. No, sir."
Remus Lupin,"Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?"
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
Remus Lupin,"I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know."
Harry Potter,"Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead."
Remus Lupin,"Oh, really? And who might that be?"
Harry Potter,Peter Pettigrew.
Remus Lupin,That's not possible.
Harry Potter,"It's just what I saw. Good night, professor."
Sybill Trelawney,"Broaden your minds. You must look beyond. The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then can you see. Try again. Now, what do we have here?"
Hermione Granger,"Oh, do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly."
Sybill Trelawney,"My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... to which you so desperately cleave. Have I said something?"
Ron Weasley,"She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see."
Harry Potter,Hang on. We better take this back.
Ron Weasley,I'm not going back.
Harry Potter,Fine. See you later.
Ron Weasley,See you.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter...
Harry Potter,Professor Trelawney...
Sybill Trelawney,He will return tonight.
Harry Potter,Sorry?
Sybill Trelawney,"Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder... shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt... and servant and master shall be reunited once more. I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?"
Harry Potter,No. Nothing.
Hermione Granger,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
Ron Weasley,It just got worse.
Draco Malfoy,Now I'll tell you. Father said... I can keep the hippogriff's head. I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. This is going to be rich. Look who's here. Come to see the show?
Hermione Granger,"You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
Ron Weasley,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
Vincent Crabbe,"Malfoy, are you okay? Let's go. Quick."
Draco Malfoy,"Not a word to anyone, understood?"
Hermione Granger,That felt good.
Ron Weasley,"Not good, brilliant!"
Rubeus Hagrid,Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Harry Potter,Why don't we just set him free?
Rubeus Hagrid,"They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... would get into trouble. He's coming down, you know? Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... When it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. A great man."
Hermione Granger,"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid."
Rubeus Hagrid,"You'll do no such thing! Think I want you seeing something like that? No. You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron..."
Ron Weasley,Scabbers! You're alive!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron."
Hermione Granger,I think that means you owe someone an apology.
Ron Weasley,"Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know."
Hermione Granger,I meant me!
Rubeus Hagrid,Blimey! What was that?
Harry Potter,Ow! Hagrid!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, crikey."
Cornelius Fudge,Very interesting.
Albus Dumbledore,"No, minister. Over this way."
Rubeus Hagrid,"It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside the castle at this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick!"
Harry Potter,Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Go on, go on!"
Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, that's the... lings you see over there..."
Cornelius Fudge,On the slope.
Albus Dumbledore,"On the slope... Ah, Hagrid."
Rubeus Hagrid,Professor Dumbledore.
Cornelius Fudge,Good evening.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Minister. Just make your way through. Have a tea, if you like."
Cornelius Fudge,"No, Hagrid, thank you. Now gentlemen..."
Albus Dumbledore,I'd like to have a cup of tea.
Cornelius Fudge,"Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereinafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Dear, dear..."
Albus Dumbledore,"Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. All right. It'll be all right."
Cornelius Fudge,The execution shall dispatch...
Harry Potter,What?
Hermione Granger,I thought I just saw... Never mind.
Ron Weasley,Let's go!
Rubeus Hagrid,Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Ron Weasley,"Oh, no."
Ron Weasley,He bit me! Scabbers!
Hermione Granger,Ron. Ron! Ron!
Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, come back!"
Harry Potter,Wait!
Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, you bit me!"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?"
Harry Potter,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
Ron Weasley,"Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! Harry!"
Hermione Granger,"Ron! Ron, wait! Harry!"
Ron Weasley,Help!
Harry Potter,Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Come on! Move!
Hermione Granger,Duck!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Hermione Granger,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Harry Potter,Don't worry.
Hermione Granger,Where do you suppose this goes?
Harry Potter,I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong.
Hermione Granger,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
Harry Potter,Come on. Ron.
Hermione Granger,Ron. You're okay. The dog. Where is it?
Ron Weasley,Harry it's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.
Hermione Granger,"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!"
Sirius Black,No. Only one will die tonight.
Harry Potter,Then it'll be you!
Sirius Black,"Are you going to kill me, Harry?"
Remus Lupin,"Expelliarmus! Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within."
Sirius Black,"Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you Remus? I found him."
Remus Lupin,I know.
Sirius Black,It's him.
Remus Lupin,I understand.
Sirius Black,Let's kill him!
Hermione Granger,"No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes."
Remus Lupin,How long have you known?
Hermione Granger,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
Remus Lupin,"Well, well, well, Hermione. You really are the brightest witch of your age, I've ever met."
Sirius Black,"Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!"
Remus Lupin,Wait!
Sirius Black,I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!
Remus Lupin,Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.
Harry Potter,I know why. You betrayed my parents. You're the reason they're dead!
Remus Lupin,"No, Harry it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!"
Harry Potter,"Who was it, then?"
Sirius Black,"Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!"
Severus Snape,Expelliarmus! Vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Sirius Black,Severus...
Severus Snape,"I told Dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle, and now here's the proof."
Sirius Black,"Brilliant, Snape. Once again you've put your keen penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion. Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business... to attend to."
Severus Snape,Give me a reason. I beg you!
Remus Lupin,Severus don't be a fool.
Sirius Black,He can't help it. It's habit.
Remus Lupin,Sirius be quiet.
Sirius Black,Be quiet yourself Remus!
Severus Snape,"Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple."
Sirius Black,Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!
Severus Snape,"I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best."
Remus Lupin,"Severus, please."
Severus Snape,After you.
Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Ron Weasley,Harry! What did you just do?
Hermione Granger,You attacked a teacher!
Harry Potter,Tell me about Peter.
Remus Lupin,He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend!
Harry Potter,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
Remus Lupin,"No, he didn't. I thought so too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the map!"
Harry Potter,"The map was lying, then."
Sirius Black,The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!
Ron Weasley,Me?! He's mental!
Sirius Black,Not you! Your rat!
Ron Weasley,Scabbers has been in my family for...
Sirius Black,"Twelve years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! He's missing a toe, isn't he?"
Ron Weasley,So what?
Harry Potter,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
Sirius Black,Finger! That dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! And then he transformed into a rat!
Harry Potter,"Show me. Give it to him, Ron."
Ron Weasley,What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?
Peter Pettigrew,Remus? Sirius. My old friends! Harry! Look at you! You look so much like your father! Like James! We were the best of friends...
Sirius Black,How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him!
Remus Lupin,"You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?"
Peter Pettigrew,"I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? What would you have done?"
Sirius Black,"I would have died! I would have died, rather than betray my friends!"
Peter Pettigrew,"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad... Your dad would have spared me! He would show me mercy!"
Remus Lupin,"You should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! Together!"
Harry Potter,No!
Remus Lupin,"Harry, this man..."
Harry Potter,I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.
Peter Pettigrew,"Bless you, boy! Bless you!"
Harry Potter,"Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you."
Sirius Black,Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit.
Ron Weasley,A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
Sirius Black,"I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. In fact, more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder."
Harry Potter,Okay.
Ron Weasley,You better go.
Harry Potter,"No. Don't worry, okay? It's fine. I'll stay."
Hermione Granger,"You go, I'll stay."
Harry Potter,You okay?
Ron Weasley,I'm fine. Go.
Hermione Granger,That looks really painful.
Ron Weasley,So painful. They might chop it.
Hermione Granger,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
Ron Weasley,It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.
Sirius Black,"It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it."
Harry Potter,"Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free."
Peter Pettigrew,"Turn me into a maggot! Turn me into a flobberworm! Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them..."
Remus Lupin,Get away from her!
Sirius Black,"I don't know if you know, Harry... but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather."
Harry Potter,I know.
Sirius Black,I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... but if you ever wanted a different home...
Harry Potter,What? Come and live with you?
Sirius Black,It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Sirius Black,"Remus, my old friend! Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart here! This flesh is only flesh!"
Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Sirius Black,Remus! Remus! Run! Run!
Harry Potter,Come on.
Hermione Granger,Wait! Wait!
Ron Weasley,Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
Hermione Granger,Professor? Professor Lupin?
Ron Weasley,Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
Severus Snape,"There you are, Potter!"
Harry Potter,Sirius!
Severus Snape,"Come back here, Potter!"
Harry Potter,Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum!
Hermione Granger,Harry?
Harry Potter,I saw my dad.
Hermione Granger,What?
Harry Potter,He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake.
Hermione Granger,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss."
Harry Potter,You mean they're gonna kill him?
Hermione Granger,"No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man."
Harry Potter,It's true. Sirius is innocent.
Ron Weasley,It's Scabbers who did it.
Albus Dumbledore,Scabbers?
Ron Weasley,"He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. But then they gave him an owl..."
Hermione Granger,"The point is, we know the truth. Please believe us."
Albus Dumbledore,"I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck."
Ron Weasley,What the bloody hell was that all about?
Hermione Granger,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk..."
Harry Potter,What just happened? Where's Ron?
Hermione Granger,7:30. Where were we at 7:30?
Harry Potter,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Hermione Granger,Come on. And we can't be seen.
Harry Potter,"Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
Hermione Granger,"You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
Harry Potter,That's us.
Ron Weasley,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
Harry Potter,This is not normal.
Hermione Granger,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year."
Harry Potter,You mean we've gone back in time?
Hermione Granger,"Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change."
Harry Potter,Good punch.
Hermione Granger,Thanks. Malfoy's coming.
Vincent Crabbe,Run.
Draco Malfoy,"Not a word to anyone, understood? I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words."
Hermione Granger,That felt good.
Ron Weasley,"Not good, brilliant."
Harry Potter,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Harry Potter,Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
Hermione Granger,"Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go."
Harry Potter,Here they come. I'd better hurry.
Hermione Granger,"Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free."
Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, you're alive!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Keep a closer eye on your pet, Ron."
Harry Potter,That's Pettigrew.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you can't."
Harry Potter,He betrayed my parents. You don't expect me to sit here.
Hermione Granger,"Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen."
Hermione Granger,Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving?
Harry Potter,Are you mad?
Harry Potter,Ow!
Harry Potter,Ow! That hurt!
Hermione Granger,Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go!
Hermione Granger,Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
Harry Potter,What?
Hermione Granger,I thought I just saw... Never mind.
Ron Weasley,Let's go.
Hermione Granger,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
Harry Potter,Get away. Get off.
Albus Dumbledore,"Minister, I really think I should sign as well."
Cornelius Fudge,"Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be..."
Hermione Granger,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on."
Hermione Granger,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
Cornelius Fudge,Your name only.
Albus Dumbledore,It's such a very long name...
Hermione Granger,"Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky."
Albus Dumbledore,"Here we are, minister. Follow me. Now, look there."
Cornelius Fudge,Where?
Albus Dumbledore,Look beyond the rocks.
Cornelius Fudge,What am I supposed to see?
Albus Dumbledore,Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
Cornelius Fudge,"Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed."
Albus Dumbledore,"And all the strawberries, you see?."
Hermione Granger,"Come on, Buckbeak. Come on."
Cornelius Fudge,I see no strawberries.
Albus Dumbledore,Over there.
Cornelius Fudge,Where?
Albus Dumbledore,Over there.
Harry Potter,This way.
Cornelius Fudge,"Let's get this over, please."
Albus Dumbledore,All right.
Cornelius Fudge,"But where is it? I saw the beast, just now. Not a moment ago!"
Albus Dumbledore,How extraordinary.
Rubeus Hagrid,Buckbeak.
Cornelius Fudge,"Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him."
Cornelius Fudge,Hagrid?
Hermione Granger,Buckbeak.
Albus Dumbledore,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time.
Cornelius Fudge,"Right. Well, well. We must search the grounds."
Albus Dumbledore,"Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you."
Rubeus Hagrid,"You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor."
Harry Potter,"Come on. This way. This way, now. Now what?"
Hermione Granger,We save Sirius.
Harry Potter,How?
Hermione Granger,No idea. Look. It's Lupin.
Remus Lupin,Immobulus!
Hermione Granger,And Snape's coming.
Harry Potter,And now we wait.
Hermione Granger,And now we wait.
Hermione Granger,At least someone's enjoying himself.
Harry Potter,Yeah. Hermione?
Hermione Granger,Yeah?
Harry Potter,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away."
Hermione Granger,With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
Harry Potter,It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, but your dad's... Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw."
Hermione Granger,Here we come.
Harry Potter,You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him.
Hermione Granger,That's great.
Harry Potter,"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban."
Hermione Granger,Harry! Run!
Harry Potter,Let's go! What are you doing?
Hermione Granger,Saving your life!
Harry Potter,Thanks. Great! Now he's coming for us.
Hermione Granger,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"
Hermione Granger,That was so scary.
Harry Potter,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius! Come on!
Hermione Granger,This is horrible.
Harry Potter,Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now! Right there! You'll see!
Hermione Granger,"Harry, listen to me. No one's coming."
Harry Potter,"Don't worry, he will! He will come! Sirius."
Hermione Granger,You're dying... both of you. Harry!
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
Harry Potter,"You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... well, I had already done it. Does that make sense?"
Hermione Granger,No.
Hermione Granger,But I don't like flying...!
Hermione Granger,Bombarda!
Sirius Black,I'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you.
Harry Potter,I want to go with you.
Sirius Black,"One day, perhaps. For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. And besides... you're meant to be here."
Harry Potter,But you're innocent.
Sirius Black,"And you know it. And for now, that will do. I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father. Except your eyes. You have..."
Harry Potter,My mother's eyes.
Sirius Black,"It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us. And you can always find them... in here. You really are the brightest witch of your age."
Hermione Granger,We have to go.
Albus Dumbledore,Well?
Harry Potter,He's free. We did it.
Albus Dumbledore,Did what? Good night.
Ron Weasley,How did you get there? I was talking to you there. And now you're there.
Hermione Granger,"What's he talking about, Harry?"
Harry Potter,"I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
Remus Lupin,"Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me."
Harry Potter,You've been sacked.
Remus Lupin,"No. No. I resigned, actually."
Harry Potter,Resigned? Why?
Remus Lupin,"Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well, someone like me teaching their children."
Harry Potter,But Dumbledore...
Remus Lupin,"Dumbledore has already... risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are... Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now."
Remus Lupin,"Why do you look so miserable, Harry?"
Harry Potter,None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.
Remus Lupin,"Didn't make any difference? Harry it made all the difference in the world. You have uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief managed."
Ron Weasley,"Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle."
Neville Longbottom,Harry. Wherever did you get it?
Seamus Finnigan,"Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course."
Harry Potter,What are you talking about?
Ron Weasley,"Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it."
Fred Weasley,Did not.
George Weasley,Did not.
Students,It's a Firebolt. It's the fastest broom in the world.
Harry Potter,For me? But who sent it?
Ron Weasley,No one knows.
Hermione Granger,This came with it.
Neville Longbottom,"Go on, Harry!"
Seamus Finnigan,"Yeah, let's see."
Hermione Granger,"How fast is it, Harry?"
Old man,Bloody kids.
Peter Pettigrew,Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy..
Voldemort,"NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say."
Bartemius Crouch Junior,I will not disappoint you my lord.
Voldemort,"Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign."
Voldemort,Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
Voldemort,Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Hermione Granger,Are you alright?
Harry Potter,Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?
Hermione Granger,Just now. You?
Harry Potter,Last night.
Hermione Granger,Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell.
Hermione Granger,"Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready."
Harry Potter,Where are we actually going?
Ron Weasley,Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
Arthur Weasley,"Haven't the foggiest, keep up!"
Amos Diggory,Arthur! It's about time son.
Arthur Weasley,"Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?"
Cedric Diggory,Yes sir.
Amos Diggory,"Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter."
Harry Potter,Yes sir. This way.
Amos Diggory,Great great pleasure.
Harry Potter,Pleasure to meet you too sir.
Arthur Weasley,"That's it sir, just over there."
Amos Diggory,Shall we? We don't want to be late.
Harry Potter,Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
Fred Weasley,That isn't just any old manky boot mate.
George Weasley,It's a portkey.
Amos Diggory,Time to go. Ready?
Harry Potter,What's a 'portkey'?
Amos Diggory,After 3. One... Two...
Arthur Weasley,Harry!
Amos Diggory,Three!
Arthur Weasley,Let go kids!
Hermione Granger,What??
Arthur Weasley,Let! Go!
Arthur Weasley,I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Arthur Weasley,"Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!"
Amos Diggory,"Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match."
Harry Potter,See ya later Cedric.
Arthur Weasley,Home sweet home.
Arthur Weasley,"Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry."
Fred Weasley,Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
George Weasley,Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
Arthur Weasley,Feet off the table.
Fred Weasley,Feet off the table.
George Weasley,Feet off the table.
Harry Potter,I love magic.
Ron Weasley,"Blimey Dad, how far up are we?"
Lucius Malfoy,"Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know"
Draco Malfoy,"Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself."
Lucius Malfoy,Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can.
Arthur Weasley,"Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for."
George Weasley,Come on!
Fred Weasley,It's the Irish!
George Weasley,Here come the Bulgarians!
Fred Weasley,Krum!!!
George Weasley,Krum!!!
Ron Weasley,Krum!!!
George Weasley,Yes!
Announcer,Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin!
Ron Weasley,"There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist."
Ginny Weasley,Think you're in love Ron?
Fred Weasley,Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!
George Weasley,Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!
Fred Weasley,When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
George Weasley,When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
Harry Potter,When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
Fred Weasley,Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.
Arthur Weasley,Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.
Arthur Weasley,"Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility."
Ron Weasley,Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
Harry Potter,What is that?
Arthur Weasley,Stop! That's my son.
Arthur Weasley,"Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?"
Bartemius Crouch,Which of you conjured this?
Arthur Weasley,You can't possibly..
Bartemius Crouch,Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!
Harry Potter,Crime?
Arthur Weasley,"Barty, they're just kids."
Harry Potter,What crime?
Hermione Granger,Harry it's his mark.
Harry Potter,"Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers."
Bartemius Crouch,Follow me.
Harry Potter,There was a man. Before. There.
Bartemius Crouch,"All of you, this way."
Arthur Weasley,"Harry, who?"
Harry Potter,I dunno. I didn't see his face.
Trolley witch,Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?
Trolley witch,Anything from the trolley dears?
Ron Weasley,Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
Ron Weasley,"On second thought, just the drewbals."
Harry Potter,It's alright I'll get it.
Ron Weasley,"Just the drewbals, thanks."
Cho Chang,Two pumpkin pasties please.
Cho Chang,Thank you.
Trolley witch,Anything sweet for you dear?
Harry Potter,Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
Hermione Granger,"This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?"
Ron Weasley,"Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses."
Hermione Granger,"It's hurting again isn't it, your scar."
Harry Potter,I'm fine.
Hermione Granger,"You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream."
Rubeus Hagrid,Clear the runway.
Harry Potter,Well there's something you don't see every day.
Albus Dumbledore,"Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen..."
Albus Dumbledore,"So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime."
Student,"Blimey, that's one big woman."
Albus Dumbledore,"And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff."
Ron Weasley,"Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!"
Igor Karkaroff,Albus!
Albus Dumbledore,Igor.
Olympe Maxime,"Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to."
Albus Dumbledore,"Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them."
Olympe Maxime,"But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey."
Filius Flitwick,You idiot!
Albus Dumbledore,"Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks."
Fred Weasley,Wicked.
Albus Dumbledore,For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.
Ron Weasley,"Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody."
Hermione Granger,Alastor Moody? The aura.
Ron Weasley,He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
Albus Dumbledore,"My dear old friend, thanks for coming."
Alastor Moody,That stupid roof.
Seamus Finnigan,What's that he's drinking do you suppose?
Harry Potter,I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
Bartemius Crouch,After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.
George Weasley,That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
Albus Dumbledore,Silence!
Albus Dumbledore,"The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun."
Alastor Moody,Alastor Moody.
Alastor Moody,"Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?"
Hermione Granger,Three sir.
Alastor Moody,And they are so named?
Hermione Granger,Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...
Alastor Moody,"Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!"
Seamus Finnigan,"Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head."
Alastor Moody,"So, which curse shall we see first?"
Ron Weasley,Yes...
Alastor Moody,Give us a curse.
Ron Weasley,"Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse."
Alastor Moody,"Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why."
Alastor Moody,Hello. What a little beauty.
Alastor Moody,Don't worry. Completely harmless.
Alastor Moody,But if she bites... she's lethal!
Alastor Moody,What are you laughing at?
Alastor Moody,Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself?
Alastor Moody,"Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up."
Alastor Moody,Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.
Neville Longbottom,There's the um... The cruciatus curse.
Alastor Moody,Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse.
Hermione Granger,"Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!"
Alastor Moody,Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger.
Alastor Moody,The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room.
Ron Weasley,"Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know."
Hermione Granger,"There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face."
Hermione Granger,Neville?
Alastor Moody,Son. You alright?
Alastor Moody,"Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something."
Ron Weasley,"Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen."
Harry Potter,Yeah well rather you than me.
George Weasley,"Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it."
Fred Weasley,Cooked it up just this morning.
Hermione Granger,It's not going to work.
Fred Weasley,Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
Hermione Granger,You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
Fred Weasley,So?
Hermione Granger,So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
George Weasley,That's why it's so brilliant.
George Weasley,Ready Fred?
Fred Weasley,Ready George?
George Weasley,You said..
Albus Dumbledore,"Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!"
Albus Dumbledore,The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!
Albus Dumbledore,The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
Albus Dumbledore,The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.
Albus Dumbledore,"Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter. Harry Potter?
Rubeus Hagrid,No... No.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter!
Hermione Granger,Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
Student,He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
Harry Potter,No sir.
Albus Dumbledore,Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
Harry Potter,No sir.
Albus Dumbledore,You're absolutely sure?
Harry Potter,Yes sir.
Olympe Maxime,Well of course he is lying.
Alastor Moody,"The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year."
Igor Karkaroff,You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.
Alastor Moody,It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?
Albus Dumbledore,That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.
Bartemius Crouch,"The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion."
Minerva McGonagall,"This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?"
Albus Dumbledore,What do you suggest Minerva?
Minerva McGonagall,Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
Albus Dumbledore,You heard Barty the rules are clear.
Minerva McGonagall,Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them...
Severus Snape,"Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold."
Minerva McGonagall,Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
Albus Dumbledore,"I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?"
Alastor Moody,I can do that.
Albus Dumbledore,"Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are."
Ron Weasley,How did you do it?
Ron Weasley,Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
Harry Potter,Let you know what?
Ron Weasley,You know bloody well what.
Harry Potter,I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.
Ron Weasley,"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend."
Harry Potter,"I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok."
Ron Weasley,Piss off.
Rita Skeeter,What a charismatic quartet. Hello!
Rita Skeeter,"I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely."
Rita Skeeter,This is cosy.
Harry Potter,It's a broomcupboard.
Rita Skeeter,You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?
Harry Potter,"Oh, no."
Rita Skeeter,"So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve.."
Harry Potter,I'm fourteen.
Rita Skeeter,...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?
Harry Potter,I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
Rita Skeeter,Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you...
Harry Potter,Fourteen.
Rita Skeeter,The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.
Harry Potter,No I didn't enter.
Rita Skeeter,"Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry.  Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish."
Harry Potter,"Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past."
Sirius Black,Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S....
Sirius Black,The bird bites.
Harry Potter,Sirius?
Rita Skeeter,"Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his..."
Harry Potter,Sirius?! How...
Sirius Black,I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?
Harry Potter,No!
Sirius Black,"Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?"
Harry Potter,I dunno.
Sirius Black,You didn't hear a name?
Harry Potter,No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
Sirius Black,What was that?
Harry Potter,"He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?"
Sirius Black,"Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more."
Harry Potter,What are you saying?
Sirius Black,"I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban."
Harry Potter,Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
Sirius Black,I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
Harry Potter,I'm not ready for this Sirius.
Sirius Black,You don't have a choice.
Harry Potter,Someone's coming!
Sirius Black,Keep your friends close Harry.
Ron Weasley,Who you talking to?
Harry Potter,Who says I was talking to anyone.
Ron Weasley,I heard voices.
Harry Potter,"Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time."
Ron Weasley,You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
Neville Longbottom,Amazing. Amazing.
Harry Potter,Neville! You're doing it again!
Neville Longbottom,"Oh, right sorry."
Harry Potter,Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
Neville Longbottom,Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
Hermione Granger,We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?
Hermione Granger,Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.
Harry Potter,Is that right? Well.... what?
Hermione Granger,Uhhh...
Hermione Granger,Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
Harry Potter,Well you can tell Ronald...
Hermione Granger,I'm NOT an owl!
Rubeus Hagrid,Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?
Harry Potter,Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
Rubeus Hagrid,You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important.
Harry Potter,What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
Rubeus Hagrid,As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again.
Olympe Maxime,Hagrid?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on."
Rubeus Hagrid,Bonsoir Olympe.
Olympe Maxime,"Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me."
Rubeus Hagrid,Couldn't forget you Olympe.
Olympe Maxime,What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.
Rubeus Hagrid,You'll be glad you came. Trust me.
Olympe Maxime,"Ahh, c'est magnifique!"
Olympe Maxime,Can we get closer?
Harry Potter,Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.
Rubeus Hagrid,Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know."
Harry Potter,Ron was here?
Rubeus Hagrid,Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?
Harry Potter,No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.
Student,Cedric rules!
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Student,Like the badge?
Harry Potter,Excuse me..
Harry Potter,Can I have a word?
Cedric Diggory,Alright.
Harry Potter,Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.
Cedric Diggory,"Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?"
Harry Potter,Yes.
Cedric Diggory,"Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them."
Harry Potter,Don't worry about it.
Harry Potter,You're a right foul git you know that?
Ron Weasley,You think so?
Harry Potter,I know so.
Ron Weasley,Anything else?
Harry Potter,Yeah. Stay away from me.
Ron Weasley,Fine.
Draco Malfoy,Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
Harry Potter,"I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic."
Alastor Moody,I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned.
Minerva McGonagall,Professor Moody what are you doing?
Alastor Moody,Teaching.
Minerva McGonagall,Is that a student?
Alastor Moody,Technically it's a ferret.
Draco Malfoy,My father will hear about this!
Alastor Moody,Is that a threat!
Alastor Moody,I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here!
Minerva McGonagall,"We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that."
Alastor Moody,He might've mentioned it.
Minerva McGonagall,Well you will do well to remember it.
Alastor Moody,come with me.
Alastor Moody,That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me.
Alastor Moody,Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?
Harry Potter,Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...
Alastor Moody,"Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths?"
Harry Potter,Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.
Alastor Moody,Better than fair the way I heard it.
Harry Potter,But I'm not allowed a broom.
Alastor Moody,You're allowed a wand.
Hermione Granger,Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Hermione Granger,How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
Harry Potter,Battle a dragon.
Rita Skeeter,Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page.
Viktor Krum,You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends.
Rita Skeeter,No matter. We've got what we wanted.
Albus Dumbledore,"Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate."
Albus Dumbledore,What are you doing here Miss Granger?
Hermione Granger,Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
Albus Dumbledore,Barty. The bag.
Bartemius Crouch,"Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will..."
Bartemius Crouch,The welsh green. Mr Krum...
Bartemius Crouch,The chinese fireball. Oooooh.
Bartemius Crouch,The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...
Harry Potter,The horntail...
Bartemius Crouch,What's that boy?
Harry Potter,Nothing.
Bartemius Crouch,"The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?"
Albus Dumbledore,Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...
Albus Dumbledore,Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant.
Hermione Granger,Your wand harry! Your wand!
George Weasley,We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
Fred Weasley,Lose a leg.
George Weasley,Or an arm.
Fred Weasley,Pack it in altogether.
Seamus Finnigan,"Go on Harry, what's the clue?"
Harry Potter,Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
Harry Potter,What the bloody hell was that?
Fred Weasley,"Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in."
Ron Weasley,I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
Harry Potter,Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
Ron Weasley,Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.
Harry Potter,Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
Ron Weasley,At least I warned you about the dragons.
Harry Potter,Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
Ron Weasley,"Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out."
Harry Potter,Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.
Ron Weasley,Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
Hermione Granger,Boys.
Hermione Granger,Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
Nigel Wolpert,Parcel for you Mr Weasley.
Ron Weasley,Thank you Nigel.
Ron Weasley,Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
Ron Weasley,I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
Harry Potter,Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
Ron Weasley,Ginny these must be for you.
Ginny Weasley,I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
Ron Weasley,What are you on about?
Hermione Granger,They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.
Ron Weasley,Dress robes? for what?
Minerva McGonagall,"The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance."
Minerva McGonagall,"Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons."
Fred Weasley,Try saying that five times faster.
Minerva McGonagall,"Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight."
Ron Weasley,Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.
Minerva McGonagall,"Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me."
Minerva McGonagall,"Now, place your right hand on my waist."
Ron Weasley,Where?
Minerva McGonagall,My waist.
Minerva McGonagall,Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...
Minerva McGonagall,"One two three, one two three, one two three."
Harry Potter,Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?
Fred Weasley,Never.
George Weasley,Never.
Minerva McGonagall,Everybody come together.
Minerva McGonagall,"Boys, on your feet."
Harry Potter,Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
Ron Weasley,"Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?"
Harry Potter,I think I'd take the dragon right now.
Rubeus Hagrid,"I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser."
Rubeus Hagrid,"And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!"
Ron Weasley,This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
Ron Weasley,"Well, us and Neville!"
Harry Potter,But then again he can take himself.
Hermione Granger,It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
Ron Weasley,Now I'm really depressed.
Ron Weasley,"Well Hermione, you're a girl."
Hermione Granger,Oh well spotted.
Ron Weasley,Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
Hermione Granger,I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell.
Ron Weasley,"Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?"
Harry Potter,Agreed.
Cho Chang,Harry!
Harry Potter,Cho!
Cho Chang,"Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top."
Harry Potter,Ok thanks. Cho?
Cho Chang,Yes?
Harry Potter,Um.  I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
Cho Chang,Sorry? I didn't catch that.
Harry Potter,Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Cho Chang,Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him.
Harry Potter,Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.
Cho Chang,Harry I really am sorry.
Harry Potter,What happened to you?
Student,He just asked Fleur Delacour out.
Hermione Granger,What?
Harry Potter,What did she say?
Hermione Granger,No of course.
Hermione Granger,She said yes??
Harry Potter,Don't be silly.
Ron Weasley,"There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out."
Student,"Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening."
Harry Potter,What did you do then?
Ron Weasley,What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.
Parvati Patil,Hi Harry.
Padma Patil,Hi Harry.
Harry Potter,Hey!
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell.
Ron Weasley,What are those??
Harry Potter,My dress robes.
Ron Weasley,"Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar."
Harry Potter,Well I expect yours are more traditional.
Ron Weasley,Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
Ron Weasley,I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
Harry Potter,Leave it alone.
Ron Weasley,"Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out."
Harry Potter,Who?
Ron Weasley,"Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?"
Harry Potter,Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
Ron Weasley,Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
Parvati Patil,Hello boys. Don't you look...
Parvati Patil,... dashing.
Minerva McGonagall,Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
Harry Potter,Ready professor?
Minerva McGonagall,To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.
Harry Potter,No.
Minerva McGonagall,"Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil."
Parvati Patil,She looks beautiful.
Harry Potter,Yeah she does.
Padma Patil,Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum??
Ron Weasley,No. Absolutely not.
Parvati Patil,Harry. Take my waist.
Harry Potter,What?
Parvati Patil,Now.
Hermione Granger,Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
Ron Weasley,"No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor."
Hermione Granger,What's got your wand in a knot?
Ron Weasley,He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
Hermione Granger,"The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends."
Ron Weasley,"Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind."
Padma Patil,Are you going to ask me to dance or not?
Ron Weasley,No.
Ron Weasley,He's using you.
Hermione Granger,How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
Ron Weasley,Doubt it. He's way too old.
Hermione Granger,What? What? That's what you think?
Ron Weasley,Yeah that is what I think.
Hermione Granger,You know the solution then don't you.
Ron Weasley,Go on.
Hermione Granger,"Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort."
Ron Weasley,Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
Hermione Granger,Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
Ron Weasley,They get scary when they get older.
Hermione Granger,Ron you spoil everything!
Voldermort,Let me see it again.
Voldemort,"Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!"
Neville Longbottom,You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!
Hermione Granger,Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
Harry Potter,Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
Hermione Granger,"I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?"
Harry Potter,What's that supposed to mean?
Hermione Granger,"I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time."
Cedric Diggory,Hey Potter.
Harry Potter,Cedric.
Cedric Diggory,How are you?
Harry Potter,Spectacular.
Cedric Diggory,Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
Harry Potter,Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
Cedric Diggory,Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
Cedric Diggory,It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water.
Harry Potter,I must be out of my mind.
Moaning Myrtle,I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
Harry Potter,Myrtle!
Moaning Myrtle,Long time no see.
Moaning Myrtle,I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry?
Harry Potter,"Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?"
Moaning Myrtle,"Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one. Cedric."
Moaning Myrtle,"Well go on, open it."
Merpeople,"Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took."
Harry Potter,"Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?"
Moaning Myrtle,"Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone..."
Hermione Granger,"Harry, tell me again."
Harry Potter,Come seek us where our voices sound.
Hermione Granger,"The black lake, that's obvious."
Harry Potter,An hour long you'll have to look.
Hermione Granger,"Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic"
Harry Potter,Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
Hermione Granger,"Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out."
Alastor Moody,"Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger."
Hermione Granger,"But sir, the second task is only hours away and..."
Alastor Moody,Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
Alastor Moody,Why don't you help Potter put his books back.
Neville Longbottom,"You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?"
Harry Potter,"Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great."
Neville Longbottom,I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.
Harry Potter,You're sure about this Neville.
Neville Longbottom,Absolutely.
Harry Potter,For an hour.
Neville Longbottom,Most likely.
Harry Potter,Most likely?
Neville Longbottom,Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.
Harry Potter,You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
Neville Longbottom,I just wanted to help.
Harry Potter,Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?
Neville Longbottom,You seem a little tense Harry.
Harry Potter,Do I?
Albus Dumbledore,"Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own."
Alastor Moody,Put that in your mouth.
Albus Dumbledore,You may begin at the start of the cannon.
Seamus Finnigan,What's the matter with him?
Dean Thomas,I don't know I can't see him.
Neville Longbottom,Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!
Albus Dumbledore,The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.
Harry Potter,But she's my friend too!
Merpeople,Only one.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry!
Bartemius Crouch,Get him another towel.
Albus Dumbledore,I want all the judges over here now.
Fleur Delacour,"You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!"
Fleur Delacour,Thank you! And you... . You helped!
Ron Weasley,Well... yeah... a bit
Ron Weasley,Merci.
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Harry Potter,Hermione
Hermione Granger,Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.
Harry Potter,I finished last Hermione.
Hermione Granger,Next to last.
Albus Dumbledore,Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!
Albus Dumbledore,"For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre."
Fred Weasley,All that moral fibre eh?
Ron Weasley,Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
George Weasley,Well done 'moral fibre'.
Bartemius Crouch,"Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter."
Alastor Moody,Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!
Alastor Moody,And they say I'm mad.
Rubeus Hagrid,"So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later."
Ron Weasley,We're still misfits.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!"
Harry Potter,Mr Crouch?
Albus Dumbledore,"A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action."
Cornelius Fudge,I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore,Then for once show them some.
Cornelius Fudge,The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.
Albus Dumbledore,"But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think."
Cornelius Fudge,What did you say? What did you say to me?
Alastor Moody,"Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private."
Cornelius Fudge,Harry! Harry how good to see you again.
Harry Potter,I can come back later Professor.
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp."
Harry Potter,Agh!
Harry Potter,Professor?
Bartemius Crouch,"Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms?"
Igor Karkaroff,I do sir.
Bartemius Crouch,What do you wish to present?
Igor Karkaroff,"I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier."
Bartemius Crouch,Mr Rosier is dead.
Igor Karkaroff,Dead?
Alastor Moody,Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he.
Igor Karkaroff,I didn't know.
Bartemius Crouch,If that is all the witness has to offer...
Igor Karkaroff,"No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy."
Bartemius Crouch,Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.
Igor Karkaroff,"Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself."
Bartemius Crouch,Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.
Igor Karkaroff,"NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape."
Albus Dumbledore,The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.
Igor Karkaroff,It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.
Bartemius Crouch,Silence!
Bartemius Crouch,Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.
Igor Karkaroff,Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.
Bartemius Crouch,What's that?
Igor Karkaroff,The name...
Bartemius Crouch,Yes?
Igor Karkaroff,"I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and..."
Bartemius Crouch,The name! Give me the wretched name!
Igor Karkaroff,Barty Crouch! ... Junior.
Bartemius Crouch Junior,Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father.
Bartemius Crouch,You are no son of mine.
Albus Dumbledore,"Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning."
Harry Potter,"Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?"
Albus Dumbledore,"He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?"
Harry Potter,"It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son."
Albus Dumbledore,Have there been other dreams like this?
Harry Potter,"Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?"
Albus Dumbledore,"I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply..."
Albus Dumbledore,Cast them away.
Igor Karkaroff,"It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I."
Severus Snape,"Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?"
Harry Potter,Yes sir.
Severus Snape,"Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?"
Harry Potter,Bubble juice sir?
Severus Snape,"Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice."
Harry Potter,I haven't stolen anything.
Severus Snape,"Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why."
Albus Dumbledore,Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...
Albus Dumbledore,and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...
Albus Dumbledore,"The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round."
Albus Dumbledore,"In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way."
Alastor Moody,Champions! Prepare yourselves.
Albus Dumbledore,On the count of three... ONE...
Harry Potter,Fleur? Fleur!
Cedric Diggory,Get down!
Harry Potter,No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
Cedric Diggory,Get off me!
Harry Potter,He's bewitched!
Cedric Diggory,Harry! Harry!
Cedric Diggory,You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.
Harry Potter,For a moment so did I.
Cedric Diggory,Some game huh?
Harry Potter,Some game.
Cedric Diggory,"Go. Take it, you saved me!"
Harry Potter,"Together, on three. One, two, three!"
Cedric Diggory,You ok?
Harry Potter,"Yeah, you?"
Cedric Diggory,Where are we?
Harry Potter,I've been here before.
Cedric Diggory,It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.
Harry Potter,"I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!"
Cedric Diggory,What are you talking about?
Cedric Diggory,What is it?
Harry Potter,Get back to the cup!
Cedric Diggory,Who are you? What do you want?
Voldemort,Kill the spare.
Harry Potter,Cedric!
Voldemort,"Do it, now!"
Peter Pettigrew,"Bones of the father, unwillingly given."
Peter Pettigrew,Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.
Peter Pettigrew,Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.
Peter Pettigrew,The dark lord shall rise again.
Voldemort,My wand Wormtail.
Voldemort,Hold out your arm.
Peter Pettigrew,Master. Thank you master.
Voldemort,The other arm Wormtail.
Voldemort,"Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me."
Voldemort,"Not even you, Lucius."
Lucius Malfoy,My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts.
Voldemort,"There were signs my friend, and more than whispers."
Lucius Malfoy,"I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask."
Peter Pettigrew,I returned.
Voldemort,"Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail."
Peter Pettigrew,"Thank you master, thank you."
Voldemort,"Oh, such a handsome boy."
Harry Potter,Don't touch him.
Voldemort,"Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!"
Voldemort,"Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!"
Voldemort,That's better. And now...
Voldemort,"Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up."
Voldemort,"Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes."
Harry Potter,Have it your way.
Voldemort,Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!
James Potter,"Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand?"
Cedric Diggory,Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father.
Lily Potter,Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!
Voldemort,No!
Albus Dumbledore,Harry! Harry!
Albus Dumbledore,Tell me what happened!
Harry Potter,"He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there."
Albus Dumbledore,"It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are."
Cornelius Fudge,"Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people."
Amos Diggory,Let me through! That's my son! My boy!
Alastor Moody,Are you alright Potter?
Alastor Moody,Does it hurt?
Harry Potter,Not so much now.
Alastor Moody,I'd better take a look at it.
Harry Potter,The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.
Alastor Moody,What was it like? What was he like?
Harry Potter,Who?
Alastor Moody,The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?
Harry Potter,I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.
Alastor Moody,"Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?"
Harry Potter,Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
Alastor Moody,Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh??
Harry Potter,It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...
Alastor Moody,You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.
Albus Dumbledore,Severus...
Albus Dumbledore,Do you know who I am?
Alastor Moody,Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore,Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?
Alastor Moody,No.
Albus Dumbledore,Is he in this room? Is he in this room?
Albus Dumbledore,Harry get away from there!
Albus Dumbledore,Are you alright Alastor?
Alastor Moody,I'm sorry Albus.
Harry Potter,"That's Moody, but then who's...?"
Severus Snape,Polyjuice potion.
Albus Dumbledore,Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.
Albus Dumbledore,We'll get you up in a minute.
Albus Dumbledore,Barty Crouch Junior.
Bartemius Crouch Junior,I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
Albus Dumbledore,Your arm Harry.
Bartemius Crouch Junior,You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.
Albus Dumbledore,"Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner."
Bartemius Crouch Junior,I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
Albus Dumbledore,Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.
Albus Dumbledore,"Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end."
Albus Dumbledore,"I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry."
Harry Potter,"Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected."
Albus Dumbledore,Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
Albus Dumbledore,"No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone."
Viktor Krum,Write to me. Promise.
Hermione Granger,Bye.
Fleur Delacour,Au revoir Ron.
Ron Weasley,Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
Hermione Granger,No.
Harry Potter,No I don't think so.
Hermione Granger,Everything's going to change now isn't it?
Harry Potter,Yes.
Hermione Granger,Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
Ron Weasley,Well I won't. You know I won't!
Hermione Granger,Harry will won't you?
Dudley Dursley,"Oh, it's you."
Gang thug,"What should we do with him, Big D?"
Harry Potter,"Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums."
Dudley Dursley,Shut up!
Dudley Dursley,"Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you?"
Harry Potter,What?
Arabella Figg,"You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents!"
Dudley Dursley,"I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. ""No, don't kill Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!"""
Harry Potter,"Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you..."
Dudley Dursley,Why should I?
Harry Potter,Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
Harry Potter,"Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away."
Dudley Dursley,G-go home!
Gang thug,What?
Dudley Dursley,Get out of here!
Harry Potter,Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
Dudley Dursley,Don't point that thing at me!
Harry Potter,"I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !"
Dudley Dursley,What's happening?
Harry Potter,Quiet!
Harry Potter,Dudley! Run!
Harry Potter,"Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back."
Harry Potter,"Dudley, no!"
Harry Potter,Lumos!
Harry Potter,"""Expecto Patronum!'"
Voldemort,"Bow to death, Harry..."
Lily potter,Haaaaaaaarry!...
Harry Potter,"""Expecto Patronum! '"
Vernon Dursley,What the heii are those?
Harry Potter,Dementors.
Petunia Dursley,"What happened, Duddikins?"
Vernon Dursley,What the hell is a dementoid?
Petunia Dursley,They didn't--?
Harry Potter,No.
Vernon Dursley,I want some answers!
Harry Potter,We were attacked.
Vernon Dursley,By those...things?
Harry Potter,"They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth."
Vernon Dursley,How do you know that?
Vernon Dursley,"Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two?"
Harry Potter,You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
Vernon Dursley,Why is he all right then?
Harry Potter,Because I used magic to save his
Harry Potter,Lumos!
Vernon Dursley,Who are all you lot?
Alastor Moody,"Quiet, Dursley."
Remus Lupin,"Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here."
Harry Potter,What are you doing here?
Remus Lupin,"We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear."
Harry Potter,How'd he know? It just happened!
Remus Lupin,"You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?"
Remus Lupin,"Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks."
Remus Lupin,"Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?"
Harry Potter,What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-
Alastor Moody,"We're not talking about it here, it's too risky."
Alastor Moody,Blast it.
Nymphadora Tonks,"Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting?"
Alastor Moody,I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip.
Harry Potter,How are we getting there?
Remus Lupin,Brooms.
Kingsley Shacklebolt,There's the first signal.
Alastor Moody,"Right, let's go."
Remus Lupin,"On your broom, Harry."
Alastor Moody,Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy! The advanced guard surrounds Harry.
Nymphadora Tonks,"Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye."
Alastor Moody,We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry.
Harry Potter,"Uh, is that very likely?"
Kingsley Shacklebolt,No one's going to die.
Remus Lupin,There's the second signal!
Alastor Moody,"Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go!"
Alastor Moody,"The third signal, everyone. Let's"
Alastor Moody,Stay in formation!
Alastor Moody,We need more height!
Alastor Moody,Contacts to the south!
Kingsley Shacklebolt,"Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down!"
Remus Lupin,"There's the other one, Alastor!"
Harry Potter,Expecto--!
Remus Lupin,"Harry, leave it to us!"
Harry Potter,No!
Remus Lupin,"""Expecto Patronum!'"
Remus Lupin,Get Harry to the safe house!
Alastor Moody,"Come on, Potter! Keep moving!"
Harry Potter,But I can help!
Alastor Moody,"Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!"
Alastor Moody,"We're not far, now!"
Alastor Moody,Did you get rid of them?
Kingsley Shacklebolt,"They're gone, Alastor."
Nymphadora Tonks,We're there!
Alastor Moody,Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!
Remus Lupin,"Stay here, Harry."
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Clear!
Alastor Moody,"Right, Harry, this way."
Alastor Moody,"Here, read this."
Alastor Moody,"Come on, inside. Hurry."
Remus Lupin,"Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything."
Walburga Black,"Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?!"
Sirius Black,"Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet!"
Walburga Black,"Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!"
Harry Potter,Was that your--?
Sirius Black,"Mother, yes. Dear old mum."
Harry Potter,But...why here?
Molly Weasley,"Hello, Harry dear."
Harry Potter,Mrs. Weasley!
Molly Weasley,"Sirius, the meeting is about to start!"
Sirius Black,Right.
Molly Weasley,"Harry, dear, go on upstairs- quietly, if you please. They're all up there."
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Ron Weasley,"Let him breathe, Hermione!"
Hermione Granger,"Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!"
Ron Weasley,"Good to see you, mate."
Hermione Granger,"Come on, inside."
Hermione Granger,"Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to."
Ron Weasley,"We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence."
Harry Potter,Right.
Ron Weasley,He thought you would be safest there.
Hermione Granger,He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...
Harry Potter,"So, why's he keeping me in the dark?"
Harry Potter,Didn't you bother asking?
Ron Weasley,"We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy."
Harry Potter,So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
Ron Weasley,"It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings."
Harry Potter,You've still been here!
Harry Potter,What's been going on?
Ron Weasley,"We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things."
Hermione Granger,"Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy."
Harry Potter,What's this Order everyone's talking about?
Hermione Granger,The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.
Molly Weasley,"You can come down now, the meeting's over."
Molly Weasley,Arthur-
Sirius Black,"Well, the Ministry is furious with you."
Harry Potter,Why?
Sirius Black,You'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow.
Harry Potter,Okay.
Harry Potter,I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
Sirius Black,"You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort."
Harry Potter,"I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything."
Molly Weasley,"And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--"
Sirius Black,"He has a right to know, Molly."
Molly Weasley,It's not your decision!
Sirius Black,"I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something."
Sirius Black,"He's not a child, Molly."
Molly Weasley,He's not an adult either!
Molly Weasley,I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
Sirius Black,He's not your son.
Molly Weasley,"Who else does he have, then?"
Sirius Black,He's got me. He's like a son to me.
Sirius Black,"What do you want to know, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
Sirius Black,"He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change."
Harry Potter,How?
Sirius Black,The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,And what's his plan?
Sirius Black,"He's building up his army again, just like before."
Harry Potter,And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
Remus Lupin,"We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult."
Sirius Black,"You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back."
Harry Potter,But...why?
Remus Lupin,"Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked."
Harry Potter,"But you're telling people, right?"
Sirius Black,"Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry..."
Remus Lupin,But Dumbledore is doing all he can.
Arthur Weasley,"If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--"
Harry Potter,What?
Sirius Black,You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A weapon.
Harry Potter,What kind of weapon?
Remus Lupin,"I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more."
Molly Weasley,"Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?"
Harry Potter,"No, my scar kept hurting."
Harry Potter,Yeah...nerves...
Molly Weasley,"Good luck, Harry!"
Hermione Granger,"They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending"
Harry Potter,"Thanks, Hermione."
Ron Weasley,What does he get a hug for?
Ron Weasley,"Oh, sure, that's why."
Ron Weasley,"Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all..."
Hermione Granger,Would you like a hug?
Arthur Weasley,"Well, come on, Harry. Time to go."
Harry Potter,Bye.
Arthur Weasley,"Good, good, not very many Muggles."
Arthur Weasley,"Well, come on Harry, in we go."
Arthur Weasley,"I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again..."
Witch,Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business.
Arthur Weasley,"Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing."
Witch,Pleas stand by.
Arthur Weasley,"Keep close, Harry!"
Arthur Weasley,"Ah, Perkins, good morn-"
Perkins,"Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing."
Arthur Weasley,Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that.
Perkins,It started at eight!
Arthur Weasley,"Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!"
Witch,Department of Mysteries.
Harry Potter,Department of Mysteries?
Arthur Weasley,"Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret."
Arthur Weasley,"Come on, Harry!"
Harry Potter,I've been there before...
Arthur Weasley,"Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely..."
Arthur Weasley,"There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck..."
Cornelius Fudge,You're late.
Harry Potter,Er...sorry.
Cornelius Fudge,"No matter, the accused will take his seat."
Cornelius Fudge,"Very well, we are ready to begin."
Albus Dumbledore,"Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore."
Cornelius Fudge,"Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you?"
Cornelius Fudge,Well. The...ah...charges.
Cornelius Fudge,"The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle."
Harry Potter,Yes.
Harry Potter,"Yes, but-"
Cornelius Fudge,Within full sight of a Muggle?
Harry Potter,"Yes, but-"
Susan Bones,"You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly- defined shape?"
Harry Potter,Yes.
Susan Bones,"That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter."
Cornelius Fudge,It doesn't matter how impressive it was!
Harry Potter,But I did it because of the Dementors!
Susan Bones,What do you mean?
Harry Potter,"My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away."
Cornelius Fudge,"Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story."
Susan Bones,Dementors in Little Whinging?
Cornelius Fudge,"Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying."
Cornelius Fudge,We haven't got time to-
Cornelius Fudge,"Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness."
Cornelius Fudge,Full name?
Arabella Figg,"Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging."
Cornelius Fudge,So...what is your story?
Arabella Figg,I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys.
Susan Bones,What did the Dementors look like?
Arabella Figg,"Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks."
Susan Bones,Anything else?
Arabella Figg,I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again.
Cornelius Fudge,"Very well, you may go."
Cornelius Fudge,Not very convincing.
Susan Bones,"Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely."
Cornelius Fudge,So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not...
Albus Dumbledore,"Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius."
Cornelius Fudge,"Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore."
Dolores Umbridge,"Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic of ordering an attack on this boy?"
Cornelius Fudge,Dementors are irrelevant!
Cornelius Fudge,"Well, yes, if he's telling the truth!"
Cornelius Fudge,"Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges?"
Cornelius Fudge,All opposed?
Albus Dumbledore,Excellent.
Arthur Weasley,"Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful!"
Arthur Weasley,You were tried by the full court?
Harry Potter,"I think so, yeah."
Harry Potter,Er...is Percy mad at you?
Arthur Weasley,"Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left."
Lucius Malfoy,"Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter."
Harry Potter,What are you doing here?
Lucius Malfoy,"Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours."
Lucius Malfoy,Shall we continue this in your
Cornelius Fudge,Certainly.
Harry Potter,"If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?"
Arthur Weasley,"Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension."
Arthur Weasley,"Settle down, you three!"
Arthur Weasley,"Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?"
Sirius Black,"Yeah, absolutely."
Arthur Weasley,"Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with."
Fred Weasley,"George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet."
George Weasley,"Right you are, Fred."
Arthur Weasley,"Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late."
Sirius Black,Harry!
Sirius Black,"You all right, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
Sirius Black,"Harry, I've got something that might interest you."
Sirius Black,This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were cleaning.
Sirius Black,"There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle; Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken...;"
Sirius Black,"then there's Frank and Alice Longbottom, tortured into insanity by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course.."
Harry Potter,My parents.
Harry Potter,"I miss them, Sirius..."
Sirius Black,"I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too."
Sirius Black,It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you didn't...
Harry Potter,"Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?"
Sirius Black,"I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it..."
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Sirius Black,"Kreacher, get out of here! Now!"
Kreacher,"Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house..."
Harry Potter,Who..who was that?
Sirius Black,"Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny."
Hermione Granger,"Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter."
Hermione Granger,"What about you, Harry?"
Hermione Granger,Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!
Harry Potter,I'm sure. Nothing.
Harry Potter,"So...congratulations Ron, Hermione..."
Ron Weasley,"Come on, lets go back downstairs!"
Harry Potter,"Yes, do go enjoy yourselves."
Harry Potter,What is that?
Harry Potter,"Yes it is, it's right there!"
Luna Lovegood,"I see them too, Harry."
Harry Potter,Er...you are?
Luna Lovegood,Luna. Luna Lovegood.
Harry Potter,"Well, thanks Luna."
Harry Potter,Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
Hermione Granger,I hope he's all right...
Ron Weasley,What if he were still on his...
Ron Weasley,What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
Harry Potter,"Yeah, could be."
Albus Dumbledore,"I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley..."
Albus Dumbledore,... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door.
Albus Dumbledore,"Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave."
Albus Dumbledore,"Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-"
Dolores Umbridge,"Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school?"
Dolores Umbridge,"Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position."
Dean Thomas,"So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus?"
Harry Potter,What?
Seamus Finnigan,Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts...
Harry Potter,Why?
Seamus Finnigan,Well...because of you...
Harry Potter,What did I do?
Seamus Finnigan,"She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who and Dumbledore's a right nutter..."
Harry Potter,Where'd she get that from?
Harry Potter,"No one believes me, Hedwig. No one..."
Harry Potter,I'm alone...
Harry Potter,"Sorry, Professor..."
Dolores Umbridge,"Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late."
Dolores Umbridge,"Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it?"
Dolores Umbridge,"I will be following a pre-approved Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan."
Dolores Umbridge,Copy this down.
Dolores Umbridge,Yes?
Hermione Granger,I wanted to know something about your course aims.
Dolores Umbridge,"Well, they should be perfectly self- evident."
Hermione Granger,But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?
Dolores Umbridge,"Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you a Ministry Expert?"
Hermione Granger,"No, but-"
Dolores Umbridge,"Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment-"
Hermione Granger,But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?
Harry Potter,What good's theory in the real world?
Harry Potter,What about Lord Voldemort?
Dolores Umbridge,"Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight."
Dolores Umbridge,Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie.
Harry Potter,It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
Dolores Umbridge,"Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!"
Harry Potter,"So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?"
Dolores Umbridge,The boy's death was a tragic accident.
Harry Potter,It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
Dolores Umbridge,"Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!"
Harry Potter,"Yeah, talk to somebody who cares."
Dolores Umbridge,"That goes to Professor McGonagall, dear."
Harry Potter,Yeah. But she called me a liar!
Harry Potter,"Yes, Professor."
Minerva McGonagall,Good. Off you go.
Hermione Granger,How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!
Ron Weasley,You reckon she's here to spy on us?
Hermione Granger,"Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order."
Harry Potter,Oh! Sorry...
Angelina Johnson,"Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there."
Harry Potter,"I'll never get out of it, Angelina."
Angelina Johnson,"Well, just...don't do it again!"
Ron Weasley,"Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?"
Harry Potter,"Later, I've got detention."
Hermione Granger,"Good luck, Harry."
Harry Potter,Thanks.
Dolores Umbridge,"Ah, Potter. Sit down."
Dolores Umbridge,"You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill."
Dolores Umbridge,"You will write ""I will not tell lies"" until I tell you to stop. Understand?"
Harry Potter,There's no ink.
Dolores Umbridge,Oh...you won't need ink.
Dolores Umbridge,"Problem, Potter?"
Dolores Umbridge,"That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper."
Hermione Granger,"Hey, Harry."
Hermione Granger,Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.
Harry Potter,"No, I haven't."
Hermione Granger,He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something.
Dolores Umbridge,"That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand."
Ron Weasley,Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!
Ron Weasley,Harry--bloody hell!
Hermione Granger,He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.
Ron Weasley,You said she was making you do lines!
Harry Potter,She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.
Hermione Granger,That old hag! She's sick!
Harry Potter,"No, I'm telling anyone."
Hermione Granger,"Harry, I really think you should tell--"
Harry Potter,No!
Harry Potter,I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help.
Hermione Granger,Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.
Harry Potter,I've asked Sirius about it.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe."
Harry Potter,"Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention."
Ron Weasley,Always knew she was a bit fishy.
Hermione Granger,You think she's working for You- Know-Who?
Harry Potter,"Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?"
Hermione Granger,"I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know."
Harry Potter,"Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry."
Sybill Trelawney,Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond!
Sybill Trelawney,Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide.
Dolores Umbridge,And how long have you been at this post?
Dolores Umbridge,I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney?
Sybill Trelawney,I am.
Dolores Umbridge,And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight?
Sybill Trelawney,These things tend to skip...several...generations.
Dolores Umbridge,Of course.
Dolores Umbridge,"Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me?"
Dolores Umbridge,The Inner Eye does not See upon command!
Sybill Trelawney,"My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please!"
Sybill Trelawney,My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends!
Sybill Trelawney,"Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death?"
Harry Potter,Er...
Sybill Trelawney,Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others.
Dolores Umbridge,"Well, if that's the best you can do, Professor, I will be going."
Harry Potter,"Where are we going, Hermione?"
Hermione Granger,There we are.
Ron Weasley,"""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?"
Hermione Granger,"Come on, I'll explain in a minute."
Harry Potter,"Hermione, what's going on?"
Hermione Granger,These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with.
Harry Potter,You mean about us teaching ourselves?
Neville Longbottom,"Hey, Harry."
Harry Potter,"Hey, Neville."
Harry Potter,"Uh...same to you, Luna."
Fred Weasley,"Hear, hear!"
Hermione Granger,"Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name."
Harry Potter,That's the first time you've said his name.
Zacharias Smith,How do we know You-Know-Who's really back?
George Weasley,Dumbledore believes he is.
Justin Finch-Fletchley,You mean Dumbledore believes him.
Hermione Granger,"That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--"
Harry Potter,"It's okay, Hermione."
Harry Potter,I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
Hermione Granger,"Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher."
Neville Longbottom,But we're all students. None of us has the experience to--
Ginny Weasley,Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
Harry Potter,Me?
Michael Corner,I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't.
Susan Bones,One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office.
Harry Potter,"Uh...well, yeah, I did."
Lee Jordan,"Blimey, Harry..."
Lavander Brown,Wow...
Fred Weasley,Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year.
Cho Chang,And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament!
Ron Weasley,Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
Ginny Weasley,And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer.
Hermione Granger,So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?
Hermione Granger,Where are we going to meet?
Neville Longbottom,What about an unused classroom?
Harry Potter,That might work. I'll look into that.
Hermione Granger,"Ok, good."
Hermione Granger,"I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here."
Ernest Macmillan,"I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing..."
Hermione Granger,"Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted."
Hermione Granger,"Also, what should we call ourselves?"
Angelina Johnson,What about the Anti-Unbridhe League?
Ginny Weasley,I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
Hermione Granger,We'll let you know when we're going
Hermione Granger,I think that went well.
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Hermione Granger,"And did you see Cho, Harry?"
Hermione Granger,"Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?!"
Angelina Johnson,"Harry, you won't believe...that Umbridge woman...this is too much!!"
Harry Potter,What's she done now?
Angelina Johnson,Follow me.
Harry Potter,"""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
Angelina Johnson,She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to Dumbledore to get her to allow it.
Harry Potter,"Not only that, but what about the"
Harry Potter,This isn't a coincidence.
Harry Potter,She knows.
Ron Weasley,She can't!
Harry Potter,"Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her."
Ron Weasley,Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.
Hermione Granger,"No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing."
Harry Potter,"What would we do without you, Hermione?"
Harry Potter,Hedwig!
Hermione Granger,She's hurt!
Ron Weasley,She doesn't look very good.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do."
Minerva McGonagall,Potter!
Minerva McGonagall,Where on earth are you going at this time of night?
Harry Potter,It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.
Minerva McGonagall,What?
Minerva McGonagall,"Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry."
Harry Potter,London.
Minerva McGonagall,"Well, give her to me. I'll run her"
Minerva McGonagall,There you are.
Minerva McGonagall,"Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?"
Harry Potter,"Yes, Professor."
Minerva McGonagall,"Good. Now, off to bed."
Dobby,Mr. Harry Potter!
Harry Potter,Dobby! What are you doing here?
Dobby,"Dobby is cleaning, sir."
Harry Potter,"What is it, Dobby."
Dobby,Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep.
Harry Potter,"Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me."
Harry Potter,"Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby."
Harry Potter,I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.
Dobby,"Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter."
Harry Potter,"That's brilliant, Dobby!"
Dobby,"Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter."
Harry Potter,"Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays."
Lee Jordan,...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle!
Students,"Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King!"
Harry Potter,"Just ignore them, Ron!"
Draco Malfoy,"I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, are you all right?"
Draco Malfoy,"Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?"
Draco Malfoy,I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother!
Draco Malfoy,And his pathetic loser of a father too!
Draco Malfoy,"But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!"
Rolanda Hooch,Impedimenta!
Rolanda Hooch,"Don't make me stupify you, Potter!"
Minerva McGonagall,My office. Now.
Minerva McGonagall,"In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display."
Harry Potter,Malfoy provoked us.
Minerva McGonagall,Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost!
Minerva McGonagall,I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now.
Minerva McGonagall,"What is it, Dolores?"
Dolores Umbridge,I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two.
Minerva McGonagall,You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office.
Minerva McGonagall,"Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions."
Dolores Umbridge,I hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this.
Dolores Umbridge,"Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff."
Dolores Umbridge,"So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this one's twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as well."
Harry Potter,Ban us...for life.
Dolores Umbridge,"Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter."
Dolores Umbridge,"Ah, I'll take your brooms as well."
Dolores Umbridge,"Well, have a wonderful day."
Harry Potter,You've--!
Minerva McGonagall,"My hands are tied, Potter."
Angelina Johnson,I can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day...
Ron Weasley,I'm going to resign.
Harry Potter,You can't!
Ron Weasley,I'm horrible! I should never have joined.
Harry Potter,"If you quit, we'll be out four players!"
Ron Weasley,This is the worst day of my life.
Hermione Granger,I know something that could cheer you up.
Hermione Granger,Hagrid's back!
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, what happened to you?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"I've fine, I tell yeh!"
Ron Weasley,"Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order."
Harry Potter,"We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp."
Ron Weasley,A month?
Rubeus Hagrid,"O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em."
Harry Potter,So what did you do when you found them?
Ron Weasley,So...no giants are coming?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes."
Harry Potter,Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
Neville Longbottom,"Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?"
Harry Potter,Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
Zacharias Smith,Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year.
Ron Weasley,Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
Harry Potter,"Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life."
Harry Potter,"Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go."
Neville Longbottom,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter,"Well done, Neville!"
Harry Potter,"Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one."
Neville Longbottom,Expelliarmus!
Neville Longbottom,I did it! I did it!
Harry Potter,"Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day."
Harry Potter,"Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!"
Neville Longbottom,What's wrong with him?
Ron Weasley,Get McGonagall! Go!
Ron Weasley,Harry! HARRY!
Minerva McGonagall,Potter!
Minerva McGonagall,"Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please..."
Harry Potter,Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
Minerva McGonagall,"You dreamed this, Potter?"
Harry Potter,"No, I saw it happen! I...I was there..."
Minerva McGonagall,"You're sure this happened, Potter?"
Minerva McGonagall,"We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter."
Albus Dumbledore,"Professor McGonagall, and...ah..."
Albus Dumbledore,What can I do for you?
Minerva McGonagall,"Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare..."
Albus Dumbledore,How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?
Harry Potter,Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective.
Albus Dumbledore,Is Arthur seriously injured?
Harry Potter,Yes!
Albus Dumbledore,You were listening?
Everard,Naturally.
Albus Dumbledore,Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people.
Albus Dumbledore,"Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them."
Albus Dumbledore,"Fawkes, we will need a warning."
Albus Dumbledore,"Naturally, naturally."
Albus Dumbledore,What news?
Everard,I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He doesn't look good. Covered in blood...
Dilys Derwent,"Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad."
Albus Dumbledore,Good.
Albus Dumbledore,"Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken."
Albus Dumbledore,Phineas.
Albus Dumbledore,"Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while."
Phineas,"It's late, Dumbledore..."
Phineas,"I'm going, I'm going..."
Severus Snape,"Sit, Potter."
Severus Snape,"As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency."
Harry Potter,"What's that, Professor?"
Severus Snape,Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
Harry Potter,Voldemort can read minds?
Severus Snape,"As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter."
Severus Snape,"The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered."
Harry Potter,So he could read our minds right now?
Harry Potter,"But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?"
Severus Snape,"Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions."
Severus Snape,"Wand out, Potter."
Severus Snape,You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.
Harry Potter,What are you going to do?
Severus Snape,I am going to break into your mind.
Harry Potter,No!
Severus Snape,"Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind."
Severus Snape,"Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon"
Arthur Weasley,"Come on, Harry!"
Harry Potter,I've been there before...
Severus Snape,What was that?
Harry Potter,I've just realized...
Severus Snape,"Realized what, Potter?"
Harry Potter,"What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?"
Severus Snape,What did you say?
Harry Potter,"That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it."
Severus Snape,"There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you."
Dolores Umbridge,I can do whatever I wish!
Sybill Trelawney,This is my home!
Dolores Umbridge,Not anymore.
Dolores Umbridge,Now remove yourself from this castle!
Dolores Umbridge,"I have the authority, Headmaster!"
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However..."
Albus Dumbledore,-..-You cannot send them from this
Dolores Umbridge,And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher.
Albus Dumbledore,"Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor"
Albus Dumbledore,...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough.
Albus Dumbledore,This is Firenze.
Ron Weasley,So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?
Harry Potter,It's got to be.
Hermione Granger,That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.
Harry Potter,"Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!"
Ron Weasley,But why the Department of Mysteries?
Hermione Granger,"It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret."
Hermione Granger,Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell!
Harry Potter,They're all Death Eaters!
Hermione Granger,Yes.
Harry Potter,Voldemort.
Dolores Umbridge,Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group--
Albus Dumbledore,"I'm not sure that's true, Professor."
Dolores Umbridge,I'm sorry?
Albus Dumbledore,"In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal."
Dolores Umbridge,"But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced."
Albus Dumbledore,"Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?"
Dolores Umbridge,I have a witness right here!
Albus Dumbledore,"Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight."
Dolores Umbridge,"Let's ask her, shall we?"
Dolores Umbridge,You can shake your head for an
Dolores Umbridge,"What do you mean by shaking your head, girl?"
Dolores Umbridge,But what about Potter? He was the
Dolores Umbridge,"Why are you shaking your head, girl?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge."
Dolores Umbridge,"My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself."
Cornelius Fudge,"Well, what about the meeting tonight?"
Cornelius Fudge,"So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing."
Albus Dumbledore,"Well, Minister. You've caught me."
Cornelius Fudge,This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your army!
Albus Dumbledore,"Quite correct, Cornelius."
Cornelius Fudge,I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time!
Cornelius Fudge,This is too good to be true!
Harry Potter,"Professor, no!"
Albus Dumbledore,"Quiet, Harry!"
Cornelius Fudge,"Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry--"
Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag."
Cornelius Fudge,"I see no snag, Dumbledore."
Albus Dumbledore,But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would 'come quietly.'
Cornelius Fudge,"Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore?"
Cornelius Fudge,"You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you."
Albus Dumbledore,Are you all right?
Minerva McGonagall,"Yes, we're fine."
Albus Dumbledore,I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts.
Harry Potter,"I'm so sorry, Professor!"
Albus Dumbledore,"It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you."
Albus Dumbledore,"Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring."
Albus Dumbledore,Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk.
Cornelius Fudge,Find him!
Dolores Umbridge,"""By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
Dolores Umbridge,"My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school."
Dolores Umbridge,"Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.' I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't."
Harry Potter,Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
Ron Weasley,"No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad."
Hermione Granger,Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Its jus' up ahead, here."
Harry Potter,"Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney."
Hermione Granger,We won't let her!
Hermione Granger,Of course we'll help.
Rubeus Hagrid,Knew yeh'd say yes!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Okay, real quiet like from here on."
Rubeus Hagrid,There we are!
Hermione Granger,"Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn' leave 'im!"
Hermione Granger,"Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?"
Rubeus Hagrid,He's me brother!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died."
Rubeus Hagrid,Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Yeh all righ', Grawp?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy."
Grawp,Hermy!
Rubeus Hagrid,Bad Grawpy! Bad boy!
Rubeus Hagrid,"We don' attack our friends, Grawpy!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"See, he don' know any better."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'ima bit o' company."
Rubeus Hagrid,Oh blimey...
Bane,"I thought we told you that you were no longer welcome in this place, Hagrid. You or that beast you brought from afar."
Rubeus Hagrid,S'not up to you who comes and goes in this forest.
Bane,You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the servant of the humans at
Rubeus Hagrid,"Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean!"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here!"
Bane,"We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you. But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit."
Severus Snape,"Have you been practicing, Potter?"
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Severus Snape,"Well, we shall see, won't we?"
Sirius Black,"Put that away, James."
Sirius Black,I'm bored. Wish it was full moon.
Remus Lupin,Easy for you to say.
James Potter,"This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. Sirius grins."
James Potter,"All right, there, Snivellus?"
Sirius Black,Expelliarmus!
James Potter,Impedimenta!
Severus Snape,You just wait...
James Potter,"And now, the moment you've all been waiting for--"
Lily Potter,"Leave him alone, James Potter!"
James Potter,"Another charity case, Lily?"
Lily Potter,What has he done to you?
James Potter,"Nothing. It's more the fact that he exists, you see..."
Severus Snape,Semper-
James Potter,Levicorpus!
Lily Potter,"Leave him alone, Potter!"
James Potter,I will if you go out with me.
Lily Potter,I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down.
Sirius Black,Locomotor mortis!
Lily Potter,"I said, leave him alone!"
James Potter,"Don't make me hex you, Lily."
Lily Potter,Then let him go!
James Potter,Fine!
James Potter,"You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus!"
Severus Snape,I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
James Potter,Apologize to her! Now!
Lily Potter,"Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is!"
James Potter,I would never call you that.
Lily Potter,"You make me sick, Potter."
James Potter,Lily! Hey Lily!
Severus Snape,"Having fun, Potter?"
Severus Snape,Been enjoying yourself?
Harry Potter,No!
Severus Snape,"Amusing man, your father..."
Harry Potter,I--sorry!
Severus Snape,You will repeat what you saw to no
Harry Potter,"No, of course not!"
Severus Snape,"You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!"
Severus Snape,Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again!
Voldemort,"Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?"
Sirius Black,I would rather die!
Voldemort,"Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then."
Voldemort,"I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh."
Griselda Marchbanks,"Are you all right, Potter?"
Griselda Marchbanks,"Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe you'll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but--"
Harry Potter,"No--no, I've done all I can."
Ron Weasley,You all right?
Harry Potter,Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!
Hermione Granger,How do you know?
Harry Potter,I just saw it.
Harry Potter,How're we going to get there?
Ron Weasley,To the Department of Mysteries?
Harry Potter,We've got to do something!
Hermione Granger,"How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world..."
Ron Weasley,Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
Hermione Granger,"It just seems so unlikely, Harry!"
Harry Potter,I won't let Sirius die!
Ginny Weasley,We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
Harry Potter,Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
Hermione Granger,"Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius."
Harry Potter,"There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!"
Ginny Weasley,Anything we can do to help?
Harry Potter,"No, there isn't!"
Hermione Granger,"Yes, they can, Harry."
Harry Potter,How?
Hermione Granger,"Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office."
George Weasley,Might be able to.
Fred Weasley,Just give us a few seconds.
Hermione Granger,"Mind you, it's got to be really good!"
Fred Weasley,It's been too quiet around here
George Weasley,Time we did some real damage to this place.
Hermione Granger,We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.
Ginny Weasley,We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.
Hermione Granger,We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
Harry Potter,That's all we'll need.
Fred Weasley,"Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours."
George Weasley,"Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while."
Hermione Granger,"Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry."
Argus Filch,Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the Astronomy Tower!
Dolores Umbridge,Ready to try out the old punishments again?
Harry Potter,Grimmauld Place!
Fred Weasley,That was worth it!
Argus Filch,I've got you now!
Fred Weasley,"Thank you for playing, one and all."
George Weasley,"And now, we've got to go!"
Harry Potter,Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
Kreacher,What's this? The Potter boy in the fire...
Harry Potter,"Kreacher, where's Sirius?"
Kreacher,Master went out.
Dolores Umbridge,"So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it?"
Fred Weasley,"Fairly amusing, yeah."
Dolores Umbridge,"Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school."
Fred Weasley,This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!
Dolores Umbridge,"Well, now you're going to get your"
George Weasley,"You know, I don't think we are."
Fred Weasley,"George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree?"
George Weasley,"Completely, Fred."
Fred Weasley,Time to enter the real world?
George Weasley,Definitely.
Fred Weasley,Accio brooms!
George Weasley,Accio brooms!
Fred Weasley,We won't be seeing you.
George Weasley,"Yeah, don't bother writing."
Fred Weasley,Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
Harry Potter,"You know where he is, don't you?"
Kreacher,Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes.
Kreacher,Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries!
Dolores Umbridge,You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy!
Dolores Umbridge,Accio wand!
Dolores Umbridge,Who were you trying to contact?
Harry Potter,It's none of your business.
Dolores Umbridge,"Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please?"
Dolores Umbridge,"Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you."
Severus Snape,You wished to see me?
Dolores Umbridge,I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum.
Severus Snape,"Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none."
Harry Potter,He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
Severus Snape,"Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps from the office. Umbridge is enraged."
Dolores Umbridge,"We've played nicely, Potter. You"
Dolores Umbridge,You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to your house had finished you off!
Harry Potter,You sent the Dementors?
Dolores Umbridge,Of course I did! Someone had to act!
Hermione Granger,"No! Please, stop!"
Dolores Umbridge,"Well, well."
Harry Potter,"Hermione, no!"
Hermione Granger,"We have to tell her, Harry..."
Harry Potter,I would rather die!
Dolores Umbridge,"Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?"
Hermione Granger,We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...
Dolores Umbridge,Tell him?
Hermione Granger,That it's ready. The weapon.
Dolores Umbridge,You and Mr. Potter will take me to it.
Dolores Umbridge,"Much further, is it?"
Hermione Granger,"Oh, yes. It's very well hidden."
Magorian,What are you doing in our forest?
Dolores Umbridge,Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic!
Dolores Umbridge,"Stay back, you beasts!"
Dolores Umbridge,You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed--
Hermione Granger,Don't call them that!
Magorian,You dare to insult us?
Dolores Umbridge,Come no closer!
Dolores Umbridge,Incarcerus!
Dolores Umbridge,Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods!
Centaur,What of these two?
Centaur,They have been here with Hagrid. They have heard the warnings and disobeyed. They must suffer the consequences!
Draco Malfoy,"God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long."
Ron Weasley,"Shut up, Malfoy!"
Draco Malfoy,"That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods!"
Draco Malfoy,"You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets."
Ron Weasley,Stupify!
Neville Longbottom,Expelliarmus!
Grawp,Haggar!
Grawp,Hermy! Where Haggar?
Hermione Granger,"Grawp, help us!"
Grawp,Grawp save Hermy!
Harry Potter,"Great plan, Hermione."
Hermione Granger,I thought it worked out rather nicely.
Ron Weasley,That's just what we were wondering.
Ron Weasley,"So, how do we get to the Ministry?"
Hermione Granger,I'd imagine we should fly.
Harry Potter,We've got no brooms.
Luna Lovegood,There are other ways to fly.
Luna Lovegood,"I mean, they can fly, and they're"
Harry Potter,What are those?
Ron Weasley,What are what?
Hermione Granger,"There's nothing there, Harry."
Luna Lovegood,"Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen someone die."
Neville Longbottom,I can see them too.
Harry Potter,"All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off."
Ron Weasley,And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them.
Luna Lovegood,I'll show you.
Ron Weasley,Never again...
Ginny Weasley,"What now, Harry?"
Harry Potter,"All right, come on."
Witch,Department of Mysteries.
Harry Potter,Where is everyone?
Ginny Weasley,The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home.
Harry Potter,That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
Harry Potter,This is it. Come on.
Harry Potter,Stay close.
Ginny Weasley,Now where?
Harry Potter,"I don't understand. In my dream,"
Hermione Granger,"Well, let's try a few."
Harry Potter,Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it.
Harry Potter,Who's there?
Harry Potter,Sirius?
Hermione Granger,"There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room."
Harry Potter,Does anyone else hear that?
Luna Lovegood,I do. It's coming from the Veil.
Luna Lovegood,There are people in there!
Ron Weasley,"What do you mean, people?"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, I think we should leave."
Harry Potter,Sirius...yeah...
Harry Potter,Alohomora!
Harry Potter,"Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it."
Harry Potter,This is it! Come on!
Harry Potter,This is it. This is where Sirius is!
Harry Potter,He's in here somewhere.
Hermione Granger,I don't think Sirius is here.
Ron Weasley,"Harry, have you seen this?"
Ron Weasley,Er...it's got your name on it.
Harry Potter,What's my name doing here?
Hermione Granger,"Don't touch it, Harry!"
Harry Potter,Why not?
Neville Longbottom,"Yeah, Harry, don't."
Harry Potter,It's got my name on it!
Lucius Malfoy,"I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter."
Harry Potter,Where's Sirius?
Lucius Malfoy,"We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned."
Lucius Malfoy,"The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here."
Lucius Malfoy,Now give me that prophesy.
Harry Potter,What prophesy?
Lucius Malfoy,That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you.
Harry Potter,Go ahead.
Lucius Malfoy,"Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?"
Harry Potter,Come and find out!
Lucius Malfoy,"Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here."
Bellatrix Lestrange,I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this!
Lucius Malfoy,No! If the prophesy is smashed--
Bellatrix Lestrange,Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we torture her.
Harry Potter,You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
Harry Potter,"So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Surely you jest, Potter?"
Harry Potter,Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
Lucius Malfoy,You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?
Bellatrix Lestrange,Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half-blood mouth!
Harry Potter,"Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?"
Lucius Malfoy,"Control yourself, Bellatrix!"
Harry Potter,What's so special about this
Lucius Malfoy,You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here?
Harry Potter,What?
Lucius Malfoy,So that's what took you so long. We wondered.
Lucius Malfoy,"Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself."
Harry Potter,"So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?"
Harry Potter,Now!
Hermione Granger,Stupify!
Lucius Malfoy,Stop them!
Hermione Granger,Colloportus!
Harry Potter,Where'd the rest go?
Hermione Granger,"Harry, they went the wrong way!"
Death Eater,They might have gone on to the hall.
Bellatrix Lestrange,Check under the desks.
Harry Potter,Stupify!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Avada-
Neville Longbottom,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter,Stupify!
Harry Potter,Ron!
Death Eater,Impedimenta!
Death Eater,We've got him!
Hermione Granger,Silenco! Stupify!
Harry Potter,Pretificus Totalus!
Neville Longbottom,Stupify!
Harry Potter,Hermione!
Harry Potter,"Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her."
Neville Longbottom,What's they do to her?
Neville Longbottom,"She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse."
Harry Potter,Can we carry her?
Neville Longbottom,I'll do it. You're better at fighting.
Neville Longbottom,Where do we go?
Harry Potter,I don't know...
Harry Potter,What happened.
Ginny Weasley,I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell...
Ron Weasley,"Hiyya, Harry."
Luna Lovegood,They hit her with something too.
Harry Potter,"We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,There they are!
Lucius Malfoy,"Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over."
Harry Potter,Let my friends go and I will.
Lucius Malfoy,You are not in a position to negotiate.
Neville Longbottom,"Don't do it, Harry! Don't!"
Harry Potter,"Stop, Neville!"
Bellatrix Lestrange,Neville? Neville Longbottom?
Bellatrix Lestrange,"My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such a time!"
Neville Longbottom,You put them in St. Mungos!
Bellatrix Lestrange,"So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents."
Neville Longbottom,Don't give it to them!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Crucio!
Harry Potter,Are you all right?
Neville Longbottom,Yeah...
Death Eater,Give me the prophesy!
Sirius Black,"Get out of here, you two!"
Sirius Black,That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries.
Harry Potter,You come with us!
Sirius Black,"You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order."
Sirius Black,"I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!"
Sirius Black,"Hello, cousin!"
Lucius Malfoy,Potter!
Lucius Malfoy,"We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord!"
Lucius Malfoy,Stupify!
Harry Potter,Protego!
Neville Longbottom,It's Dumbledore!
Sirius Black,"Is that the best you've got, cousin?"
Remus Lupin,Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do...
Harry Potter,No...no...no....
Remus Lupin,"Harry, no!"
Bellatrix Lestrange,"You can't stop me, Potter!"
Harry Potter,I'LL KILL you!!
Harry Potter,Stupify!
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Come out, come out, Potter..."
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather?"
Harry Potter,Crucio!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Crucio!
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul..."
Bellatrix Lestrange,Give me the prophesy!
Harry Potter,Can't. It got smashed by accident!
Bellatrix Lestrange,You lie!
Harry Potter,"How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Forgive me, Master! I tried, I--"
Harry Potter,"He can't hear you from here, you know!"
Voldemort,"So, you smashed my prophesy..."
Voldemort,"I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter!"
Voldemort,Avada Kadavra!
Albus Dumbledore,"You should not have come here tonight, Tom."
Voldemort,"It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!"
Voldemort,Avada Kedavra!
Voldemort,"You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?"
Albus Dumbledore,"There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom."
Voldemort,There is nothing worse than death!
Albus Dumbledore,"You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been."
Harry Potter,Look out!
Harry Potter,Professor!
Albus Dumbledore,"Stay where you are, Harry!"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry!
Albus Dumbledore,"Are you all right, Harry?"
Percy Weasley,"Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!"
Cornelius Fudge,I know...I saw him too...
Albus Dumbledore,"If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended."
Cornelius Fudge,Seize him!
Albus Dumbledore,"Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!"
Albus Dumbledore,"If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be."
Cornelius Fudge,"Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?"
Albus Dumbledore,"I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school."
Cornelius Fudge,What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?
Albus Dumbledore,"Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school."
Albus Dumbledore,All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work.
Albus Dumbledore,"I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head."
Albus Dumbledore,Portus.
Cornelius Fudge,"Dumbledore, I want some answers!"
Albus Dumbledore,"The Second War has begun, Minister."
Albus Dumbledore,Thank you...
Albus Dumbledore,"Please sit, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,"I understand how you feel, Harry--"
Harry Potter,No you don't!
Albus Dumbledore,"You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,"There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength..."
Harry Potter,You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
Albus Dumbledore,What can't I know?
Albus Dumbledore,"This pain is part of being human, Harry..."
Harry Potter,I don't care! I don't care!
Albus Dumbledore,You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
Harry Potter,Let me out.
Albus Dumbledore,No.
Harry Potter,You can't keep me in here!
Albus Dumbledore,"I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it."
Albus Dumbledore,It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
Albus Dumbledore,"Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man."
Harry Potter,I already know all this.
Albus Dumbledore,"Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?"
Harry Potter,"Well, yeah, I did..."
Albus Dumbledore,"Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency."
Harry Potter,But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
Albus Dumbledore,"Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed."
Harry Potter,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort-"
Albus Dumbledore,"I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year."
Harry Potter,Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
Albus Dumbledore,"Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed."
Albus Dumbledore,"During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries."
Harry Potter,"I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection."
Albus Dumbledore,"Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams."
Albus Dumbledore,"Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius."
Harry Potter,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--
Albus Dumbledore,Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.
Harry Potter,Why?
Albus Dumbledore,Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.
Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,"Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?"
Albus Dumbledore,Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.
Albus Dumbledore,Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.
Harry Potter,And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
Albus Dumbledore,"She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated."
Harry Potter,Sirius hated him.
Albus Dumbledore,He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.
Harry Potter,"Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!"
Albus Dumbledore,I was trying to save his life!
Albus Dumbledore,I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.
Albus Dumbledore,"This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia."
Harry Potter,She never loved me.
Albus Dumbledore,"Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected."
Albus Dumbledore,"And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders."
Albus Dumbledore,Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?
Albus Dumbledore,Do you remember what you asked me that night?
Harry Potter,I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
Albus Dumbledore,"You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must."
Harry Potter,"I don't understand, Professor."
Harry Potter,"Professor, why am I so important to"
Albus Dumbledore,"An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy."
Harry Potter,"Sir, it got smashed."
Albus Dumbledore,That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.
Sybill Trelawney,"""The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to"
Harry Potter,"I'm not sure I understand all that, sir..."
Harry Potter,And...it means me?
Albus Dumbledore,"Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom."
Harry Potter,"So it's not necessarily me, sir?"
Harry Potter,What if he chose wrong?
Harry Potter,Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
Albus Dumbledore,"Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power."
Harry Potter,But I don't have any special powers.
Albus Dumbledore,There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.
Harry Potter,"What is it, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,"There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives."""
Albus Dumbledore,"It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry."
Harry Potter,One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Nearly Headless Nick,"Hello, Harry."
Harry Potter,"Hey, Nick."
Nearly Headless Nick,"I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and Ron are out of the hospital wing."
Harry Potter,Oh. Thanks.
Harry Potter,"Nick, I was wondering about something?"
Nearly Headless Nick,I've been expecting this...
Harry Potter,Expecting what?
Nearly Headless Nick,A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones.
Harry Potter,I expect so...
Nearly Headless Nick,"He's not coming back, Harry."
Harry Potter,Why?
Nearly Headless Nick,I'm sorry I couldn't be of more
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Harry Potter,How are you?
Ron Weasley,"Good as new, mate."
Harry Potter,Better.
Hermione Granger,"Come on, let's go in to the feast."
Harry Potter,I've got something to tell you. Something important.
Harry Potter,But not right now. I'm not ready.
Hermione Granger,"Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are."
Luna Lovegood,"Hello, Harry."
Luna Lovegood,It's the last night and I need to pack.
Luna Lovegood,"Oh, people take my things and hide them."
Luna Lovegood,"I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me ""Loony"" Lovegood."
Harry Potter,Do you need any help looking?
Luna Lovegood,Oh no. It all turns up in the end.
Luna Lovegood,Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather.
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Luna Lovegood,My mother. I was nine.
Harry Potter,I'm sorry.
Luna Lovegood,It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again.
Harry Potter,Isn't it?
Luna Lovegood,Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil?
Luna Lovegood,"They were just out of sight, that's all."
Luna Lovegood,"Of course. Anyway, my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding."
Harry Potter,I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
Hermione Granger,What's that ?
Harry Potter,That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
Ron Weasley,Yeah ?
Harry Potter,Something worth fighting for
Bellatrix Lestrange,Narcissa!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Cissy! You mustn't do this.  He can't be trusted.
Narcissa Malfoy,The Dark Lord trusts him.
Bellatrix Lestrange,The Dark Lord is mistaken.
Bellatrix Lestrange,Or so I believe.
Narcissa Malfoy,"Well, who can one trust these days?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,He lives in this Muggle dunghill?
Severus Snape,"Run along, Wormtail."
Narcissa Malfoy,"I've nowhere else to turn, Severus."
Bellatrix Lestrange,You must be joking.
Narcissa Malfoy,I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --
Severus Snape,"If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak."
Severus Snape,"Put it down, Bella.  We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa."
Bellatrix Lestrange,You? The Dark Lord told you?
Severus Snape,"Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable."
Severus Snape,Over the years I have played my part well.  So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
Severus Snape,Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
Narcissa Malfoy,"I... I don't doubt you, Severus."
Bellatrix Lestrange,"You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --"
Narcissa Malfoy,He's just a boy!
Severus Snape,I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection.
Narcissa Malfoy,"Do you mean it, Severus?"
Severus Snape,I can try.
Narcissa Malfoy,"Oh, Severus, please, if you would... I would be forever in your debt."
Bellatrix Lestrange,Swear to it.
Bellatrix Lestrange,Make the Unbreakable Vow. You see.  It's just empty words. Oh he'll try.  He'll give it his best effort.  But when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole.  Bloody coward...
Severus Snape,Take out your wand.
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes."
Severus Snape,I will.
Bellatrix Lestrange,"And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"
Severus Snape,I will.
Bellatrix Lestrange,"And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?"
Severus Snape,I will.
Waitress,Harry Potter.  Who's Harry Potter?
Harry Potter,Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser.
Waitress,"Funny that paper of yours.  Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move."
Harry Potter,Really.
Waitress,Thought I'd gone round the twist.
Harry Potter,Hey.  I was wondering...
Waitress,Eleven.  That's when I get off.
Albus Dumbledore,I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...
Harry Potter,I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
Albus Dumbledore,"Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm."
Harry Potter,"I just Apparated, didn't I?"
Albus Dumbledore,Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time.
Harry Potter,Can't imagine why...
Albus Dumbledore,"Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?"
Harry Potter,"After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Wand out, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,Lumos...
Albus Dumbledore,Horace!
Horace Horace Slughorn,Merlin's Beard!
Horace Slughorn,"There's no need to disfigure me, Albus!"
Albus Dumbledore,"I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace."
Horace Slughorn,It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
Albus Dumbledore,Dragon's blood.
Horace Slughorn,"Yes, well, I couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could I?  Oho!"
Albus Dumbledore,"Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One."
Albus Dumbledore,"So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?"
Horace Slughorn,S-someone else?  I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
Horace Slughorn,Oh all right!  The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  Do you know what that's like?  One can only say no to these people so many times before they...
Albus Dumbledore,Take matters into their own hands?
Horace Slughorn,I never stay anywhere more than a week.  The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.
Albus Dumbledore,"Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?"
Albus Dumbledore,That was fun.  May I use the loo?
Horace Slughorn,"Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus!  The answer is still no!  Absolutely, unequivocally no!"
Horace Slughorn,You look very like your father. Except for your eyes.  You've got --
Harry Potter,"My mother's eyes, yeah."
Horace Slughorn,Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.
Harry Potter,One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year.
Horace Slughorn,"Oh, but you mustn't think I'm prejudiced!  No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  Look, there she is. Right up front."
Horace Slughorn,"All mine, each and every one.  Ex- students, I mean.  You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet."
Horace Slughorn,"Always takes my owl should I want to register my opinion on the news of the day.  And there's Ambrosius Flume of Honeydukes.  Sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday.  That is, when I had a house.  And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time..."
Horace Slughorn,"Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I taught the whole Black family except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented boy.  I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set."
Albus Dumbledore,Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.
Horace Slughorn,Of course.  But you're not leaving?
Albus Dumbledore,"I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind."
Horace Slughorn,"All right!  I'll do it.  But I'll be wanting Professor Merrythought's old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise!  These are mad times we live in!  Mad!"
Albus Dumbledore,Indeed they are.
Harry Potter,"Sir, exactly what was that all --"
Albus Dumbledore,"You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return..."
Albus Dumbledore,"I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl."
Harry Potter,"It's alright, sir.  I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --"
Albus Dumbledore,"You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry."
Harry Potter,"But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there's my trunk --"
Albus Dumbledore,Both are waiting for you.
Harry Potter,Sir?
Ginny Weasley,Hedwig...?  Mum!
Ginny Weasley,Exactly.  How'd you guess?
Ginny Weasley,"I'm joking, Mum."
Molly Weasley,You're worse than Fred and George.
Ginny Weasley,Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here.
Molly Weasley,Harry who?
Ginny Weasley,"Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course."
Molly Weasley,"I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?"
Ginny Weasley,Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl.
Molly Weasley,I seriously doubt that.
Ron Weasley,Harry?  Did someone say Harry?
Ginny Weasley,"Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you?"
Ron Weasley,"'Course not.  Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?"
Hermione Granger,Was that an owl I heard?
Ginny Weasley,"Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house."
Hermione Granger,Really?
Harry Potter,Really.
Ron Weasley,Harry!
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Molly Weasley,But why didn't you tell us you were coming?
Harry Potter,Didn't know. Dumbledore.
Molly Weasley,"That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!"
Ron Weasley,You've a bit of...
Harry Potter,When'd you get here?
Hermione Granger,"A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming."
Ron Weasley,Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it's too dangerous.
Harry Potter,Oh come on...
Hermione Granger,She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
Ron Weasley,"Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round."
Harry Potter,But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?
Hermione Granger,There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.
Harry Potter,Rubbish.  He's only -- what?
Ron Weasley,A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years.
Fred Weasley,Step up!  Step up!
George Weasley,Step up!  Step up!
George Weasley,We've got Fainting Fancy...
Fred Weasley,Nosebleed Nougats...
George Weasley,And just in time for school...
Fred Weasley,Puking Pastilles!
Fred Weasley,"Into the cauldron, handsome."
George Weasley,"Into the cauldron, handsome."
Fred Weasley,"What'd you think, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Amazing.
George Weasley,"Pocket that and you'll pay in more than Galleons, my friend."
Fred Weasley,We've got eyes in the back of our heads.
George Weasley,Bloody urchins.
Harry Potter,Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
Fred Weasley,A real money spinner that.
Fred Weasley,"Handy if you need to make a quick escape.  Hello, ladies!"
George Weasley,"Yes, they do really work."
Fred Weasley,"Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own."
Ginny Weasley,Meaning?
Fred Weasley,Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
Ginny Weasley,None of your business.
Hermione Granger,These are adorable.
Fred Weasley,Aren't they now.  Pygmy Puffs. Can't breed them fast enough.
Ron Weasley,How much for this?
Fred Weasley,Five Galleons.
George Weasley,Five Galleons.
Ron Weasley,How much for me?
Fred Weasley,Five Galleons.
George Weasley,Five Galleons.
Ron Weasley,But I'm your brother!
Fred Weasley,Ten Galleons.
Ron Weasley,C'mon. Let's go.
Lavender Brown,"Hi, Ron."
Ron Weasley,Hi.
Hermione Granger,How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down.
Ron Weasley,Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
Harry Potter,Reckon he's right...
Hermione Granger,Oh no.  Look.
Hermione Granger,But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...
Harry Potter,Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...
Ron Weasley,Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
Ron Weasley,What're they playing at?
Harry Potter,Dunno.  Let's get closer.
Ron Weasley,Hey.  Where's Hermione?
Ron Weasley,"Harry, where is she?"
Harry Potter,I don't know.  I'm turned around.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell.
Hermione Granger,Sorry.
Harry Potter,What just happened?
Hermione Granger,I don't know.
Luna Lovegood,Quibbler...?  Quibbler...?
Luna Lovegood,There's an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?
Luna Lovegood,"He's lovely.  They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?"
Ginny Weasley,Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?
Luna Lovegood,They're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler?
Harry Potter,"Don't you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation."
Hermione Granger,"Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --"
Harry Potter,It's happened.  He's one of them.
Ron Weasley,One of what?
Hermione Granger,Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
Ron Weasley,You're barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
Harry Potter,So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  Browsing for furniture?
Ron Weasley,It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke.
Harry Potter,"Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes."
Hermione Granger,I told you.  I don't know what I saw.
Harry Potter,I need some air.
Draco Malfoy,What just happened?  Blaise?
Blaise Zabini,Don't know.
Pansy Parkinson,"Relax, boys.  The lights went out is all.  Come, Draco.  We'll be at Hogwarts before you know it."
Draco Malfoy,Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.
Pansy Parkinson,What's that supposed to mean?
Draco Malfoy,Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.
Draco Malfoy,"Amused, Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end."
Hermione Granger,Where's Harry?
Ron Weasley,Probably on the platform.  C'mon.
Draco Malfoy,You two go on.  I want to check something.
Draco Malfoy,"Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!"
Draco Malfoy,"Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin."
Draco Malfoy,Enjoy the ride back to London.
Luna Lovegood,"Hello, Harry."
Harry Potter,Luna.  How'd you...?
Luna Lovegood,Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
Harry Potter,"Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna."
Luna Lovegood,It's alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.
Harry Potter,"I am your friend, Luna."
Luna Lovegood,That's nice.
Filius Flitwick,About time!  I've been looking all over for you two.  Names.
Harry Potter,"Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years."
Filius Flitwick,"No exceptions, Potter."
Luna Lovegood,Who are those people?
Filius Flitwick,Aurors. For security.
Draco Malfoy,"It's a not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick."
Argus Filch,And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
Severus Snape,It was his father's.
Draco Malfoy,Is my father's.  He's not dead.
Severus Snape,"It's alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy."
Draco Malfoy,"Nice face, Potter."
Luna Lovegood,Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it's up to you.
Harry Potter,Have you ever fixed one?  A nose.
Luna Lovegood,No.  But I've done several toes and how different are they really?
Harry Potter,What the hell.  Give it a go.
Luna Lovegood,Episkey.
Harry Potter,Well?  How do I look?
Luna Lovegood,Exceptionally ordinary.
Harry Potter,Brilliant.
Ron Weasley,Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
Hermione Granger,Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!
Ron Weasley,"Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic."
Ginny Weasley,He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?
Ron Weasley,Looks like his own this time.
Hermione Granger,"Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?"
Harry Potter,Later.  What've I missed?
Ron Weasley,"Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside?"
Harry Potter,Thanks...
Hermione Granger,What's happened to his hand?
Albus Dumbledore,"The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn."
Albus Dumbledore,"Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape."
Albus Dumbledore,"Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why."
Albus Dumbledore,"Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent."
Albus Dumbledore,"Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you."
Albus Dumbledore,"Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!"
Ron Weasley,That was cheerful.
Minerva McGonagall,"History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that's the girl's toilet..."
Minerva McGonagall,Potter!
Harry Potter,This can't be good.
Minerva McGonagall,"Enjoying ourself, are we?"
Harry Potter,"Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor --"
Minerva McGonagall,So I noticed.  I would think you'd want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
Harry Potter,It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my
Minerva McGonagall,"And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations.'"
Harry Potter,Really?  Well... brilliant.  I'll head there straight away.
Minerva McGonagall,Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
Ron Weasley,But I don't want to take Potions!
Horace Slughorn,Harry m'boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we've brought someone with us...
Ron Weasley,"Ron Weasley, sir.  But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --"
Horace Slughorn,"Nonsense, we'll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --"
Harry Potter,"Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --"
Horace Slughorn,Not to worry.  You can get what you need from the cupboard.
Horace Slughorn,"Now, as I was saying, I've prepared a few concoctions this morning.  Any ideas what these might be?  Yes, Miss...?"
Hermione Granger,"Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world."
Hermione Granger,"It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --"
Horace Slughorn,One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year...
Horace Slughorn,"Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course.  That's impossible.  But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room."
Katie Bell,"Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one."
Horace Slughorn,Ah yes...
Horace Slughorn,"What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --"
Hermione Granger,Liquid luck.
Horace Slughorn,"Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately tricky to make.  Disastrous should you get it wrong.  But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off."
Katie Bell,But then why don't people drink it all the time?
Horace Slughorn,"Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence."
Blaise Zabini,"Have you ever taken it, sir?"
Horace Slughorn,Twice.  Once when I was twenty- four.  Once when I was fifty- seven.  Two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  Two perfect days...
Horace Slughorn,"So.  This is what I offer each of you today.  One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook."
Horace Slughorn,"You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  In any event -- good luck."
Hermione Granger,How did you do that?
Harry Potter,Crush it.  Don't cut it.
Hermione Granger,No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.
Harry Potter,No.  Really --
Hermione Granger,Sh!
Horace Slughorn,"Merlin's Beard!  But it's perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all!  Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can't you do, m'boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end..."
Horace Slughorn,"Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use it well."
Albus Dumbledore,"Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit."
Albus Dumbledore,So.  How are you?
Harry Potter,"Fine, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you."
Harry Potter,"I think he overestimates my abilities, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,Do you?
Harry Potter,Definitely.
Albus Dumbledore,And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?
Harry Potter,Sir?
Albus Dumbledore,I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --
Harry Potter,No!  I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.  But... no.
Albus Dumbledore,"Forgive me, Harry, I..."
Albus Dumbledore,"... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here."
Albus Dumbledore,What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle.
Albus Dumbledore,This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would...
Mrs. Cole,"I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.  In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence."
Albus Dumbledore,I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.
Mrs. Cole,I see...
Mrs. Cole,I think I should tell you.  He's a funny boy -- Tom.  Odd.  There have been incidents with the other children.  Nasty things.
Albus Dumbledore,Perhaps you could give me an example.
Mrs. Cole,"You've got a visitor, Tom."
Albus Dumbledore,"How do you do, Tom."
Mrs. Cole,"Well, I'll leave you two to yourselves."
Tom Riddle,Don't.
Albus Dumbledore,As you wish.
Tom Riddle,"You're the doctor, aren't you?"
Albus Dumbledore,No.  I am a Professor.
Tom Riddle,"I don't believe you.  I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  They want me looked at.  They think I'm different."
Albus Dumbledore,Perhaps they're right.
Tom Riddle,I'm not mad.
Albus Dumbledore,Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
Albus Dumbledore,It's a school.  A school of... magic.
Albus Dumbledore,"You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't."
Tom Riddle,Yes.
Albus Dumbledore,"Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom."
Tom Riddle,I can make things move -- without touching them.  I can make animals do what I want without training them.  I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  I can make them hurt... if I want.
Tom Riddle,Who are you?
Albus Dumbledore,"I'm like you, Tom.  Different."
Tom Riddle,Prove it.
Albus Dumbledore,"I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It."
Albus Dumbledore,Take it out.
Albus Dumbledore,Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?
Albus Dumbledore,"Why did you want these things, Tom?"
Tom Riddle,I like having things that belonged to other people.  It makes me feel ... close to them.
Albus Dumbledore,"Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully."
Tom Riddle,I can speak to snakes too.
Tom Riddle,They find me.  Whisper things.  Is that normal.  For someone like me?
Albus Dumbledore,It is unusual.  But not unheard of.
Harry Potter,"Did you know, sir?  Then?"
Albus Dumbledore,Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...
Albus Dumbledore,"Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?"
Harry Potter,"You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,"No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything."
Harry Potter,You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
Albus Dumbledore,I did.
Harry Potter,Do you want me to let him?
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Harry Potter,All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me...
Ginny Weasley,Shut It!
Harry Potter,Thanks.  All right.  This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?
Cormac McLaggen,"No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?"
Ron Weasley,Hard feelings?
Cormac McLaggen,I'll be going out for Keeper as well.  Nothing personal.
Ron Weasley,"Really?  Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --"
Cormac McLaggen,"I like my chances.  Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?  Wouldn't mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean?"
Harry Potter,"All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron."
Cormac McLaggen,Hang on.  She's his sister.  How do I know she won't toss him a floater?
Ginny Weasley,"Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?"
Harry Potter,Quiet!  I'm Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!
Harry Potter,"C'mon, Ron..."
Lavender Brown,Isn't he brilliant?
Ron Weasley,"Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard."
Ron Weasley,"Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac."
Hermione Granger,He's vile.
Harry Potter,Ever heard of this spell?
Hermione Granger,No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
Ron Weasley,"Not bloody likely.  He's top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he's a genius."
Ron Weasley,What?
Hermione Granger,"I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?"
Harry Potter,No.
Hermione Granger,Why not?
Harry Potter,It's... old.  The binding is fragile.
Hermione Granger,The binding is fragile?
Ginny Weasley,Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
Hermione Granger,The who?
Ron Weasley,The who?
Ginny Weasley,That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.'
Hermione Granger,"For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?"
Harry Potter,"I didn't say I wasn't curious. And, by the way, I don't sleep with it."
Ron Weasley,"Yeah. Right. Well, it's true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you're always reading that bloody book.  It's like being with Hermione."
Hermione Granger,"Well, I was curious.  So I went to"
Harry Potter,The library.
Ron Weasley,The library.
Harry Potter,And?
Hermione Granger,And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
Harry Potter,Good.  That settles it then.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hey, you three!"
Hermione Granger,"What've you got there, Hagrid?"
Rubeus Hagrid,Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees 'ere are drippin' with it.
Hermione Granger,"Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"It's not fer me.  It's fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don' yeh?"
Ron Weasley,Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?
Rubeus Hagrid,Tha's the one.  He's taken ill. I'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. Keep yer fingers crossed.
Ron Weasley,Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?
Hermione Granger,"The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer."
Horace Slughorn,Filius!  I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks.
Filius Flitwick,"Emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace."
Harry Potter,Who's up for a Butterbeer?
Harry Potter,No.  Over here.
Harry Potter,"No, no.  Sit next to me."
Ron Weasley,O-kay.
Skinny kid,What'll we have?
Hermione Granger,"Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please."
Ron Weasley,"Aw, bloody hell..."
Hermione Granger,"Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands..."
Hermione Granger,And snogging.
Ron Weasley,I'd like to leave.
Hermione Granger,Leave?  You can't be serious.
Ron Weasley,That happens to be my sister.
Hermione Granger,So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?
Horace Slughorn,"Harry, m'boy!"
Harry Potter,"Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you."
Harry Potter,"So what brings you here, sir?"
Horace Slughorn,"Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back.  Longer than I'd care to admit.  In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick!"
Horace Slughorn,"Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!"
Horace Slughorn,"Listen, m'boy.  In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  Would you be game?"
Harry Potter,"I'd consider it an honor, sir."
Horace Slughorn,"You'd be welcome too, Granger."
Hermione Granger,"Be delighted, sir."
Horace Slughorn,"Brilliant.  Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby."
Ron Weasley,What're you playing at?
Harry Potter,Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
Ron Weasley,Get to know him?
Harry Potter,Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
Ron Weasley,Um... You've got a little...
Ron Weasley,Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if...
Leanne,Katie.  You don't know what it could be!
Hermione Granger,What's up?
Leanne,I warned her!  I warned her not to touch it!
Ron Weasley,"Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --"
Hermione Granger,I'll get someone --
Harry Potter,There's no time!
Rubeus Hagrid,Get back!  All o' yeh!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Now, now.  Now, now..."
Rubeus Hagrid,Don' go touchin' tha' but by the wrappin's.  Unnerstan'?
Minerva McGonagall,"You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?"
Leanne,It's like I said.  She went to the loo and when she came back she had the package.  She said it was important she deliver it.
Minerva McGonagall,Did she say to whom?
Minerva McGonagall,"All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens?"
Ron Weasley,"Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years."
Minerva McGonagall,Severus. Is this it?
Severus Snape,What do you think?
Severus Snape,I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
Harry Potter,"She was cursed, wasn't she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly."
Minerva McGonagall,Yes.  She was cursed.
Harry Potter,It was Malfoy.
Minerva McGonagall,"That's a very serious accusation, Potter."
Severus Snape,Indeed.  Your evidence?
Harry Potter,I... just... know.
Severus Snape,"You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One."
Minerva McGonagall,I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you.
Ron Weasley,What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.
Harry Potter,What does she see in him?
Ron Weasley,Dean?  He's brilliant.
Harry Potter,You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
Ron Weasley,"Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle."
Harry Potter,I suppose.
Ron Weasley,So what is it?  He sees in her?
Harry Potter,I don't know.  She's smart. Funny.  Attractive...
Ron Weasley,Attractive?
Harry Potter,You know.  She's... got nice skin.
Ron Weasley,Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
Harry Potter,"Well, no.  I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor."
Ron Weasley,"Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean."
Harry Potter,"I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice."
Harry Potter,I think I'll be going to sleep now.
Ron Weasley,Right.
Horace Slughorn,To Hogwarts' best and brightest!
Cormac McLaggen,"Here, here!"
Neville Longbottom,Which one do I use for the soup?
Horace Slughorn,"So tell me, Cormac.  See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?"
Cormac McLaggen,"Yes, sir.  In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him and the Minister for Magic over holiday."
Horace Slughorn,"Well, be sure to give them both my best.  What about your uncle, Belby?  Working on anything new? For those of you who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion."
Marcus Belby,Dunno.  He and me dad don't get on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish.  Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the --
Horace Slughorn,"And you, Miss Granger?  What is it your family does in the Muggle world?"
Hermione Granger,My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth.
Horace Slughorn,Fascinating.  And is that considered a dangerous profession?
Hermione Granger,"No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches."
Horace Slughorn,"Miss Weasley!  Come in, come in."
Ginny Weasley,"Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --"
Horace Slughorn,No matter.  You'll be just in time for dessert.  That is -- if Belby leaves you any.
Hermione Granger,Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean.
Harry Potter,What?
Hermione Granger,Nothing.
Horace Slughorn,"Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  We'll have to do it again."
Horace Slughorn,Oh.  Potter.
Harry Potter,"Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass."
Horace Slughorn,"Ah, yes.  A most intriguing object.  The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not..."
Harry Potter,I think I'll be going.
Horace Slughorn,"Nonsense.  You have nothing to fear, m'boy.  As for some of your classmates, well, let's just say, they're unlikely to make the shelf."
Harry Potter,"The shelf, sir?"
Horace Slughorn,"Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren't you, Harry?"
Harry Potter,"I don't really know how to answer that, sir."
Horace Slughorn,"Your mother was modest too.  Your father not so much.  As you can see, he did not make the shelf."
Harry Potter,"Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?"
Harry Potter,"You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher."
Horace Slughorn,Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts.
Harry Potter,What was he like?
Harry Potter,"I'm sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see..."
Horace Slughorn,"Of course.  It's only natural that you should want to know more.  I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I've known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within."
Neville Longbottom,"Good luck, eh, Ron?"
Seamus Finnigan,"Counting on you, Ron.  I've two Galleons on Gryffindor."
Ron Weasley,So.  How was it?
Hermione Granger,How was what?
Ron Weasley,Your dinner party.
Hermione Granger,Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
Hermione Granger,"Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone..."
Ron Weasley,I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?
Hermione Granger,"Actually, I was going to ask you."
Ron Weasley,Really?
Hermione Granger,Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
Lavender Brown,"Good luck today, Ron!  I know you'll be brilliant!"
Ron Weasley,I'm resigning.  After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot.
Harry Potter,Have it your way.  Juice?
Ron Weasley,Sure...
Luna Lovegood,"Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron."
Luna Lovegood,Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?
Hermione Granger,"Don't drink that, Ron!"
Hermione Granger,You could be expelled for that.
Harry Potter,Dunno what you're talking about.
Ron Weasley,"C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win."
Ginny Weasley,What's gotten into him?
Dean Thomas,Ginny!  Let's go!
Students,Weasley!  Weasley!  Weasley!
Hermione Granger,Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
Harry Potter,Yep.  Apparently it's his lucky day.
Hermione Granger,"You shouldn't have done it, Harry."
Harry Potter,"Yeah.  I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?"
Hermione Granger,That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --
Hermione Granger,You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?
Hermione Granger,Charms spell.  Just practicing.
Harry Potter,Ah.  Well... they're really good.
Hermione Granger,"How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her."
Lavender Brown,Oops.  I think this room's taken.
Ron Weasley,What's with the birds?
Hermione Granger,Oppugno!
Harry Potter,It feels like this.
Ron Weasley,"Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent."
Hermione Granger,"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements."
Harry Potter,Have you?
Hermione Granger,Yes.  Why?
Harry Potter,"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  As friends."
Hermione Granger,Why didn't I think of that?
Harry Potter,So who are you taking?
Hermione Granger,"Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion."
Harry Potter,Really...?
Hermione Granger,"Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?"
Harry Potter,But I am the Chosen One.
Harry Potter,Okay.  Kidding.  I'll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool.
Luna Lovegood,"I've never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It's why I wear shoes to bed."
Horace Slughorn,"Someone has taken a BITE out of it. Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of '78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of '67. Mingle, m'boy!  Mingle!  We're all friends here.  And we run the world."
Neville Longbottom,Drink?
Harry Potter,Neville...?
Neville Longbottom,I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club.  It's okay.  He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.
Eldred Worple,"Lovegood, did you say?  I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing.  Claimed to run a magazine..."
Harry Potter,What're you doing?
Harry Potter,And what's happened to you?
Hermione Granger,"Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe."
Harry Potter,Cormac!  That's who you invited!
Hermione Granger,I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
Waiter,Dragon tartar?
Hermione Granger,No thank you.
Waiter,Just as well.  They give one horribly bad breath.
Hermione Granger,"On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!"
Harry Potter,I think she went to powder her nose.
Cormac McLaggen,"Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?  Yak yak yak. What is this I'm eating, by the way?"
Harry Potter,Dragon balls.
Severus Snape,What's going on back here?
Severus Snape,"You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen."
Severus Snape,"Not so quick, Potter."
Harry Potter,"I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date..."
Severus Snape,... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
Severus Snape,"Besides, I only wish to convey a message."
Harry Potter,A message...?
Severus Snape,"From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes."
Harry Potter,Traveling?  Where?
Draco Malfoy,"Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!"
Argus Filch,"Professor Slughorn, sir!  I've just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.  He claims to have been invited to your party."
Draco Malfoy,"Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?"
Severus Snape,I'll escort him out.
Draco Malfoy,Certainly... Professor.
Draco Malfoy,Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't.  What's it to you?
Severus Snape,I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow --
Draco Malfoy,I don't need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won't fail him.
Severus Snape,"You're afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you --"
Draco Malfoy,No!  I was chosen.  This is my moment!
Ron Weasley,Unbreakable Vow.  You're sure that's what Snape said.
Harry Potter,Positive.  Why?
Ron Weasley,"It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow."
Harry Potter,"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough."
Ron Weasley,"No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell..."
Harry Potter,Lovely.
Ron Weasley,All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
Harry Potter,I'll take your word for it.
Harry Potter,So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
Ron Weasley,You die.
Molly Weasley,"Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come!"
Harry Potter,"Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help."
Remus Lupin,Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
Harry Potter,I know it sounds mad --
Remus Lupin,"Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?"
Harry Potter,That's not what it sounded like.
Nymphadora Tonks,"Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.  To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --"
Remus Lupin,"It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do."
Harry Potter,But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --
Remus Lupin,You're blinded by hatred.
Harry Potter,I'm not --
Remus Lupin,"You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed."
Ginny Weasley,"Open up, you."
Ginny Weasley,Don't trust me?
Harry Potter,It's good.
Ginny Weasley,'Course 'tis.  Made them myself.
Arthur Weasley,You'll have to forgive Remus.  It takes its toll -- his condition.
Harry Potter,"Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?"
Arthur Weasley,"We're being followed, all of us. Molly doesn't leave the house most days.  It's not been easy."
Harry Potter,Did you get my owl?
Arthur Weasley,"Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person.  If Dumbledore's traveling, it's news to the Ministry.  But perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.  As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more."
Harry Potter,Go on.
Arthur Weasley,"I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes.  From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet."
Harry Potter,A Vanishing Cabinet?
Arthur Weasley,"They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.  But they're tricky contraptions.  Require a tremendous amount of looking after.  Eventually they fell out of favor."
Harry Potter,What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?
Arthur Weasley,Nothing.  It's still there.
Arthur Weasley,"Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last."
Nymphadora Tonks,"It was delicious, Molly.  Really."
Molly Weasley,You're sure you won't stay?
Nymphadora Tonks,"No, we should go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst --"
Molly Weasley,Remus...?
Ginny Weasley,Everyone gone to bed?
Harry Potter,Soon.
Ginny Weasley,"I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?"
Ginny Weasley,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
Nymphadora Tonks,Sweetheart...
Remus Lupin,There's someone out there.  I can smell him.  There's more than one --
Ginny Weasley,Oh my god...
Arthur Weasley,"Harry, no!"
Nymphadora Tonks,Remus!
Arthur Weasley,"Ginny, stay with your mother!"
Ginny Weasley,"No, Harry!  It's a trap!"
Fenrir Greyback,Don't you smell clean.
Hermione Granger,"You have to realize who you are, Harry."
Harry Potter,"I know who I am, Hermione, alright?"
Hermione Granger,Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said.
Harry Potter,"If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet."
Hermione Granger,What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
Harry Potter,You tell me.
Hermione Granger,"He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill."
Harry Potter,Who could tell the difference?
Ron Weasley,"Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it."
Lavender Brown,That's my Won-Won.
Hermione Granger,"Excuse me, I have to go vomit."
Tom Riddle,"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
Horace Slughorn,"Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
Tom Riddle,Intuition.
Horace Slughorn,"Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
Horace Slughorn,"Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
Tom Riddle,I know a secret shortcut or two.
Horace Slughorn,"Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?"
Tom Riddle,"Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand."
Horace Slughorn,Go on.
Tom Riddle,"I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me..."
Horace Slughorn,I don't know anything about such things and I wouldn't tell you if I did!  Now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again!
Albus Dumbledore,Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't.
Harry Potter,I don't understand -- what happened?
Albus Dumbledore,"This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn."
Harry Potter,But why would he tamper with his own memory?
Albus Dumbledore,I suspect he is ashamed of it.
Harry Potter,Why?
Albus Dumbledore,Why indeed.
Albus Dumbledore,I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so.
Albus Dumbledore,Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can.
Harry Potter,"I don't know him that well, sir --"
Albus Dumbledore,"You're the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins."
Albus Dumbledore,"This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail."
Horace Slughorn,"Now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  I'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  I'm joking!  Off you go! Don't forget your rattails, Miss Alys."
Horace Slughorn,Ah! If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself!  To what do I owe the pleasure?
Harry Potter,"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something."
Horace Slughorn,"Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!"
Harry Potter,"Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic..."
Horace Slughorn,Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic.
Harry Potter,"I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?"
Horace Slughorn,"I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape."
Harry Potter,"Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  He might... misunderstand."
Horace Slughorn,"There can be no light without the dark.  And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light.  I suggest you do the same."
Harry Potter,"Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions."
Horace Slughorn,Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn't he?  Didn't he!
Harry Potter,Sir --
Hermione Granger,"Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One."
Harry Potter,Nice.
Hermione Granger,"You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder."
Harry Potter,Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
Harry Potter,I've seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.
Hermione Granger,That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
Harry Potter,The Map is never wrong.
Ron Weasley,"It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon."
Harry Potter,"Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?"
Ron Weasley,It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one...
Harry Potter,Or twenty.
Ron Weasley,"I can't stop thinking about her, Harry."
Harry Potter,"Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you."
Ron Weasley,She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.
Harry Potter,Excuse me?
Harry Potter,Well... Brilliant.
Ron Weasley,Do you think she knows I exist?
Harry Potter,Bloody well hope so.  She's been snogging you for three months.
Ron Weasley,Snogging?  Who're you talking about?
Harry Potter,Who're you talking about?
Ron Weasley,"Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane."
Harry Potter,Okay.  Very funny.
Harry Potter,What the hell was that for?
Ron Weasley,It's no joke!  I'm in love with her!
Harry Potter,Okay!  Fine!  You're in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!
Ron Weasley,No.  Can you introduce me?
Harry Potter,"Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane."
Ron Weasley,How do I look?
Harry Potter,Devastatingly handsome.
Horace Slughorn,Damn it all!
Horace Slughorn,Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It's you.  I'm afraid I'm busy at the moment --
Harry Potter,Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
Ron Weasley,Where's Romilda?
Horace Slughorn,What's the matter with Wenby?
Horace Slughorn,Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in.
Horace Slughorn,"I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you."
Harry Potter,"I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir."
Ron Weasley,"Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?"
Horace Slughorn,Hm.  Perhaps you're right.
Harry Potter,"I'm sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding."
Horace Slughorn,"Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?"
Harry Potter,"I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort."
Horace Slughorn,I'll ask you not to use that name.
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir.  It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible."
Horace Slughorn,"With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived."
Horace Slughorn,"Alright, m'boy!  Bottoms up!"
Ron Weasley,What's this?
Horace Slughorn,A tonic for the nerves.
Ron Weasley,What happened to me?
Harry Potter,Love potion.
Horace Slughorn,And a bloody strong one at that.
Ron Weasley,I feel really... bad.
Horace Slughorn,"Pick-me-up's what you need, m'boy. Do us all good, I think.  I've got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances..."
Horace Slughorn,"There we are, Potter.  To life!"
Harry Potter,"Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!"
Horace Slughorn,I d-don't understand --
Harry Potter,Professor!  Do something!!
Harry Potter,He's choking!!
Harry Potter,"Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!"
Ron Weasley,"These girls are gonna kill me, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,"Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?"
Horace Slughorn,Hm?  Oh.  Yes... very proud.
Minerva McGonagall,I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.
Albus Dumbledore,Why indeed.
Albus Dumbledore,"This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison."
Horace Slughorn,Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
Albus Dumbledore,To whom might I ask?
Horace Slughorn,"You, Headmaster."
Lavender Brown,Where is he?  Where's my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here?
Hermione Granger,I might ask you the same.
Lavender Brown,I happen to be his girlfriend.
Hermione Granger,I happen to be his... friend.
Lavender Brown,Don't make me laugh.  You haven't spoken in weeks.  I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting.
Hermione Granger,"He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting."
Lavender Brown,"Ha!  See? He senses my presence. I'm here, Won-Won. I'm here --"
Ron Weasley,Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!
Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended."
Ginny Weasley,"'Bout time, don't you think?"
Horace Slughorn,I've always cherished my students. They're my life...
Hermione Granger,Oh shut up.
Hermione Granger,Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow.
Ron Weasley,Huh?
Ron Weasley,Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
Hermione Granger,"Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --"
Ron Weasley,Don't get me wrong.  I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It's just she seems... a bit put out.
Hermione Granger,"Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?"
Ron Weasley,"Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?"
Hermione Granger,Right.  Boggled...
Hermione Granger,That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell.
Harry Potter,"How are you, Katie?"
Katie Bell,"Give me a moment, girls."
Katie Bell,"I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've tried to remember.  Honestly. But I just... can't..."
Draco Malfoy,Cruci--
Harry Potter,Sectumsempra!
Draco Malfoy,Don't touch me!  Don't you dare touch me!
Ginny Weasley,You have to get rid of it.  Today.
Ginny Weasley,Take my hand.
Harry Potter,The Room of Requirement...
Ginny Weasley,"Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself."
Harry Potter,Who showed you this?  First.
Ginny Weasley,Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it...
Ginny Weasley,What was that?
Ginny Weasley,"See, you never know what you'll find up here."
Ginny Weasley,All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted.
Ginny Weasley,There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...
Ginny Weasley,"That can stay hidden up here too, if you like."
Ron Weasley,So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
Harry Potter,What?
Ron Weasley,You know.  Hide the book.
Harry Potter,Oh.  Yeah.
Ron Weasley,"Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?"
Harry Potter,Say that again.
Hermione Granger,Well?  How do you feel?
Harry Potter,Excellent.  Really excellent.
Hermione Granger,"Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office."
Harry Potter,Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's.
Hermione Granger,"What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --"
Harry Potter,"No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?"
Hermione Granger,No.
Ron Weasley,No.
Harry Potter,Trust me.  I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does.
Horace Slughorn,"Merlin's beard, Harry!"
Harry Potter,"Sorry, sir.  I should've announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout."
Horace Slughorn,"Well, yes, actually -- Why would you think that?"
Harry Potter,"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?"
Horace Slughorn,"Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I'm familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all.  My own interests are purely academic, of course."
Harry Potter,"Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out."
Horace Slughorn,"Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?"
Harry Potter,"Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going."
Horace Slughorn,Harry!
Harry Potter,Sir?
Horace Slughorn,It's nearly nightfall.  Surely you realize I can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.
Harry Potter,"Well, then by all means come along, sir."
Horace Slughorn,"Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!"
Harry Potter,"That would be counterproductive, sir."
Horace Slughorn,And what makes you say that?
Harry Potter,No idea.
Horace Slughorn,Merlin's beard...
Horace Slughorn,Is that an actual Acromantula?
Harry Potter,"A dead one, I think, sir."
Rubeus Hagrid,'Arry.  'Orace.
Horace Slughorn,"My god, dear man.  How did you ever manage to kill it?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"Kill 'im! Me oldest friend, 'e was!"
Horace Slughorn,"I'm sorry, I... didn't realize."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Ah, don' worry yerself.  Yer not alone.  Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.  It's the eyes, I reckon.  Unnerve people."
Harry Potter,Not to mention the pincers.
Rubeus Hagrid,I reckon that too... How'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?
Harry Potter,Through the front doors.
Horace Slughorn,"Hagrid.  I wouldn't want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits..."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit?"
Horace Slughorn,"My thoughts exactly!  Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  Old Potion Master's habit, you know..."
Rubeus Hagrid,Wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.  Magnificent 'e was.  Jus' magnificent...
Horace Slughorn,Why don't I say a few words?  I trust he had family?
Harry Potter,Oh yeah.
Horace Slughorn,Farewell...
Rubeus Hagrid,Aragog.
Horace Slughorn,"Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids.  Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home.  May your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained."
Rubeus Hagrid,Tha' was... tha' was... beautiful.
Horace Slughorn,"And Odo the hero, they bore him back home..."
Rubeus Hagrid,"To the place he'd known as a lad, They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad..."
Rubeus Hagrid,"I had 'im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  No bigger'n a Pekinese."
Horace Slughorn,Sweet.  I once had a fish. Francis.  Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he'd vanished.  Poof.
Rubeus Hagrid,Tha's odd.
Horace Slughorn,"Isn't it?  That's life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof."
Horace Slughorn,"That's never unicorn hair, Hagrid?"
Horace Slughorn,"Hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  Nods."
Horace Slughorn,"But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth?"
Rubeus Hagrid,No idea... no idea at all...
Horace Slughorn,"It was a student who gave me Francis.  One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  The petal had come from a lily."
Horace Slughorn,"Your mother.  The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she..."
Horace Slughorn,I know what you want.  But I can't give it to you.  It will ruin me...
Harry Potter,Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.
Harry Potter,Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
Horace Slughorn,Please don't say his --
Harry Potter,"I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I'm not afraid of him.  And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep."
Harry Potter,"Professor.  I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It's true.  I am the Chosen One."
Harry Potter,"Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him."
Harry Potter,"Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever."
Horace Slughorn,Don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.  You don't know what he was like... even then.
Albus Dumbledore,How is he?  Horace?
Tom Riddle,"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
Horace Slughorn,"Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
Tom Riddle,Intuition.
Horace Slughorn,"Good gracious, is it that time already?  Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
Horace Slughorn,"Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
Tom Riddle,I know a secret shortcut or two.
Horace Slughorn,"Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?"
Tom Riddle,"Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other Professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand."
Horace Slughorn,Go on.
Tom Riddle,"I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.  It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux."
Horace Slughorn,Excuse me?
Tom Riddle,Horcrux.  I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.
Horace Slughorn,"I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed."
Tom Riddle,"Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to you.  I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you."
Horace Slughorn,A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
Tom Riddle,"Yes, I thought it might be something like that.  But I don't understand how that works, sir."
Horace Slughorn,"One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.  By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed."
Tom Riddle,Protected?
Horace Slughorn,"That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  In other words, you cannot die."
Tom Riddle,"How does one split his soul, sir?"
Horace Slughorn,"I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom."
Tom Riddle,Murder.
Horace Slughorn,"Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same."
Tom Riddle,"Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once?  For instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number --"
Horace Slughorn,"Seven!  Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?  To rip the soul into seven pieces..."
Horace Slughorn,"This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?  All academic..."
Tom Riddle,"Of course, sir.  And I promise I'll not speak of our conversation.  It'll be our little secret..."
Harry Potter,Sir --
Albus Dumbledore,This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.
Harry Potter,"Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us."
Harry Potter,Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?
Albus Dumbledore,"They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book..."
Harry Potter,Tom Riddle's diary --
Albus Dumbledore,"It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful..."
Harry Potter,And the ring...?
Albus Dumbledore,Belonged to Voldemort's mother. It was difficult to find and...
Harry Potter,... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
Albus Dumbledore,One destroys Voldemort.
Harry Potter,"But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they..."
Albus Dumbledore,"True.  But magic, especially Dark magic..."
Albus Dumbledore,... leaves traces.
Harry Potter,"It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  When you leave the school."
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
Albus Dumbledore,"Once again, I shall ask too much of you."
Hermione Granger,Harry.  It's time.
Harry Potter,"Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?"
Hermione Granger,If one wants it to be.  Why?
Harry Potter,It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
Harry Potter,He was going to the Room of Requirement.
Hermione Granger,"Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!"
Ron Weasley,No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there.
Harry Potter,But I'm telling you.  I saw it --
Harry Potter,What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.
Hermione Granger,What if there are?
Harry Potter,I don't know...
Ron Weasley,"Good luck, mate."
Harry Potter,I don't need luck.  I'll be with Dumbledore.
Severus Snape,Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
Albus Dumbledore,"Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss."
Albus Dumbledore,"Harry.  You need a shave, my friend."
Albus Dumbledore,"At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man."
Harry Potter,"You look the same to me, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind."
Albus Dumbledore,A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid.
Albus Dumbledore,"The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question."
Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide."
Albus Dumbledore,"Should I tell you to run, you will run."
Albus Dumbledore,And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...
Albus Dumbledore,You will do so.
Albus Dumbledore,"Your word, Harry."
Harry Potter,My word.
Albus Dumbledore,Take my arm.
Harry Potter,"Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts."
Albus Dumbledore,Being me has its privileges.
Harry Potter,"It's there, isn't it?"
Albus Dumbledore,"This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty..."
Albus Dumbledore,"One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged."
Harry Potter,Sir!
Albus Dumbledore,"In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder."
Harry Potter,"You should've let me, sir."
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine."
Albus Dumbledore,Careful.  The water.
Albus Dumbledore,It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it?
Harry Potter,"We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?"
Harry Potter,Accio Horcrux!
Albus Dumbledore,Perhaps not.
Albus Dumbledore,"If you would, Harry..."
Harry Potter,Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
Albus Dumbledore,"Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one's own luck."
Harry Potter,Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Albus Dumbledore,Remember... the water.
Harry Potter,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,Oh yes.
Albus Dumbledore,It has to be drunk.
Albus Dumbledore,"You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?"
Harry Potter,"Why can't I drink it, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry."
Harry Potter,Professor?
Harry Potter,Professor?  Can you hear me?
Albus Dumbledore,Don't... don't make me...
Harry Potter,"You... you can't stop, Professor. You've got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember."
Albus Dumbledore,Nooooooo!!!
Albus Dumbledore,Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
Harry Potter,"It will, sir.  It'll stop.  But only if you drink..."
Albus Dumbledore,My fault.  It's all my fault...
Albus Dumbledore,"Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!"
Harry Potter,What?
Albus Dumbledore,"Your word, Harry!  Your word!"
Harry Potter,No...
Albus Dumbledore,Kill me!  It's the only way!
Harry Potter,One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I'll do what you say.
Harry Potter,I promise.
Albus Dumbledore,Water. Water...
Albus Dumbledore,Aguamenti.
Harry Potter,"You did it, sir.  Look --"
Albus Dumbledore,Water!
Harry Potter,"I'm trying, sir.  I'm --"
Albus Dumbledore,Go...
Albus Dumbledore,We have to... go.
Harry Potter,"Don't worry, sir.  We're nearly there."
Albus Dumbledore,"I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you."
Minerva McGonagall,To your Houses.  No dawdling.
Harry Potter,"We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --"
Albus Dumbledore,No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...
Albus Dumbledore,Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...
Harry Potter,All right.  Okay.
Harry Potter,"Sir, are you... praying?"
Albus Dumbledore,"No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate."
Albus Dumbledore,Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.
Albus Dumbledore,"Do as I say, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,Trust me.
Albus Dumbledore,"Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?"
Draco Malfoy,Who else is here?  I heard you talking.
Albus Dumbledore,"I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?"
Albus Dumbledore,"You are not an assassin, Draco."
Draco Malfoy,How do you know what I am?  I've done things that would shock you.
Albus Dumbledore,"Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?"
Draco Malfoy,He trusts me!  I was chosen!
Albus Dumbledore,Then I shall make it easy for you.
Draco Malfoy,Expelliarumus!
Albus Dumbledore,"Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy."
Albus Dumbledore,You're not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?
Draco Malfoy,The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
Albus Dumbledore,That cabinet has been broken for years.
Draco Malfoy,I've been mending it.
Albus Dumbledore,Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.
Draco Malfoy,In Borgin & Burkes.  They form --
Albus Dumbledore,"A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco."
Draco Malfoy,I don't want your help!  Don't you see!  I have to do it!  I have to! I've got to kill you or he'll kill me.
Albus Dumbledore,"Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time."
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore.  Wandless and alone."
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Cornered in his own castle.  Well done, Draco."
Albus Dumbledore,"Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order."
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Love to, Albus.  But I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule."
Fenrir Greyback,Do it.
Bellatrix Lestrange,He doesn't have the stomach.  Like his father.  Let me finish him. In my own way.
Severus Snape,"No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy's to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now!"
Severus Snape,No.
Albus Dumbledore,Severus...
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Well, look who's here.  Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Come to see the slaughter?"
Albus Dumbledore,Severus... please.
Severus Snape,I gave my word.  I made a vow...
Severus Snape,Avada Kedavra!
Severus Snape,You can no longer stay here.
Bellatrix Lestrange,Boo.
Bellatrix Lestrange,Draco!  Draco! They'll kill you if you stay.
Severus Snape,Go on!
Severus Snape,Go on!
Harry Potter,Cruciatus!
Harry Potter,Incacerata!
Harry Potter,Impedimenta!
Harry Potter,"Fight!  Fight back, you coward!"
Severus Snape,Don't ever associate that word and my name again.
Severus Snape,No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!
Harry Potter,Sectumsempra!
Severus Snape,"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"
Severus Snape,"You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  Yes.  It's me.  I'm the Half-Blood Prince."
Harry Potter,Hagrid... HAGRID!
Harry Potter,Hagrid!  You alright?
Rubeus Hagrid,"Take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  Not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  But if anybody can put it righ', Dumbledore can."
Harry Potter,"Hagrid, Dumbledore --"
Rubeus Hagrid,Only thing I can't reckon is wha' Snape was doin' with tha' lot.
Rubeus Hagrid,"An' wha's this wi' the Dark Mar'? Who's been killed? Where's Dumbledore, 'arry? Where's Dumbledore!!"
Minerva McGonagall,Potter.
Minerva McGonagall,"Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone..."
Minerva McGonagall,You should know... Professor Dumbledore...
Minerva McGonagall,You meant a great deal to him.
Hermione Granger,Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
Harry Potter,"No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing..."
Hermione Granger,Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul...
Harry Potter,"Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake."
Harry Potter,Go on.  Open it.
Hermione Granger,"'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'"
Harry Potter,"Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it."
Hermione Granger,"Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum."
Harry Potter,"I'm not coming back, Hermione."
Hermione Granger,We reckoned -- Ron and me.
Harry Potter,I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
Hermione Granger,"I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick."
Hermione Granger,"You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry."
Harry Potter,Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I'm around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum.
Hermione Granger,Like that's going to happen.
Hermione Granger,"Besides, he's barking."
Harry Potter,"Funny, he says the same about you."
Hermione Granger,"Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive."
Harry Potter,You're brilliant.  You both are.
Hermione Granger,Do you think we'll ever... come back?
Harry Potter,I don't know. I never realised how beautiful this place was.
Rufus Scrimgeour,"These are dark times, there is no denying.  Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.  But I say this to our citizenry:  we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong..."
Mrs. Granger,"Hermione.  Your tea is ready, dear."
Hermione Granger,"Coming, Mum."
Mrs. Granger,Don't you look lovely.  All packed?
Mr. Granger,Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free?
Mrs. Granger,"Quite sure, dear.  See the big bold letters that say 'Sugar Free'?  Dead giveaway."
Mr. Granger,"Mm.  Yes. Hello, kitten.  Don't you look lovely."
Mrs. Granger,"Darling, don't be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be grateful the company's so clever..."
Hermione Granger,Obliviate.
Hermione Granger,Goodbye.
Ron Weasley,What are those?
Arthur Weasley,Close the door.
Arthur Weasley,"These are for the Order.  So many are on the run now, it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us.  Know they're not alone..."
Ron Weasley,C'mon.  Mum's got dinner ready.
Voldemort,Severus.  I was beginning to worry you'd lost your way.  Come.  I've saved you a seat.
Voldemort,"You know our hosts, of course, Severus.  Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable.  Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence.  Are you, Lucius?"
Lucius Malfoy,My lord?
Voldemort,Are you burdened?
Narcissa Malfoy,My lord is always welcome here.
Voldemort,"You bring news I trust, Severus?"
Severus Snape,It will happen Saturday next.  At nightfall.
Voldemort,And this information comes --
Severus Snape,-- from the source we discussed.
Corban Yaxley,"I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before he turns seventeen."
Severus Snape,This is a false trail.  The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.
Death Eater,"Well, they've got that right, then, 'aven't they?"
Voldemort,"Pius, what say you?"
Pius Thicknesse,"One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear."
Voldemort,"Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.  Where will he be taken?  The boy?"
Severus Snape,"To a safehouse.  Likely the home of someone in the Order.  I'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.  We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him.  As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety."
Bellatrix Lestrange,"My lord, if I might, I'd like to volunteer myself for this task. I'd like to kill the boy."
Voldemort,Wormtail!  Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
Peter Pettigrew,"Yes, m-my lord.  Right away, my lord."
Voldemort,"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  But I face an unfortunate complication.  It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins.  We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another's wand."
Voldemort,"Come now.  Surely one of you would like the honor?  What about... you, Lucius?"
Voldemort,I require your wand.
Voldemort,Do I detect elm?
Lucius Malfoy,"Yes, my lord."
Voldemort,And the core?
Lucius Malfoy,Dragon -- dragon heartstring.
Voldemort,My wand?  You can't possibly think I would give you my wand.
Lucius Malfoy,"No, my lord."
Voldemort,"For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us."
Voldemort,"She would, given her way, have us mate with them.  To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.  I, of course, take a contrary view.  But we're all civilized here.  All adults.  We can agree to disagree."
Charity Burbage,"Severus, please.  We're friends..."
Voldemort,Avada Kedavra!
Voldemort,Nagini... Dinner.
Vernon Dursley,"Come now, Dudley.  Hurry up!"
Harry Potter,Time for the teary farewell.
Petunia Dursley,I've lived in this house twenty years.  And now -- in a single night -- I'm expected to leave.
Harry Potter,"They'll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--"
Petunia Dursley,You think I don't know that?  You think I don't know what they're capable of?
Petunia Dursley,"You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know.  I lost a sister."
Harry Potter,Do you have any?  Magic?
Petunia Dursley,What a cruel thing to ask.
Vernon Dursley,"Well, this is goodbye then, boy."
Dudley Dursley,I don't understand.  Isn't he coming with us?
Vernon Dursley,Who?
Dudley Dursley,Harry.
Vernon Dursley,Absolutely not.
Dudley Dursley,Why?
Vernon Dursley,"Well, because -- he doesn't want to, do you, boy?"
Harry Potter,"Absolutely not.  Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  Isn't that right, Vernon?"
Vernon Dursley,"Come on, Dudley, we're off."
Dudley Dursley,I don't think you're a waste of space.
Harry Potter,Well... thanks.
Harry Potter,"See you, Big D."
Harry Potter,Good riddance.
Rubeus Hagrid,"All righ', 'arry?  Yeh look fit."
Alastor Moody,"Yeah, he's ruddy gorgeous.  What say we get undercover before someone murders him."
Harry Potter,"I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley."
Kingsley Shacklebolt,You're more important.
Bill Weasley,"Hello, Harry.  Bill Weasley."
Fred Weasley,Wasn't always this handsome.
George Weasley,Dead ugly.
Bill Weasley,True enough.  Owe it all to a werewolf by name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day.
Fleur Delacour,"You are still beautiful to me, William."
Remus Lupin,"Just remember, Fleur, once you're married:  Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now."
Nymphadora Tonks,"My husband, the joker.  By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are --"
Alastor Moody,"All right, all right!  You'll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!  We've got to get the hell out of here and soon!"
Alastor Moody,"Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you."
Harry Potter,The Trace?
Alastor Moody,"You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.  Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We'll go in pairs.  That way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one."
Harry Potter,The real one...?
Alastor Moody,I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.
Harry Potter,No!  Absolutely not!
Hermione Granger,I told you he'd take it well.
Harry Potter,If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me --
Ron Weasley,"Never done that before, have we?"
Harry Potter,This is different.  Taking that. Becoming me -- no.
Fred Weasley,"Well, none of us really fancy it, mate."
George Weasley,"Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever."
Alastor Moody,"Everyone here's of age, Potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk."
Mundungus Fletcher,"Technically, I've been coerced. Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I've always been a huge admirer."
Alastor Moody,"Nip it, Mundungus!  All right, Granger, as discussed."
Harry Potter,"Blimey, Hermione!"
Alastor Moody,"Straight in here, if you please."
Alastor Moody,"For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning.  It tastes like goblin piss."
Fred Weasley,"Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?"
Fred Weasley,Just trying to defuse the tension.
Fred Weasley,Wow -- we're identical!
George Weasley,Wow -- we're identical!
Alastor Moody,Not yet you aren't.
George Weasley,"Don't have something a bit more sporty, do you?"
Fred Weasley,"Yes, don't fancy this color at all."
Alastor Moody,"Fancy this:  You're not you, so shut it and strip. You'll need to change too, Potter."
Fleur Delacour,"Bill, look away -- I'm 'ideous."
Ron Weasley,I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, your eyesight really is awful."
Alastor Moody,Blimey.  I almost forgot.
Alastor Moody,"Right then.  We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. As for you, Harry..."
Harry Potter,Yes?
Alastor Moody,"The real Harry!  Where the devil are you, anyway?"
Harry Potter,Here.
Alastor Moody,You'll ride with Hagrid.
Rubeus Hagrid,Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ' I should be the one ter take yeh away.
Alastor Moody,"Yeah, it's all very touching. Let's go."
Alastor Moody,"Good luck, everyone.  On the count of three.  One... two --"
Harry Potter,Hagrid!  We've got to help the others!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Can't do it, 'arry.  My job's ter get you where we're goin' safe 'n sound -- Mad-Eye's orders!"
Harry Potter,What was that?
Rubeus Hagrid,Dragon fire!
Death Eater,That's him!  The real one!
Rubeus Hagrid,"Hol' tight, 'arry!  We've got ter get yeh out of here!"
Harry Potter,Hagrid... HAGRID...!
Voldemort,Avada...
Molly Weasley,Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?! Have you seen the others?
Harry Potter,Is no one back yet?
Rubeus Hagrid,"They were on us from the star', Molly -- the Death Eaters.  And You-Know-Who as well."
Molly Weasley,"Well, thank goodness you two are all right."
Rubeus Hagrid,"Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?  Fer medicinal purposes?"
Ginny Weasley,Ron and Tonks should've already been back.  Dad and Fred as well.
Ginny Weasley,Oh my God!  George!
Remus Lupin,The house!  Quickly!
Molly Weasley,My boy!  My darling boy!  What've they done to you?!
Ginny Weasley,Remus!  What're you doing!
Remus Lupin,What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!
Harry Potter,Are you mad...?
Remus Lupin,What Creature!
Harry Potter,A grindylow!
Remus Lupin,We've been betrayed.  Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an imposter.
Harry Potter,Who did this to him?
Remus Lupin,"Snape. He'll be fine, Molly.  But that's Dark Magic.  The damage is done."
Rubeus Hagrid,Someone else is back.
Kingsley Shacklebolt,The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?
Remus Lupin,'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.'
Kingsley Shacklebolt,What gave you away?
Harry Potter,Hedwig -- I think.  She was trying to protect me --
Ron Weasley,Hey ya -- Well... thanks.
Nymphadora Tonks,"Deserves that.  Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him."
Hermione Granger,Really?
Ron Weasley,Always the tone of surprise.
Arthur Weasley,Are we the last?  Where's George?
Arthur Weasley,Remus.  Where's my son?
Fred Weasley,"How do you feel, Georgie?"
George Weasley,Saint-like.
Fred Weasley,Come again?
George Weasley,"Saint-like... You see, I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?"
Fred Weasley,"With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey?  Pathetic."
George Weasley,"Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.  Better-looking than Bill, that's for sure."
Bill Weasley,Mad-Eye's dead.
Bill Weasley,Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.
Remus Lupin,Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror.  He knew he'd be in the most danger.
Arthur Weasley,It doesn't explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight.
Rubeus Hagrid,"Wha'?  One of us?  Tha's mad.  I'd wager me life it wasn' none of you lot.  An' if it was me I'd kno', wouldn' I?  Talk in me sleep on occasion, I'll admit, but there's only Fang aroun' ter hear an' mostly it's gibberish an' besides I'd cut me tongue out 'fore 'd betray 'arry e'en in me dreams --"
Rubeus Hagrid,Wha's so funny!
Harry Potter,"I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?"
Rubeus Hagrid,"'Ear, 'ear."
Remus Lupin,Better.
Garrick Ollivander,"No!  No!  I believed a different wand would work, I swear!"
Voldemont,Then explain this!
Garrick Ollivander,But it makes no sense...
Voldemort,"Perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail."
Garrick Ollivander,No!  There must be a way!  I'll think of something else!
Voldemont,"I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake.  I won't be so forgiving next time..."
Ron Weasley,Going somewhere?
Harry Potter,No one else is going to die.  Not for me.
Ron Weasley,"For you?  You think Madeye died for you?  You think George took that curse for you?  You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that."
Harry Potter,Come with me.  Now.
Ron Weasley,And leave Hermione?  Are you mad? We wouldn't last two days without her.
Ron Weasley,"Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.  And there's the wedding..."
Harry Potter,Wedding?
Ron Weasley,"Bill and Fleur.  Mum's been planning it for months.  Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon.  She'll kill me if I miss it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest."
Harry Potter,I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It's the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
Ron Weasley,"Tonight's not the night, mate. You'd only be doing him a favor."
Ron Weasley,Do you think he knows?
Ron Weasley,"I mean, they're bits of his soul, the Horcruxes.  Bits of him.  When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?"
Ron Weasley,"What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one..."
Ron Weasley,Won't he know he's being hunted?
Arthur Weasley,All together now!
Arthur Weasley,One.  Two.  Three!
Ginny Weasley,Were you going to tell me?
Harry Potter,Yes.
Ginny Weasley,And Ron and Hermione.  They'll not be going back to Hogwarts either?
Ginny Weasley,I see.
Harry Potter,"Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.  If I tell you, I'd be betraying him."
Ginny Weasley,"Zip me up, will you."
Ginny Weasley,"Seems silly, doesn't it?  A wedding.  Given everything that's going on."
Harry Potter,Maybe that's the best reason to have it.  Because of everything that's going on.
George Weasley,Morning.
Arthur Weasley,"How's it look on your end, boys?"
Fred Weasley,Brilliant!
George Weasley,"Bloody hell, what's the Minister of Magic doing here?"
Ron Weasley,Dunno.  But something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride.
Harry Potter,"To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?"
Rufus Scrimgeour,"I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter."
Harry Potter,And this would be...?
Rufus Scrimgeour,"Don't be coy, Mr. Potter.  Mr. Weasley.  Would you say you were close to your former Headmaster?"
Ron Weasley,Dumbledore?  And me?  I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  He was always polite --
Rufus Scrimgeour,"And you, Miss Granger?  How would you characterize your relationship?"
Hermione Granger,"We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --"
Harry Potter,What's this all about?
Rufus Scrimgeour,"This.  Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased Headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will.  Now why do you suppose that would be?"
Harry Potter,No idea.
Rufus Scrimgeour,"Come now, you don't expect me to believe..."
Rufus Scrimgeour,"'Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.'"
Ron Weasley,Dumbledore left this?  For me? Brilliant.  Er -- what is it?
Ron Weasley,Wicked.
Rufus Scrimgeour,"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'"
Ron Weasley,"Mum used to read me those!  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump..."
Ron Weasley,"Oh, c'mon!  Beedle's stories are famous!  Babbity Rabbitty? No...?"
Rufus Scrimgeour,"'To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill."
Harry Potter,That's it then?
Rufus Scrimgeour,"Not quite.  Dumbledore left you a second bequest:  The Sword of Godric Gryffindor.  Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.  As an important historical artifact, it belongs..."
Hermione Granger,To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!
Rufus Scrimgeour,"The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger.  That does not make it that wizard's property.  And in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown."
Harry Potter,Excuse me?
Rufus Scrimgeour,"The sword is missing. I won't pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter.  But I assure you I'm not your enemy."
Harry Potter,"You'll forgive me, Minister.  But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days."
Rufus Scrimgeour,Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke.
Hermione Granger,"Where is your guard, sir?"
Rufus Scrimgeour,I came alone.  I don't really need them anymore...
Remus Lupin,We want you to be the godfather.
Harry Potter,You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to say.
Remus Lupin,Say yes.
Luna Lovegood,"Hello, Harry!"
Luna Lovegood,"Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?  I can see it growing smaller in your eyes."
Harry Potter,"No, 'course not.  How are you, Luna?"
Luna Lovegood,Very well.  I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.
Xenophilius Lovegood,Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!  Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!
Harry Potter,"Nice to meet you, sir."
Xenophilius Lovegood,"I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully."
Luna Lovegood,"Come, Daddy.  Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.  He's just too nice to say so."
Harry Potter,Sir?  May I sit down?
Elphias Doge,Mr. Potter!  By all means!
Harry Potter,"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?"
Elphias Doge,"I certainly knew him the longest, if you don't count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth."
Harry Potter,"I never even knew he had a brother, sir."
Elphias Doge,"Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private.  Even as a boy."
Harry Potter,"Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died."
Elphias Doge,The occasional owl.  Though it was strange...
Harry Potter,"Strange, sir?"
Elphias Doge,It was the owls themselves.  They often arrived in distress.  It was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases.
Harry Potter,"Could you tell me from where they'd come, sir?"
Elphias Doge,"I'm afraid not.  Albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.  They were surprisingly intimate.  When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.  Still, I sensed he was under great stress.  Why do you ask?"
Harry Potter,Just curious.  I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.
Elphias Doge,"Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that.  I can also tell you that when a person passes, it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me."
Woman,"Don't despair, Elphias.  I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter.  In 800 pages no less."
Elphias Doge,"That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it."
Muriel,"Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth.  I read your obituary, Elphias.  Lovely.  But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in Dumbledore's life."
Elphias Doge,"I'm sorry you think so, Muriel.  I assure you I was writing from the heart."
Muriel,"Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn't made that mistake, I'm sure.  Word has it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.  You and I both know who that is, Elphias."
Elphias Doge,A monstrous betrayal.  I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered.
Harry Potter,Who are you talking about?
Muriel,"Well, I don't suppose it'll be a secret once the book comes out. Bathilda Bagshot."
Harry Potter,Who?
Muriel,"Who? Bathilda Bagshot!  My god, boy, she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.  Don't they read History of Magic at Hogwarts anymore?"
Harry Potter,"Oh, right.  Slipped my mind..."
Muriel,"She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone.  She'd have letters, perhaps an interesting photograph or two.  I'm sure Rita Skeeter would have thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage."
Harry Potter,Godric's Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Muriel,For years now.  That's where she first met Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,Excuse me?  You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?
Muriel,"Of course.  The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.  It was quite the scandal. Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?"
Patronus,The Ministry has fallen.  The Minister of Magic is dead.  They are coming...
Elphias Doge,"Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!"
Hermione Granger,Ron!  Ron!
Remus Lupin,Harry!  Go!  Go!
Ron Weasley,Where are we?
Hermione Granger,Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don't know why...
Hermione Granger,This way!
Hermione Granger,We need to change.
Ron Weasley,How the ruddy --
Hermione Granger,Undetectable Extension Charm.
Ron Weasley,"You're amazing, you are."
Hermione Granger,Always the tone of surprise.
Hermione Granger,That'll be the books.
Harry Potter,Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?  Maybe we should --
Ron Weasley,"They were after you, mate.  We'd just put everyone in danger going back."
Hermione Granger,"Ron's right.  Cappuccino, please."
Ron Weasley,What she said.
Harry Potter,Same.
Woman,Wicked scar.
Ron Weasley,So where do we go from here?  The Leaky Cauldron?
Hermione Granger,"Too dangerous.  If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe."
Harry Potter,My rucksack.  With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --
Harry Potter,You're joking.
Hermione Granger,I've had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case.
Ron Weasley,By the way -- these jeans?  Not my favorite.  Bit tight.
Harry Potter,Down!
Harry Potter,Stupefy!
Hermione Granger,Petrificus Totalus! Go.
Hermione Granger,She doesn't argue.
Harry Potter,"Lock the door, get the lights."
Harry Potter,This one's name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
Ron Weasley,This is Dolohov.  I recognize him from the wanted posters.
Ron Weasley,"So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?"
Ron Weasley,Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?
Harry Potter,"It's better we wipe their memories.  We kill them, they'll know we were here."
Ron Weasley,You're the boss. Hermione?
Ron Weasley,You're the best with spells.
Hermione Granger,Obliviate.
Harry Potter,How is it they knew we were there?
Hermione Granger,Maybe you still have the Trace on you.
Ron Weasley,Can't be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It's Wizarding law.
Ron Weasley,What?
Hermione Granger,"We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding..."
Harry Potter,Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
Hermione Granger,Right.  Perspective.
Ron Weasley,"We've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe."
Harry Potter,I have an idea.
Alastor Moody,Severus Snape?
Harry Potter,Mad-Eye...?
Ron Weasley,What was that about?
Hermione Granger,"Mad-eye's doing, I'd guess.  In case Snape decided to come snooping."
Hermione Granger,Homenum revelio.
Hermione Granger,It's a spell to reveal human presence.
Hermione Granger,We're alone.
Harry Potter,Lumos.
Lily Potter,Dear Sirius.  Thank you for Harry's birthday present.  You'd think he'd been born on a broom.
Lily Potter,"James says he's got the look of a Seeker, but then James would.  We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who dotes on Harry.  Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and didn't stay long.  James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so he doesn't have much choice.  By the way, Bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don't know how much to believe. Can it really be true that Dumbledore --"
Hermione Granger,Harry!  Harry!
Hermione Granger,Ron!  I've found him!
Ron Weasley,Good!  Tell him from me he's a git!
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --"
Hermione Granger,It's from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?
Harry Potter,"Yeah.  They knew her.  She wrote A History of Magic, you know."
Hermione Granger,Did she now?
Harry Potter,I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  She still lives in Godric's Hollow.  I'm thinking maybe she could help us.
Hermione Granger,"Harry.  I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes."
Ron Weasley,Hey!  I think you two better come down here.
Ron Weasley,"The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  Dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench. Can't see us, of course.  But we'll have to be careful coming and going.  C'mon.  There's something else you need to see."
Hermione Granger,Lovely.
Harry Potter,To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...
Ron Weasley,R.A.B. was Sirius' brother?
Hermione Granger,"Yes.  Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?"
Harry Potter,Stop!  I order you!
Ron Weasley,Kreacher...
Harry Potter,"Been spying on us, have you?"
Kreacher,Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches.
Hermione Granger,Maybe he knows.
Harry Potter,Ever seen this before?
Harry Potter,"Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too."
Kreacher,That was Master Regulus' locket.
Harry Potter,"That's right.  But there were two, weren't there?"
Harry Potter,Where's the other one?
Kreacher,Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is.
Hermione Granger,But was it here?  Did you ever see it?
Kreacher,Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!
Kreacher,Blood-traitor Weasley --
Hermione Granger,Ron!  RON!
Harry Potter,Answer her.
Kreacher,"Yes.  It was here, in this house. A most evil object..."
Harry Potter,How do you mean?
Kreacher,"Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It was the last thing he asked of Kreacher.  But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could not.."
Harry Potter,"Where is it now?  Did someone take it, Kreacher?"
Kreacher,"He came in the night.  He took many things, including the locket."
Harry Potter,"Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?"
Kreacher,Mundungus.  Mundungus Fletcher.
Harry Potter,Find him.
Pius Thicknesse,"As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this:  You have nothing to fear... as long as you have nothing to hide..."
Cormac McLaggen,My father will hear about this.
Neville Longbottom,"He's not here, you fools."
Hermione Granger,They have flesh memories.
Hermione Granger,"Snitches.  They're never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it.  Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  That way, if there's a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it."
Harry Potter,You mean... it remembers me?
Hermione Granger,"When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it."
Dobby,Harry Potter!  So long it's been --
Hermione Granger,Expelliarmus!
Kreacher,"As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!"
Dobby,Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!
Mundungus Fletcher,What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin' 'ouse-elves on me!
Dobby,"Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.  And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name, which Dobby thought was very curious.  And then Dobby saw that Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very, very --"
Mundungus Fletcher,"I'm no thief, you foul little git. I'm a purveyer of rare and wondrous objects --"
Ron Weasley,"You're a thief, Dung.  Everyone knows it."
Dobby,Master Weasley!  So good to see you again!
Ron Weasley,Wicked trainers.
Mundungus Fletcher,"Listen, I panicked that night, all right?  I never volunteered to die for you, mate.  Can I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom --"
Hermione Granger,Stop lying!
Ron Weasley,Piece of advice.  Let's not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?
Harry Potter,"When you turned this place over -- don't deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?"
Mundungus Fletcher,Why?  Was it valuable?
Hermione Granger,You've still got it.
Ron Weasley,No.  He's worried he should have got more money for it.
Mundungus Fletcher,"Wouldn't be difficult, would it? Bleedin' gave it away, din' I? There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and asks to see my license.  Says she's of a mind to lock me up and would've, too, she hadn' taken a fancy to that locket."
Harry Potter,Who was she?  This witch?
Mundungus Fletcher,"Well, she's right there, in't she? Bleedin' bow an' all."
Ron Weasley,Right. So let's do it.  Who gets who?
Hermione Granger,"Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt..."
Hermione Granger,Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then...
Harry Potter,It gets really tricky.
Hermione Granger,Correct.
Harry Potter,This is completely mental.
Hermione Granger,"Completely, utterly, without question."
Ron Weasley,"The world's mental.  Come on, drink up.  We've got a Horcrux to find."
Ron Weasley,"In case you're interested, I'm Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department."
Hermione Granger,"Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office."
Harry Potter,I'm nobody.
Hermione Granger,You're somebody.  Be careful.
Wizard,"Morning, Reg!  Good luck today."
Ron Weasley,Oh... yeah.  Thanks.
Ron Weasley,What do you reckon he meant by 'Good luck.'?
Harry Potter,Apparently so.
Ron Weasley,That's bloody disgusting.
Harry Potter,Are those...?
Hermione Granger,Muggles.  In their rightful place.
Wizard,"Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me..."
Hermione Granger,You appear to be quite popular.
Ron Weasley,"I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit."
Harry Potter,The Ministry must be hiring young these days.
Ron Weasley,They're not Ministry.  They're Snatchers.  They hunt Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price.
Harry Potter,"How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?"
Hermione Granger,I didn't.
Corban Yaxley,Cattlemole!
Corban Yaxley,It's still raining in my office. Two days now.
Ron Weasley,Really?  Have you tried an umbrella?
Corban Yaxley,"You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?"
Ron Weasley,Downstairs...?
Corban Yaxley,"To interrogate your wife!  If my wife's blood status were in doubt and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think I'd make it a priority.  You've got one hour."
Ron Weasley,Oh my god.  What am I going to do? My wife's all alone downstairs?
Harry Potter,Ron.  You don't have a wife.
Harry Potter,"Look, we'll go with you --"
Ron Weasley,"No, that's mad.  You two find Umbridge.  I'll be fine.  But how do I stop it raining?"
Hermione Granger,Try Finite Incantatem.  Of course if something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --
Woman,"Level Two.  Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including Wizengamot Administration Services, Auror Headquarters and Improper Use of Magic Department."
Hermione Granger,This is you.
Ron Weasley,"Finite Incantatem, okay.  And if that doesn't work...?"
Hermione Granger,I don't like him being on his own down there.
Harry Potter,Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  It's us you should be worrying about.
Hermione Granger,"You really have horrible teeth, you know that."
Harry Potter,"I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  Deal?"
Dolores Umbridge,"Ah, Mafalda!  Travers sent you, did he?  Good.  We'll go straight down."
Percy Weasley,"Oh, yes... of course."
Witch,Reckon the old hag will be interrogating Mudbloods all day?
Pius Thicknesse,Sh...careful.
Dolores Umbridge,Runcorn.
Harry Potter,Accio locket.
Wizard,"All right, all right.  Let's calm down, shall we?"
Wizard,It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms.  I think none of us will soon forget last month's Poisonous Duck...
Wizard,R-Runcorn.
Ron Weasley,M-morning.
Harry Potter,"Ron, it's me."
Ron Weasley,"Harry!  Blimey, I forgot what you looked like.  Where's Hermione?"
Harry Potter,She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --
Arthur Weasley,"I understand, Wakinda, but I can't be a party to that."
Arthur Weasley,"Hello, Reg.  Isn't Mary in for questioning today?  Try to have faith.  If there's anything Molly and I can do for you --"
Wakanda,Let me guess.  It's raining in Yaxley's office again?
Arthur Weasley,Tell him to try an umbrella.
Harry Potter,"Arthur!  You know you're being tracked, don't you?"
Arthur Weasley,"Is that a threat, Runcorn?"
Harry Potter,"No, Arthur.  It's a fact.  They're watching you."
Harry Potter,I'll tell you later.  Let's find Hermione.
Ron Weasley,Bloody cold down here.
Man,"I'm half-blood, I tell you!  My father was a wizard!  Look him up! William Alderton!  He worked here for thirty years..."
Ron Weasley,What is it?
Harry Potter,It's here...
Mary Cattermole,Reg...
Dolores Umbridge,Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
Mary Cattermole,Yes.
Dolores Umbridge,"Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?  Wife to Reginald?"
Mary Cattermole,Yes.
Dolores Umbridge,"A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole.  Is this that wand?"
Dolores Umbridge,Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand.
Mary Cattermole,"But I didn't take it.  I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was eleven.  It chose me."
Dolores Umbridge,"No, no, I don't think so, Mrs. Cattermole.  Wands only choose witches.  And you are not a witch."
Mary Cattermole,"But I am!  Tell them, Reg!  Tell them what I am!"
Dolores Umbridge,"What the devil are you doing, Albert?"
Harry Potter,"You're lying.  And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!"
Harry Potter,Expecto PATRONUM!
Hermione Granger,Relashio!
Mary Cattermole,"You?  It's you! Reg, it's Harry Potter!"
Ron Weasley,"'Tis, isn't it?  This'll be one to tell the kids."
Wizard,Harry Potter...?
Hermione Granger,Harry... they've seen you.  We've got to get out of here.
Ron Weasley,"Mary.  Go home.  Get the kids. I'll... I'll meet you there.  We have to get out the country, understand?"
Ron Weasley,Mary!  Do as I say!
Ron Weasley,I'm sorry.  It's just --
Ron Weasley,Long story.  Nice meeting you.
Ron Weasley,Piss off.
Corban Yaxley,Seal the exits!  Now!
Hermione Granger,"Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany.'"
Hermione Granger,Quickly!
Harry Potter,Accio Dittany.
Hermione Granger,Unstopper it.
Harry Potter,Hermione.  His arm --
Hermione Granger,Just do it!
Harry Potter,What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.
Hermione Granger,"We were.  We were there.  But Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched.  I'm... sorry."
Harry Potter,Don't be stupid.
Hermione Granger,It's all I feel safe doing.
Hermione Granger,Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
Harry Potter,What're you doing?
Hermione Granger,"Protective enchantments.  I don't fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent..."
Harry Potter,Tent?  Where am I supposed to find --
Hermione Granger,Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...
Hermione Granger,How're the mushrooms?  Seem to be the only edible things growing round here.
Harry Potter,They're great.
Hermione Granger,Make sure to leave some for Ron.
Harry Potter,No problem.
Harry Potter,How bad is he?
Hermione Granger,"He'll be alright in a few days. Hopefully.  If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --"
Hermione Granger,So where do we go next?
Harry Potter,"Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother."
Hermione Granger,"It scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of Vol--"
Ron Weasley,"No, don't!  Don't say it!"
Ron Weasley,It's taboo -- You-Know-Who's name. That's how they track people now. It's how they found us in the cafe that night.
Harry Potter,How d'you know?
Ron Weasley,"I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry.  Blimey, what's that smell?"
Hermione Granger,Dinner?
Ron Weasley,Not bloody likely.  Smells like something Ginny would cook.
Hermione Granger,Tea?
Ron Weasley,Is that it?
Harry Potter,"I know.  I felt it too. It's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's --"
Ron Weasley,... alive.
Hermione Granger,I hate it.  It's like he's here with us.
Harry Potter,That's why we're going to kill it.
Harry Potter,Dissendium!
Hermione Granger,Incendio!
Harry Potter,Expulso!
Hermione Granger,Confringo!
Ron Weasley,It's angry.
Hermione Granger,What're you doing?
Harry Potter,We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.
Hermione Granger,I can put it in my bag --
Harry Potter,No.
Ron Weasley,"Seems strange, mate.  Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?"
Voldemort,"You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch?  Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you..."
Voldemort,Who was he?  The thief?
Mykew Gregorovitch,Just a boy!  Not of the village. It was he who took it.  I never saw it again.  I swear on my life.
Voldemort,I believe you...
Hermione Granger,I thought it had stopped.
Hermione Granger,"You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It's too dangerous --"
Harry Potter,"It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  Can you understand that?"
Hermione Granger,Tell me. What you saw.
Harry Potter,He's found him.  Vol--
Harry Potter,You-Know-Who.  He's found Gregorovitch --
Hermione Granger,The wandmaker?
Harry Potter,Yes.  How'd you know?
Hermione Granger,Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What's he got to do with You-Know-Who?
Harry Potter,You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  But he's desperate to have it.  It's as if his life depends on it.
Hermione Granger,Don't -- It... comforts him.
Harry Potter,Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear?  Good news?
Hermione Granger,I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.  It gets him through the day.
Harry Potter,And what gets you through the day?
Hermione Granger,"We've all made sacrifices, Harry."
Harry Potter,How long before he can travel?
Hermione Granger,I don't know.  It takes time.  I'm doing all I can.
Harry Potter,You're not doing enough.
Hermione Granger,Take it off.
Hermione Granger,Take it off.  Now.
Hermione Granger,Better?
Harry Potter,Loads.
Hermione Granger,It's cold.  Even though it's been lying against your skin for days.
Hermione Granger,We'll take turns.  Okay?
Scabior,What's that?  That... smell?
Harry Potter,Snatchers.
Harry Potter,Good to know your enchantments work.
Hermione Granger,He could smell it.  My perfume.
Harry Potter,We have to leave.  We're not safe here.
Hermione Granger,I told you.  Ron's not strong enough to Apparate.
Harry Potter,Then we'll go by foot.
Ron Weasley,I'm hungry.
Harry Potter,We're all hungry.
Ron Weasley,Leave it.
Ron Weasley,Mum can make food appear out of thin air.
Hermione Granger,No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law.  The other four are --
Ron Weasley,"Oh, speak English, can't you?"
Ron Weasley,I said leave it.
Harry Potter,It'll be dark soon.  We need to find a place to sleep.
Hermione Granger,Good plan.
Ron Weasley,"Yeah.  Brilliant.  Only, correct me if I'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?  And the day before that?  And the day before that?  Walk.  Sleep.  Walk. Sleep."
Harry Potter,My turn.
Ron Weasley,"He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?"
Hermione Granger,None of us do.
Ron Weasley,Wizards were here.
Hermione Granger,I don't like this place.
Hermione Granger,I want to go.
Hermione Granger,I'll tell you in a minute.
Harry Potter,Maybe you could tell me now.
Hermione Granger,Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor? It's Goblin made.
Harry Potter,Brilliant.
Hermione Granger,You don't understand.  Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
Harry Potter,O-kay.
Hermione Granger,"Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry Potter,With a basilisk fang.  If you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --
Hermione Granger,"Don't you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor."
Hermione Granger,Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom.
Harry Potter,It only takes in that which makes it stronger...
Hermione Granger,Exactly!  Which means...
Harry Potter,... it can destroy Horcruxes.
Hermione Granger,Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
Harry Potter,"You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly."
Hermione Granger,"Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook."
Harry Potter,There's only one problem...
Ron Weasley,The sword was stolen.
Ron Weasley,"Yeah, I'm still here.  But you two carry on.  Don't let me spoil your fun."
Harry Potter,What's the problem?
Ron Weasley,"Problem?  There's no problem.  Not according to you, anyway."
Harry Potter,"Look, don't be shy.  If you've got something to say, spit it out."
Ron Weasley,"All right, I'll spit it out. Don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find."
Hermione Granger,Ron...
Harry Potter,I thought you knew what you signed up for.
Ron Weasley,"Yeah, I thought I did too."
Harry Potter,I don't understand.  What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?  Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?
Ron Weasley,"No, I just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something.  I reckoned you knew what you were doing.  I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!"
Harry Potter,"I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!"
Ron Weasley,"Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we!"
Hermione Granger,"Take it off, Ron.  Please take it off.  You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day --"
Harry Potter,"Yeah, he would.  D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D'you think I haven't guessed what you were thinking?"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, we weren't --"
Ron Weasley,"Don't lie!  You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --"
Hermione Granger,I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!
Ron Weasley,"Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night?  Do you!  To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name or Fred or George or Mum or --"
Harry Potter,You think I don't listen!  You think I don't know what it's like --
Hermione Granger,Stop!  Stop!
Harry Potter,Go then.  But leave that.
Ron Weasley,And you?
Hermione Granger,Me?
Ron Weasley,Are you staying?  Or coming?
Ron Weasley,"Fine.  I get it.  I saw you two the other night.  Yeah, that's right.  Didn't know I knew, did you?"
Hermione Granger,"What?  Ron, no -- please --"
Hermione Granger,He's gone.
Harry Potter,Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
Hermione Granger,It's a Muggle station.
Harry Potter,You were right.  It's like you said.  Snitches have flesh memories.  But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand.  I almost swallowed it.
Hermione Granger,'I open at the close?'
Harry Potter,What do you reckon it means?
Hermione Granger,"I don't know.  But look, I've found something as well..."
Hermione Granger,"I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either.  And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book."
Harry Potter,"Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur's wedding."
Hermione Granger,What d'you mean -- wearing it?
Harry Potter,Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family.
Hermione Granger,Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?
Harry Potter,"Hermione, I've been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --"
Hermione Granger,And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.
Harry Potter,"But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?"
Hermione Granger,"It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?"
Harry Potter,"Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, 'course it is.  Obvious, isn't it?"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?"
Harry Potter,Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open.
Harry Potter,Hermione...
Hermione Granger,Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.
Hermione Granger,I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.
Harry Potter,No.  This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else.
Hermione Granger,"Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve! Listen..."
Harry Potter,Do you think they'd be in there? My mum and dad?
Hermione Granger,Yeah. I think they would.
Hermione Granger,Harry.
Harry Potter,Is it -- ?
Hermione Granger,No.  But look.
Hermione Granger,Did you know he had a sister?
Harry Potter,No.
Hermione Granger,Lumos.
Hermione Granger,"Ignotus... Hey, Har --"
Harry Potter,"Happy Christmas, Hermione."
Hermione Granger,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
Hermione Granger,Harry...
Harry Potter,Yeah.
Hermione Granger,Someone's watching us.  By the gate.
Harry Potter,C'mon.
Hermione Granger,I don't think this is a good idea.
Harry Potter,We look like ordinary Muggles.
Hermione Granger,Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave.
Harry Potter,Relax.  This is right.  I know it.
Hermione Granger,Omigod.  Harry...
Harry Potter,"This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them."
Harry Potter,"You're Bathilda, aren't you?"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, I'm not sure about this."
Harry Potter,"Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly."
Hermione Granger,There's something odd about her. And what's that smell?
Harry Potter,"She's gaga, remember?"
Harry Potter,Here.  Let me do that.
Hermione Granger,"You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot."
Harry Potter,Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?
Harry Potter,His name.  Can you tell me his name?
Harry Potter,"This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch's wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he?"
Harry Potter,She wants us to go upstairs.
Hermione Granger,All right...
Harry Potter,She wants me to go.  Alone.
Hermione Granger,Why?
Harry Potter,It's all right.  You stay here.
Hermione Granger,Harry...
Harry Potter,Lumos.
Bathilda Bagshot,You are Potter?
Harry Potter,Yes.
Bathilda Bagshot,I have something for you...
Hermione Granger,Harry!
Hermione Granger,Confringo!
Hermione Granger,"Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?"
Harry Potter,Yes.
Hermione Granger,Good.  That's good...
Harry Potter,We got away.
Hermione Granger,Yes.
Harry Potter,Are you alright?
Hermione Granger,I'm fine.  But you've been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...
Harry Potter,You've outdone yourself this time.
Hermione Granger,"The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It's just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It's like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything's changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me."
Harry Potter,Where are they?
Hermione Granger,"Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.  They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  No children."
Hermione Granger,"Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old."
Hermione Granger,"You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  Well, I know."
Hermione Granger,"It was in Bathilda's sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading --"
Harry Potter,"Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?"
Hermione Granger,Yes.
Harry Potter,Well?
Hermione Granger,For a time.
Harry Potter,"Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?"
Hermione Granger,"Gellert Grindelwald.  He's not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who..."
Harry Potter,"Hermione, I don't need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is."
Hermione Granger,"When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn't anymore.  After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric's Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot."
Harry Potter,"Get to the hard part, Hermione."
Hermione Granger,"She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense.  Dumbledore's mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  They did a lot of talking that summer.  But they always returned to one particular subject."
Hermione Granger,Wizard rule over Muggles.
Harry Potter,And Dumbledore believed in it?
Hermione Granger,Yes.
Harry Potter,'For the Greater Good.'  What does that mean?
Hermione Granger,"It was something Dumbledore came up with.  He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good.  Grindelwald took a more violent position."
Hermione Granger,"It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --"
Harry Potter,"We're young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported."
Hermione Granger,"He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison."
Harry Potter,Where's my wand?  I'll take the watch.
Harry Potter,Hermione.  Where's my wand?
Hermione Granger,"It's my fault.  As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --"
Harry Potter,It's done.
Hermione Granger,Maybe we can --
Harry Potter,It's done.
Harry Potter,Leave me yours.  You get back in the warm.  And give me that.
Hermione Granger,"He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you."
Harry Potter,No...
Harry Potter,Lumos! Accio Sword.
Harry Potter,Diffindo.
Harry Potter,Hermione...
Ron Weasley,Are -- you -- mental?
Harry Potter,It was you!
Ron Weasley,"Well, yeah.  Bit obvious, I'd think."
Harry Potter,And the doe.  That was you as well.
Ron Weasley,No.  I reckoned it was you.
Harry Potter,My Patronus is a stag.
Ron Weasley,Right.  Antlers.
Harry Potter,You didn't see anyone else?
Ron Weasley,"No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --"
Ron Weasley,Anything?
Harry Potter,"But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it."
Ron Weasley,"And we did, didn't we?"
Harry Potter,See that?  It knows.  It's afraid. Do it.
Ron Weasley,"What?  No.  Harry.  That thing's bad for me.  I can't handle it. I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
Harry Potter,All the more reason.
Ron Weasley,No.  I can't --
Harry Potter,Then why are you here?  Why did you come back?
Harry Potter,"I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  When it does, don't hesitate.  I don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight.  The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me."
Harry Potter,On three.  One.  Two.  Three. Take me inside...
Harry Potter,"Stab it, Ron.  Now."
Voldemort,I have seen your heart and it is mine...
Harry Potter,Don't listen to it.
Harry Potter,Ron.  Don't listen to it!
Harry Potter,Ron.  Stab it!
Harry Potter,"We were better without you, happier without you."
Hermione Granger,"Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?"
Harry Potter,Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!
Harry Potter,Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...
Hermione Granger,"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him..."
Harry Potter,"Do it, Ron!  Kill it!"
Harry Potter,"After you left, she cried for a week.  She's like my sister."
Ron Weasley,I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I left.
Harry Potter,You've sort of made up for it tonight.  Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.
Ron Weasley,Saving your life.
Harry Potter,That too.
Ron Weasley,And just think of it.  Only three to go.
Harry Potter,Hermione!
Hermione Granger,Everything all right?
Harry Potter,Fine.  Actually... more than fine.
Ron Weasley,Hey.
Ron Weasley,Wo -- hey -- ouch!
Hermione Granger,"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'Hey?' Where's my wand?  Harry, where's my wand!"
Harry Potter,Um... I don't know?
Hermione Granger,"Harry Potter, you give me my wand!"
Ron Weasley,How come he's got your wand?
Hermione Granger,Never mind why he's got my wand --
Hermione Granger,What is that?
Hermione Granger,You destroyed it?
Harry Potter,It's a long story.
Hermione Granger,Don't think this changes anything.
Ron Weasley,"No, of course not.  I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux!  Why would that change anything!  Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  To see you doing those things --"
Hermione Granger,See me doing what things?
Hermione Granger,What happened out there?
Harry Potter,It's a long story.
Ron Weasley,"Look, I wanted to come back the minute I'd left.  I just... didn't know how to find you."
Harry Potter,Exactly how did you find us?
Ron Weasley,With this.
Ron Weasley,"It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I'd given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it..."
Harry Potter,It?
Ron Weasley,A voice.
Ron Weasley,"Your voice, Hermione.  Coming out of this."
Hermione Granger,And what may I ask did I say?
Ron Weasley,My name.  Just my name.  Like a whisper.
Ron Weasley,So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew.
Harry Potter,Knew what?
Ron Weasley,"Just knew.  On account of Hermione's voice.  And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here."
Ron Weasley,"I could feel it inside me.  It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  And I knew it would take me where I needed to go."
Ron Weasley,So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside.  It was dark.  I didn't have any idea where I was. I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did.
Ron Weasley,I've always liked it.  These flames Hermione makes.
Ron Weasley,How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
Harry Potter,Keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round.
Ron Weasley,It was true.  Every word.
Ron Weasley,"Bloody hell.  I just realized. You need a wand, right?"
Harry Potter,Yeah...
Ron Weasley,"Well, I've got one.  Here.  It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.  I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back."
Ron Weasley,"Don't tell Hermione, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.  This one was definitely part Troll.  The smell off him..."
Harry Potter,Engorgio.
Ron Weasley,Wo.
Harry Potter,Reducio!
Hermione Granger,What's going on in there?
Harry Potter,Nothing.
Ron Weasley,Nothing.
Ron Weasley,"Maybe a bit more practice, eh?"
Hermione Granger,We need to talk.
Ron Weasley,All right.
Hermione Granger,I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.
Harry Potter,Sorry?
Hermione Granger,See this?  It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It's the mark again.
Hermione Granger,It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard in Godric's Hollow -- what?
Harry Potter,Jesus.  It was there too.
Hermione Granger,Where?
Harry Potter,Outside Gregorovitch's wand shop. on the alley wall...
Ron Weasley,But what does it mean?
Hermione Granger,"Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I'm sure of it."
Ron Weasley,I think Hermione's right.  I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it?  Those in favor...
Ron Weasley,"Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time."
Harry Potter,"Not still mad at him, are you?"
Hermione Granger,I'm always mad at him.
Ron Weasley,Luna?
Harry Potter,Luna.
Hermione Granger,Luna.
Ron Weasley,Keep off the dirigible plums.
Xenophilius Lovegood,What is it? Who are you? What do you want --
Harry Potter,"Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  I'm Harry Potter.  We met a few months back?"
Harry Potter,"Would it be okay if we came in? It won't take long, sir.  I promise."
Xenophilius Lovegood,Excuse me.
Xenophilius Lovegood,"So.  What brings you here, Mr. Potter?"
Harry Potter,"Well, sir, we need some help."
Xenophilius Lovegood,"Ah.  Help.  I see.  Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry Potter, rather dangerous these days..."
Ron Weasley,Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?
Xenophilius Lovegood,"I have expressed that view, yes. In the past.  Would you excuse me one moment.  I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you..."
Harry Potter,What's going on here?
Ron Weasley,"He's mental.  Let's face it. Luna's always good value, but she's nutty as squirrel poo."
Hermione Granger,Do you see that?
Ron Weasley,"Well, yeah, of course.  It's massive, isn't it?"
Hermione Granger,No!  Don't go near it!
Hermione Granger,It's an Erumpent horn.  It's a Class B Tradeable Material.
Ron Weasley,"Yeah, all right..."
Xenophilius Lovegood,May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make it ourselves.
Hermione Granger,"Where is Luna, sir?"
Xenophilius Lovegood,"Luna?  Oh, um, she'll be along. Now how can I help you, Mr. Potter?"
Harry Potter,"Well, sir, it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  A symbol..."
Xenophilius Lovegood,You mean this?
Harry Potter,"Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?"
Xenophilius Lovegood,"What is it?  Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course."
Harry Potter,The what?
Ron Weasley,The what?
Hermione Granger,The what?
Xenophilius Lovegood,The Deathly Hallows.  I assume you're all familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers?'
Hermione Granger,Yes.
Ron Weasley,Yes.
Harry Potter,No.
Hermione Granger,It's in here.
Xenophilius Lovegood,"Well, there's no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale.  Why don't you read it aloud, Miss...?"
Hermione Granger,"Granger.  Well... all right. There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --"
Ron Weasley,Midnight.  Mum always said midnight. But twilight's fine.  Better actually.
Hermione Granger,"In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass..."
Xenophilius Lovegood,"Well, there you are.  Those are the Deathly Hallows."
Harry Potter,Sorry... I still don't really understand...
Xenophilius Lovegood,The Elder Wand...
Xenophilius Lovegood,The Resurrection Stone...
Xenophilius Lovegood,... then encloses both in a TRIANGLE. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the Deathly Hallows.  Together... they make one master of Death.
Hermione Granger,"Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?"
Xenophilius Lovegood,Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story.
Xenophilius Lovegood,"Ah, but your tea's grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back."
Ron Weasley,"Let's get out of here once he's back.  I'm not touching this stuff, hot or cold."
Harry Potter,Which one would you choose if you could?  Of the Deathly Hallows?
Hermione Granger,"It's obvious, isn't it?"
Ron Weasley,The Wand.
Hermione Granger,The Cloak.
Harry Potter,The Stone.
Ron Weasley,"You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  Dead boring if you ask me.  But an unbeatable wand!"
Hermione Granger,Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.
Ron Weasley,"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead."
Hermione Granger,"Why the Stone, Harry?"
Harry Potter,"Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody."
Hermione Granger,But according to the story they don't want to come back.  It's all rubbish anyway.  There's no such thing as the Deathly Hallows.
Harry Potter,But I have one.  The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.
Hermione Granger,There have always been Cloaks --
Ron Weasley,Not like Harry's.  I've seen a fair few.  Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry's is different.  It's perfect.
Harry Potter,"And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the Horcrux.  It had a symbol on it.  Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows."
Hermione Granger,"Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --"
Ron Weasley,You forgot the water.
Xenophilius Lovegood,The water?
Ron Weasley,For the tea.
Xenophilius Lovegood,"Did, didn't I?  How silly of me."
Hermione Granger,"No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--"
Xenophilius Lovegood,"No, you mustn't --"
Harry Potter,Sir?
Xenophilius Lovegood,"You're my only hope.  They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... But it's really you they want..."
Harry Potter,"Who took her, sir?"
Xenophilius Lovegood,Him.  Surely you call him You-Know- Who.  But his real name of course is... Voldemort.
Ron Weasley,Nooooooooo!
Xenophilius Lovegood,Stop!  I've got him --
Hermione Granger,Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!
Ron Weasley,That treacherous old bleeder!  Is there no one we can trust!
Harry Potter,They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate.
Ron Weasley,I'll do the enchantments.
Scabior,"Hello, beautiful."
Gellert Grindelwald,"Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day.  But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek..."
Voldemort,"If not you, then who?"
Gellert Grindelwald,"You're so innocent, Tom.  Like a schoolboy.  There's so much you don't understand..."
Voldemort,"Tell me, Grindelwald.  Tell me where to find it!  Tell me who possesses it!  The name, Grindelwald!  The name!"
Gellert Grindelwald,"Can't you guess, Tom?  It lies with him, of course.  Buried within the earth.  It is he who possesses it, even in death.  Your old friend and mine... Dumbledore."
Harry Potter,They exist.  The Hallows.
Harry Potter,"But he only wants the one, the last one.  That's what he's been looking for."
Hermione Granger,What're you saying?
Harry Potter,"He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  He'll have it by the end of the night.  He's found the Elder Wand."
Ron Weasley,Don't touch her!
Hermione Granger,Stop it!
Scabior,"Your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave, lovely."
Scabior,"What happened to you, ugly?"
Scabior,What's your name?
Harry Potter,Dudely.  Vernon Dudley.
Scabior,"Check the list.  And you, ginger?"
Ron Weasley,Stan Shunpike.
Scabior,Like 'ell you are.  We know skinny Stan.  Try again.
Ron Weasley,Weasley... Barney Weasley.
Scabior,"Weasley, eh?  Wouldn't be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?"
Ron Weasley,Piss off!  Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!
Scabior,"Worth ten times you if I can find him.  Wasn't you that tipped him off, was it?"
Scabior,"How 'bout you, lovely?  What do they call you...?"
Hermione Granger,Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood.
Scabior,"You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you're going to be my favorite."
Snatcher,There's no Vernon Dudley on 'ere.
Fenrir Greyback,"Hear that, ugly?  The list says you're lying.  How come you don't want us to know who you are?  Hm?"
Harry Potter,The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --
Scabior,"Change of plans, boys.  We won't be taking this lot to the Ministry."
Harry Potter,What did you put on me?
Hermione Granger,A Stinging Jinx.
Harry Potter,How long will it last?
Hermione Granger,Not long.
Bellatrix Lestrange,Show me. Get Draco. Well?
Draco Malfoy,I can't be sure.
Lucius Malfoy,"Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord... ...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?"
Scabior,"Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy."
Lucius Malfoy,You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Lucius. Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over. Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure."
Draco Malfoy,What's wrong with his face?
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Yes, what is wrong with his face?"
Snatcher,"He came to us like that. Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon."
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We'll see what her last spell was. Ah. Got you. What is that? Where'd you get that from?"
Snatcher,It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now. Are you mad? Go! Get out!
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Cissy, put the boys in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl."
Ron Weasley,What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her.
Luna Lovegood,Ron? Harry?
Harry Potter,Luna?
Bellatrix Lestrange,That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it? What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!
Hermione Granger,I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.
Bellatrix Lestrange,I don't believe it.
Ron Weasley,We have to do something.
Garrick Ollivander,There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted.
Hermione Granger,Please! please!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Shut up!
Luna Lovegood,"You're bleeding, Harry. That's a curious thing to keep in your sock."
Harry Potter,Help us.
Ron Weasley,Let her go.
Peter Pettigrew,"Shut up. Get back. You, goblin, come with me."
Dobby,Aah!
Harry Potter,Dobby? What are you doing here?
Dobby,"Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course. Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter."
Harry Potter,You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you?
Dobby,"Of course, sir. I'm an elf."
Ron Weasley,Works for me.
Harry Potter,"Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--"
Ron Weasley,Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. Trust me.
Luna Lovegood,"Whenever you're ready, sir."
Dobby,Sir? I like her very much. Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.
Peter Pettigrew,Ow.
Dobby,Who gets his wand?
Bellatrix Lestrange,"I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin. Think very, very carefully before you answer."
Griphook,I don't know.
Bellatrix Lestrange,You don't know? Why weren't you doing your job? Who got into my vault? Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?
Griphook,"When I was last in your vault, the sword was there. Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then."
Griphook,There is no place safer than Gringotts.
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Liar! Consider yourself lucky, goblin. The same won't be said for this one."
Ron Weasley,Like hell.
Ron Weasley,Expellliarmus!
Harry Potter,Stupefy.
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Stop! Drop your wands. I said, drop them! Pick them up, Draco, now. Well, well, well, look what we have here. It's Harry Potter. He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord. Call him. Call him."
Harry Potter,Stupefy!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Stupid elf. You could've killed me.
Dobby,Dobby never meant to kill. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure.
Bellatrix Lestrange,How dare you take a witch's wand? How dare you defy your masters?
Dobby,Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends.
Harry Potter,Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe.
Dobby,Harry Potter.
Harry Potter,"Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me."
Dobby,Such a beautiful place... ...to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend... ...Harry Potter.
Luna Lovegood,We should close his eyes. Don't you think? There. Now he could be sleeping.
Harry Potter,I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.
Luna Lovegood,It's beautiful here.
Bill Weasley,"It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least."
Luna Lovegood,Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong...
Harry Potter,I need to talk to the goblin.
Harry Potter,How are you?
Griphook,Alive.
Harry Potter,You probably don't remember --
Harry Potter,Yes.
Griphook,And brought me here.
Griphook,You are a very unusual wizard.
Harry Potter,Why did you leave Gringotts?
Griphook,Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.
Ron Weasley,Then you're on our side.
Griphook,This is a wizard's war. I take no side.
Griphook,It is impossible.
Harry Potter,"Alone, yes. With you, no."
Griphook,How did you come by this sword?
Harry Potter,It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
Griphook,It's complicated.
Harry Potter,The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.
Griphook,"There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer."
Harry Potter,And she never suspected?
Griphook,The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
Ron Weasley,Who put it there? The fake.
Griphook,"It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts."
Harry Potter,And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Griphook,Perhaps.
Griphook,I have no interest in gold.
Harry Potter,Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes
Griphook,That is my price.
Griphook,"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"
Hermione Granger,"Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?"
Harry Potter,"She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him."
Ron Weasley,And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?
Harry Potter,I'm still working on that part.
Fleur Delacour,He's too weak.
Garrick Ollivander,Forgive me if I don't get up.
Harry Potter,"Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions."
Garrick Ollivander,"Anything, m'boy, anything."
Harry Potter,"Can you identify these, sir?"
Garrick Ollivander,Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Harry Potter,And this?
Garrick Ollivander,Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Harry Potter,Was? Isn't it still?
Garrick Ollivander,Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.
Garrick Ollivander,"The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore."
Harry Potter,"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?"
Garrick Ollivander,"There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --"
Harry Potter,"But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?"
Harry Potter,You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
Garrick Ollivander,"He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --"
Harry Potter,"He has found it, sir."
Harry Potter,"That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now."
Garrick Ollivander,"He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance."
Harry Potter,"Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
Ron Weasley,You're sure it's hers?
Hermione Granger,Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.
Harry Potter,I reckon you should take this then.
Ron Weasley,You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
Hermione Granger,But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...
Harry Potter,"If I can hold it, you can."
Ron Weasley,"How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
Harry Potter,I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...
Ron Weasley,That's a bit scary.
Hermione Granger,"It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
Harry Potter,No. I just know. When one's near.
Fleur Delacour,"This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione."
Hermione Granger,"It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur."
Bill Weasley,"You're leaving, aren't you."
Harry Potter,In the morning.
Bill Weasley,And Griphook?
Harry Potter,He'll be leaving too.
Bill Weasley,"Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving."
Luna Lovegood,The sky has lost a star.
Luna Lovegood,"My father used to say that when a child died. She looks up, smiles."
Harry Potter,"Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --"
Luna Lovegood,"I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it."
Harry Potter,Hogwarts?
Harry Potter,"It's not the place you left, you"
Luna Lovegood,Neither am I.
Ron Weasley,Always good value. I'll miss her.
Ron Weasley,What d'you think?
Harry Potter,Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.
Ron Weasley,You want to tell me what that is?
Harry Potter,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
Ron Weasley,You mean he could see you?
Harry Potter,Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...
Ron Weasley,Go on.
Harry Potter,"You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore."
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell... that's a sight.
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Well, how do I look?"
Ron Weasley,Hideous.
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn't I? Hold still..."
Ron Weasley,"Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --"
Ron Weasley,"Never mind. I'm good.  That is you in there, isn't it?"
Harry Potter,"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?"
Goblin,Madam Lestrange.
Griphook,"Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!"
Ron Weasley,Hey. Easy.
Griphook,She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?
Hermione Granger,He's right. I was being stupid.
Harry Potter,C'mon. Let's do it.
Goblin,Identification.
Bellatrix Lestrange,I wish to enter my vault.
Goblin,"I see. Very well. Excuse me, won't you?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,I don't like to be kept waiting.
Goblin,Next.
Bellatrix Lestrange,He's with me.
Griphook,They know!
Ron Weasley,What do you mean?
Griphook,They know she's an imposter! They've been warned!
Bogrod,Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand?
Bellatrix Lestrange,And why should I do that?
Ron Weasley,"Harry, what do we do? Harry...?"
Bogrod,"It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand, given the current climate --"
Bellatrix Lestrange,"No, I most certainly do not understand --"
Bogrod,I'm afraid I must insist.
Harry Potter,Imperio.
Bogrod,"Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me."
Goblin,"But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault."
Bogrod,I'm fully aware of that. I'm also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.
Goblin,"Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --"
Bogrod,"Let me be specific with you, Ricbert. I've run this bank for forty-five years, long before anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood!"
Bogrod,"Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself."
Harry Potter,How long before they come after us?
Ron Weasley,What's that? Up ahead.
Griphook,I should have known --
Harry Potter,"What is that, Griphook?"
Harry Potter,Griphook! What is that!
Harry Potter,Well done. Hey.
Griphook,The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly.
Ron Weasley,You don't say.  Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?
Griphook,No.
Bogrod,What the devil are you all doing down here!
Griphook,We need him!
Bogrod,"Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you --"
Ron Weasley,Imperio!
Griphook,Well done.
Ron Weasley,No. It's not possible...
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell. That's a Welsh Green.
Hermione Granger,It looks like it's been down here forever.
Griphook,Go on.
Ron Weasley,It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
Hermione Granger,That's barbaric. I...
Griphook,We'll only have a few seconds. In other words... they'll be no do-
Griphook,"Ready, Bogrod?"
Bogrod,Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course.
Harry Potter,Lumos !
Ron Weasley,Lumos !
Hermione Granger,Lumos !
Ron Weasley,Blimey...
Hermione Granger,Look.
Hermione Granger,No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
Ron Weasley,"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?"
Hermione Granger,"It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY."
Hermione Granger,"Ron, your foot!"
Griphook,We'll be crushed! Hurry!
Harry Potter,That's it. Up there.
Hermione Granger,How're we going to reach it?
Harry Potter,Give me the sword! The real one.
Ron Weasley,Keep going!
Hermione Granger,Harry! Behind you!
Ron Weasley,The cup!
Hermione Granger,In here!
Harry Potter,"We have a deal, Griphook."
Griphook,I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.
Harry Potter,Griphook! Griphook!
Griphook,Thieves! Help! Thieves!
Ron Weasley,Foul little git. Least we've got Bogrod.
Ron Weasley,That's unfortunate.
Hermione Granger,We can't just stand here! Who's got an idea?
Ron Weasley,You're asking us? You're the brilliant one.
Hermione Granger,I've got something. But it's mad.
Hermione Granger,Relashio!
Ron Weasley,That's your idea?
Harry Potter,Come on!
Hermione Granger,It doesn't realize it's free!
Ron Weasley,That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell.
Harry Potter,We're dropping!
Ron Weasley,I say we jump!
Hermione Granger,When?
Voldemort,"The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe."
Harry Potter,He knows.
Hermione Granger,How is it you --
Harry Potter,I saw him.
Hermione Granger,"You let him in! Harry, you can't --"
Harry Potter,"I can't always help it, Hermione!"
Ron Weasley,Never mind! What did you see?
Harry Potter,He's angry. But he's scared too. He's going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.
Ron Weasley,What happens when he finds out four are gone?
Harry Potter,I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts.
Hermione Granger,What?
Ron Weasley,What?
Hermione Granger,You saw it?
Hermione Granger,Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --
Harry Potter,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose."
Ron Weasley,'Fraid he's right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We can't just walk in the front door.
Harry Potter,We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.
Harry Potter,"There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected."
Ron Weasley,Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.
Harry Potter,"No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more"
Hermione Granger,They were ready for us.
Death Eater,"We know you're here, Potter. There's no getting away."
Death Eater,Perhaps you need some convincing.
Ron Weasley,What's he mean by that?
Hermione Granger,"No, you'll give us away."
Harry Potter,Expecto Patronum!
Aberforth Dumbledore,"In here, Potter."
Ron Weasley,Did you get a look at him! Fora second I thought it was --
Hermione Granger,I know.
Hermione Granger,Harry! I can see you! In here!
Aberforth Dumbledore,You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is --
Harry Potter,You're Aberforth.
Harry Potter,Dumbledore's brother. It's you I've been seeing -- here. It's
Aberforth Dumbledore,Where've you left him?
Harry Potter,He's dead.
Aberforth Dumbledore,Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.
Aberforth Dumbledore,"Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago."
Harry Potter,Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --
Aberforth Dumbledore,Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you'd be if I didn't.
Aberforth Dumbledore,"Right then. Reckon you're hungry. Let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here."
Hermione Granger,Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
Aberforth Dumbledore,The Order is finished. You-Know- Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
Harry Potter,We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
Aberforth Dumbledore,Did he now? Nice job? Easy?
Harry Potter,We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.
Harry Potter,"If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight."
Aberforth Dumbledore,"It's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor boy. Go home. Live a little longer."
Harry Potter,"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through."
Harry Potter,Why should he...
Aberforth Dumbledore,Keep secrets? You tell me.
Harry Potter,I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.
Aberforth Dumbledore,Did you now? And why is that?
Harry Potter,I had no reason not to -
Aberforth Dumbledore,"That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who won't even tell him where to start. You're lying. Not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does."
Harry Potter,You're drunk.
Aberforth Dumbledore,"You don't strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I'll ask you again. There must be a reason. Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why?"
Aberforth Dumbledore,You know what to do...
Harry Potter,Where've you sent her?
Aberforth Dumbledore,You'll see soon enough.
Hermione Granger,"That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful."
Aberforth Dumbledore,She'll always be beautiful.
Hermione Granger,"She died very young, didn't she."
Aberforth Dumbledore,"My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her. She was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time."
Hermione Granger,Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.
Hermione Granger,"Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?"
Hermione Granger,She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!
Ron Weasley,Who's that with her? Bloody hell...
Neville Longbottom,I knew you'd come! I told them alii! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!
Harry Potter,"Neville, you look..."
Neville Longbottom,Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron!
Neville Longbottom,"Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way."
Neville Longbottom,Well? Ready?
Ron Weasley,I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.
Neville Longbottom,That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors.
Hermione Granger,"How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster."
Neville Longbottom,Hardly ever see him. It's the Carrows you have to watch out for.
Harry Potter,The Carrows?
Neville Longbottom,"Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the Carrows."
Hermione Granger,They did that to you? But why?
Neville Longbottom,Today's Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed.
Neville Longbottom,"Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there."
Neville Longbottom,"Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?  Hey! Listen up, you lot! I've brought you a surprise!"
Seamus Finnigan,Blimey.
Neville Longbottom,Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.
Nigel Wolpert,"River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report: Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck..."
Neville Longbottom,"Okay, okay! Stand down! lLet's not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance!"
Harry Potter,"Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who."
Neville Longbottom,What is it?
Harry Potter,We don't know.
Dean Thomas,Where is it?
Harry Potter,I realize it's not much to go on.
Seamus Finnigan,That's nothing to go on.
Harry Potter,"I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?"
Luna Lovegood,"Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem."
Luna Lovegood,The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous.
Cho Chang,"Yes, but Luna, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it."
Ron Weasley,Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
Cho Chang,"It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara."
Cho Chang,"Ravenclaw's was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer."
Ginny Weasley,Harry.
Harry Potter,"Hey there. Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry. He frowns, speaks to Hermione."
Ron Weasley,"Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother."
Seamus Finnigan,"Got loads of those, though, doesn't she? There's only one Harry."
Ron Weasley,"Shut up, Seamus."
Neville Longbottom,"What is it, Ginny?"
Ginny Weasley,Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
Alecto Carrow,"Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn't want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you?"
Severus Snape,Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
Severus Snape,I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
Severus Snape,"For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle."
Severus Snape,Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.
Harry Potter,I think I can help you out with that... -.. Harry appears.
Harry Potter,And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.
Harry Potter,How dare you stand where he stood.
Harry Potter,"Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!"
Harry Potter,I'm a Gryffindor.
Voldemort,I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is foily.
Voldemort,I wish you no harm. TI have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit...
Voldemort,Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shail leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
Pansy parkinson,But he's there! Potter's there! Someone grab him!
Argus Filch,Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
Argus Filch,"Oh. Sorry, mum."
Argus Filch,Right away.
Harry Potter,Time. As much as you can give me.
Harry Potter,"Is that possible, Professor?"
Harry Potter,I think you're right.
Harry Potter,"You, too, Professor."
Neville Longbottom,"Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?"
Neville Longbottom,To blow it up. Boom.
Neville Longbottom,Wicked.
Seamus Finnigan,I can bring 'er down.
Filius Flitwick,"You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely."
Pomona Sprout,That doesn't mean we can't hold him up.
Professors,Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum...
Ron Weasley,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux."
Hermione Granger,Unless we can destroy it.
Ron Weasley,So we were thinking --
Hermione Granger,You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.
Ron Weasley,"You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?"
Harry Potter,Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
Hermione Granger,Where are you going?
Harry Potter,"Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is"
Luna Lovegood,Harry! Wait! I need to talk to
Harry Potter,"I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna."
Harry Potter,"We'll talk later, Luna."
Luna Lovegood,Harry --
Harry Potter,Later.
Luna Lovegood,Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: 'There's not a person alive who's seen it.'
Luna Lovegood,"It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead."
Luna Lovegood,"He's very impressive, isn't he?"
Voldemort,They never learn. Such a pity.
Voldemort,Begin.
Pius Thicknesse,"But, my Lord, shouldn't we wait --"
Fred Weasley,Nice night for it!
Harry Potter,"Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?"
Seamus Finnigan,That's it. I want a charge on each and every joist.
Neville Longbottom,"You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?"
Neville Longbottom,Blimey.
Neville Longbottom,Not good.
Luna Lovegood,"If you're to find her, you'll find her down there."
Luna Lovegood,No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy.
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
Dean Thomas,"Yes, sir."
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Dean!
Remus Lupin,"It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers."
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Who said that?
Remus Lupin,Me.
Remus Lupin,Speaking of quality.
Remus Lupin,You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you.
Nymphadora Tonks,He'll sleep 'til dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight.
Harry Potter,It's you...
Neville Longbottom,Ha! dal
Neville Longbottom,Yeah! You and whose army!
Seamus Finnigan,Woah! Easy up there!
Neville Longbottom,Sorry.
Ron Weasley,Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?
Hermione Granger,No. Of course not.
Ron Weasley,I've never got this far before.
Hermione Granger,I'm scared.
Ron Weasley,Me too. Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this.
Hermione Granger,Not this.
Harry Potter,"You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower."
Helena Ravenclaw,I do not answer to that name.
Harry Potter,"I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me."
Helena Ravenclaw,Are you a friend of Luna's?
Harry Potter,Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
Helena Ravenclaw,You seek my mother's diadem.
Harry Potter,Yes! That's right --
Helena Ravenclaw,"Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you."
Harry Potter,Wait! Please!
Helena Ravenclaw,Many have sought my mother's diadem. Its powers are
Harry Potter,But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --
Harry Potter,I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me!
Harry Potter,I want to destroy it.
Harry Potter,"That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed."
Helena Ravenclaw,"But I only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the pain I felt... the pain I feel even now..."
Harry Potter,"I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory -"
Helena Ravenclaw,"Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name..."
Harry Potter,Tom Riddle --
Helena Ravenclaw,But he lied.
Harry Potter,He's lied to many people --
Helena Ravenclaw,I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic!
Helena Ravenclaw,Strange... you remind me of him a bit...
Helena Ravenclaw,It's here. In the castle. In the
Helena Ravenclaw,"If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask..."
Harry Potter,Thank you... -.. then turning...
Harry Potter,Thank you... -.. then running.
Ron Weasley,You do it.
Ron Weasley,"Yes, you can."
Neville Longbottom,Not good.
Ginny Weasley,Ready!?
Neville Longbottom,Are you bloody joking?!
Seamus Finnigan,He's good...
Seamus Finnigan,He's good...
Ginny Weasley,What?
Neville Longbottom,That was kind of exciting. Seamus grins and winks knowingly. Ginny shakes her head.
Ginny Weasley,Mad. The both of you.
Neville Longbottom,Not good.
Argus Filch,Night-tee night.
Pansy parkinson,"You let us out of here, you filthy squib!"
Harry Potter,Ginny! Neville! You alright?
Neville Longbottom,"Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?"
Harry Potter,Luna -- ?
Neville Longbottom,"I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!"
Ginny Weasley,I know.
Ron Weasley,Bloody hell. We/'ll never find him on this.
Hermione Granger,There he is.
Ron Weasley,Brilliant.
Hermione Granger,He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:
Hermione Granger,That's right. I did.
Ron Weasley,Let's go.
Hermione Granger,Brilliant.
Draco Malfoy,Take my hand.
Draco Malfoy,"Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry."
Harry Potter,I could ask you the same.
Draco Malfoy,I virtually lived here last year. Remember?
Harry Potter,I remember.
Harry Potter,What's wrong with the one you have?
Draco Malfoy,Easy.
Harry Potter,Why didn't you tell her?
Harry Potter,Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
Draco Malfoy,Give me my wand.
Harry Potter,No. I don't think so...
Harry Potter,"Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me..."
Gregory Goyle,"C'mon, Draco. Don't be a prat."
Gregory Goyle,Avada Kedavra!
Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Hermione Granger,Did you see where it went? The diadem!
Harry Potter,Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.
Ron Weasley,RUN! Goyle's set the bioody place on fire!
Harry Potter,Split up!
Hermione Granger,Do we climb!
Harry Potter,"No, it''ll just follow us!"
Harry Potter,Here! Take one!
Ron Weasley,Serves him right.
Hermione Granger,C'mon! This way!
Harry Potter,Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
Ron Weasley,Brilliant.
Voldemort,Nagini. Come.
Ron Weasley,You're bloody well welcome!
Harry Potter,"Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul."
Harry Potter,He does.
Harry Potter,It's the snake. She's the last one. The last Horcrux.
Ron Weasley,Where will he take her?
Hermione Granger,Someplace safe.
Harry Potter,No. He'll keep her close.
Ron Weasley,"Look inside him, Harry."
Ron Weasley,"Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this."
Voldemort,Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten.
Lucius Malfoy,"Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?"
Voldemort,"I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!"
Lucius Malfoy,"Of c-course, my Lord."
Voldemort,"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?  Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately."
Harry Potter,I know where he is.
Sybill Trelawney,"There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
Luna Lovegood,Thanks.
Neville Longbottom,Don't mention it.
Voldemort,Why doesn't it work for me?
Severus Snape,"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --"
Voldemort,No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!
Severus Snape,"There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only."
Voldemort,Does it?
Severus Snape,My Lord?
Voldemort,The wand. Does it truly answer to me?
Voldemort,"You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know."
Voldemort,"Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?"
Severus Snape,"With you, of course, my Lord."
Voldemort,"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am"
Voldemort,"The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine."
Severus Snape,My Lord --
Voldemort,"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus."
Voldemort,But only I can live forever...
Voldemort,Kill.
Voldemort,Nagini! Come!
Severus Snape,Take them...
Severus Snape,Take them!
Severus Snape,Please.
Harry Potter,Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
Severus Snape,They are the same...
Severus Snape,You have your mother's eyes...
Ron Weasley,He's gone. The snake too.
Voldemort,You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical bliood
Voldemort,"I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured."
Ron Weasley,Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!
Hermione Granger,Where is everyone?
Severus Snape,Lily... Then...
Petunia Dursley,Lily! Come out of there! Now!
Petunia Dursley,We're going home.
Severus Snape,She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special.
Lily Potter,That's mean.
Severus Snape,It's true. You know so yourself.
Severus Snape,No! Don't kill me!
Albus Dumbledore,That wasn't my intention.
Albus Dumbledore,"Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?"
Albus Dumbledore,Is this about the Prophecy?
Severus Snape,Yes.
Albus Dumbledore,How much did you relay?
Severus Snape,Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her.
Albus Dumbledore,The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --
Severus Snape,Yes! But he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!
Albus Dumbledore,"If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy."
Severus Snape,I have asked.
Albus Dumbledore,You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
Severus Snape,She's more than that! She's different! Beautiful. Kind.
Albus Dumbledore,"And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?"
Severus Snape,Anything.
Severus Snape,You said you would keep her safe!
Albus Dumbledore,"Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus."
Albus Dumbledore,The boy survives.
Albus Dumbledore,He has her eyes.
Severus Snape,He doesn't need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --
Albus Dumbledore,The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.
Severus Snape,No one can know. Your word.
Albus Dumbledore,"My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist."
Severus Snape,He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father's. And he seems to relish his fame.
Albus Dumbledore,"Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging."
Severus Snape,You see what you want to see.
Albus Dumbledore,Perhaps. oOh. Severus.
Severus Snape,Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.
Albus Dumbledore,I was... foolish... greedy...
Severus Snape,Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.
Albus Dumbledore,For the time being?
Severus Snape,It will spread.
Albus Dumbledore,How long?
Severus Snape,Maybe a year.
Albus Dumbledore,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward."
Albus Dumbledore,"Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?"
Severus Snape,It is not expected that he will succeed.
Albus Dumbledore,You must agree.
Albus Dumbledore,"Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely."
Severus Snape,You ask too much.
Albus Dumbledore,There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
Severus Snape,Tell him what?
Albus Dumbledore,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself."
Albus Dumbledore,There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
Severus Snape,"So when the time comes, the boy must die."
Severus Snape,You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
Albus Dumbledore,"But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?"
Severus Snape,Expecto Patronum!
Albus Dumbledore,Lily. After all this time?
Severus Snape,Always... We GO TO BLACK...
Albus Dumbledore,"The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing..."
Hermione Granger,Where've you been?
Ron Weasley,"We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --"
Harry Potter,I'm going there now.
Ron Weasley,Are you mad! No!
Harry Potter,It's... meant to be.
Ron Weasley,"Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him -- Hermione squeezes Ron's arm, silencing him."
Hermione Granger,"What is it, Harry? What is it you"
Harry Potter,There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
Harry Potter,I think I've known for awhile.
Hermione Granger,I'll go with you. I/'ll --
Harry Potter,Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over.
Oliver Wood,I'll take him from here.
Ginny Weasley,It's all right. We're going to get you inside.
Student,I kept calling. No one came.
Ginny Weasley,Don't worry. I won't leave you. I promise.
Lily Potter,"You've been so brave, sweetheart."
Harry Potter,Why are you here? All of you?
Lily Potter,"We never left, dear."
Harry Potter,Does it hurt? Dying?
Sirius Black,Quicker than falling asleep.
Remus Lupin,And he will want it to be quick.
James Potter,"You're nearly there, son."
Harry Potter,"I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son..."
Remus Lupin,Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand...
Harry Potter,You'll stay with me?
James Potter,Until the end.
Harry Potter,He won't be able to see you?
Sirius Black,"No. We're here, you see."
Harry Potter,Stay close to me.
Lily Potter,Always...
Corban Yaxley,"No sign of him, my Lord."
Voldemort,"I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken."
Harry Potter,You weren't.
Corban Yaxley,Quiet!
Voldemort,Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die. Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death Eaters. Harry's gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises
Albus Dumbledore,You cannot help.
Albus Dumbledore,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk."
Harry Potter,"Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, yes."
Harry Potter,Then... I'm dead too?
Harry Potter,Not?
Albus Dumbledore,Not.
Harry Potter,But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.
Harry Potter,"It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?"
Albus Dumbledore,Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
Albus Dumbledore,"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make."
Harry Potter,And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
Albus Dumbledore,"Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess."
Harry Potter,"Professor, is that -- ?"
Harry Potter,"Exactly where are we, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?
Harry Potter,It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
Albus Dumbledore,"King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party."
Harry Potter,"Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?"
Albus Dumbledore,"You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust"
Albus Dumbledore,"I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man."
Harry Potter,Sir --
Albus Dumbledore,"You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life."
Harry Potter,"You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Harry Potter,"I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin..."
Albus Dumbledore,True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?
Harry Potter,"I've got to go back, haven't I?"
Albus Dumbledore,That is up to you.
Harry Potter,I've got a choice?
Albus Dumbledore,"Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train."
Harry Potter,And where would it take me?
Albus Dumbledore,On.
Harry Potter,Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
Albus Dumbledore,True.
Harry Potter,And the snake lives.
Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
Harry Potter,And I've nothing to kill it with.
Albus Dumbledore,'Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'
Albus Dumbledore,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my"
Harry Potter,"With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle."
Albus Dumbledore,"I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon."
Harry Potter,"Which would be, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,Luck.
Albus Dumbledore,"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love."
Harry Potter,"Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?"
Albus Dumbledore,"Actually, if I think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all."
Harry Potter,Professor.
Harry Potter,Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?
Albus Dumbledore,"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,"My lord, let me help you --"
Voldemort,I do not require assistance.
Bellatrix Lestrange,The boy. Is he dead?
Narcissa Malfoy,Is he alive? Draco?
Sorting Hat,"Don't despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good reason..."
Ginny Weasley,Who's that?
Ginny Weasley,... Hagrid's carrying?
Ginny Weasley,"Neville, who is that?"
Arthur Weasley,"What's going on here, Neville?"
Voldemort,"Behold, Nagini. Our work is done."
Ginny Weasley,No... NO!
Voldemort,Stupid girl. You cry for that?
Voldemort,"While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's."
Voldemort,So do not cry for that. He's not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat.
Ron Weasley,Liar!
Voldemort,"Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER Is"
Voldemort,Now is the time to declare yourself.
Lucius Malfoy,Draco...
Lucius Malfoy,"Draco, don't be stupid --"
Narcissa Malfoy,"Come, Draco."
Ron Weasley,He saved your life.
Voldemort,"Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don't be shy."
Voldemort,"Well, I must say, I'd hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?"
Voldemort,"Who might you be, young man?"
Neville Longbottom,Neville Longbottom.
Voldemort,"Well, welcome, Neville. I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks."
Bellatrix Lestrange,Someone has to do the washing.
Voldemort,"Now, now, Bellatrix. Let's not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day..."
Neville Longbottom,I'd like to say something.
Voldemort,"Very well, Neville. I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
Neville Longbottom,It doesn't matter that Harry is gone. A troubled MURMUR ripples through the crowd.
Neville Longbottom,This isn't over.
Draco Malfoy,Potter! Harry turns. Draco's hand whips forward and -- to Harry's shock -- tosses him his wand. Ron GRINS.
Ron Weasley,"Well done, Malfoy!"
Harry Potter,Confringo!
Harry Potter,The snake! We've got to kill the snake!
Neville Longbottom,Harry! Look out!
Voldemort,Nagini! With me!
Voldemort,Leave her!
Voldemort,I said LEAVE HER!
Voldemort,Nagini
Voldemort,Die! Die
Voldemort,Why do you live!
Harry Potter,Because I have something worth living for.
Harry Potter,Confringo!
Bellatrix Lestrange,"Come on, granny, give us your best."
Molly Weasley,"Back off, boys! She's mine!  You will never touch my chiidren again!"
Bellatrix Lestrange,Be thankful we only took one. Besides...
Ron Weasley,Hermione!
Hermione Granger,Yes!
Hermione Granger,I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it!
Harry Potter,You were right.
Harry Potter,When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.
Voldemort,It belongs to me! I killed Snape!
Harry Potter,Together.
Hermione Granger,What's the matter with her?
Sybill Trelawney,"There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
Harry Potter,I told you: it's useless to you.
Ron Weasley,"Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?"
Hermione Granger,Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
Hermione Granger,Something my mum used to say.
Hermione Granger,Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand.
Harry Potter,Because it answers to another.
Harry Potter,"When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape."
Ron Weasley,But that means...
Harry Potter,It answers to me.
Ron Weasley,What do you reckon we should do with it?
Hermione Granger,We?
Harry Potter,"Well, it wasn't boring, was it?"
Harry Potter,Together?
Hermione Granger,Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.
Albus Potter,Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?
Harry Potter,"There's nothing scary about thestrals. They're gentle things. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages. You/'be going in the boats, remember?"
Albus Potter,Dad?
Harry Potter,Yes?
Albus Potter,What if I'm put in Slytherin?
Harry Potter,Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
Albus Potter,But just say I am --
Harry Potter,"Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
Albus Potter,Really?
Harry Potter,Really.
Harry Potter,Ready?
Albus Potter,Ready.
