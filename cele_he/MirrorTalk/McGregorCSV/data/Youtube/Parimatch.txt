today

basically i want to ask you questions

which are

not normally asked um nothing to do with

ufc

because uh obviously everyone knows you

as a living

living legend of the sport and a lot of

material material has already been

covered on this topic

uh it would be interesting to know

another side of yours like

uh corner as a businessman cause conor

connor as a human being corner as a

father

corner as a husband just to basically

share your

personal experiences which are beyond uh

fighting career are you fine with that

yeah

to start yeah that would be my pleasure

to start with

uh my pleasure how do you look at this

year i mean this year has been tough for

everyone just i mean globally but

personally how do you sum up this year i

mean corona

ufc like uh what do you think has

has this year been good or you think

it's maybe

uh it's been a challenge you know

you know there are challenges of course

every year every day every second you

know

you know there's always challenges but

for me i am an optimist true and true

and you know although there are lots of

things going on around the world but

there's lots of opportunity

you know there's lots of opportunity to

adapt to

evolve into something else all business

sectors and all areas are

are you know they're forced to look at

their ways and adapt and evolve and that

is only good

uh you know anytime you have to you're

almost

even if you're forced to look at

yourself in the mirror and look at your

own practices and your own

ways of how you carry yourself you know

if you're forced to look at that and

address that

and assess that and and and you know

make

growth through that that that is only a

positive

so you know i look at this year as an

opportunistic gear you know what i mean

there are a lot of

there are a lot of things moving and

shaking and you best believe you know

through this situation we are faced with

you will see some amazing things take

place as you have already seen you know

what i mean

some very uh highly intuitive things you

know what i mean some some some things

that have happened and the way people

have handled things so

you know i just i just look at it with

it with an opportunist

uh opportunistic mindset and an optimist

very optimistic you know that good

things will happen from it so

it's always happened to me sergey

anytime anything bad has happened to me

or anything i've any time i've been

faced with something that forces me to

look at myself i look at the

surroundings

you know it's always worked out for the

better so

you know you've got to go to the storm

to get to the zone you know they say so

that that for me is the way i'm looking

at this year do you think

it's possible to achieve success without

this mindset without you know seeing

opportunities without being adopted in

let's say for the

upcoming generations for the next 10

years all businessmen all businessmen if

they don't have this mindset can they

succeed your opinion

no no impossible yeah i don't think so

i would say so yeah you've got to you

know it's got to start with the mind

your mind has to

believe in believing chance believing

believing in the divine believing things

to to happen for you

you know what i mean it's got to you

can't your mind must create these things

before anything else

and then the rest of it you know through

work getting through

through fighting through the doubts and

through the storm so to speak

you know you know maybe other people's

doubts upon you

you know fighting through all of that

strengthening again this strengthens

your own mind

and then you know you you will break

through and succeed you've got to you've

got to see it you've got to have it in

you've got to have that outlook

fully agree you know it is hard at times

to get to that stage but it's

about a lot of self-talk you know a lot

of self-er

self-talk with yourself and and and just

being honest with yourself you know a

lot of people can lie to themselves but

if you're truly honest with yourself

you know a lot of most of us if not all

of us know the changes we must make or

the things we must do

in order to become successful or to

reach the heights where it happens is we

just don't do it

you know you i know i've got to get up

at 8 a.m in the morning i get up at 9

a.m

you know these are things

i know i should need this extra pack of

donuts but you eat them you know

these are little defeats in yourself if

you if you if you simplify it what you

what time you go to bed what time you

wake up at if you can control that if

you can control what you put into your

mouth

be it food or drink or any of that if

you can control those two things

you know they are the main things to

control everything else is

you know everything else just falls into

place after that so if you if you if you

listen to yourself and take care of

yourself in this manner

it strengthens your your power to

conquer anything else

and and that's you know that's where i

have that's where i have succeeded

and it's also where i i felt short so

this is coming from a

this is coming from an experienced talk

and even you know

as an everyday team that i must you know

i must bring it back to the basics you

know look after

my rest look after my nutrition i

treat my body and my mind like a temple

and then everything else falls into

place you know i could say make sure i

go training make sure i keep my

structure my training structure

but if i get my rest correct and if i

get my food and nutrition correct

the trainingism is i don't even got to

speak on the training because it's a

guarantee

i have energy i'm for i am i am excited

to go to work

you know be it exercise or be a business

so i don't even got to say i got to make

sure i got to be at this all

at this training session at this time or

this meeting that's a given

i'm asleep at a certain time i'm up at a

certain time i'm eating a specific diet

that's going to boost my

immunity my endurance my mindset

everything else

that comes with it and then it's like a

i don't want to say a domino

effect because dominoes is knocking it

down it's like a reverse domino effect

you know it builds it up you can't build

you can't build something on an unstable

foundation

you know you build something on a shaky

foundation

you can even get it high as you can you

can

you know you can build something on it

you can throw things together and get it

up

high real quick but the cracks in that

early foundations will start to

it will start to present itself and it

will start to open up and

eventually crumble and it's a hard

crumble

you know it's a hard fall when you do

this everyone

everyone looks will look to skip these

things and make excuses for these things

the basics

and but it catches up on you you know

what i mean the night cell will catch up

on you the lack of that

the lack of discipline in the in in in

the

you know it's it's i'm going to say the

small things but it's not you know as

they say the small

the small things make the big things

what you put into your body what rest

you take you know

you you were saying about your you play

you you have this place where you go

you go to and it's like your water you

know we've got to have these things that

that strengthen us and and and

guide us to that next level and that's

that's where i'm at now and i'm trying

to

i'm trying to stay no i'm not trying

because you know i am

i'm working for it and i'm doing it

that's it it's dawn i'm being i'm

i'm engaged holy in it now i'm fully

obsessed and fully committed

to being the best version of myself and

that's it you know so

onwards and upwards we go what about

surroundings

i mean people that surround you how

important is it as

a part of the core picking right people

you know to

help help you through it or maybe

cleaning cleaning up some people so they

don't distract you

you think it's important

yeah you know i hear what you're saying

it's like

you know as time goes on things will

just happen naturally you know what i

mean i feel those that are there are

there

and and those that are not you know they

are not and eventually

eventually they say the cream always

rises to the top

so you know if you just put true faith

in that alone you know that as long as

you

internally your own self is is correct

and your elite you know people you must

lead from the top

you know you it filters down throughout

the staff or throughout the people

surrounding you or whatnot

in your businesses it filters from the

top you know the people

the people the staff below are one that

are not gonna say below like people are

above each other it's not like that but

i'm just saying

people that are are looking at who's

who's

instructing them will be looking at at

how

how they carry themselves they'll be

looking at how the how the the leader

carries themselves the chairman the ceo

the boss whatever

you want to call it and then you know

they will

they will respond to that if the boss is

late or if the boss is acting humble

then everyone else thinks it's okay to

act up

you know what i mean so it comes down

from the top and that's why i'm almost

like

you know regarding bad people that made

bad energies or bad things i almost

don't

i don't dwell too much on that because

it almost just works itself out as

long as internally you from the top

are correct and it filters down and that

you will only see

good from that you know a guy that i've

been speaking to recently was like and

even my own mother right i've been very

proud of my mother recently and actually

she caught she actually you know

my mother was was was going through some

things and she she

came through with flying colors and

she's like a new woman and when i seen

this

and my my mother is at the top my mother

is the top right

and that's that seeing her correct she

wasn't telling me connor do this do this

be right get yourself right do this do

that you know because that is

almost you're going gonna say wait what

i'm okay and

you'll almost rebel against that it's

leading by example

and i saw my mother in the great light

that she was in and i was in

all of it and i was like i'm gonna do

that i want to get to that stage

i want to be in this position and that

motivated me

to go and correct myself so that's what

i'm saying

in in that way you know as long as you

in your place

are correct and on top of your game to

what you need to do and where you're

going

everything else around you will fall

into shape and everyone will

you know take inspiration from that and

become that in their own way

and then they will bring their own

qualities to it which will make the

whole

picture like a picasso you know like a

picasso painting for sure man very wise

words i fully agree the only way forward

is lead by example don't force anything

because it will naturally happen

wrong people will will depart and right

people will

join join joins the vegan you know yeah

so uh

for sure and i went through that went

through this time

almost trying to get people the way it

the way i feel it should be but it's not

about that

that's all external in the internal must

be correct

you know it's like listening to external

thoughts or external doubts from people

that will criticize you or want to see

you fail or

are are pro it's like a mirror almost

people will project their own

insecurities towards you

you know what i mean it's like it all

it's all external it does not matter

you know as long as your internal is

strong and correct and focused

again it's like a mirror so my internal

is correct and i'm looking out in

a in such a strong place it

reflects back like a mirror you know and

then all i'm seeing is

internal strength within my surrounding

you know what i mean

the external is not even not even a uh

nothing you know i went to here you go

online or something you'll see some guy

hey

you're only [ __ ] you only fought

ceremony or you know

like imagine saying that imagine some

guy saying that about a legend or

something or you know the way the way

the fans kind of try and

downplay who you fought or something or

you haven't fought this guy yet or you

ain't done that

if you think of it like a mirror that

man or that person who is

writing this are saying this him he

himself is projecting his own

insecurities

because that man would have not even

fought anyone on planet earth

so he said you ain't doing this you

ain't doing that when really it's his

own thoughts

that he ain't done this or ain't done

that on any scale

so it's just it's like a mirror so you

know i just see it you know

as long as your own self is right

everything else around you will become

right and that's it

so being indifferent to external is is

also part of the key right

being indifferent to the external yeah

yes of course i've been reactive to it

external

and even now and with all the things

that's going on with me in the fight

business

say yeah i know we don't want to talk

about the business no problem i

appreciate that also it's a different

conversation

yeah it's it's it's it's they it's a

it's a

it's a it's an attempt at getting you

getting a reaction

getting you to like like bait like bait

on a fishing rod

you know they want to draw out a

reaction tish to paint your character or

yourself in a different way

to see you go a different route but it's

like

as long as you're yourself and you're

strong and you're you know

like i said leading from leading from

the top

you know it's like it's it's

non-existent you're not reactive you're

creative

and that is what it's all about it's

about creating

not reacting do you think for modern

leaders it's important to have someone

you know to pass on the knowledge

someone who who will inspire you or are

you singing on your own it's also

possible without listening to others to

succeed

well uh you know you're that's a bit

that's a bit ego that's a bit of vegan

ego issue i feel

you can't you know you've got to be

you've got to have an open mind you've

got to

you've got to accept and not you know

it's almost like

the old martial arts way before it

became like

before people began mixing the arts it

was like

a corrupting coach would

disrespect someone else's methods and

almost

this like really almost spit on that the

methods in the way of training and

that is not the right way and then all

of a sudden the fight would happen

and it would not end well and then it

was they were forced to look at

themselves you know so that i would feel

that that's kind of the same thing

if you don't if you don't look for

guidance from elsewhere

you know we are all we are all students

at the end of the day and if that's got

to be understood

no matter what level you are you know we

are all students we must all remain

with that student beginner beginner

mindset

so where i think to be a leader you've

got to

to be to be a leader you've got to be an

amazing student

you know what i mean and you've got a

remainder no one knows where

conor invests where do you invest

where where do you normally invest like

invest money i mean do you

in which areas you invest some people

know that you are uh

co-owner of proper wealth but do you

have other businesses where you have

stakes and like what what spheres of

business do you

put your money into

i have many uh i have many businesses

and i'm involved in many many things for

sure you know obviously i've got the

proper 12.

i've got mcgregor fast i've got the mac

live media you know

i i've also got paradigm sports

management i've got

you know i've got property development

work going on here as well i've gotten

i've got my hand in many pies you know

what i mean many many good things that

are going on

for me i just i invest as far as like

stocks and bonds and all of this type of

thing i don't

i don't engage in any of that i don't

engage not that i'm not that i'm not not

that i don't think that that's

a bad thing but and and maybe down the

line i don't know you know i've met with

these financial advisors and i've

listened to them and you know

it's uh it's not really related to me to

be honest to be putting my money in

things that i have no interest in or no

passion towards

i just go down and invest in things that

uh

i'm i'm passionate about i've got

claymore productions also which is a

production company

and and we've got big things planned

with netflix regarding my own

you know my own movies as well as uh

executive producer producer of other

ventures and you know so the production

aspect is very good

um geez i've got about i've said i've

got about nine or ten eight

eight or nine i'd say how about

technology do you have any investments

in the technology businesses like

i know some websites media media

websites or uh

technology companies

yeah i have my media side the microwave

we're actually doing

amazing numbers mainly uh

mixed martial arts and fight sports and

we're looking to grow and go into other

sports as well as

we do lifestyle and health and and these

type of things so

it's growing at a nice rate you know

it's been steady and but it's

the numbers are you know we're actually

doing better numbers than than the than

the uh promotions that were actually

covering you know their their is we're

doing better than them so you know we're

doing

we're doing pretty good we're getting

good traffic and and you know it's

growing so

that would be my media side of things on

my my electronic side of things

on my technology side of things but also

mcgregor fast

i'm in the closing stages of partnering

up with a crowd

um from the u.s that had involvement

in uh with nike that they've done some

amazing things with nike and

a crowd called freeletics they they have

an incredible database and

infrastructure for online

fitness programs they've had incredible

success with it

so we are engaging in that process now

so pretty soon that will be uh that will

be done

and we'll be ready to launch that and it

will basically get you

the the consumer the person will be able

to train

with me and under my guidance with the

sport and by the sports scientists that

have trained me

gonna bring out as well so that's that's

another technology side of things that's

that's going really well and moving

towards uh an announcement so hopefully

hopefully really soon so from what i

hear you will increase

uh your um number of investments into

technology sphere right

more technology companies because this

is after all it's the future i mean

we see the technological companies they

scale they grow they're

like crazy conquering the world yeah

yeah

yeah yeah well this crowd now this crowd

now has incredible database to

to reach the consumer the online fitness

consumer

you know what i mean and the way they

you know the way they suggested to come

go at things and to when that you know

to to launch things was very exciting to

me

and i was very on board when i was like

this is this is the right setup

i believe we're going to change lives

with this program and i'm very excited

about that i'm also going to work on

you know something that's a dream of

mine is to host a mcgregor fast world

games

you know like it uh a mountain bike hill

racing

you know many maybe a white collar maybe

white collar matches at the end of it or

something to decide the winner

you know there are many exciting games

that we can create under the mcgregor

fast program

and be it long endurance runes be it

short hills be it even long hill sprints

on them on the big heavy mountain bikes

that i was that i've been

the training i've engaged in basically i

want to make them into competitions

and then host a game somewhere and

somewhere in a beautiful part of the

world and have amazing

athletes and competitors compete and

bring people on board and do something

do something good

you know and align it with all with all

the people that are partnered with me

and

continue to grow and continue to change

people's lives for the better

for all these businesses you sit at the

board and make only strategic decisions

or you actually involve yourself into

operations like how do you run it

how do you run those businesses

yeah i'm certainly involved in a lot of

a lot of it you know i just i'm on a lot

of calls with a lot of people

you know what i mean and i have a great

team of people

you know that that that work with me and

you know i would i would trust in them

wholeheartedly

so they would come to me with many

things and then i would

say what i would like or what way we

should go and then we kind of round it

out and

you know i i usually the way i handle

things in my life or business or

anything i

you know in being such big ventures and

that there's just

usually there's a group of people a

collective group of people

and i would usually hear out everyone's

thoughts on certain things

be it two people three people be a 10

people you know depending on what

situation it is and i and i would come

to

i would gather all the information and

where we are you know obviously growth

is everywhere i know we discussed our

markets and

i'm i'm all for it i highly admire party

match i've had great work with yourself

i have a very close relationship with

yourself it's beyond

it's beyond anything even business you

know it's at this stage it's beyond that

you know i have a very close

relationship with you i admire how you

carry yourself i admire the three traits

you said about yourself i admire about

you

your empathy your calmness

and your passion and you know all the

staff that i

that have been uh you know engaging with

me that i was out there at that time and

i had an amazing experience i'd love to

get partnered with it

you know i i feel it's a sector that

it's a sector that's going to come to me

that's i'm going to be engaged in any

way

you know it's going to happen somewhere

away so i

don't have to have this amazing can i

have to do it we have to do it

it's going to happen you know i'm like

you know yourself so

i don't wh yeah

has to be done between us i agree so we

will solve it

apart from betting any other sector

where you would love to get in

apart from betting any sector you would

just dream to get in

um well i did mention music i do like

music

i like i like perform performance you

know what i mean so maybe something to

do with that

if you have like a life purpose

you never shared it like ultimate goal

inner peace to be happy to be engaged in

things i enjoy

with the people that i that i enjoy

spending time with that's

that's it what short advice can you give

to all leaders out there or

all those who struggling today like what

is a very simple formula

how to live today or how to adapt to

continually changing environment

and very challenging times like what's

the

simple thing simple advice to everyone

i suppose i'll just give the advice that

i've been utilizing myself

rather than looking out all the time at

the doom and the gloom that's all

that's all around us at times it

sometimes feels like it's so

overwhelming

look within look within yourself what

are the

what are the what feel like minor things

but they are actually the major things

what are the we'll call the minor things

right what are the what are the minor

things that you can do

in your own self that can make you

better

you know are you are you eating correct

are you exercising correct are you

resting correct again back to the basics

back to the foundation back to the car

handle these things and the outlook will

begin to

appear so much better you know what i

mean it's

it has to be it has to begin within it

is no one else's fault

it is their all the external

circumstances are

they do not matter so do do not give

them time do not

do not point blame at them or do not put

energy into them

bring that energy internally focus on

your internal self

your rest your you know your nutrition

your

your health your exercise your your your

social time with people you love

you know these type of things put time

into these and watch

everything else transform that would be

my advice

man thank you very much i mean from on

behalf of very much and all partners and

the entire team just want to express

deepest gratitude for this entry because

this side of corner not many people see
