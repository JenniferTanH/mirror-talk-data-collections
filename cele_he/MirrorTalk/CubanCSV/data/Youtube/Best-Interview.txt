while Mark first of all thank you so

much for taking the time man to come to

your American Airlines Center you know

most people you think this is a bar you

talk to most people this would look like

a bar but this happens to be the coolest

office in the world this is your office

in the center right this is where I go

to get away it's my office my mancave my

bar when I need it preferably to

celebrate it rather than drown my

sorrows but yeah this is where I get

away well so far it's been a pretty good

start for you guys eight and fours yeah

you know we've got to play a lot better

but we'll see what happens I feel good

about how the players are playing out I

send you cyber dust you have they sing

about how I felt on yeah Dee will cuz a

lot of people thought he was but he's a

very well yeah and he's still not 100%

healthy so you know as he gets more

comfortable and gets a little bit

feeling a little bit better he's going

you better I feel that as well he's he

had at one point he was one Paul was two

if you remember that yep I know it's not

a regular guy so if he's got the fire

again he could do some stuff yeah I

think you know he's just feeling his way

a little bit and once he gets that

confidence up a little bit more he shows

those flashes of brilliance and I think

I feel the synergy when I see it so

there's some synergy with the team so so

let's get right into it at the time that

we have here together

mark biggest difference between being a

millionaire and a billionaire well would

you say the difference like the

difference between having a hundred

dollars and a thousand dollars worth a

dollar you know we're a penny and a

thousand dollars it's no difference no

no no it's huge difference I mean I've

been I've been blessed I mean I made a

lot of money at a relatively young age

and was a millionaire a few times over

but just in terms of what you can do and

the opportunities that buys there's no

comparison at the billionaire mom yeah

yeah this is crazy now how do you stay

so so so humble I mean you gotta be the

coolest cat in entrepreneurs everybody

people who follow you you got a lot of

opinions you just don't know it I'm sure

behind closed doors I see your

interviews sometimes you know you don't

but still the level of the one thing

that always impresses me with you is

because sometimes you know how guys get

to a higher level they have so many

people that hey Mark can you give me

money can you give me money kidding do

this you still are very accessible how

do you balance that accessibility and

still running all the businesses you run

well people you know that I'm close to I

know what's going on and so it's it's

really easy you know and if I don't know

you you know reach out to me on

cyberdust and I've got 30 seconds to

decide whether or not I want to know you

you know I don't do a lot of meetings I

don't do a lot of phone calls I don't do

a lot of sit downs I do almost

everything through cyberdust or email

and that makes me a lot more efficient

and gives me a lot more time in terms of

people wanting things you know it's the

best problem in the world to have and so

I try to be nice I try to be considerate

um but you know people people know me

know what's important to me and what's

not and either you fit in that or you

don't that's good to know

you know I finish your book and I watch

a lot of three pages of it but you know

what the one part in your book with the

edge that I think every entrepreneur

needs to real it's true literally I

think every entrepreneur even if it's

just the edge part well that's why I

made it so short and sweet right I want

people to see stories I wanted people to

see you know that if I can do what they

can do it um and I don't want to get

them all bogged down and you know this

little story or that little story and

try to you know try to sound smart or be

smart I figured you know the things that

have worked for me and the things that I

use to motivate myself if I could keep

it short and sweet people would actually

read it and you don't get comments all

the time this is the first book I've

read in years and I read it all in one

sitting and that was my goal and it gets

a lot done into one city yeah it's

something I guess a lot done in one

sitting okay for four bucks you can

afford it yeah absolutely

and so if you haven't read about if

you're watching you got to get the books

one of the action items at the end mark

so question I read the story you know

the whole $7,500 ring the eighty three

thousand a 85,000 the whole day you know

the the Motley eighteen year old and

then the sixteen year and all that stuff

that yeah but I'm curious if if you and

I were buddies in high school okay we're

14 years old 15 years old and we know

each other uh-huh would I bet on you

being who you are too

no chance really no chance tell me why I

mean I had my I had my good friends and

you know we we hung out and I was a

hustler there's there's no question I

was a hustler even in high school oh

yeah and into business in a big way um

but I don't I don't think people saw to

me it wasn't like people look to me oh

he's he's destined to succeed I'll show

you a picture of me in high school when

we leave I'm not gonna let you take a

picture of it all and you'll see why now

you got everybody curious you want you

can describe it but yeah I'll show it to

you but yeah I'm not gonna let you put

on camera no worries so in high school

you were the fungi were you were you

were you always the guy that made people

laugh when I was into sports not I

wasn't great at it I was just decent um

wasn't technology guy I mean I I was

into learning I was I was I was a

business guy I was I was the guy reading

about business all the time reading

business books all the time

you know going to Junior Achievement I

was a junior achievement geek why do why

were you reading business books because

I want that's what I knew I mean I was

wired that always you know I started my

first business when I was 12 I was

buying and selling baseball cards buying

and selling stamps anything I could do

to make money I was hustling and trying

to do so I was in the business but I not

so much were it was all my friends were

into it with me so they wouldn't know me

spell cards yeah baseball cards you name

it I mean I grew up in Pittsburgh and so

I would probably even less than 12 years

old I would excuse me go up by a bunch

of baseball cards that I collected and I

would package I would say okay you're

guaranteed to have a Pittsburgh pirate

in this package and I would charge three

times as much and I'd set up on this

park bench down in the park down it's

got Township where I grew up and I'd

have these little sails and it was great

I've made money you know I mean it was

you know and I learned as much about

business when I was nine ten and twelve

as I learned any other time I'm obsessed

with baseball cards there is it anything

no I wish I know I wish I still had on

but they're all long gone I gave it to

my brother who knows what happened

something about cards man I don't know

what it is you explain it to somebody

they think you're not so bad now you

learn yeah back then that's how you know

you had your favorite players and you

know you didn't see they weren't on TV

every day you

read about him in the newspaper there

was no internet and so baseball cards

were a way to connect you know I had my

Willie Stargell I have my Roberto

Clemente cards so you're not talking

about your tie back yeah there was no

pick it back then yeah so um Beck was

just getting started right so gonna you

know I don't look at it more I looked at

it just hey this is the home affinity it

wasn't like okay these were going to be

valuable at some point so yeah but it

was just you know it was just a means

yeah now you have the Honus Wagner card

you know I'm not like yeah that'd be a

cool card yeah but I've just I mean just

look look around you right I mean I got

stuff I'm just not into like I'm not a

big collector tech guy well I got your

gift man I'm with you now I wanted to

get you something and what can I get

this guy you may have it but I hope you

don't have my wife but I hope so so

let's get into entrepreneurship a little

but we already have but I you know going

into it now to focus on a little bit

what would you say out of all the

reasons in the world not regular but you

have the talent you know all these keys

to success etcetera what would you say

is the number one reason why people fail

not necessarily why they make you the

complete opposite right lack of brains

lack of effort lack of brains lack of

effort yeah they just they don't do the

work they don't learn you know when you

walk in the room when you start a

business and you start to talk about

somebody you're never in a vacuum with

no competition you know and unless

you're just extremely lucky and if

there's going to be competition that

means somebody else knows your business

as well as you do when you get started

and if you walk into a competitive

environment and they still know more

about the business than you do and more

about your customers you're going to

lose and but most people don't consider

that they don't do the work they don't

learn more about their industry they

don't know even about their business I

mean and so you've got to put in the

effort to know more about your industry

than anybody else and that's that's the

brains part and that's the effort part

as well because look if you're competing

with me you you better know what you're

doing otherwise I'm gonna kick your ass

you know and you're not gonna outwork me

and so you know the combination is

usually what kills businesses early on

more than anything

do you think so there's a part that

people say you know mark made it because

mark is a special again he became an

entrepreneur you know this guy made it

all these guys made it because they have

this special gene or whatever it is

do you think there's a proven formula

that if a brand rookie guy he's got a

lotta ambitious gun out of this rap but

not a lot of knowledge and how to do you

think if he follows a formula he's

guaranteed to make it as a porno okay so

you don't believe there's a guarantee to

make it no because who knows you're

gonna be competing with so if you put

two two people both following the same

formula both in the same industry right

which one wins yeah maybe they both can

win and both be successful but you know

so I don't I don't think there's a

DeVault default template for success but

I think there's things that you can do

to put yourself in the best position to

succeed you know so I talk about stuff

in the book you know I talk about the

one thing in business you can control

his effort you know um going out there

and sales curing all you know so I I

think you know and I agree with your

point that there are things that if you

do them you put yourself in the best

position to succeed but you know if you

just walk into a buzz you know a buzz

saw and somebody else is doing them a

little bit better you know what happens

now are you saying - to compete on your

level there's no we're just look we're

just any level right just as even if you

put a formula for me I followed it will

I eventually be able to make a quarter

million a year if I followed up one day

but I'm not talking about a hundred

million you guys pick where - right

right so how would this be wise right

yeah it was a business plan competition

and they were talking about making big

money reselling travel plans and making

$3 in affiliate commissions right it's

just not gonna happen you have that's

just more you have to be smart you can

pick the wrong things and you know

you're talking to you know alluded to

earlier about entrepreneurs being born

or built you know and I think they're I

knew I was wired to be excited about

business how or why I don't know but you

know and there's certain guys they have

the genetics to jump out of the gym

right certain guys you know that you

know when they golf they have the muscle

memory and and the discipline you know

dirt the Biscay may not be the most

talented guy in the NBA but his

discipline and his focus to do what's

necessary to be successful he's willing

to do and combine it with being seven

feet tall and being skilled you know it

makes him an amazing basketball player

so it's understanding what your skill

set is finding the right place to use

those skills and then going for it you

know will that make you 250 grand

as if you picked the right industry but

whatever industry you pick if you

outwork everybody if you try to be a

little smarter than everybody if you try

to be a better salesperson and everybody

if you try to be better prepared than

everybody you've got your best chance

because if you don't do it and somebody

else does yeah I have the same work like

someone's trying to take it all away

from you you know work you actually work

like someone's spending 24 hours working

24 hours to take it all away from you

and that's kind of the way I look at it

when you were younger did you have was

your father into business was your

mother was there an uncle somebody that

did well in business that you admire

with or somebody you read about they

said I like rockefeller I like Carnegie

nothing nothing so it's just purely user

I said I think you know my dad did

upholstery on cars

my mom did whatever odd jobs um but my

dad was always like if you want

something you have to earn it and to his

credit he never said no you can't do

that

so whether it was selling garbage bags

baseball cards stamps whatever it was he

never held me back and so I think that

was as important as anything and you

know sometimes being young and trying

things are so naive and you don't know

any better

all you do is learn and if you fail it

doesn't matter and so whether I was 9 10

12 1621 the failures were irrelevant and

you know whether you're you know nine

twelve sixteen twenty one twenty two

twenty four you know I'm sleeping on the

couch you know I have a car with a hole

in the floorboard

you know I'm living like a bum and like

a student and so what did I have to lose

and so I think that influenced me as

much as anything so it you know my dad

was like go for it

you know don't why not what do you got

to lose you know you have to sleep on a

different couch so I think that that was

motivation as much Steve said you had

the encouragement from others your

support go do it so do you think like

let's just if we put 10 guys here you

interview them okay

you could within a 5 10 minute minute

interview say this to is not gonna make

it as an entrepreneur could you pretty

much know that you know I'm not very

good at interviewing it the issue is my

interview skills more than free Gollum

horrible Shark Tank interview well yeah

it is but I get to do due diligence

after the fact right so I get my hunches

but I get your check yeah I mean I can I

can typically tell right I can tell

um but by um

their passion I can tell by their focus

I can tell by their preparation you know

there's a whole realm of things than any

business here you know here's here's the

business you're in and here's a thousand

things that influence whether or not

you're going to be successful and really

to me by you know through my experience

and businesses I can put myself in his

position and say okay here are nine

hundred of the thousand things he has to

be aware of and then go through and ask

and by how many of those or her issues

they've been able to address already

that kind of gives me a sense of how

hard they're willing to work you know

and I can tell by the questions they ask

me so all I have to do is say okay what

do you want to know and you know when

they start saying what should I do

they ask you yeah what you know and

that's fine right and I want them to ask

questions but you know people like to

say you know the only stupid questions

are the one you don't once you don't ask

that's not right right because the

questions you ask tell everybody

tell me tell whoever more about you than

anything else you do because in

particular tells me about your

preparation if you ask me questions

about just basic things that you should

have known and you should have down to a

science

that's gonna disqualify you almost more

than anything I've read this cyber

that's we send out by the way but now I

got to get the questions right I said

okay I'll take that as a challenge

that's another bird I stopped flying

sound like when I have a saw it was

great yeah so no it's phenomenal what

the question you asked are critical are

you reads it's complete opposite on the

way you you know the traditional way of

thinking and I always ask the question

so mark you're now you know whatever

your net worth is billions of dollars

you own a sports team you have

businesses you're in Shark Tank you're

on TV shows everybody wants your time

how hard is it for you now this is the

thing I think about because for my so I

run a business it's harder for me to

make friends now and let people in my

circle but I'm not at your level how is

it when a person like you is it still

easy to make friends now I'm not out

there you know at this world I'm not out

there looking me you know I don't need

any new writing buddies I mean my high

school buddies are still my friends my

college buddies got rugby buddies um the

guys I when I first came to Dallas that

were my friends then are my friends now

you know I've got three kids you know so

it's more you know my family just takes

up so much my time along with business

up

I'm not you know and even back in the

day when I was single I was still

successful I could tell the gold diggers

from the the real friends I mean you

know it was pretty easy got it

did association play a big role with you

or not really yeah for you yeah as you

were so determined it didn't matter

nobody could influence you influence

other PA I just I just want to do my

thing made sense make sense um couple

words I'll just put out that I want to

see what you think about it because I

watch you and I watch some of these

other guys and I see a sense of paranoia

and I don't know if you read the book

the only the paranoid survive ten twenty

great book that was written do you think

there needs to be a healthy level of

peril absolutely they're nice too oh

yeah I mean I I always say you know for

every one of my businesses I said what

would I do to kick my own ass you're

right so whatever business you have

there's somebody's trying to put you out

of business there's somebody trying to

to take a bite out of your business and

it's better for you to figure out how

they're going to do it rather than they

do it and so yeah that's being paranoid

and so you have to be paranoid you have

to anticipate other people's next moved

and moves and you can't ever you know

downplay the competition you know I was

telling I was at a business plan

competition this morning for at a

college and they were kind of being

dismissive of the competition and so you

can't ever do that you know they're out

there trying to take you down and

they're not just gonna sit still and if

you're good really really good you're

gonna inspire them to work even harder

faster better and so you have to be you

know very self aware of what you're good

at and what other people are good at and

you know a healthy dose of paranoia

makes a bit dear me it's very helpful so

that's interesting you say that so

sometimes you know you'll be a little

bit too paranoid you know you're being

too concerned about this too concern

about that the other question for you

would be mark you don't run one company

you run many companies you're doing

deals all the time and there is this

notion that you hear multitasking right

on the you can multitask you can do this

so your brain if I were to take a

hundred percent ok 10 percent here seven

percent your 6 percent here how do you

process all of it here in your mind with

the difference that has to be something

I'm really good at right you know I just

I process things very quickly

and that's always been my strength I can

I can identify what's going on typically

faster than anybody and and crying right

through it and plus you know I because I

force everybody to email or cyberdust

it's all coming from one flow right it's

all one funnel and so I'm not bouncing

from meeting to meeting thinking okay

what did we say in that meeting we're

having to take notes and then we're

having somebody take notes you know it's

like it's already in writing it's in an

email and if it's in cyberdust is like

having a face-to-face and when I see it

I respond to it immediately kind of

cyber has forced me to respond to it

immediately

um and so that that allows me to keep

things organized and stay on top of

things and you know so you know anything

that's unread that's my to-do list and

that's all I stay on top of it got it so

I've become a phonetic side of this

there's an every other hour I'm chicken

side when you told me you know go check

outside with us and then from there I we

got everybody on the company now

everyone out here the only way you gonna

get to see this first you got it and I

would like the link I will do what I

mentions to get everybody closer but I

love the product and we'll get to that

because I want to explain how I see side

with us you're not as a CEO as a

customer because I want people to see

how I see it as a customer let's talk

about speed when people ask me and say

hey you know how do I get speed going I

want to see your perspective on this

because cyber does has a tipping point

you know you got Twitter has a tipping

place but everything is about the

tipping point in your mind how does one

entrepreneur increase the speed in areas

that they can increase there's certain

things you can't be in one way speed of

growing your business all right

so how fast can I grow yeah I mean it

just depends you've got to know your own

skill set right and you've got to know

how that fits within your company's

lifecycle um you know some companies are

slow slow grind and you just have to

understand that and you've just got to

bide your time and still until it starts

to click and then grow with it quickly

you know if you're trying to release a

product that needs to be ubiquitous

you've got to go as fast as you can and

and then you know release a product yeah

no long yeah and and you know there's a

lot of people will say you know

perfection is the enemy of profitability

right and that doesn't mean you have to

to us a perfect product you know

cyberdust is perfect and we still

haven't it's been almost two years we

still haven't advertised it yet because

we know it's not ready yet you know and

so it's been a slow growth grind because

that's we wanted we want feedback you

know we want to keep on learning we're

evolving but it really just depends on

what the product is that you know a

barber shop right isn't an app is it a

service is it a product but you know the

the key is looking for the low-hanging

fruit what are the app what are what

customers are willing to write you a

check or commit to it you know so that

they're willing to integrate it into

their daily lives or integrated into

their daily business and so getting a

commitment either through time or

revenue is typically what I look for and

so if I can get a commitment then I'm

gonna be able to learn I'm gonna see how

they use it to they sustained usage and

then once I get the next one you know

hopefully it came a little bit faster

than the first one then I can ask for

referrals and then the next one then the

next one and I just tried to ramp it up

you know when I bought the Mavs we had

no season ticket-holder base and so

literally it was a matter of just

putting a list of former season ticket

holders and a white pages back then you

know on my desk next to my phone and

making phone calls you yeah me yeah

because if I'm not gonna do it I'll find

someone else to do it right so just get

on the phone hey this mark you know I'm

the new owner of the Dallas Mavericks

we've you know I'd like to invite you

back where again it's not though this is

my business you we can't get regular

sales gets or something make those calls

wants to get to a corner you're a guy

that's a billion you're making them but

that's all you know and that's fine and

good right because everybody's got their

own goals right and but still I don't

want anybody at the Mavs to be able to

said well he's not willing to do the

work right there's you know if I walk

around I'm picking up all the papers I'm

not saying go get that picked up I'm

like okay that's trash I'm picking it up

so but in terms of speed of growth it's

really you got to get that first

customer first and then when you get

that first what did you learn reiterate

get that next customer and then

hopefully as you learn more and more

through the process than the next one

the next one the next one becomes coming

by and faster you know it's interesting

when we walked in here and I appreciate

that on two speeds

we walked in here typically when I want

to know how does to work for somebody

you got to ask people around them or you

can ask the processor to work for you

right we get the right answer so that's

the security guy had this guy said oh

you know mark country's gonna say hi to

everybody he's gonna do this he's gonna

do that and they were all like fans they

love work yes cuz we have cameras and

microphones that's classic

that's classic okay let's transition to

a different subject let me see what time

okay let's transition to a different

subject with college you went to IU

yep right now you got a lot of people

that say forget about school you know

you're out of school they're idiots oh

you think they're idiots

tell me what if you're gonna have and

run a business if you don't understand

accounting you're already behind the

eight ball can't you hire a guy that's

good no second day they still have to

communicate to you right I mean there's

people that don't understand the concept

of you know the difference between

profits and cash you know oh your

accountant might tell you you're

profitable but your cash is going down

you know not understanding that

breakdown and and when you don't you

thing you need college to learn that

yeah I think you do right because it may

not for some people look if you're so

self-motivated that you can take an

online course in accounting and teach

yourself everything you're way ahead of

the game anyways but most people aren't

and I'm not saying you have to go to

Indiana

I'm not saying going an expensive school

I don't care if you go to a community

college and take accounting and spend 99

bucks for the class just you know

spending the money forces you to be more

obligated to do it but accounting

finance lesser extent marketing sales of

the school offers that these are

although that's the language of business

and so while it's possible to teach

yourself these things and while it's

possible to hire them when you're

starting your own company

you don't want to have to spend money

hiring an accountant right you're

already probably gonna have to hire a

lawyer to set up your your well let me

take that if you've gone through all

these classes if I don't have to hire a

lawyer to incorporate right you'll

probably figure out yourself and so your

cost of opening up a business drops but

even more important and all that that's

that's the block unit tackling that's

the language of business you know the

thing I learned at Indiana that was more

important than anything else I learned

how to learn

and learning became far more important

to me because the one certainty in

business is that it's always going to be

changing the if you're not always

learning to this minute if I'm not

continuously learning if I'm not just

absorbing as much as I can absorb

someone else is going to kick my ass

right so you talked about paranoia the

the greatest source of your paranoia

should be knowledge if someone else

knows more than you do and if you're not

learning if you don't know the Lord if

you don't know how to learn if you don't

have a thirst for learning and acquiring

information you're you're Sol do I need

to go to school to have that though so

make it maybe let me restate the

question would be the question the

question will be do I need to get a

bachelor's degree so what's you just

obviously necessary you have to have the

degree okay write something Branca you

have to have the knowledge holy I

totally agree with that fair enough okay

let's so let's skip that part and go

into a little bit of politics and you

know our conversations start I said mark

you know I said man you gotta get up

there because you got such a big fan

base people want to hear your opinions

about politics you may want to run for

president one day and we were going back

with the thing and I said mint

people got to know who is what is Mark

thinking about cuz a lot of times CEOs

don't want to touch polyps right they

don't want to touch it at all for

whatever reason if you were the

president today Mark Cuban is the

president

February 1st 2016 what are three things

you're attacking income inequality right

improving the ability for companies to

raise capital through IPOs I think

that'll have a big impact on the market

you've touched that on Inc you said that

on the incas well so let's talk about

income inequality rl1 so how do you do

that so right now let's just say you're

making thirty five thousand dollars a

year and you're clearing fifteen hundred

bucks a month after tax okay and you

live like a student I don't care if you

have thirty forty fifty what sure you're

living like a student and you're able to

save five hundred bucks a month okay

where you sleep are you staying at home

you're living at home right with your

hey two-year-old parents you're 50 years

old um there's a lot of that right now

yeah unfortunately and so you're saving

six grand a month right well right now

with interest rates near zero

surrounding you

or six grand a year um so you're saving

six grand a year five hundred bucks a

month which is amazing that's what every

Republican wants you to do that's what

every Democrat wants you to do try to

control your own destiny now you put it

in the bank or do you put it in stocks

no one trusts the stock market no one

really knows what they're doing right no

you put it in to a fund but the problem

is if you put into a fund because you're

not making a lot of money if the

dishwasher breaks right you get

penalized for taking and show that money

out so we're in a situation right now

where it's if you put that money into

the bank which is really only the safe

way you know six thousand a year and a

year you'll have six thousand and sixty

dollars okay sure you're just not ever

going to be as bad if that right and the

point being is you're never going to

improve your place in life right where

the 1% really the reason income has

become so unequal is I can hire anybody

I want to help me pick the best

investments and I do most of it myself

but I'm decent at it right so I can put

my money in stocks I could put my and

hedge against the risk I can put my

money in whatever but I'm liquid so I

don't have to worry about the dishwasher

break-in guy if you would have six

thousand dollars how are you going to

keep up right how are you going to

improve your position in life even if

you spent twenty years saving six

thousand dollars a year that's $120,000

but you've earned $1,500 in interest

that whole time right and while 120

thousand is good you're not gonna be

able to live off of that when you hit

sixty five or seventy years old right

not at all so part of the challenge is

how do you allow people to accumulate

capital okay without the risk of waking

up one day and not being able to get the

money out for their dishwasher or their

car or paying for their kids school

right we're not um we're finding that

the stock market is way down and they're

basically wiped out and so to me that's

the first thing to address and so I

think you know one ways the Federal

Reserve I don't think you mess with the

Federal Reserve but I think you come up

with savings certificates savings bonds

that literally pay a little bit more

that allow people to save for their

future because I think that helps people

protect their future that allows people

to build more of an asset base and that

takes them you know gives them a comfort

level that they're gonna be able to

survive is

as they age and take care of their

expenses and maybe then maybe they can

buy a house you save up enough money

earn enough and an interest or whatever

it may be to buy a house but you just

you know it's not so much pulling the

top down as in bringing the bottom up

and then I would also increase the

minimum wage and the way I would there's

a couple different ways to look at it

but in my mind like this past December

we gave everybody here a raise to a

minimum of $10 an hour and the reason I

did it is I found out there were people

that work for me that were on government

assistance in one way or another you

know might be a program but I hate the

idea that I'm subsidizing somebody you

know the fact that I'm not paying enough

everybody's taxes is subsidizing this

person's life you know you think about

that and so you get a lot of business

owners saying oh you can't raise the

minimum wage well all of us pay for the

fact that you're not paying that person

enough and will it change the

competitive balance well if everybody's

having to pay more then the competitive

balance still say it's somewhat

competitive will the markets change some

but it's not so much that I think

raising the minimum wage is a great idea

but what I don't like is the fact that

we are subsidizing low wages for certain

for businesses and so I think you know

maybe there's a better way the minimum

wage so I'm just talking off the top

show that sure of course but the bottom

line is that people who work for me

shouldn't have to use government

services funded by everybody and until

we get people off of that incoming

inequality interesting it's just gonna

be kind of convoluted your approach will

be the government doing something about

it well it's not so much the government

doing something about I wanted to get

people off the government assistance got

it right so how about this part you know

there used to be time when the whole

Ford Motor Company came out with you

know working 9:00 to 5:00 and when they

came out with this after the Great

Depression you know what that's why at

night 9:00 to 5:00 is only a 90 year old

system right so when they came out with

that you and I said okay I'll give you

30 years of my life and I'm for it you

know we said hey but what are you gonna

give me if I give you 30 years of my

life so they said we'll give you a

pension right in 1984 we have 130

something something pension plans

thousand one hundred thirty seven

thousand pension today we have 24 right

I think we've gone away from that

because

it sounds like from what your concern is

on income inequality is the first point

you made is $500 a month times 12 months

$6,000 so long term 20 or 7 or $20,000

which means they may not have long term

money for retirement but if we go away

from the pension plan

so do they probably go right away to the

pound and advise companies well the

problem with pensions is the uncertainty

of business right so what's happening

with pensions now Serna they've got to

grow them just because to support the

amount of money required for the

employees they can't they can't find

that return right so if if I either got

a if everybody's Arne only earning 1%

and your pension matches your salary I

mean okay just for the and you're making

$36,000 a year I've got to find a way as

a business owner to fund thirty six

thousand dollars per year for the you

know so that you're making twenty or

seventy right right a math for that's 65

to 85 yeah but but if you're only

earning 1% the rule of 72 says it takes

three years right so I've got a you know

you don't get 72 years so I've got a fun

three-quarters of it or whatever so what

would it be with the solution will be

you know we can move away from this

topic would it be given an incentive for

companies who do give pension plans up

to this I just don't I don't think

companies it's mathematically yeah I did

yeah I don't think it works simply

because there's too much uncertainty on

the are not big thing of it the key of

it is what what elements of certainty do

you put on businesses right a pension is

a certain amount that you have to pay

but you're it's uncertain how much

you're going to earn you know if whether

it's minimum wage or some other way of

doing it or you know working so that

whatever it is right so that you don't

need government assistance then that's

just part of your current business you

know and so it's really I guess it's

more about coming to you or I as a

business owner and said okay if you're

making a million dollars a year would

you be okay with making seven hundred

fifty thousand dollars a year and your

attack on another 250 on it know

whatever there's no tax no tax no no tax

a way they say to you why don't you pay

your guys more that's what you're a

guilt type thing right you know and so

you know I've said I would react of

Ehrman government of dollars I know you

like a cross a type of yeah let's go out

there and do this like what did you do

my drive yeah how much more money

look I've literally received that

happening yeah I've literally written

checks to the Dallas City Treasury you

know when the Mavs won a championship I

paid for the pray that when we needed

extra police overtime I wrote the check

for it because it's not fair to ask all

the citizens of Dallas to pay the taxes

for something that benefits me like that

would you consider yourself a capitalist

you're full on capital oh yeah but see

what's changed with capitalism it I mean

I'm a hardcore we're not a full on

capitalism you know that we know we're

not that what we've evolved right and so

you know 90 years ago the Henry Ford

days sure if you didn't have a job and

you couldn't afford it you found

somebody's floor to sleep on and you

went with your family or whatever you

know and if it was 12 to a room that's

the way it was and then over time we

started having you know you know with

with FDR we started having you know

basic services that we would provide for

you and then over time with LBJ there

was more services right and and welfare

services and now you know we're not

gonna let you drop dead in the streets

we want you know you anybody can walk

into a hospital or or now we want you to

have these about them I think it's right

I think it's you think it is right look

I'm so what would call you a Democrat

and no no hell no no no look there's

there's different things for different

reasons right if we as a society decide

that we don't want people dropping dead

in the streets or you know just dying at

home then there's a cost to that and we

can't expect insurance companies and

hospitals just to pick up that cost for

decisions we make as a society just like

we want TSA at the airport just like we

want you know Homeland Security you know

should we say look don't pay for it

we'll just all get blown up right

there's certain minimum services that

we've all defined that's evolved

capitalism and we all have to pay for

that but at the same time that doesn't

destroy the root of capitalism and who

we are and and the incentives right it

just means that we're gonna take a chunk

off the top now on the flip side of that

how we do that how you pay for it that's

a different beast is the government too

big yes

is the government inefficient yes if for

every you know I'd rather the government

have one half the employees and just

write checks to people you know the old

helicopter dropped of cash

you know just drop cash on the people

because they're just gonna spend it

these are people who can't afford to say

economy yeah and so I'd rather you know

you talk about what would you do as the

president probably the third thing I

would take all these services we have

and cut I would say to everybody okay

here's two years three years severance

and then I'm gonna take 75% of what's

left and just consolidate it all

together and write everybody who

qualifies the cheque right and then you

know to go to you know you know yeah but

you use that money or but I get crushed

by all the union's right because there's

like yeah this would be anti control

votes now yeah exactly so it's very

anti-union we you know in somewhat

somewhat socialist and you can argue

about creating distance and you'd have

to work those things but the one

certainty is governments to big

government is inefficient and there's

way to cut ways to cut back on the

amount of money you spend so what does

it take to pay for all the services we

as a country feel are legit for our

citizens whether it's health care

security whatever it may be and what's

the best way to do that and I literally

rather than saying here's 30 programs

you have to sign up for and here's all

the overhead associated with managing

those services and monitoring and

checking for fraud here's a check here's

your $800 a month you know in addition

to Social Security no accountability no

account of no accountable right because

now because you can't get it anywhere

else right now

you this has got to take care of your

life if you don't do it they're sorry

right we've eliminated the excuse there

is a limit to where listen if you do

nothing with this there's nothing else

we can do right at that point is they

sense yeah at that point you know your

family's also getting paid right you're

on your own right but trying to say okay

you've got to do this program this

program this program this program is

just so saturated with overhead it

doesn't work that is such an interesting

topic that's off the table so would you

be comfortable with a capitalist like

Donald Trump being our president um the

capitalist side yeah I don't have a

problem with in I like Donald and he's

smart

I just what's concerning is the way all

the candidates Republican or Democrat

are trolling for votes I mean they're

just pandering you what do you need what

do you want me to say I'll say it in

order to get you vote he's sane would

hell yeah

you think he's saying whatever people

want him to say pretty much yeah now Wow

within the realm of what gets votes

right so within the realm of what gets

most right so yeah it's not just when

you want me to say right so I need I

need to appeal to ultra-conservatives in

order to get elected in the primary and

so if I'm appealing to

ultra-conservatives what to all Cultra

conservatives want you know we started

with immigration that fit now you know

everything he says and does it's okay

what's the playbook for getting voters

for the primary now do I think once he's

elected president he'll follow through

for all those with all those things no

because most of them won't work and he's

and do I think he's smart enough to

figure that out and then just do the

right thing after he's elected yes so

you know with like a lot of candidates

and politicians you vote for not what

they say but knowing that 99% of they

say won't come true what they'll do the

rest one who's gonna follow through with

a lot because they know that what you

already know he's not gonna get a wall

built right he's not gonna get all these

things done it's just not gonna happen

and there's no money to do it so slice

those off and what will happen when you

just put the guy in the office so what

do you think that the American people

should ask about Trump as a president if

there's one question what would it be

is it the same thing you're saying that

do you really think he's gonna deliver

on all this now because he knows I mean

look when when he him and all I'm not

this isn't just Donald right this is

everyone at every single Hillary right

because when they put the other tax pay

all we're cutting the tax to all this we

used a number from this tax group right

it doesn't add up right and they say oh

it's gonna cost you know 30 trillion

dollars over ten years

oh no the economy will increase so much

right right you know it's BS right do

you process the boat though you got to

pick somebody to vote for house what

comes out look we got 12 months right

show me nothing matters too late yeah

right and so we got lots of time and you

know things will start right now

they can play Alice in Wonderland and

just throw things up and it doesn't

matter right I mean because none of

their tax plans work and then Hillary or

Bernie saying okay tax the 1% and

that'll pay for everything doesn't work

right

won't work you know Hilary's um pay for

college her plan is ridiculous it'll

increase college costs not reduce you

know so they don't they don't think them

through they just say okay here's here's

my justification but over time don't

have to start thinking them through and

they'll have to start dealing and

addressing some facts and then at that

point in time you say okay knowing that

none of this is ever going to pass who's

still going to be the best president

when it's all said and done it's gonna

be very interesting it is very very

interesting on what's gonna happen so

let's do it let's do a couple things

here with fun and then we'll go into

cyber to wrap it up sports you know

Dallas and what happened with our you

know we can say runaway bride if you

want to call it oh yeah it's super got

it

runaway bride with what happened with

them if you were to ever call back this

season let's just say because my opinion

is this I think if the clips don't pull

it together this year I think

something's gonna break apart that's my

opinion I don't care if he called us he

wants to come and plead Alice would you

ever take a battle never so now he's

ever stating ever you never say never

right everybody deserves the second

chance

Chum you know dee will said no to us

initially and we brought it back

interesting right so you know I just

care about winning

and I'll put winning above ego anytime I

noticed with guys that get to your level

that there's got to be a level you have

a strong memory because you know enemies

everyone's got a target we got enemies

but there's also a level of forgiveness

when it comes down to it you're here to

win right oh so just make sense if the

opportunity arises yeah why not why not

right I I mean look it's basketball it's

not thermonuclear war right it's not

like you shot my cousin you know or you

know we're just you know cut off us

pinky right it's basketball oh my

goodness we think sometime we you know

when we drink some of these exciting

drinks you got back here sometime we get

a little bit more excited thinking it's

very very important exactly so you think

all them sick we go 73 or nine this year

yeah who knows right I hope not but

we'll see they're looking good yeah

they're really good looking very very

good some funk questions from your

favorite type of music what do you want

hip hop really even when you were

younger or was it kind

yeah yeah a classic funky hip-hop yeah

Tupac or biggie um probably biggie I

just like to beat more and it did you

know Tupac was more about you know the

message and Biggie was like let's just

party favorite decade of music

probably the 90s right now that we're

big isn't yeah okay you got a favorite

song you listen to during workout um

yeah I forget that a band that was

called I'm a beast whose mo beast you

know is I'm obese it's actually great

favorite movie of all time

oh gosh I don't have anyone I mean I'm

really into like into the world movies

so my wife always cracks up so any movie

that has like been yeah I like Sam yeah

Independence Day like San Andreas Fault

was a horrible movie but the whole place

was falling apart you know the day after

tomorrow I'll watch you know you name it

if the whole world is blowing up you

know and la is crumbling and there's

some big old thrust you know of water

you know wave of water coming through

New York I was like that's why I did

sharknado 3 right it's the end of the

world are you two cars are not redundant

it - I have a Lexus but I'm Bonnie - got

it

favorite room in the house I know you

living in a big cast you got like a real

cool place you vote for yourself like

some like no not like this because

actually my house was perfect when I had

no furniture I mean I my buddies came

over I could throw a football we played

wiffle ball I mean we had one bin size

inside yeah and what we would do you

know like imagine you know you drive

over the sofas you can catch a pass and

you roll off the sofa like you just got

tackled it was perfect then I got

married things changed when that happens

real quick so um iPhone or droid both I

carry one of each two different networks

so if my network is bad on one I have

the other and I get the test and play

with all actually you prefer more it

just depends on the app really so you're

both yeah what I like let me be

independent is what I like what I like

about Android is that with Samsung has

replacement batteries so I just carry an

extra battery on

but on the flip side iOS batteries seem

to last longer so there's pluses and

minuses to both so yeah I don't know if

you heard him say this iOS batteries

tend to last longer to all my droid

friends out there yeah okay

so let's talk about cyber yes uh-huh

this has become the app that I check

probably the most on a daily base

outside of YouTube good and YouTube I

checked because of what we got going on

but this is a very very exciting app

tell me the story behind why cyberdust

sure um back in 2013 I had a trial

against the SEC the SEC accused me of

insider trading and in the trial as part

of their discovery they took all my

emails and some of the most innocuous

emails you know when I wrote them

thought okay this is really you know

this means absolutely nothing they would

take and they turned him into like oh

this is proof you did X Y & Z like I

said I had one of my buddies Lee that is

the world's worst stock trader and I

said that in the email you know cuz he

asked me about the stock that I was

accused of insider trading mama calm and

I said you know no stay away from it

because I knew he would just lose money

figure out a way to lose money and I

said and you know when when the SEC

asked me about it I said no he's the

world's worst or threatened said no you

knew this stock was going down and you

just said that to protect him I'm like

that's ridiculous right so if someone

was that as simple as that just when

you're in an adversarial position

whether it's the SEC or any lost

interest right if you've ever done a

deposition right whatever you say the

other sized attorney is going to try to

turn it into something to their benefit

sure and and with emails with text it

loses context and when you really think

about it the minute you hit Send on an

email a text message a Facebook message

whatever it may be the minute you who

it's in you lose ownership of it but you

don't lose responsibility for it and

we're not talking about judging your

ownership but not responsibility very

interest right because if I send you an

email you own it now that's right right

if you want to say you know when I if I

said the sky is blue what an amazing day

you know and then

you know something comes out and you say

see he sent me this email he doesn't

really believe this guy is green you

know he may have said this guy's free

he's a liar right see Cubans a liar you

know and so you can take anything I said

you know if if my daughter has a friend

who you know finds her lost iPad which

would be a calamity and she says I love

you for this thank you so much you're

the best thing that ever happened to me

and some little schmucky little kid says

Oh from Alexis I have this email and she

says she loves me see right that

responsibility that context can change

forever that's why I started cyberdust

so from a business perspective I do

didn't like the fact that I lost control

of all my emails no matter where they

were

since particularly since I do everything

via email at the time I didn't like the

fact that anybody could keep it whether

or not I liked it or not right

from and so and I also like the fact

that because it disappeared it was like

a face-to-face conversation so when you

and I talked via cyberdust it's like

talking here now sure except now it's

being recorded but you know - the camp -

the camp it's right if you take the

picture name doesn't say Dave doesn't so

nominal but even yeah but even if you

take a screenshot right not only does it

not say who it came from but it sends me

an alert and you know you talk if

someone were to have a whole group of

screenshots trying to reassemble a

conversation you're gonna know something

was wrong in the first place right

because you're not gonna if you want

them to save it you're not gonna have

that conversation inside with us if I'm

sending you something I want you to save

I'm gonna say I'm what's your email

right cuz you don't you you use email

less right but you know you still can

use email here's a contract here's you

know let's discuss the terms we need to

memorialize that's great but for having

what would otherwise be in a

face-to-face conversation for anything

that is just a business conversation I'm

gonna use cyber dust every time and so

that's why I created it and when we

created it you know like anything else

like any other business I thought this

would be big for kids right sorry it's

like kids it's the post snapchat

generation that really is into it people

who think in terms of words people who

communicate ideas you know as opposed to

here's a picture of my lunch

you fell it commented on

snap check if they has made a very big

mistake they I need a very big miss yeah

they said every say yeah and that

benefits cyber does I mean positioning

wise that was not a good move on there

right now and that's okay I mean they're

fine not worried about anything

but at the same time you know we're kind

of like if you will snapchat for

grown-ups

you know when once you get past here's

pictures of my lunch at for grown-ups

yeah you know if four people wonder so

if you've only used snapchat you're

trying to figure out what it is right

because snapchats all about pictures

it's not about communications cyber to

us is about communicating ideas it's a

you know you can send links you can send

it from one to one person and then send

it to a hundred or a thousand or a

million people that follow you cyber

dust is about being able to have a

private conversation

privacy creates honesty if we're having

a conversation and you and I could talk

about politics and I can beat like we

did and I could be brutally on and you

were and I was right because it's not

going everywhere and the minute if you

took a snapchat a snapshot I'm not

talking about anymore right right and

and then I can it's not for me right

because it doesn't have my hair so that

privacy really makes people a lot more

candid and if you and if you're in a big

business as an example your lawyers will

always tell you you know write an email

knowing that someone else is going to be

reading it and it could be a lawyer from

an opposing counsel right you don't have

to do that with cyberdust you can just

be honest and to me that moves forward

the conversation and makes businesses

more effective do you think politicians

people who are of influence that

everything is held against them do you

think people would you know public

figures they need to start transitioning

away from Twitter to cyber that's what

you're saying oh yeah and there's a lot

to do and they just do it on a private

basis you'd be shocked at the be a level

names and the people that use cyber dust

and then if told me and the politicians

and you know because I can see that I'm

oh yeah this morning you know 90% of our

usage is 9:00 to 5:00 you know and so

you know it's putting doing it on

Twitter whatever your whole whether

you're 16 26 66 right everything you do

in social media creates a footprint that

says who you are anybody I hire right

that's going to direct for me I'm

looking at Twitter I'm looking at

Facebook I'm looking at their Instagram

I'm following them on snapchat because

it all creates a profile who they are

and now there's machine learning that's

going through and analyzing these things

and saying okay Patrick is this and I

know that because here's all his social

media posts and it's going to be a whole

lot worse if you're 16 17 18 and you've

got this whole long history or some of

this it's not an issue obviously and

they're coming out with websites are

coming I would wait to try to audit you

to be able to figure out what you think

you're yes of course there are

everything you know everything well I'll

tell you my opinion outside with us so

some of the people that are watching is

I love cyber that's when I first

switched to cyber does and I started

messing with it the first couple things

was well you know what how do I know who

the message comes from all group and all

you got to do is hold a picture comes up

which was all right yeah all these

different colors how to know who is this

so I had to do that then you know the

screenshot you have to learn the

screenshot that if you have to get

something that you want to save hey get

this email screenshot I can save that

okay great that helped me out but I put

it in three different categories so I

use dust as a text right that's how I

look at dust right I use blast as they

tweet how I look at it right as you can

send it but the good thing is I have

groups right on who I can tweet to right

just great really right yeah then I like

the group dust right and on the group

dust I can look at that as group me

that's group text it's just privacy it's

private it's an oh group me is becoming

very slow so fun whether I'm running an

organization sales organization a

company it doesn't matter I can

categorize those three and it's working

amazingly well for me right now so I'm

I'm a big fan of okay yeah cyber dust in

a major major way so it's like I get

like I follow you on cyber too so I get

your motivation he's enough and I'll be

blasted a lot right you get the stuff

that I put out there on whether it's on

business or motivation or stuff like

that so and the cool part about it when

you tweet something like on your Twitter

on your Instagram on YouTube right no

matter what you tweet or put out there

someone's gonna bust on you for it right

there's always going to be a troll that

trolls you from one way and in the back

your mind you're always thinking okay

how somebody going to nail me on this

you never have to do that on cyber is

because if I say something you don't

agree with and you come back

math suck well 30 seconds later it's

gone right and I can block you and you

don't know it and and but the better

part is no one else sees it on Twitter

if they say well you know what

you suck right your company sucks

everybody sees that's right right and

you don't want to deal with that knowing

that everybody's gonna see there is one

very very good point you just made I

didn't even think about that so you're

not talking about me saying you suck I'm

held to it

right you're saying it's a brand another

person says you suck right so when I go

sir yeah when I go search for your

company very good point so when you

search for Mark Cuban or M cube in my

Twitter handle you see all the people

say oh you're an idiot cube and you suck

why did you do this why did you do that

right I don't put anything of

consequence on Twitter anymore

Twitter's like a PR News we're a lot

less on Twitter than you were taller

years ago not even a question on it's

night and day not notice about anything

a consequence I put on cyberdust and

blasted up right and so a patrick says

oh that was an interesting concept we

can have a conversation and it's private

right on Twitter if you say something

that I'm interested one I'm living it to

140 characters - we could go to direct

message and do it that way but you could

still keep it all right three everybody

else is going to see the conversation

and it's going to jump in and add their

own two cents and so it becomes such a

public medium that you can't it's no

longer social whereas was cyberdust

if 30 people respond respond to

something I blast out there I can deal

with them one to one and if I like

something I can say hey would you mind

if I read last this or you know

screenshot it and send it to everybody

and if I want to I can and so you get

the best of all worlds yeah I'm a big

big fan of it you know we use it in so

many we have everybody in the field

getting it use it and then the

interesting thing is the speed is very

it's getting faster faster and faster it

was a little bit but like this within a

month could change every month you're

seeing something worried that's not

gonna better and better I love it I'm

looking forward to using it a lot more

as well

so III have a feeling you know I was in

front of a group of guys and I see guys

go get cyber does a challenge sometimes

is you know Gary Vaynerchuk he got big

on YouTube early with my library you had

some some of these Twitter guys with

himself he's got 1.1 million followers

but on Twitter he got involved right off

the bat right so yeah I've got 4 million

right

and it helped that I was there like I

said my suggestion to everybody is if

you're not on if you if you don't have a

big presence on Twitter if Africa it's a

lot easier go get a big before cyberdust

got 5 million users I'd rather have a

little we get the right sir but yeah so

if you add yourself so if you want to

get followers and you're looking to

build a following on Twitter it's really

hard right and you know if you built

enough build up a thousand followers on

Twitter it's probably taking you

multiple years and half of them are

dormant or BOTS right on cyberdust there

are no BOTS first of all and if you add

yourself to chatters then you're going

to be able to get followers and we have

a follow Friday like Twitter does right

and we'll put out there people to follow

but also we're going to be improving our

discovery mechanism significantly here

over the next two months and so because

to your point we want regular everyday

people to be able to get a thousand two

thousand five thousand followers we're

on Twitter they might have 150 followers

and most of those are just follow backs

or bots and so it they're not really a

consequence so no doubt about it

Twitter they did a number saying Twitter

their biggest criticism is only 24% of

users are real oh really

everyone else that's great not real

because they sell thousands fake

followers because you know now that I

can write fake file right right and then

you know so that's yeah none of the

world bots don't work you can't bought

ours

you can bot cyberdust that's great

that's great well you know again mark
