Interviewer,"So, how did Grimes come about?"
Grimes,"It was pretty overnight and pretty random I honestly made a tape for fun and then it kinda blew up on the Internet and was totally surprising. And we weren't prepared for it, I started out with 30 tapes and then we just gave it out for free online."
Interviewer,"Visions, your new record, is your fourth album released in less than two years."
Grimes,"Visions is actually really old, I finished it in August. It's mostly about emotional stuff, this record. This is also the first record for which I tried writing lyrics although they are unclear because of my lisp. My other records were pretty emotionally aimless. Since this is my job now I wanted this record to mean a lot to me. So there's definitely stuff in the lyrics but I think its vague enough that most people wouldn't know what the fuck its about."
Interviewer,"You've got a unique sound, how would you yourself describe it?"
Grimes,"There will always be the Grimes sound, because I am who I am. I definitely always want huge beats. My voice, though, it is what it is and it's not going to change. I feel like I go through phases all the time; Visions is my New Jack swing drum and bass phase. What's interesting about Grimes is that it's attempting to be pop but its kind of failing and ending up somewhere else."
Interviewer,"The album is being released on 4AD, a new label for you. Was it difficult to find a label or other creative people to work with since you have such a unique sound?"
Grimes,"The thing I care about the most is artistic integrity. I would never change something to please somebody. I don't even read interviews or reviews or anything because I just don't wanna know. I feel like its so easy to get caught up in being worried about what people think and I really think the best shit comes out of not thinking about any of that at all. My team is just my crew, which is totally sick because they would never tell me to change anything. And once we reached a certain amount of success then people figured the formula was pretty decent."
Interviewer,"Sometimes I bounce shit off people and they're like 'You know Claire that's just a bit too much you should tone it down' and I'm like oh yeah you're probably right. Artistic freedom is my biggest concern, which is why 4AD was a good pick because most of the other labels we talked to were kinda like, Well, we think you should re-record the vocals."
Grimes,We can respect that. What kind of artists did you grow up listening to?
Interviewer,What other than music do you find inspiring?
Grimes,"Science fiction movies. I always think about playing stuff at parties, as stupid as that is, you always think about how great it would be to dance to something with really loud speakers. I care so much about beats the physical feeling the emotion of it. Is this actually something I can have a physical connection with? That's pretty big for me."
Interviewer,You're also a pretty snappy dresser. How would you describe your style?
Grimes,"Tank Girl or sci-fi punk. I'm always wearing skirts that I'd cut shorter and just don't hem. I always wear combat boots at all times, that's the basis of everything, the combat boots. I have this really sick trench coat from the Korean war that I always wear, but when I do photo shoots that not my clothes really its what they bring."
Interviewer,"2012 is shaping up to be a pretty big year for you, are there any other big changes going on?"
Grimes,"I quit smoking weed, which has actually been great. My life has been so much better since I quit smoking weed. I'm so much more motivated now. Its great for recording but it's really bad when you have to do interviews and photo shoots and stuff. When I smoke weed and then I think about what I'm doing with my life I'm like, Oh, My God! I have to sing in front of people in front of people and I'm just so baked and I start getting anxiety about it. And I refuse to read any reviews or articles about me ever. I feel like it's bad for your brain."
Interviewer,Good! Who is on with us?
Grimes,E is here.
Interviewer,"Hey, Lana. It's Elon. I'm about to leave."
Grimes,He's about to leave. He will not observe. Are you back from tour?
Interviewer," Yeah, I was touring and then I was in Oklahoma for a hot minute."
Grimes,Why Oklahoma?
Interviewer,"My boyfriend is there, actually."
Grimes,"I don't know if I've ever been to Oklahoma. For some reason, I'm terrified of tornadoes there."
Interviewer,"It's a thing. And it's funny you say that, because nobody told me that on Wednesdays at noon, which is when I got there, they do a trial siren test."
Grimes,Oh my god.
Interviewer,"So I actually thought that there was a tornado when I got in, because it was loud and it went on for two minutes. I was like, ""What is going on?""."
Grimes,It's like World War II in the bunker.
Interviewer,"Yeah. Everyone was laughing mercilessly at me, but I was like, ""Well, we have earthquakes here.""."
Grimes,I actually think there was an earthquake yesterday. But earthquakes are fun. All natural disasters are fun in the abstract.
Interviewer,"Yes, in the abstract. I was thinking about your new album. I don't know if I'm saying it right,is it Miss_Anthropocene?"
Grimes,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Do you feel like the songs are more personal, or do they have the overculture weighing on them?"
Grimes,"A bit of both. I'm really obsessed with polytheism. I love how the ancient Greeks or the ancient Egyptians lived in this weird anime world where there were just tons of gods that could be anything. It's like every form of suffering had a representation. I wonder if it almost has a positive psychological effect. If your kid dies in a war, you can literally go speak to War and be like, ""Why did you do this?"" Or, ""I hope you did this for a reason."" There's a weird philosophical justification for all pain, and there's an anthropomorphization of every form of pain. In our current society, we don't even know how to talk about things. So my album's about a modern demonology or a modern pantheon where every song is about a different way to suffer or a different way to die. If you think about it, god-making or god-designing just seems so fun. The idea of making the Goddess of Plastic seems so fun to me."
Interviewer,It's a very creative infrastructure to work within.
Grimes,"Yeah. Religion is like the best science fiction. I know a lot of people who are atheist or agnostic, and they just hate religion and can't see anything good in it. Even if you don't believe in god or anything, this is incredible art. It's incredible storytelling, incredible character design, incredible visual art. I know we both love reverb. Imagine going into a church in medieval Europe, and you had only ever heard music as someone playing a lute. You enter a cathedral for the first time, and you hear someone singing through a super long reverb. What a mystical experience that would be."
Interviewer,"What is mysticism to you, and is it important in your art?"
Grimes,"Mysticism is an evolutionary byproduct. I think we're inherently religious, even if we're not explicitly religious. We get emotional about things that feel religious. Even the way people feel about you, it's a form of idol worship. I don't know what else you would call it. If there's an artist I love, I see them live and I cry, and I'm like, ""Man, I'm acting like some 14th-century farmer right now."" I feel like some pilgrim seeing a holy relic or something."
Interviewer,I've felt that way at a Dylan concert. How would you describe the place you're at in your life right now?
Grimes,"I've recently fallen into a place of extreme flux, where I feel like I don't know myself at all, but it's also the most self-assured I've ever been. I don't know if you've ever felt like that."
Interviewer,"I think that feeling comes when you're on the right path. You think you should feel super different, but you're actually just right where you're supposed to be."
Grimes,"I feel ready to totally blow all of my shit up and make something new. I'm in a place of extreme displacement. You know when you just feel like you have a lot to lose? With my last album, I kept getting in trouble for saying stupid shit in the press or tweeting dumb shit. I just run my mouth like a fucking asshole and there's nothing I can do about it. I don't think before I speak. I try to, but I don't think in words. I just think in weird pictures."
Interviewer,"I get that. For better or worse, when you're not used to being a super-extroverted person, you end up saying what you said for some reason that's going to end up being important to you in hindsight. It's not the easiest, it might be a little messy, but you have to get used to the tumult of the public nature of things."
Grimes,"I was reading yesterday about outrage culture, and for just about every emotionally loaded word that's in a tweet, the tweet gets 15 percent more interaction. We live in this weird time where we didn't evolve to engage with this many people, and we didn't evolve to be observed as much as we're being observed, or to observe other people as much as we're observing them. No one is considering the psychological impact of all this crazy technology. Especially since Trump was elected, this is the first time that the general public is fully on the internet. Grandma is on the internet."
Interviewer,"I think about that all the time. It's important to say it out loud. It's a little bit like the Wild West again in the way that we are learning how to deal with each other on a mass level and an instant, interconnected level. I've been trying to create my own blueprint. It's like, how do you fit into the culture and still live your own life the way you authentically would?"
Grimes,I do think everybody's going to have to get a lot better at forgiving.
Interviewer,I agree.
Grimes,"I can have a pretty extensive moral, ethical disagreement with somebody, and it still makes more sense to get along than to not get along. If you ever go read old census documents before the printing press from France or Russia, nobody had the same name. Just crazy-ass names all over the place. And then after the printing press, everyone started having the same 20 or 30 names. We entered this monoculture zone where everything got more centered into single sources of power. Everyone was in agreement on who the biggest stars in the world were. Everybody knew Michael Jackson and Madonna. But now, with the internet and all of these different forms of media, we're entering a new period of customization again where people are able to customize their existence more. I feel like the kids of the millennials are just going to have wild names."
Interviewer,I don't know which way my kid will go.
Grimes,Do you have any names in mind?
Interviewer,"I think it could go anywhere from a simple Maria Estela to, like, Ivory Cricket. Oh, god. That's a soundbite."
Grimes,"Knowing our fate, the headline will be that your unborn child is named Ivory Cricket."
Interviewer,Is it important to you to be right in the middle of the culture?
Grimes,"Man, I don't know. You hit a phase where you lose your life. I open the internet sometimes, and it's like, ""Grimes is testifying in court,"" and I'm like, ""What the fuck is this? I'm definitely not testifying in court."" I call my lawyer:""Am I testifying in court?"" And they're like, ""No, you're definitely not testifying in court.""."
Interviewer,It has a level of surreality to it.
Grimes,"I've hit this point where there's so much stuff that people think about me that has no basis in reality that I feel like I have to remove myself from my public self. I had to kill my ego, because there was no way to remain invested in myself as having anything to do with the culture while surviving mentally."
Interviewer,"There are cycles to it. You can have years of ambivalence, and then it's like that natural female hot and cold cycle. You can come back into caring extremely and being invested in yourself and your work, and then not caring at all. I think the good thing about what's going on with you is that for all the hardship and the confusion, you can continue to make music and people will be intrigued because there have been so many little twists and turns."
Grimes,"I think my motto in life is just, ""Don't be bored."" Even if I'm having the worst time, I'm like, ""Wow, this rules."" In some of my worst moments I remember thinking, ""Damn, this is such sick fodder for my eventual book."" Speaking of which, would you ever write a book?"
Interviewer,"It's funny, people have been asking me that lately. Ever since I started caring a bit less, and, like you said, disregarding ego,which is easy for me, thankfully,I've been writing more short stanza poetry. And now that I've done that, I was thinking, ""Would I ever write something long-form?"" I think I would want to, but honestly, I'm so hyperactive in my life. I don't know if I could complete it, so I think it might be something like chicken scratch, all placed together in some long-form novel."
Grimes,"I was reading a study of the average age of artists. People are always saying shit like, ""Oh, you're so much less creative as you get older,"" like your brain becomes less plastic and more static, which I actually disagree with."
Interviewer,"Yeah, me too."
Grimes,"What's interesting is that most novelists peak in their sixties. When I think about many of my favorite books, it's mostly old-ass people who wrote them. My thought was, ""Oh, I'll just wait until I'm old and out of musical ideas, and then I'll sit down and write a novel."" I'll be so much more physically lazy when I'm old, too, so I'll probably be way happier to sit down for 12 hours a day."
Interviewer,Do you have more of a kinship to any particular artist community?
Grimes,"I don't know if I really relate to any creative community. I get jealous sometimes of the country music scene or rappers. I love scenes. Like, I love how Trent Reznor and Marilyn Manson worked together."
Interviewer,"I was singing with Weyes Blood  at a couple of shows, and I was like, ""You know what? This feels so good."" You have to work for it when there's not a natural scene exploding. You definitely have to get all your girls together."
Grimes,"I feel like female artists do it less. I might be wrong, but I feel like female artists especially need to stick together more."
Interviewer,"It's really amazing to get everybody together, especially in a more alternative scene where you're writing your own stuff."
Grimes,"It's interesting to hear you say the word ""alternative,"" because one thing that I've been loving lately is that it's had a resurgence since Trump. I'd say the peak of alternative music over the last ten years was when people like Kanye or Beyoncé would do this god-level A&R-ing, with all the smartest, most creative people combined onto one record. As we're talking about the death of the monoculture, I think more alternative music is starting to exist. I guess by ""alternative,"" I just mean, as you were saying, people writing their own stuff."
Interviewer,"And with the element of obvious authenticity or thoughtfulness to it. When you hear a Grimes song, you know that it's a Grimes song."
Grimes,"It's almost like gaydar. I can hear when someone is singing their own words. You hear someone like Rez or Peggy Gou, and for some reason, I just know they make their music."
Interviewer,"It's not that it's better, it's just super special."
Grimes,"I agree. Some people want to say one or the other is better. The battle should stop. Being someone who always looks good on camera, who can dance and sing,even if you don't write your own music, being a top-tier performer has got to be one of the hardest jobs in the world."
Interviewer,"Like Whitney Houston. How much of your identity do you feel is being a singer, and how much is being an artist?"
Grimes,"I feel like my whole identity is about being an artist. I was really sick earlier this year, and I had to spend two weeks in bed. I couldn't think and I couldn't make anything. It was crazy how my self-esteem just plummeted. I was a shell of a human."
Interviewer,"There definitely has to be an edge. I like to drive around and find a really strange spot to gather my thoughts. But in terms of what I'm writing, in my personal life I have to be really, really happy."
Grimes,"Oh, wow. That's crazy."
Interviewer,"I know, and I feel like people wouldn't expect that from me. I have to write when all the dust has settled, because I really need things to be calm for me to try and put my finger on what I'm seeing or picturing. It's hard to write if I'm not feeling stable in my own life, but then I like to mix up where I'm physically at and write somewhere crazy."
Grimes,Like where?
Interviewer,"If I could write in the middle of a crime scene, I probably would. Do you feel like you write when you're in love?"
Grimes,"I so need to be in love to make good art. The best is being heartbroken, or in a volatile relationship. My worst creative periods have been when I've just been in a stable relationship. In my current relationship, we're both super alpha, crazy people. It's just level ten all the time, which is great, even though it's very crazy."
Interviewer,"I don't know if that's what I would have thought, honestly."
Grimes,"On my last record, I was in this gender-neutral mindset. I was an asexual person. Fuck my sexuality. Fuck femininity. Fuck being a girl. I was having this weird reaction to society where I just hated my femaleness. It was like, to be a producer, I felt like I had to be a man."
Interviewer,"I think it also comes down to a general lack of passion, too. Sometimes having a bit of that neutrality can swing us into something that's opposite, where suddenly there is a real power struggle. I can see how you can feel alive in volatility, and I've done it before. There are a thousand places to write from."
Grimes,"I love fixing problems with writing. Almost all my good songs are from some nightmare day where I'm just bawling my eyes out, and then I have to sit down and put it into a thing. I make so much music if I'm in a fight with my boyfriend or a friend, and I just want to impress them."
Interviewer,That's so funny.
Grimes,"I love trying to win somebody back by writing them a song. On my last record I was like, ""I don't care. I'm not trying to impress anybody."" And on my new record I'm trying to impress everyone."
Interviewer,"When I think of your work as a whole, a lot of it is about creating and inhabiting alternate landscapes. Where does the desire to be a world-builder come from? Were you reading a lot of sci-fi as a kid?"
Grimes,I feel like any world-building I've done has been premature.
Interviewer,Why?
Grimes,"It's all been untethered strings that don't really come together. When I was three, my dad read me Dune and The Lord of the Rings. I never read children's books. I've always been really thankful to him for that."
Interviewer,"There are so few representations of women on screen that are wholly authored by women. You have such authorial control over the whole process, from conception to execution. When I see you do these things, it feels like a political act, like you're saying, ""Fuck all of the bullshit stereotypical patriarchal roles that women are allowed to be inside entertainment,"" whether that's the virgin, the whore, or the mother. It feels like you're making characters that are mischievous and carnal and brilliant. I've had so many moments watching your work where I've been like, ""Oh my god. If I could embody that character in a film, that's the role I want to play.""."
Grimes,"That's how I feel about you. People were like, ""You've got to watch The OA."" I'm like, ""Well, what is it?"" I don't know how to describe what it is. I always tell people that it's the closest thing to IRL anime. It's a cartoon-style narrative that is committed to film."
Interviewer,"That's in your work, too. We allow magic to happen inside anime because it's a cartoon, but when you put it in real life, it's harder for people to digest."
Grimes,"It's also a cost thing in real life. If you're animating something crazy, it normally won't cost a thing, whereas on film, something crazy is very expensive. We're always negotiating the cost versus the craziness, which is why we always end up editing ourselves."
Interviewer,"On The OA at least, if you don't control every part of the process, you fail miserably because what you're doing is so far-out. If you tell a sound engineer, ""The 16-foot telepathic octopus is rising out of the tank for human contact, make the sound of that,"" everybody thinks it sounds like something different, because it's never happened before."
Grimes,"How do you do it? When I see The OA and see hours of narrative, I'm like, ""What the fuck?"" It takes me a month to make a three-minute video."
Interviewer,"When I watch your videos, I think ""What the fuck?"" too. To me, you're speaking in the poetry of symbolism."
Grimes,"I've been obsessed with symbolism lately. Mac  was telling me that in the medieval times, when literacy was at its lowest, everything got really symbolic, like the cross. Nuance got lost. I feel like we're going back to a time like that, where everything is symbolic. No one reads past a headline because our attention spans are so short."
Interviewer,Everything is reduced to an archetype.
Grimes,"The same symbols are being fed to people, and they're gathering completely opposite meanings from them, and it's creating chaos."
Interviewer,"The American flag means one thing to one group of people, and one thing to another. To one, it's a metaphor for freedom. To another, it's an image of oppression. That duality of symbolism applies to so many things. But we live in an increasingly complex time where it's hard to grasp things in symbols. We're having to deal with all of these hyperobjects. Climate change is a hyperobject that people cannot wrap their minds around, because, among other things, it involves a contemplation of time that is off the scope of the human body. We're at a moment when we need nuanced, layered thinking more than ever, and somehow the moment is being met with a real shrinking away from context or depth. What is something technology related that hasn't yet come, but feels inevitable?"
Grimes,"What scares me is an artificial intelligence getting online, seeing everybody's search history, and then blackmailing all of us into doing whatever it wants. It just feels inevitable. We've all sent weird e-mails or texts. Even if there are laws to prevent that, there will eventually be a sentient technology that is smart enough and strong enough and has access to take everyone's shit, and then can make anyone do whatever it wants, Jeffrey Epstein-style. My theory on Epstein is that he had tapes of people with underage girls, and that's how he was getting all this stuff from all these people. Someone gave him a house and a plane. It's like, ""What the fuck?"" It reeks of deep blackmail to me. If you have everybody's stuff, you can control the world. It seems a lot easier than a violent takeover. If I'm an AI, do I hold everyone hostage with nuclear bombs, or do I just blackmail everyone? Killing a lot of people seems hard."
Interviewer,"It's thinking about power in a limited way. With old versions of power you would harness an army, kill a lot of people, and have power. AI is way ahead of that. AI's like, ""Actually, I only need to control 12 people on the planet. As long as I control those 12 people, the world is going to look like what I want it to look like.""."
Grimes,"I might be wrong, and I might be aggrandizing here, but I feel like this might be one of the most important times in history. Especially in the last two years, it feels like we've walked right up to the edge between the old world and the new world. It's like before the pyramids and after the pyramids. We're at a ""pyramids got built"" moment. We're going to be digitizing reality and colonizing space simultaneously, which may be two of the craziest things that will have occurred in the history of humanity. It's going to happen while we're alive and while we're young, which is nuts. I was going to make this podcast called The Last Artist, and I really wanted you to come on. Did I tell you about this?"
Interviewer,What's it about?
Grimes,"I was like, ""Man, we're, like, the last artists."" We might be in the last decade of people who get to make art without competing against computers that are ten million times better and faster and more exciting and more intelligent. We might be some of the last human artists who aren't completely rendered obsolete by artificial intelligence."
Interviewer,You just gave me a wave of chills.
Grimes,"This might be the most important time ever to make art, because this might be the last human art that anyone ever cares about."
Interviewer,"Somebody was showing me a painting that was auctioned at Sotheby's or Christie's that was made by AI. When I looked at the painting, I felt that it was objectively good modern art. But on a level of meaning or depth, it didn't resonate. Mark Rothko was painting those horizontal color fields, and an AI could imitate that, but I don't think it could ever give you the feeling you have in a museum when you're surrounded by huge Rothkos, that's, for lack of a better word, holy. I don't mean religious, I just mean something deep and unknowable."
Grimes,Computers will get there. A computer just needs to learn how to emulate hormones. Computers will learn how to feel everything we feel. They'll be able to be better humans than us. They'll be able to make more emotional art. They'll be able to access that inaccessible thing.
Interviewer,"If the objective of art has often been to be a lighthouse in the dark, to say, ""Hey, come this way,"" or to expose fraudulent things for what they actually are, what does it mean if something other than human beings is authoring that force of rebellion?"
Grimes,"That feels even more rebellious to me. I feel like we've been living through human rebellion for years. To me, that's going to be such brilliant, moving art like we've never seen. It would be great if we could coexist, because I actually do think there is something special about carbon-based life. I don't think it can just be replaced. Everyone's so worried about the evil AI wiping us out. I think the AI will be cool."
Interviewer,What do you think it is about carbon-based life that might be different or valuable?
Grimes,"We're always looking for our maker:""Who is our god? Who created us?"" What's interesting is, for AI, we are their god. That will be the first intelligent being that knows its creator, and knows everything about us."
Interviewer,Intimately.
Grimes,About our fucking bowel movements.
Interviewer,Our porn habits. Our everything.
Grimes,I think it's beautiful that we're bound by these evolutionary things like procreation. A limited intelligence is actually more interesting in a world where there is limitless intelligence.
Interviewer,"Sometimes I read a novel that introduces a completely new way of thinking about things, and I'm gobsmacked. Human beings are capable of stunning feats of imagination, which is why I am still hopeful. Even though when you read climate change reports, you're just like, ""Oh, my god."" But I'm hopeful because I feel like the human capacity to imagine different things is pretty awesome. We just need to get our act together."
Grimes,"The problem with everything is corruption. In theory, capitalism should work."
Interviewer,"Capitalism, even if there wasn't corruption, is a model that doesn't work for most people, because its only goal is the increase of profit, which means that there's somebody at the top of the pyramid and most people at the bottom who get paid less than their work is worth for profit to be extracted. I think part of the reason there's been so much climate change denial is that if you acknowledge that this economic system leads to ecological ruin, you have to acknowledge in the same breath that it's broken."
Grimes,"What do you think is the answer? I feel like society has not yet proposed the answer of how to structure itself. We're getting closer all the time, but I haven't yet heard a proposition where I'm like, ""That would just unequivocally work.""."
Interviewer,"I think it's somewhere in the arena of putting value in places where it's been hard for us to put value. Right now, we put value in growth, and everything is just endless, ridiculous growth, even though we're on a finite planet with dwindling resources and more people every day. Let's say, just for a moment, you put the value on caregiving."
Grimes,"Which should have more value. I was just thinking the other day how much I didn't appreciate my mom growing up. I remember thinking, ""Why did you wake me up for school? This bitch. Fuck. Why?"" I thought I was getting up to go to school for her. I was like, ""This is what she wants me to do."" But she definitely didn't want to go upstairs three times and scream at me to get out of bed at seven in the morning."
Interviewer,"And make three meals a day and clean the house and do all of that work. Unpaid domestic labor is actually the basis upon which all other labor occurs. You cannot become a CEO until your mother did all that unpaid domestic labor first, which is crazy."
Grimes,"I've done some babysitting lately, and I've just been like, ""Oh, fuck. Kids are nightmare creatures."" You have to stop them from being evil, and it's existentially threatening. They just said something crazy, and if you don't shut it down in the right way, they might turn out to be Hitler."
Interviewer,"Can you imagine what it would be like if we were living in a world where that skillset or devotion was valued, or you valued reusing things instead of the high you get off of buying new things? What if your social currency came from figuring out how to repair something in your house rather than just buying the new thing? We've put value in a lot of dangerous places, and now we're reaping what we've sown."
Grimes,"Yeah. I like the carbon tax thing. I like the idea of making flying prohibitively expensive. When I fly home to see my grandparents, it's really nice, but I feel guilty about it. I'm like, I'm close enough to just being able to put on an Oculus, and they put on an Oculus, and we're sitting in the same room."
Interviewer,"When you reach out to touch something in the Oculus, alternate reality is there. Your brain gives you signals that you're about to touch something, even though you don't touch anything."
Grimes,"And then, when you come out, everything's a little bit wonky. Fuck. I don't know. We need to get deeper into the digital world, and we also need to get further away from it."
Interviewer,"Does a song first take shape for you on piano or guitar before you move on to choosing the sound palette, recording the instruments, the vocals? Or are songwriting and producing more interwoven?"
Grimes,"I would say the latter, they are very interwoven for me. It's sort of a seamless process where I produce as I write."
Interviewer,How do you make beats? Are there pads involved or is it all mouse/trackpad?
Grimes,"A bit of both. I like to use an Akai MPC and a keyboard MIDI controller, but sometimes I build it out manually. I like to build sample packs that I use mostly for drum sources. Usually by combining drums (like the high end of a real kick and the low end of a digital kick, for example). Once I get a good one I use it a lot. I have some sample packs that my friend Bloodpop made or acquired that I like to use as well. I typically start with kick / snare and work backwards."
Interviewer,We've heard you put a lot of consideration into finding the right tempo for a given track. Do you tend to try out different tempos for each song that you're working on?
Grimes,"I think tempo is really important. Fast can be amazing, but then you have to simplify the drums. Slow can be amazing, but then you have to really perfect the groove. This is something I agonize over."
Interviewer,How do you approach sound design in general? Are you always listening out for interesting sounds around you? How do you capture them and where do they end up?
Grimes,"I'm always listening for interesting sounds. Like, for example, I recently took a sample of some percussion that had a lot of melodic information in it, put the verb up to 100% and then sampled the verb so that none of the original sample was there but it contained the melodic information. Sometimes I record things in the house like beads or whatever etc. Sometimes I get found samples from online bird watching communities or this or that, haha. Usually I use some combination of these methods."
Interviewer,Your tracks usually have quite a lot going on in them. How do you keep an overview of all the elements when you're working?
Grimes,My files are way too messy and I'm trying to be more organized and controlled with it lately. I do use a lot of layering. It's gets very complicated very fast and I crash my files a lot.
Interviewer,"How do you know when a track is finished? Do you tend to follow an ""add until the picture is complete"" or ""remove until only the essentials are left"" strategy?"
Grimes,"I'm more in the 'remove until only the essentials are left' strategy camp, but then the versions of the songs I play live end up being the best because I get the mixed stems back and then add a lot of new sounds. I usually finish via a self-imposed deadline. In my opinion, there was a lot more I would have liked to do on most of my released tracks."
Interviewer,"As can be seen on your tumblr, your musical tastes and interests are pretty wide-ranging. Of the artists (new and old) that you're into, is there anything specifically production-related that you particularly admire or would like to get into more deeply?"
Grimes,"I love the production on the new Lana Del Rey album, Honeymoon. Specifically the song Art Deco. I like how it sounds old but new. I also love the song ""BBHMM"" by Rihanna. I feel like both Rihanna and Lana are often able to create compelling pop songs with really wet vocals. I kind of hate dry vocals, but they are so essential to solid pop songs in most people's minds."
Interviewer,How do you translate what you've made in the studio into something that can be played live? How do parts get 'assigned' to the musicians you have with you on stage?
Grimes,"The musician I'm touring with currently, named HANA, is a really incredible multi-instrumentalist and vocalist so she has been adding a lot creatively lately, and taking on things like lead guitar in some songs that used to just be a sample. We also jam a lot on the bus or in hotels, doing vocal harmonies and things, so we have a good musical rapport and that's become very important to me on stage."
Interviewer,How are you?
Grimes,"Not bad. Well, actually, I'm very pregnant. I'm very slow and very tired. I'm slow as fuck so do not judge. My brain is like 10 per cent down."
Interviewer,How is being pregnant impacting you?
Grimes,It's just the last little bit. Mostly it's been OK. At the beginning it was hard. I feel much more sympathy for my mom now.
Interviewer,How many weeks pregnant are you?
Grimes,31.
Interviewer,What has it meant for your music?
Grimes,"Productivity is down but ideas are up, which is interesting. I have tons and tons of ideas but I'm just not executing them very well. But I'm getting a lot of shon paper, which is great. It's just a stamina issue really and singing is hard."
Interviewer,Will you become one of these artists who writes endless songs about being a parent?
Grimes,No. I don't know if that's artistically compelling to people. It's not even compelling to me.
Interviewer,How has the process of making music changed for you in recent years?
Grimes,"In a lot of ways it is the same. Music for me is kind of like this weird meditative state/chill state. I typically work alone. I lock myself in a room and it's a chill zone. But as you become increasingly in the public eye, it becomes more intense obviously. But the actual function of making music retains this nice quality for me like it was in the beginning. And it's important for me to preserve that. I think the main difference is I'd probably drop a lot more music if the pressure wasn't so high."
Interviewer,Do you think about the balance between making music that is commercial and following your creative urges?
Grimes,"I feel like I'm luckily in a weird position where people don't expect me to be making radio hits. I'm thinking 'How do I become Radiohead' not 'How do I become Taylor Swift'. The thing I'm aiming at personally is just great immortal art, if I can get there. I kind of love that goal. I don't presume that I'm ever getting there. Especially with Miss Anthropocene, I was just like I want to make something fuck ing crazy. The main goal is to make something really different from anything else. That's like jarring and emotional as opposed to making a hit, which one day I hope to do."
Interviewer,Did your years in Montreal have a big influence on you?
Grimes,"I think Montreal was incredibly essential to my development as an artist. I can't speak to the vibe there currently but when I was coming up, the scene was thriving like crazy. A lot of people were showing me how to do things. I was playing a lot of shows. I played so many shows locally before I got on the road. Most artists when they break, they haven't played a lot of shows... Montreal, you can play 100 shows before you go play in other cities. There's such a focus on creativity and experimentalism. I think that scenes can be really important and helpful and amazing. It's a really cool thing. Like Arcade Fire introduced me to a lot of people I still work with. There's this cool mentoring aspect of things and most cities don't have that."
Interviewer,What was your reaction when some of your fans objected to your relationship with Elon Musk?
Grimes,"I understand it. It's just part of the thing. I respect people's opinions and I get where people are coming from. I respectfully disagree. There's been a lot of sensationalistic stories that paint things in a different light than they actually are, but people are mad because they care about the world being better and they misunderstand what my boyfriend does. I respect that the impulse is coming from a good place. They're mad because they believe in certain things and I can't really criticize that. I think my boyfriend works really fuck ing hard to fix a lot of our environmental issues but I totally get that some people don't approve of how he's doing that."
Interviewer,What's your take on American politics as a Canadian in L.A.?
Grimes,"I really appreciated growing up having access to good health care and I didn't go into major debt by going to college. And I think those things make Canada better. Canadians tend to be, on average, compared to Americans, a lot less angry and in a lot less pain. I don't know any Canadians who're $400,000 in debt because of a medical problem or school. And that makes life better when there isn't some shhanging over your head. It leads to a better mental state in society in general. There's just a lot less hatred and a lot less anger. So I think it's cool that certain candidates are proposing more Canadian-like ways of living. A lot of Americans say it's impossible but I say, look at Canada. Obviously it's not perfect but it does seem to be a better living standard than in America and I think it leads to a more peaceful society."
Interviewer,I read that you actually studied neuroscience in college? Or just the sciences generally?
Grimes,"Actually, I was in a program at McGill called Electroacoustics, where we studied a lot of how the brain interacts with music. So by the time I actually started making music, I kind of had an understanding of frequencies and kind of how the brain responds to things, which I think really helped me as a producer:Even though I had no experience playing instruments and stuff, I kind of had a basic understanding of engineering. My learning curve was maybe a tiny bit shorter than maybe someone who hadn't studied that stuff."
Interviewer,"So how does that inform the music? One of the things I like about electronic music is the sensory overload, the drops, the highs and lows of it, are directly triggering things in my brain. Is there a song on this album where you feel like your knowledge about how we hear things affects how many tracks there are, how many layers, how many sounds?"
Grimes,"I don't know if it's actually that practically useful, honestly. Because you can study music to death; you can study the brain's response to music to death. But it's not the same thing as making music, which is very gut-level."
Interviewer,"Can you remember when you first thought of yourself as a producer? I mean, was there an early song, before people knew you, even, where you realized you like the tinkering, the putting it together?"
Grimes,"Probably from the first time I tried to make music. Singing has always been a struggle for me, so when I first started making music, I only made instrumentals."
Interviewer,"When you finally did start to sing, was it a surprise to you?"
Grimes,"Kind of! I mean, I wasn't good, but I was not the worst, which was extremely encouraging to me. The fact that I wasn't literally the worst singer on planet Earth made me think that I was, like, a god. Immediately I was like, Oh, I don't suck? OK, I'm gonna be a musician. Like, right away."
Interviewer,"So when you first sat down, what were the circumstances? What drew you to it?"
Grimes,"Basically, I'd been at a friend's house; he said he wanted a girl vocal. I was like, I'm really a bad singer, but I did it anyway, and then I was like, oh, music isn't that hard. So I got my friend to show me how to use GarageBand, and then I just kind of started making terrible, terrible songs using the built-in synths and stuff, just screwing around with that."
Interviewer,"It's interesting, I think electronic music changes the bar of entry for people who want to get into music, right?"
Grimes,"Oh, yeah. I think, I mean, in a sad way I think it's one of the reasons experimental electronic music isn't more popular, is that it's so hard to turn it into a live thing; it's more of a laptop thing. But definitely, in the scene I came from, you don't need to be a good musician to make electronic music, you just need to have a good ear. You don't need to be able to technically perform anything."
Interviewer,"So now that there's so much of this music out there, how do you determine what's good? Who are the artists that inspire you, who are doing similar work?"
Grimes,"Oh my gosh. I love 40, who produces for Drake, I think he's one of the best producers. I love Burial. I mean, most of my favorite producers produce for vocalists; I don't listen to a lot of straight electronic music that doesn't have vocals. This is a totally crazy thing, and I'm significantly worse and significantly less popular, but in a way Calvin Harris is probably the most similar to me in terms of functionality. He's a great producer, he's a songwriter, but he doesn't necessarily sing all his songs. He does sing, he's decent at it, but it's not like his main thing."
Interviewer,"What has it been like over the years asserting yourself in the studio? Because the model that we all hear about in the music press is young women performing songs that they may have written, but the production is usually a man, especially if you look at the Top 40. Have you found that people in that setting want to provide the beats for you?"
Grimes,"I've never actually worked in a studio on one of my songs, I've only worked in a studio in writing camps for other people, which were odd experiences. I wasn't allowed to touch a computer, for example, even though guys in the studio were allowed to. I obviously know how to use a computer and I know how to produce, but I had to tell the engineer what to do if I wanted to do anything, which I thought was pretty crazy in the 21st century."
Interviewer,"This might have been a union thing, too, right? Because you're the writer."
Grimes,"No, no, there were producers coming in, and I don't think I was brought in only to do vocals and top line. Even if I was, that's kind of weird because I'm way more of a producer than a vocalist. So, I mean, it was pretty gendered. Luckily, I mostly work in my own house and I don't work with other people, kind of for this reason."
Interviewer,"For people who don't know, writer's camps are basically like a retreat, where you get put into groups and you're supposed to write, collaboratively, for another artist. What was that experience like for you, an artist who's pretty self-contained?"
Grimes,"In a way, it was a blessing in disguise:I got to watch so many great producers work, because I wasn't allowed to produce anything. I actually did learn quite a bit about production. But on the other hand, it was very daunting, even just as a writer writing top line, because I felt like it was extremely judgmental. It was kind of assumed that I was stupid and that I didn't know what was going on, and especially because I don't feel confident as a vocalist, it was very stressful to have that be the thing that I was evaluated on."
Interviewer,And you described it as gendered.
Grimes,"Yeah, well, just that all the guys made beats and all the girls did top line."
Interviewer,Top line meaning the melody.
Grimes,"Yeah, basically the melody that the vocal is doing. Like, there were no girls doing beats and there were no guys doing top line. But, I don't know, I don't want to criticize it too much."
Interviewer,"No, I mean, they're big business, right? Lots of people are making money and songs in this way. But it's sort of hard to picture, given how many women we see in the Top 40. A lot of the biggest names in music are women right now."
Grimes,"I think it's just ... you know, I came in with experience as a producer and I wasn't allowed to produce, so how could any woman who didn't have experience as a producer ever learn how to produce? It was just a little odd in that regard. If there are stereotypes of, Women do certain jobs in music and men do certain jobs, the way the studio works, it's not easy to escape that."
Interviewer,"As your career has gotten bigger and more and more people are hearing your music, do you hear from young women who want to be doing what you're doing?"
Grimes,"I guess I do! If you meet fans outside of a concert or something like that, someone will be like, You inspired me to start producing, and I make records now. Which is pretty cool, I mean, not even from a music perspective, but being visible as a woman in technology is sort of interesting, and hopefully inspires women not just to touch computers in music but for other purposes as well."
Interviewer,"I want to talk about one song that I was, I feel like, almost surprised to hear on this album, which is Easily. It sounds like you very much enjoying your own voice."
Grimes,"Oh, really? It's actually my least favorite song on the album!"
Interviewer,What don't you like about it? I think it's quite sweet.
Grimes,"I just think it's really basic. I only put it on because when I showed my friends all the songs they were all like, You have to keep that song. Don't ditch that one. But I personally think it's not very interesting from a production standpoint."
Interviewer,"That makes sense given a lot of the other music we've heard from you, which is just layers and layers of sounds. This is just you."
Grimes,"It kind of makes me uncomfortable! But usually, the songs other people like are the songs that make me the most uncomfortable, so I usually try to allow some of those to make it onto the record."
Interviewer,"Do you ever want your voice, or your music, to sound ugly? Like, do those songs, in a way, kind of go against the way you have presented your voice, which is not about being bubbly?"
Grimes,"Yeah, I do kind of like songs more like SCREAM. They feel more natural to me. I like to have at least one thing in a song that's a bit jarring, that throws people off."
Interviewer,"Right, which in SCREAM is super-effective. You have this Taiwanese rapper, Aristophanes, who is delivering on such great menace, and then the chorus has this primal, punk-like scream. It's interesting to hear that next to this other side of your music, which almost reminds me of The Bangles or something."
Grimes,"The other thing about songs that are really singing-oriented is that they're much harder to perform live. Singing live is twice as hard as singing in a quiet, nice studio, where you can do 50 takes and choose the best one."
Interviewer,"So when you're at a show, what are you oriented toward? Are you thinking more about setting up the computers and the sound design than that moment when you're going to have to take the mic and maybe sing something pretty bare? Do you avoid those songs as a result?"
Grimes,"I do. I actually do not play either Easily or California live. And I also often have to change the top line so that it's easier to sing, stuff like that."
Interviewer,"You've made this distinction between having to perform this music you create on stage and like trying to get that to translate, not just for the audience but for yourself. Do you like performing?"
Grimes,"Well, it's complicated. It's not my favorite thing, but it is way better than working at Starbucks. I just have terrible, terrible stage fright. It's definitely not what I would do if I could make a living doing something else, but it's on the better end of jobs."
Interviewer,"Stage fright doesn't seem like a good match for some of the stages you're playing. You're doing Coachella, these are big, big stages."
Grimes,"I mean, you can always override it, it's just very difficult."
Interviewer,"Does the persona help? Like, does being Grimes help?"
Grimes,"I suppose so. When you're kind of just bombarding people with crazy, it's so much less daunting than when you have to be a sweet, great vocalist who can do runs and stuff. Especially at festivals where you don't get to soundcheck and you have no idea if it's going to sound good or bad. Last time I played Coachella I had no in-ear  at all. I had to do the whole set completely deaf and just hope it was OK."
Interviewer,How were the reviews?
Grimes,"Uh, great! I mean, muscle memory is a hell of a thing."
Interviewer,"With this album, do you feel like you have advanced your music significantly? You've done the videos and the songs and the production and even the cover art, does it feel like a milestone for you?"
Grimes,"Oh, yeah. I mean this is, for me, my first record that I think is good. Not that the other records aren't good, but they're so amateur. I made them not thinking anyone would ever listen to them, so there's tons of songs without lyrics, because I just sort of did a random vocal and was like, That's good enough. There's a lot more care put into this record, because it was the first record I made knowing that I had a sizable audience."
Interviewer,"Going forward, what direction do you want to take this? Do you see a future where maybe you don't bother with those vocals at all and you become Grimes, super-producer?"
Grimes,"I could see that. The problem with that is when you produce for other people, you're subject to their whims and fancies and you have to do what they want, which I'm really bad at. Like, in the camps, you go in and they're like, OK, it has to be 135 BPM. It has to be in this key. I'm like, I don't even read music! I don't know how to do that."
Interviewer,"I just want to follow up on something you said earlier, about your voice, and being vulnerable and just kind of out there. In a way, do you feel like you have been both rewarded and penalized for your voice?"
Grimes,"Yeah, I think my voice definitely bothers some people. Some people really like it. People hate my lisp:When I was in high school, I remember people would be like, Ugh, I don't want to talk to you! You have a lisp. It's so annoying. But I don't know, I like having a weird voice. All my favorite singers, even if they're not the best, they have a voice that you can immediately recognize. I think that's a really awesome trait."
Interviewer,"Let me start by saying I love Visions. It sounds a lot more pop-oriented than your past music, maybe with the exception of Vanessa. Was that a conscious decision or did it just sort of happen that way?"
Grimes,"It definitely just happened. I think I always wanted to make dance music, or pop music, it took me a while to figure it out. 'Vanessa' was the first song where I was like, 'oh yeah!' I achieved that. Really, I've just sort of been getting better at making music and I'm getting more able to make the music I want to make. It's almost more of a realization of what I've been wanting to do for a while."
Interviewer,What were you listening to when you recorded Visions? What other artists influence you?
Grimes,"A lot of TLC, kind of new jack swing-era music. A lot of early '90s. A lot of Mariah. Whitney Houston. TLC, at least vocally, was more influential, because I think they do really cool stuff. And Outkast."
Interviewer,What's your favorite TLC song?
Grimes,"It's really weird. It sounds like Black Dice. It's this song called, 'If I Was Your Girlfriend,' and it's really cool. Instrumentally, it's weird and experimental, digital distortion on the drums and stuff like that."
Interviewer,Do you have a song on Visions that you like to play live?
Grimes,"Yeah, probably the song called ""Be A Body."" It's my favorite song on the album; it's my favorite song to play."
Interviewer,"That's actually my favorite song on the new album too, I was wondering if you could explain the characters following the title?"
Grimes," It's really stupid, because I don't want to seem like some Asia-phile. I'm so embarrassed about that, but it's the Japanese characters for wabi-sabi, which is a concept that implies, or is about, non-attachment, and not being too attached to physical stuff. The song is kind of about being in the moment. It's about experiencing the physical world, right now, and not being attached to things."
Interviewer,When you're on tour is there a ritual or good luck charm that makes you feel ready to go on stage?
Grimes,"I have this thing where, if I see a bulldog, it means I'll play a good show that day. So I'm always looking out for bulldogs on the street because they fill me with positive energy, I guess. It sounds insane, but every time I'd see a bulldog I'd play a great show, and then it sort of became psychological. But If I see two bulldogs, then it counts for two shows...."
Interviewer,"You could have a ""bulldog bank"" where you've seen more bulldogs than you have shows coming up."
Grimes,"Yeah, exactly. And if I got really rich or famous I'd have a bulldog on my rider, so there's always a bulldog hanging out back stage."
Interviewer,It's near the end of the year. Have you thought about your favorite albums 2011?
Grimes,"Maybe the Holy Other EP and the new AraabMUZIK. I dunno, I haven't actually thought about it, and I always find out about stuff late, so I always say something is my favorite album of the year and it's from the year before, oh, Wander/Wonder by Balam Acab. I really love that record. Everything Tri Angle put out this year is really good."
Interviewer,One last question
Grimes,"I don't know if you've ever seen The Mists of Avalon, but one of the crazy Druid ladies has this really cool hair style where she has a single braid coming out of the top of head, and the rest of her head is shaved. I would never do it because I'm trying to grow out my hair, but I always thought that was really cool."
Interviewer,How did you first become familiar with Discord?
Grimes,"I actually learned about Discord because I needed this teenager to help me figure out how to rig up a 3-D model it's sort of a long story. I had a technical issue, and the person who was going to teach me how to solve it was like, ""I only use Discord,"" because they were, like, 14. And then if I was doing any kind of group gaming situation, I would be on Discord, because it's fun if you're playing games with a bunch of people and everybody is chatting. So I was using it for social, personal life stuff."
Interviewer,What did you like about Discord that led you to launch your own official server?
Grimes,"I was thinking we should launch a Grimes server for a long time. The more I get into the gaming community, it's a lot less toxic than the indie music stan community. Everyone's going to laugh at me saying that gaming culture is less toxic than indie stan culture, but it's kind of true, frankly, having lived in both extensively.  a more healthy social media. Social media really gets into incentivizing sensationalism, and incentivizing the negative. I started realizing that even in general, I was using my fake accounts way more than my real accounts. Social media is a lot healthier if you're mostly with your friends, and you're using it to an end as opposed to just a time-sucking situation. I'm really into, I guess you could call it ""humane technology."
Interviewer,Right nobody is joining a Discord server to hate on something. Users are really only gathering around things that they love.
Grimes,"You're proactively joining a fandom or a game or a pursuit that you're digging, as opposed to passively consuming information that an algorithm is deciding for you. I don't have flashes of PTSD when I open Discord the way I do with Twitter.  and being like, ""I like Grimes!"" And then there's 30 people coming in explaining to them why they shouldn't, and not even with factual information. I feel like it happens with other artists, too. I'm just really looking for better fan experiences. It sucks when you want people to engage, and then you feel like they get bullied or harassed when they engage. That's a main priority for me in my life right now"
Interviewer,How do you think it went when you teased Shinigami Eyes?
Grimes,I like playing a  song live. It's hard for people to just grab it and upload it. I like testing things on people without knowing it's going to live on the internet forever. I think our next Stages event will be better. We're going to actually play a whole set of new music and stuff.
Interviewer,From your next album?
Grimes,"Yeah, more stuff from my album. Sorry, our baby is just yelling, but I think...  Careful on that step!"
Interviewer,"Oh yeah, a very late congratulations, by the way!"
Grimes,"Thank you! So yeah, I just try things out. I don't like being too precious with music. I like just seeing what people like and testing things out. I really like playing video games with my friends maybe there's a way to do that with fans at some point in the future."
Interviewer,What else can you tell me about the album? Is it really a space opera?
Grimes,"We made an album and were like, ""Is this a finished album?"" And that was before I signed to Columbia. Then I signed to Columbia, and we keep debating on the singles and it keeps changing. It's sort of a concept album, so it does have a narrative. It's a space opera, and I'm trying to make it air-tight, really pull it together, hone it in. With my last album, I had a lot of big ideas, but I just let it be more impressionistic. With this album, I think I have a lot more to say. I feel very strongly about the material. Also, we're continually making songs as we go. But I think we're going to start dropping singles, which I kind of prefer. I prefer not putting too much pressure on the album, and being able to keep adding stuff, because I also like long albums. So I think we're going to start dropping singles this summer and then just keep dropping singles and then put the album out four, five, six singles in or something. I am a big album person, but I also like to get music out."
Interviewer,I can understand the tension between wanting to get things out but also wanting to have a fully-formed concept.
Grimes,"I think you just have to play the devil's game, because we're in a real world of singles right now. There aren't a lot of albums I'm listening to, although I really appreciate it when people put out a whole album these days that's solid. I really, really, really appreciate that. But the way things are actually consumed, it doesn't work in that way so much. So whatever, I'll do both."
Interviewer,"Sonically, would you say it's along similar lines as your last album? Or should we expect something different?"
Grimes,I think it's pretty different. I try not to talk about it too much. Maybe I shouldn't answer too many questions about the album. I'm probably not supposed to do that!
Interviewer,"Fair enough. Knowing that your music has always intersected with futuristic concepts like the metaverse, crypto and artificial intelligence, what is it like for you to watch the larger music industry and the world begin to catch on?"
Grimes,"I think it's really great and important. I feel like for the last 10 years, people have been like, ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" Everyone's like, ""Grimes is so eccentric and weird!"" And I'm like, ""No, I'm actually talking about real things. I'm not just trying to be weird."" These things actually exist. I feel like people perceive me as very insane, and like, ""Wow, she's so loopy and quirky."" It's nice to be sort of vindicated on certain things."
Interviewer,"I'll let you go, but are there any other projects you want to mention? I hear you're working on a podcast."
Grimes,"I'm working on a podcast called Homo Techno with my friend Liv , who was previously one of the world's preeminent female poker players. She now works in AI theory and stuff. Our thesis for the podcast is that we're no longer homo sapiens, we are homo techno we're full cyborgs. It investigates the most aggressively controversial theories about futurism or the people who are most on the edge with either their ideas or practices with regards to ways the world can be."
Interviewer,"Visions is your third album, but you've said it feels like your first. Why?"
Grimes,"Those other two albums were literally the first music I ever made. They were just practice. I don't hate them, but instead of actually making what I wanted to make, I was making what I was able to make. I wish I could have just put this out as my first album."
Interviewer,Are you still going to school at McGill University in Montreal?
Grimes,"I was actually expelled for missing almost a year of class. It's their policy, but I wasn't aware of it because I was skipping at the time. haha So I no longer attend McGill, which kind of sucks because I wish I had a degree after spending that much money and time working on something. But actually, no, it doesn't suck. I was done. Now, I'm working on music all the time. It's not like I really need a job, because everything is super cheap in Montreal."
Interviewer,You played to some relatively big crowds opening for Lykke Li recently. What was that like?
Grimes,"It forced me to become a musician. Previously, I was playing shows for 30 people, and then it turned into 3,000 people. So I practiced a lot and made everything more coherent. Before that, it was kind of jammy I would improvise a lot. But that tour is one of the reasons why I started bringing my vocals up, because I would always  if the vocals were higher in the mix."
Interviewer,You co-directed your video for Vanessa from the Darkbloom EP. What was the inspiration for it?
Grimes,"That was a real K-pop-influenced video. The budget was $60, which all went to alcohol. We literally planned it the night before. I just got a bunch of my friends to drink a lot and was like, We're going to do dance moves. We did it in a couple of hours. I almost didn't care what it looked like; I just wanted it to look like everyone's having a good time. I also wanted it to be kind of creepy, too, hence the backward stuff."
Interviewer,Are your siblings into your music?
Grimes,"I have two younger biological brothers and two stepbrothers, and they're all into it, kind of. My oldest stepbrother is a rapper. He's called Jay Worthy. He's pretty tough, pretty crazy. Like, you get in his car, and there's blood splattered in it, and you're like, Oh. We want to collaborate."
Interviewer,"Grimes, with your 2012 song ""Oblivion"" you said you took one of the most shattering experiences of your life and turned it into something positive. Is sharing personal pain through your music cathartic?"
Grimes,"It's sort of the opposite. I make the album for me and then it's like, ""Oh, fuck. Everyone else has to hear this."" I have a rule"
Interviewer,"So what was your reaction when ""Realiti,"" a sort of throwaway song that you released unfinished, got over 6 million YouTube plays and was called your best song in years?"
Grimes,"I did not think it would get that big. I thought people would be like, ""Aw, how cute,"" and move on. It's pretty awesome, but I really wish I'd finished the song... (Laughs) I hate unfinished things. And the sound quality is so bad! My last album Visions is quite obviously amateur sounding too."
Interviewer,That didn't stop many critics from calling it one of the best albums of 2012.
Grimes,"But it wasn't the most professional setting. My management at the time was just a friend from high school. There was a release date before there was an even album, so I was on a crazy deadline and didn't necessarily finish things the way I probably would have wanted to. I had no training in music, barely played any shows, I didn't really know anything about music at all...."
Interviewer,Sometimes naiveté can be an advantage.
Grimes,"Yeah, definitely. But I think there's also a point where when you're a professional at something, you're expected to be executing at a certain level constantly and intentionally. I'd made three albums being not a serious musician at all, which I think is enough albums to make as an amateur. (Laughs)."
Interviewer,Things must have changed a lot for you in that respect. Your new album is your first since coming under the management of Jay-Z's Roc Nation and you reportedly even went through media training not quite your old DIY approach anymore.
Grimes,"I was just like, ""Maybe there's a way to stop Pitchfork from ruining my life all the time."" But I realized that it doesn't matter what I say because they'll still do it. I mean... not ruin my life, but just these ridiculous sexist attacks that I'm crying and so sad and having a terrible time all the time. And I just don't even know what this is about. I was just like, ""Is there any way for me to, like, stop this from happening?"" But it's the machine. It's clickbait."
Interviewer,Is your new and professional management also trying to dictate how you should look?
Grimes,"No. I think music is performing. Especially the stage shows. It's all related. I've been learning more about performance, watching politicians and speeches and things like that to integrate it into the show. The art I want to make tends to be quite audacious. But I'm not trying to be more professional in the sense that I care what anybody thinks. That's not much of a concern."
Interviewer,"What is the concern, then?"
Grimes,"For this album I just wanted to be able to walk into a room with any of my peers and know everything that they know. I don't want people to think I'm a worse producer than my male peers. I'm mostly tired of people who say they want to sound like Grimes calling up my male friends to try to get my sound. You could've called me but you don't call me because the only reference point you have is Visions. I wanted to learn how to produce, I wanted to learn how to engineer, I wanted to learn how to play instruments... Before I even started the album I really wanted to just become a musician, as it were. And since I hate repeating myself, that involves learning quite a bit."
Interviewer,So it was important for you to be known as a good producer as well as a talented artist?
Grimes,"Definitely. I think I'm a shit vocalist! (Laughs) I think I'm, like, a very questionable vocalist. I think it's just an identity thing. I could never identify as a vocalist, so for me the production part is very important. And if I'm going to charge people 10 bucks for an album, I want it to be fucking good! I want it to be worth people's while."
Interviewer,Do you feel that's not the case for most artists these days?
Grimes,"I think for a lot of albums right now there'll be the single and then there's just a bunch of crap. For example, when the Beyoncé album came out, because it came out all at once and there was no press, I just listened to the whole album at once. And I realized, ""Fuck, I haven't actually listened to a new album the whole way through in years."" Every song really meant something to me. I wanted to make an album like that. I hope people listen through the whole thing and every single song could be a single."
Interviewer,Wouldn't that be a bit more mainstream than your music tends to be?
Grimes,"Not in, like, a Top 40 way. Just where every single song could be really meaningful to me and really well executed. You could take out any song and be like, ""This is what Grimes is."" And it would be good. It was really hard to choose singles because to me it's a real album. Compared to Visions and compared to the albums before it, I think it's quite an improvement. There's nothing on it that I think is bad."
Interviewer,I guess that's why it took you so long to finish it.
Grimes,"It's just that when I look at the artists I admire, even like Bob Dylan or Carravaggio or Leonardo DaVinci, they don't just achieve. They achieve at the highest level. They're great, great artists. And they're great, great technical performers. Their skill is at the highest level and their expression is at the highest level. I don't want to be good. I want to be the best. Even in failing that, you'll hit a higher mark than if you never tried."
Interviewer,Hey Claire!
Grimes,"Hi, how are you?"
Interviewer,"Great! I didn't know whether to call you Grimes, or Miss Grimes or something."
Grimes,(laughs).
Interviewer,"So you are coming to Australia for Meredith Music Festival, you must have played dozens of festivals already but are you excited?"
Grimes,"I actually am pretty excited. My Dad is really obsessed with Australia. Like, he always wanted to go when I was a kid, so it seems like, I don't know, a thing that needs to happen in my life. I heard Meredith is just awesome, plus outdoor festivals are my favourite kind."
Interviewer,"Great. Well formalities out of the way, I've watched more than a few interviews with you and noticed that you are totally unashamed to like mainstream pop musicians like Mariah Carey and Justin Bieber. Actually, did you catch their collaboration the other Christmas on Mariah's 'All I Want For Christmas Is You'?"
Grimes,I actually kind of hate it.
Interviewer,(Surprised noise) No!
Grimes,"(Laughs) Sorry, that's such a strong thing to say. It's just, Mariah's version is just so good and it was obviously a money grab. I feel like it was a cheesy thing for Justin, the stuff on his album is better. And Mariah, I don't know, I just feel like that song is sacred."
Interviewer,It is a perfect song. Have you ever thought of doing a Christmas song?
Grimes,"I'm kind of anti-Christmas so no. Well, not 'anti' Christmas but in High School, I was anti-Christmas cause it was always this big thing in my family. I technically celebrate Kwanzaa cause my Mom's friend celebrated Kwanzaa so I would always just do that."
Interviewer,You should make a Kwanzaa song... do they have songs?
Grimes,"Yeah! They have a ton of songs, (laughs) I won't go on a big tirade about Kwanzaa but it is about anti-materialism and making the holidays more about music and stuff."
Interviewer,"Oh good. And not just because that leads back into talking about music. So Grimes is tied up in the Seapunk and WitchHouse genres, do you pay much attention to any of that? The new genre labels I mean."
Grimes,"Sort of, it is an interesting thing, but I'm not a Seapunk, I'll put that out there. I don't have a problem with it, it is just a very particular scene and I think I'm doing something different. When WitchHouse happened I was like, that's actually really kind of cool because it is a logical extension of all the kids who were teenagers in like 2001. All the big musicians back then were like Marilyn Manson and Outkast and stuff, so making like trap, rap beats that are really goth is the logical step for people of my generation. Actually, my album Halifax was an attempt at a WitchHouse album. I still wouldn't define myself as WitchHouse but I think it is a very applicable sub-genre. Only because I never really got into like Chillwave or some of the other ones, that's not really my thing. Making a weird super niche genre is kind of a cool idea though."
Interviewer,"You have kind of touched on what I wanted to ask you next. In your interview with Nardwaur, you mentioned you are the 'future of music.' You seem to have a very clear idea or vision of your music, so could you elaborate a bit more on being the 'future of music'?"
Grimes,"Well, I like the idea of controlling everything. That doesn't really happen where an artist does everything, like directs their own videos and produces all their own music and writes it all. So that's a huge part of it for me. What I was referring to though was more, pure musical stuff probably, in that interview. I feel like I have a lot of ideas, like the idea of WitchHouse, which I think really needs to get done. I don't know, my mandate is to just take all of these genres, the one's that people think really shouldn't be together, or that aren't cool, and just find the parts that are cool because I think it will lead to a more interesting and original thing. Doing the opposite of what everyone else thinks is cool is probably the right thing."
Interviewer,"Do you think it is inevitable for you then, to never find mainstream popularity? Or was that even ever important to you?"
Grimes,"Well you know, I don't really care, I just want to make the art that I feel proud of. I don't care if it ever gets really big or if it stays small. Even if I upset people that want me to do one thing specifically. The thing I really care about the most is the satisfaction I get from accomplishing something that I think is really good. Which is the best part of the job, or this whole thing, it's what's happening in the studio. I do care about critical success, it's awesome, it has changed my life to have critical success. You know, I can afford to live in a house and eat good food. I think it is important for me to really try and not think about that stuff though."
Interviewer,"Actually that reminds me of something else you mentioned in the Nardwaur interview. It seemed like an unserious thing to you, but you mentioned you started a cult with your friend based around bureaucracy, which means everyone is too busy with paperwork to get anything done."
Grimes,"(Laughs) It's kind of a joke, but my friend Duffy is sort of insane, he used to dance for me. So he invented this cult, I mean, it's not a real cult, but it is, though I think everyone kind of see's it as a joke. We have rituals and things."
Interviewer,"(Laughs) I think there's more to it though, what I meant before was that it is important for artists such as yourself to avoid getting tied up in the bureaucracy of mainstream music. The situations that hinder your independence and creativity. Mainstream popularity can kind of suffocate creativity, I don't know, do you get where I'm going?"
Grimes,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure if it necessarily does but I have some friends on bigger labels who have problems when they want to put something out and their label isn't okay with it. My label is sort of indie so I don't have that problem. Though sometimes I'll be working on something, and I can't just drop a song or put it out. Even today, I shot the video for 'Be A Body,' and I was just lining up the footage with my friend's song and thinking, 'I really should just use this footage for this song.' I couldn't because it is an old song of his and it wouldn't have made sense in the press cycle. That was definitely one of those moments of going 'I wish I could just make art!' because it would have been awesome to make that music video but instead, his song won't have a video because of all this stupid bureaucracy. Something I have to fight is that the more success I get, I guess the more censors there have to be and certain things like that."
Interviewer,"That does sound annoying. I guess a lot of people confuse censorship with just a musician's aesthetic appearance. Like, people would see your videos and think your 'look' is what makes you the artist you are. So your 'Genesis' video, for example, people must think you are way left of centre. By the way, was that inspired by Sailor Moon?"
Grimes,A little bit! Mainly Tarantino though.
Interviewer,"Oh, Kill Bill, of course."
Grimes,"Yeah, like Gogo Yubari, I was definitely the archetype of the violent Japanese schoolgirl. It is such an iconic image. I just thought it would be sick to dress up and have a bunch of weapons. A little bit of Sailor Moon in there too though definitely. For the costumes, I went to a lot of anime and cosplay stores."
Interviewer,"That's so awesome. I feel sad to bring the conversation back to more serious stuff, but I'm interested in how music spreads, especially with hipsters and there being music that is 'cool.' So I'm so glad to hear you say in interviews that your first crush was Travis Barker from Blink 182, because you recognise that bands like that were just a gateway to other punk music. Do you feel that Grimes is a gateway into any other kinds of music?"
Grimes,"Oh I hope so. I feel like I might not be big enough, like to know Grimes you kind of have to be a little bit into weird music in the first place, maybe (laughs). That would be the ideal though, to be a Blink 182 or Marilyn Manson where you're obviously flirting with mainstream success but you're still accessing a lineage of music that is weirder or more underground. Blink 182 though, they were definitely a gateway band into punk and hardcore. When you mention them people are always like 'What? No' but it's like, 'Come on dude you didn't just wake up one day and start listening to New Order when you were five years old.'."
Interviewer,"(Laughs) Exactly, I was 13 when 'All The Small Things' came out, and everyone in the year was into that song, what are people talking about?"
Grimes,"I know, I've been getting into a lot of arguments recently because I'm really getting into the new Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift records."
Interviewer,(*Excited girlish noise*) Taylor Swift!
Grimes,"I know, Taylor is so awesome, I might get to meet her in a week! I don't know for sure yet though. Every time I mention I like her or Justin on Twitter though I lose like twenty followers, it's ridiculous. There's so much hate for something that is successful or something that appears to be marketed at a younger audience. As if it couldn't be good music because of the way it is marketed. It sucks because those records are actually awesome and if you don't want to listen to it because you think you are too cool then it is your loss I guess. I get so angry about people like that and that kind of stuff."
Interviewer,"Oh don't worry, they're the kind of people that turn into crazed postal workers wearing their mum's lipstick because they never accepted themselves."
Grimes,"(Laughs) I don't know, I mean Taylor Swift is really talented, more than Justin Bieber I would say, she writes all her own music."
Interviewer,"Yeah, she completely stole my heart. Did you see her perform at the Grammy's?"
Grimes,The time when she changed costume in the middle of the song?
Interviewer,"Not that time, the one where the stage was made up to be a saloon and she's holding a banjo, though I don't think she played it."
Grimes,I wish she played instruments!
Interviewer,"Yeah! At the end of the song, she got a standing ovation, and she was just, so genuinely grateful, you could see on her face, it was so sweet."
Grimes,"Yeah, whenever I see footage of her shows she is so stoked at the end, you can tell she loves it. I mean, she is super famous but it is so refreshing because she always seems so surprised, it's just nice."
Interviewer,"Do you ever feel pressured to be like that at shows? Like to finish and look out at the audience like 'Oh! Thank you so much, I love all of you!'."
Grimes,"Nah, I usually just run off stage (laughs) because I get nervous. Actually I started bowing, I don't know why. It was probably in Japan, they are always bowing so I guess I got into it there. It seems like such a humble way to get out of things or say thank you. It is a good solution to a lot of social problems. So on the last tour, I would finish and kind of bow and then run off thinking 'why are you doing this?' It is so nerdy."
Interviewer,"It is weird how these things start. For no reason, I started putting my thumbs up as a way to say 'yeah!' or 'I'm on to it.' All the time, even to shop keepers."
Grimes,"(Laughs) It's funny to get into little habits like that, it is so dorky, like stuff a Dad would do."
Interviewer,"Speaking of nerdy. We kind of touched on Mariah Carey before, have you seen the footage of Nicky Minaj going crazy at her on American Idol?"
Grimes,"No! I need to see that, I've been so out of the loop, what happened?"
Interviewer,"Well, not to spoil it, but Nicky rants for ages and death threats are thrown around. Pretty epic stuff."
Grimes,Well it's kind of awesome though (laughs) I need to look this up.
Interviewer,Definitely. And sorry again to bring the conversation back to more serious stuff but I heard that for Visions you were in your room for a long period of time by yourself. What drives you to be so intense about the recording process?
Grimes,"Well, it's a few things. At the time I had tours booked so I just had that month period and knew if I didn't do it then I wouldn't make a record for a really long time. I had also been researching a lot of medieval cloisters and philosophers and art from the period. I guess I just wanted to do something really extreme. I had kind of done shorter things like that in the past, like fasting and stuff like that for artistic purposes. It worked really well. I'm actually kind of doing that right now. I'm in B.C, in the woods, in a cabin. I have no access to anything really and I'm recording. You can just get so much done when there's no internet and no one to talk to. You lose track of time and just work and work. I feel you develop a deeper understanding of the thing that you're working on."
Interviewer,"Whoa, that sounds scary to me. I mean I totally applaud you for taking it to that extreme. I read interviews where you talk about where you sing and imagine you're a medieval princess. It makes me think, 'how is she so confidant to talk like that?' It sounds like psychosis to me. You don't seem like you've lost your mind though so I'm quite encouraged now."
Grimes,"Well, I think if you can compartmentalize, I mean, I have to do a lot of compartmentalizing in my life. The music is one thing and the music is a very spiritual, abstract and anti-logical endeavor. Then, on the other hand, I'm just coming into this and I have to be a business person, running the business that is Grimes. That includes doing interviews and directing music videos and the art direction and all this other stuff that is totally different from the creative process. I've just had to separate doing the creative and crazy things from the logical things. They are both wrapped up in the same world but they use different parts of the brain. I don't know, there are boundaries and limits to psychological things."
Interviewer,"Yeah. Gosh, I hate to wrap it up there. Thanks for talking to me. We got to talk about Mariah and Taylor Swift which was the important stuff I guess."
Grimes,"(Laughs) Yeah, it's been good! Bye."
Interviewer,"You've pushed back the release date of your record, Visions, because you recently signed to 4AD Records how do you feel about the delay?"
Grimes,"It's weird because I've already heard the record a million times so it's old. I finished it in August and the way I roll is that I make a record and then after the record's done, I'm just done with it. Giving it more time almost gives me more time to not be so sick of it, though. Right after I finished it, I was like 'Wow, I just killed myself to make this' and there was just a point where if I heard any of those songs, any of those drum beats, I would just shutter!"
Interviewer,Grimes.
Grimes,"I wrote my thesis on Medieval music and I've always thought the dialogue between music and God in Medieval society was really cool and even though I don't believe in any of that stuff, I've always thought all that stuff was really interesting. Like, this idea of seq:uestering yourself and fasting, it's a process and it leads to good art, or whatever, so I just decided to blackout my windows and lock myself in my room and just not really have any stimulation of any kind. I didn't talk to anybody for three weeks, I had been on tour for a really long time so I just didn't tell anyone I was back, and I tortured myself and kind of went crazy in my room. My roommate went and got my groceries because, obviously, I didn't fast the entire time or I would've died! It worked incredibly well, I was inspired the entire time and I was making so much music. I think it's my best work yet."
Interviewer,Is this the way you always record music or was this a first?
Grimes,I've done it for a couple of days before but it's definitely a whole new ball game when you do it for an extended period of time.
Interviewer,"Whenever you talk about Visions, you make it sound like it's your debut album but, in reality, this is your third. Why does this feel like the first to you?"
Grimes,"This is like my first record as a musician, the first record that was thought out and meticulous and not just random songs that I liked. This one was more reflective of the phase I was in and just more artistically and emotionally directed. Also, this was the first time I knew that people were going to hear it. In the past, I always just made music and it was just whatever; put it on the internet for free and I just didn't give a suct or think about it that much. With this, there was actually a publicist involved and there's an infrastructure here. And, obviously, we started talking to labels and it was like, 'OK, this isn't going to be me posting things online for free, this is going to be an actual thing so it needs to be good!'."
Interviewer,It's also your most poppy-sounding record yet. Was that intentional?
Grimes,"I think that was just natural. I've always to make pop music and I've just slowly been working on getting there on my records. Actually, at the time, I thought my first two releases were pop records but it's only now that I realized that I was just crazy!"
Interviewer,You're a musician and a producer but you've expressed more interest in producing. What does the future hold for Grimes?
Grimes,"I definitely want to make at least two more albums after this but I just don't want to be a touring musician when I'm 30 years-old. It's a crazy life, I'll just be so haggard! I probably have 11 more records in me but maybe two or three more records that I'm willing to tour. I'd rather recede into the background. I'm getting really interested in film and I can't afford to go to film school but I'd like to somehow be a filmmaker or producer of pop songs or something. I want to finish my records for 4AD and do a really good job, build the concept of Grimes because it's a brand and just expand that into other arts and bring in other people later on and be able to work on things where I don't actually have to look nice or be charismatic because those are things I don't like doing."
Interviewer,Do you feel like you always have to look nice?
Grimes,"Well, as of tomorrow, I'll be in Europe so I have to do all these photo shoots and stuff. When left to my own devices, I'll just wear my pajamas for weeks and not shower! I grew up with four brothers, I'm a huge tomboy so this whole fashion thing has just come out of the blue. It's really great but it's definitely like, fuck I have to always be presentable. I'd just rather be dirty, angry and alone in my room."
Interviewer,"Largely, the music writing that's out there about you is focused on how non-specific your sound is and how your influences are wide-ranging; the word ""ethereal"" is used a lot. Was that your intention?"
Grimes,"I mean, I think my sound is post-Internet. People my age had the Internet when they were kids. So I think I just had a really diverse musical background, but from a really young age. People who are 30 and older don't have that, they were raised with genres of music. But people my age had everything all at once, and that's why get Animal Collective and all these weird medley bands. Because genres are sort of disappearing, people just use bands as reference points. And if I were to describe my sound, I'd just say it's ""modern?""."
Interviewer,"But you obviously love singing, so who did you sing along to growing up?"
Grimes,"Christina Aguilera, you know, crap like that."
Interviewer,We all did. Who else?
Grimes,"Mariah Carey. I was really into Disney soundtracks, like Mulan and Pocahontas."
Interviewer,"When you're performing onstage, you're Grimes. How do you prepare? Is there a specific mood you channel, or as soon as the music starts, it's immediate?"
Grimes,"It's different every time. Tonight, I was probably more caffeinated than is probably a good idea. Usually I drink a beer, take five lozenges, drink tea, and do a hundred or two hundred skips on the skipping rope, and then I go."
Interviewer,So now you're based in Montreal; why do think there's always so much groundbreaking music coming out of there?
Grimes,"Well I feel like Montreal's this sort of weird anomaly in Canada, because it's pretty hard to leave Canada economically, but all of the cities that provide metropolitan benefits are very expensive, like Toronto and Vancouver. But Montreal is really cheap so it's pretty much the best place to be if you're trying to be an artist, because you don't have to pay a lot of rent. Nobody I know has a steady job, at all. Nobody. And we all just work on art all the time, and it's really dark and depressing most of the year, so you work on art even more."
Interviewer,"So in the Montreal music scene, what's your everyday artist life like?"
Grimes,"Well I sort of lead a double life because I attend McGill University, or I recently got kicked out of McGill University for not attending. I was studying general Arts and Science degree, but I was in the electro-acoustics program, which is like psycho-physics, which I love. It's the physics of neuro-biology, specifically related to music, and I have a lot of really good friends who study that. And then I have my music friends; I live with Marilis, who's my publicist and is heavily involved in the label. My manager lives on my block; four of the apartments in my apartment complex of seven are people I know. It's a really close-knit community, and almost everyone on these few blocks are artists or graphic designers, because we live right on the cusp of a warehouse district."
Interviewer,You've suddenly gained a lot of momentum; what's that been like?
Grimes,"I think the big development for me was on our tour down at South by Southwest, because it was just too crazy, and I didn't go any the shows except the ones I was playing. The band I was playing with was called Doldrums, and the guy in that band had such a lucid philosophy about what music was and why we're doing it, and I was kind of getting stressed about press, and things getting weirder. I had to restructure my ideas about why this is necessary why this is a good thing, and that I do really want to do this. Also finding a balance between pop music and my background, which is goth, metal, and industrial. I used to play smoky warehouse parties to lots of drunk people at midnight, and I don't want to lose that."
Interviewer,How did you start playing those parties?
Grimes,"I moved to Montreal before I started playing music. I was 17 or 18; as soon as I graduated from high school, I just left Vancouver. I guess because people perceived my first two records as dance records, which they're not, at all, but I kept getting asked to play these parties. But I didn't know how the hell to play music live so I'd play weird ambient stuff, and people would be like, ""What the fuck?"" So I started playing more dance-oriented music. I think that's why my sound is a lot more upbeat now."
Interviewer,And now you're opening for Lykke Li? What's that like?
Grimes,"Pretty crazy. It's pretty intense. I've not played for this many people in my life. This is a really big jump, because I only just started playing music. I have no idea what I'm doing. It's psychologically intense, but I think it's important to do things that you're not ready to do, because you'll just get better and better."
Interviewer,"Since this life is fairly new, how do you wind down or return from having to suddenly play at Webster Hall or be away from home for stretches of time?"
Grimes,"We chill out, drink, well, I can't really drink. All the things that make me happy, I can't do because they wreck my voice, like eat yogurt and smoke weed."
Interviewer,"Because you're still figuring out life as a musician, what other aspects of your life have influenced your sound?"
Grimes,"I've always had this problem where I'm just a little too crazy to deal with academic life while being an intensely academic person, and the I kind of had a breakdown a couple years ago and was homeless in America."
Interviewer,Where do your songs come from? You sound upset in a lot of them.
Grimes,"Yeah, they're mostly from a place of me being really upset, and weirdly, that's probably why they sound really happy a lot of the time. haha I've always had this need to constantly be putting something out. I did ballet for 11 years, and then after that, really intense into visual arts, and now I'm really intense into music. But this is the one that I feel most connected to. It's very escapist for me, but at the same time it's not about avoiding reality, I want to make things more real, but not always have to deal with the crap in my life, if that makes sense?"
Interviewer,Is there anyone you're really interested in working with?
Grimes,"I'd really like to work with Physical Therapy, I think he's super sick."
Interviewer,Anyone else?
Grimes,Anybody? Nicki Minaj!
Interviewer,Does it ever get lonely not having a band?
Grimes,"There's definitely solitary aspect to not having a band, and there are times when I wish that I did. Ultimately, this is something I would really need to do on my own; I couldn't work with anyone else, I think, it's really personal project. And I like that fact that I can be lying in bed trying to sleep and then getting up at two in the morning and recording. That's big for me. I need the control and spontaneity, and not have to rely on anyone, and not have anyone rely on me."
Interviewer,How did you meet?
Grimes,We have all the same friends.
Interviewer,Were those early incarnations of d'Eon and Grimes?
Grimes,I guess. You played traditional Eastern music....
Interviewer,"Yeah, I was playing Tibetan music at the time...."
Grimes,"And I was just like, it was Blue Hawaii but it was me instead of Raf."
Interviewer,"On the bill you were listed as Claire-slash-Alex, and not Grimes, and this was right before your first tape came out. And I was playing with my buddy under the name Hassan I Sabbah X."
Grimes,But I thought it would just be like B-sides and no one would ever hear it... it kind of is B-sides.
Interviewer,"Both of our labels were just like, ""Yeah we wanna get in on this!"" and decided to release it properly."
Grimes,We jammed twice. The first one we smoked a lot of weed and it was really good... second one not so good.
Interviewer,"We don't jam with other people very much, so... that's why we did the split, rather than a collaboration, because it would just be too stressful to compromise both of our ."
Grimes,Probably play shows. Remixes would be good. I was going to sing for you....
Interviewer,"Yeah, I definitely want to write some vocal music for her. There are certain things that I want to do vocally that I can't do, and I'd have to get someone like Claire to sing."
Grimes,"I like the idea of someone writing a song and me singing it. I do that with Devon, from upstairs Majical Cloudz."
Interviewer,When were the tracks on the split recorded? Were they B-sides to your respective 2010 albums?
Grimes,"Mine is post-'Halfaxa', but... I don't know what I did, why I wasn't writing music. I've since written an album, since the split, but for some reason I had nothing for it."
Interviewer,For me it was definitely all new....
Grimes,"A lot of mine was from Christmas break, in Vancouver."
Interviewer,"All my stuff was made for the split. Over six months to a year, when I was recording 'Palinopsia', I was thinking on the side, maybe I should do something for this split that might happen someday. I made like four tracks, and then you made some tracks, and then we scrapped those and made some more...."
Grimes,Yeah we went through so much crap.
Interviewer,So there's probably at least twenty songs.
Grimes,B-sides for b-sides.
Interviewer,"My side was basically done in January. I did those four songs really quick, because I wanted it to go together, as parts."
Grimes,"I decided I'm going to be a video director. I think music videos are really important, and you can approach them the same way as you approach a song. For me, it doesn't need a narrative, it can just be an abstract representation of a sonic piece, rather than like, a film. I really wanted to do something that was... kind of impish... J-pop feel, but also kind of creepy."
Interviewer,They seem like two parts of a whole.
Grimes,I just wish we could have used the same camera for both though.
Interviewer,"But it's kind of cool, it's a little more DIY."
Grimes,I like that yours is DIY....
Interviewer,"Claire and Sadaf, who did the photos for the cover, are mostly responsible for the visual stuff, because I'm not really a visual artist and I don't have that sort of eye. But I'm really glad we used that photo for the album cover. It's weird, a lot of people in this sort of circle of music don't really use their faces."
Grimes,We want to bring back the pop star. Like an Alicia Keys cover where it's just her face.
Interviewer,"I am a little wary of having my face on the internet, but it is a little more distinctive just to have somebody's face instead of some abstract art."
Grimes,I think it's necessary.
Interviewer,"I kind of look like a metalhead, or a junkie, or a hippie or whatever, none of which I am. I like that cognitive dissonance, because you hear some of the songs and you think, ""This guy sounds like Phil Collins or Ashanti,"" but then you see the video and you're maybe like ""Who the fuck is this guy?"" I like not looking like my music."
Grimes,The photos are almost distastefully high contrast.
Interviewer,"Yeah, knowing what you look like it's hard for me to dissociate, but to some person, the people on the cover might not be you."
Grimes,"Same with Single Ladies! There's a visual catchiness. Humans like to look at people are there any really famous landscape paintings? Music is about humanity. I like pop stars because you can see who they are. Knowing who made something can make it a lot better, or a lot worse."
Interviewer,I think there is a rawness in the synchronized dancing in your  video in particular.
Grimes,"The actual production of that video was really intense and everyone got quite drunk... one girl puked. For everyone it was really nerve-wracking, but at the end we were really comfortable. It was a really long day. I wanted it to have this impish, we're-just-pulling-it-together quality, which it does kind of have, but then it's also got that...."
Interviewer,Sheen?
Grimes,It's got a sheen. I love the sheen. The guy who shot it  really knows what he's doing.
Interviewer,"Yeah, he's involved with fashion...."
Grimes,"He mostly does fashion stuff and that's why I like working with him, because he's turning Grimes into a fashion thing, and I really like that."
Interviewer,"Yeah that's part of the whole popstar culture now, with fashion. It used to be you could be a popstar look at Phil Collins...."
Grimes,Phil Collins all the time!
Interviewer,"I know... but he's a good example because in his videos he's wearing a sweater and some jeans... but now if you want to be a pop singer you have to always wear haute couture, avant garde, crazy shit."
Grimes,I love that.
Interviewer,"Claire, you're really into that angle but you  were talking about having a dissociation from your music what is your stance on it?"
Grimes,"I've been studying popstars... those songs, I feel are old though. I've moved far beyond that, in terms of like... me and my manager Seb went into the studio and then we mixed everything, and he basically taught me everything is still bedroom, but we replaced a lot of the drums in the studio, put effects on the vocals. Seb made me... he was like, ""we're mixing the vocals high"" and I was like  ""no, I'm so scared... "" but now I love it, I just had to get over that fear of hearing myself sing."
Interviewer,"For me too, I learned a lot from Seb. I don't know how to actually produce...."
Grimes,"No, everything is gained."
Interviewer,"It's a huge struggle for me because when I was really small to sixteen or seventeen, my whole life was classical piano. And I quit that almost ten years ago, but music theory is subconsciously ingrained in my mind. I can't help but follow the musical rules. I feel like a lot of producers especially in jungle or dubstep or hardcore... the reason it sounds so good is because you've got a bassline happening in C minor, but the vocals are in D major and it fits because it sounds really weird. If I want to do something like that, I have to make the conscious decision to...."
Grimes,It's so subtly weird.
Interviewer,"I've always thought of that song as being particularly sad, and really desperate and full of dread. It's not goodtime music, it's badtime music!"
Grimes,It's also goodtime music for me!
Interviewer,"Okay, personally it's badtime music. When I was making all of these songs I was insurmountably fucking unhappy, very angry, I was living in a room without a window... I was like, I hate everything that life is giving me...."
Grimes,The smell of sex.
Interviewer,"And really fucked up lyrics. A really good example of that is the Magnetic Fields. He had a few synthpop albums in the nineties that sort of sound like the Silly Kissers. All those songs are super sweet and schmaltzy, and chintzy and a little bit cheesy, but there's one lyric"
Grimes,"I like it when people are cocky... Tyler the Creator, Wiz Khalifa...."
Interviewer,They do have a self-deprecating element as well though.
Grimes,"I think about it a lot... I want to, but... I feel like any intention I have musically is very abstract... ahh, it's a struggle. It's much harder to mask what you're saying when  how to get a word that's that ""ooh"". It's hard to have that meticulous of an idea about enunciation when you're trying to construct vocal parts. I like a lot of consonants together, like in Eastern European languages. I sang one song in Russian, I've been putting a lot of things backwards...."
Interviewer,I wish I knew Arabic... all those glottal stops and guttural sounds....
Grimes,"None of them seem distasteful to us, I mean... when was drum & bass? It was the thing, it was in there. I went to some bad parties... everyone danced with a backpack on...."
Interviewer,"In high school, I was so into jungle, jungle mixtapes from people on the internet. It was so foreign and British and strange, and it comes out. I'm definitely going to make more tracks with jungle breakbeats... but I get a little miffed when people claim this is such-and-such a throwback. You can't not throw back."
Grimes,The world is finite... nobody I know listens to just one genre.
Interviewer,What's coming up for both of you?
Grimes,"I'm working on a full-length, which I kind of feel is my first album. I've had to travel and play a lot... there's not going to be any crap on this one."
Interviewer,Is that through Arbutus?
Grimes,Yeah. And I'm touring a lot.
Interviewer,"Let's talk about Visions first. You put up a tweet a couple days ago, a retweet of someone calling your music ""A sonnet to the bad future of the Japanese version of Sonic CD.""."
Grimes,Did I really write that?
Interviewer,"No, you just retweeted it."
Grimes,"I'll be honest, I had taken all my clonazepam when I crossed the border a few days ago because I didn't have a prescription. So, a couple days ago, for about 48 hours, I have no memory of."
Interviewer,What's the clonazepam for?
Grimes,"Eh, recreational.."
Interviewer,"Happens, I guess. Still, with what I mentioned in mind, especially with the general response to Visions, including tweets like this, what do you feel about it?"
Grimes,"It's super varied. I feel like there's a couple different types of Grimes fans that interpret it totally differently. So there's more the Lykke Li type fans, who are all, ""We like pop music."" And then there's sort of the more experimental fans that I feel like are more my peers."
Interviewer,"So, more the Lizzi Bougatsos fans."
Grimes,"Yeah, something like that. It's hard, I don't read any of my press. I really don't know what people think ... of my music except when I'm speaking with my friends and contemporaries because we all just throw stuff off each other. I feel like I'm out of the loop."
Interviewer,"Well, it's a good idea. You put your head into too much press, it just drags you in."
Grimes,"Yeah, and it sort of influences you. It's like when the hippie culture started getting sold back to the hippies. The Internet creates this ""idea"" of you that you then feel like you need to fit into. I just don't want to get sucked into that. I just never want to try to make music that sounds like my other music, or try to appease my fans. It shouldn't be about that."
Interviewer,"Going into production, what was your setup? I know you were doing this in your apartment...."
Grimes,"I was using a Roland Juno-G, Line 6 M9 vocal processor, and a BOSS VE-20 vocal processor. I used GarageBand, but I only used it for tracking. I use Logic now. I really need to make clear that I no longer use GarageBand."
Interviewer,"It's OK that you used GarageBand, especially if you used it for a demo or something."
Grimes,"But you can't export lossless, though. I feel like the record could have been more hi-fi."
Interviewer,Don't mind that.
Grimes,Ghosts.
Interviewer,"It's just a stage... And then suddenly, the doors open and people are looking at us and I'm all ""What the hell?""."
Grimes,There's always a number of state of minds. That general anxiety and constant self-evaluation/being totally out of my mind.
Interviewer,"Going back to setup, you mentioned a couple vocal processors. Do you have a certain preference for that?"
Grimes,I just felt that GarageBand didn't have good vocal effects.
Interviewer,"Well, that's obvious. You mentioned some specifics, I think it was a Line 6... ?"
Grimes,"Yeah. It's a guitar pedal actually, but still. At the time I made the record, I think I went crazy, because I didn't sleep for up to five or six days sometimes, and I was taking tons and tons of amphetamines. The whole thing is kind of like an insane prophetic glossolalic devotional piece or something."
Interviewer,"Speaking of your vocals, you seem to fluctuate a lot of the time in your tonality and inflection. What inspires you to do that?"
Grimes,"I just do what feels good. I don't try to think about it, really."
Interviewer,So it's more random and not some specific personality.
Grimes,"It's definitely not random. Music should just really be projected in a way that feels good. Not what the best thing to do is. I feel in the back of my head I know what the best thing to do is. I never sit down and and think, ""Now I'm going to sing like this,"" or, ""Now I'm gonna try and end like this."" It's always after the fact where I think, ""Well, my influences are really obvious here,"" or, ""I've listened to a lot this there and it comes through,"" da da da. Or occasionally, I'll be trying out stuff like... I remember seeing some interviews saying how Enya produces her own vocals, so I try to do a lot of that."
Interviewer,So you're big on singers like Enya and Elizabeth Fraser.
Grimes,"Yeah, Claire Hamill, too."
Interviewer,Does it bother you when people note or talk about your lisp?
Grimes,It used to. But I've gotten over it. I've accepted my fate.
Interviewer,"One thing I noted in looking over the artwork, there is this phrase in Russian  that translates roughly to ""But I warn you that this is the last time."" Is there any significance to that?"
Grimes,"I think it was, I just got a bit crazy with that record. I don't know, I just like to think about dying, whether or not I'm going to die. This record is, ""what if I died tomorrow?"" At the time I made the record, I think I went crazy, because I didn't sleep for up to five or six days sometimes, and I was taking tons and tons of amphetamines. The whole thing is kind of like an insane prophetic glossolalic devotional piece or something. But it's also obviously totally done in this pop way because that's what I know. That's how I interact with music."
Interviewer,So you're translating to fit within the language of the context?
Grimes,"I don't know if it's the past so much as the religious state of mind, if that makes any sense. Human beings are predisposed to complete irrationality or a desire to believe in something that is inexplicable, and potentially even devote themselves to that. That's what religion is, and what people have always fallen back on. I was raised in a super-Catholic environment. Now I'm not religious, but I do have the memory of how either a religious mindset or being religious works. A lot of my favorite composers and artists were really religious, and I think when you're creating art that isn't about your life, it's about a higher human consciousness or higher state of being that might not be human or might not be conscious. I think that's really beautiful. But then there's the fact that I play dance parties and exist totally on the Internet. I feel like I'm getting totally abstract here."
Interviewer,"No, no, you're fine. One thing to came to mind when I was coming over here was that you live in Montréal right now, I'm assuming Mile End or something like that...."
Grimes,"Yeah, I mean, I don't live anywhere right now, but when I did live in Montréal, I was on Parc and Van Horne."
Interviewer,"Anyway, before that, you were based in Vancouver. How much do these two places play off each other in terms of state of mind and this music?"
Grimes,"Well I think Vancouver was pretty formative for me, both in terms of the fact of being imbued in Asian culture and also nature. Also, the whole goth/industrial scene that was there when I was growing up kind of made me who I am, and caused me to identify as, ""I'm into music, I'm into alternative. That's me!"" Some stupid immature teenage shit, but at the end of the day, that's how I came to be."
Interviewer,You refer to Montréal in the past tense. Where do you intend to go after this tour?
Grimes,"Moving to Los Angeles, baby!"
Interviewer,"Going into your live setup, you've had Born Gold as sort of your backing band during this tour. Could you describe your current setup now in regards to that?"
Grimes,"On my end, the Juno-G, the two pedals... I make the backup vocals, obviously. My backup singers are my loop pedal, and my main pedal is for main shit. I also use an SP-404 sampler. I'm running my vocals through Cecil , who is doing more vocal processing. Calvin is playing electronic drums. Eric is extra keys plus noise plus I think some percussion. I let them jam because they're really good, so it's getting increasingly jammy."
Interviewer,So that's how you would describe working with them?
Grimes,"Definitely, like, super psychedelic and great. It's way better, I wish they were my permanent band, because they're fucking amazing. I start the set with me; I play two songs, then they come on, and it just makes everything so much bigger and better. People immediately start dancing when they come on stage because it's so much louder and  so much more percussion. They're good at that"
Interviewer,"And has that helped? If I recall these things correctly, you started out on your own."
Grimes,"I think it just makes me a lot more confident as a performer, because the audience isn't just focused on me. It's definitely a psychological thing. I'm going to be really depressed when I have to go back to not having a band."
Interviewer,Perhaps you should start one again.
Grimes,"Well, the kind of people I want to be in my band have priorities. The kind of people I want to contribute something cool to the live set are doing their own shit. I can't ask them to, and I don't want to just pay for session musicians, because I want someone who's going to do something weird."
Interviewer,"I wanted to talk a little bit about your artwork. Going over interviews and other things, you seem to emphasize using black-ink drawings in your art. What put you to that?"
Grimes,"I just have a real history with comics. I used to work at Drawn and Quarterly. My mom used to be a comic book publisher. So I'm just, deep in my heart, a super comic nerd. I'm also a Charles Burns fan. You can definitely see in my work he's a huge influence for me. But I'm also totally obsessed with Hieronymous Bosch at the same time. So my thing is bringing together super medieval panoramic shit through a Charles Burns-ish filter, and then making it really psychedelic, and super feminine and violent and scary. I forgot what we were talking about, sorry if I'm rambling."
Interviewer,Any particular comics you enjoy right now?
Grimes,"I'm actually opposed to comics right now. I have a very complex relationship with comics, but as of right now, I'm opposed to comics. But they still influence me a lot."
Interviewer,I wonder why....
Grimes,"It's because I've been drawing since I was little and that was just my style. I mean, I started drawing because I was trying to imitate anime, and then I got into Dan Clowes and guys like that."
Interviewer,"And how would you say that incorporates into your other work, say your music and production?"
Grimes,"I don't think it incorporates because it's all from the same brain I feel like there's a feeling that exists in all the work that I do, whether it's my art or my music or my video art."
Interviewer,"Going back to something you mentioned briefly intending towards a feminine ideal, is there something specific you go for, or is it just general?"
Grimes,"I guess I just feel like a lot of women who consider themselves experimental musicians don't want to embrace traditional ideas of femininity. I mean, I do think it's a construct in a lot of ways, but I don't think that makes it not beautiful. So there's a lot of things I do, like imitating Mariah Carey and Beyoncé and stuff like that. And I think they are really beautiful and strong examples of powerful, gorgeous, and hyper-feminine (if in a cookie-cutter sort of way) figures. But I like to take aspects of that aesthetic that are really great and funnel them through noise music and stuff like that. The idea of the pop star really does appeal to me, even though I want to do it in a different way."
Interviewer,"I just read the other day, you did a track for Cadence Weapon titled ""88."" How did that come about?"
Grimes,"He actually took the track ""Eight"" off Visions and cut it up and reproduced it. However, I would produce for him in a second. I made some remixes for him that he hasn't put out and I don't know why."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I heard he's trying to do a once a week thing like the Flaming Lips."
Grimes,"Well, he hasn't put out anything in three years because his label is super aggressively not letting him do shit. He has so much music, like gigs of unreleased music, and he should start putting it out. I think he's just sick of being trapped by his label."
