OUR FIRST GUEST IS ONE OF THE

MOST TALENTED MEN IN THE WORLD.

HE IS A MULTI-AWARD-WINNING

RECORDING ARTIST, FASHION

DESIGNER AND SHOE SALESMAN.

HIS NEW ALBUM IS CALLED "YE."

PLEASE WELCOME KANYE WEST.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

FIRST OF ALL -- THANKS

FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR

THE SHOES.

NOBODY EVER BRINGS ME SHOES, YOU

BROUGHT ME SHOES, THAT'S VERY

NICE OF YOU, VERY KIND.

I'LL TELL YOU A STORY AND THIS

IS HONESTLY TRUE.

THE LAST TIME, A FEW YEARS AGO

YOU SENT ME A PAIR OF YEEZYS.

I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD MORE

PEOPLE COME UP AND TALK TO ME

THAN WHEN I WAS WALKING AROUND

IN THEM TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS

LIKE, THIS IS CRAZY, I'VE GOT TO

GET THESE OFF, PEOPLE ARE

CHASING ME.

I'M WORRIED PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

BEAT ME UP AND TAKE THESE.

USUALLY PEOPLE WAIT -- I'VE SEEN

THEM SLEEPING ON THE STREET

WAITING FOR THESE SHOES.

IS THAT FOR YOU MORE REWARDING

THAN HEARING PEOPLE SAY THEY

LIKE YOUR MUSIC?

BOTH.

IT'S BOTH, YEAH.

SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE THE THING

YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO HEARING

AND YOU START HEARING SOMETHING

ELSE, AND IT'S MORE EXCITING TO

HEAR SOMETHING ELSE.

BUT NOT FOR YOU.

YEAH, WHEN YOU GO OUT AND DO

CREATIVE JOURNEYS, IT IS

EXCITING FOR PEOPLE TO

APPRECIATE THAT.

YEAH.

ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE, YOU

KNOW, DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS

POSSIBLE.

LIKE WHEN I STARTED OFF IN

CHICAGO AS AN ARTIST.

AS A -- I'M A VISUAL ARTIST, I

WENT TO ART SCHOOL.

RIGHT.

AND I DECIDED TO START DOING

MUSIC AND PEOPLE SAID IT

WOULDN'T WORK OUT.

THEN I STARTED PRODUCING AND

SELLING BEATS AND I STARTED

SELLING BEATS TO JAY-Z, ROCKA

FELLA AND THAT WENT WELL.

I SAID I WANTED TO RAP AND

PEOPLE SAID THAT WOULDN'T WORK,

PRODUCER RAPPER, IT MEANT YOU

WOULDN'T RAP AS WELL AS THE REAL

RAPPERS.

THAT STARTED WORKING OUT.

I SAID I WANTED TO DESIGN CLOSES

AND THAT STARTED WORKING OUT.

WHAT'S THE NEXT --

WHAT IS NEXT FOR YOU?

WELL --

SPACE FORCE?

[ LAUGHTER ]

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

I WOULD TOTALLY BE INVOLVED.

YOU SHOULD DESIGN THE

UNIFORMS FOR THE SPACE FORCE.

[ LAUGHTER ]

IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD

DO IF PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED YOU

TO DO THAT?

I'M INTO DESIGNING.

YEAH, WHY NOT.

[ LAUGHTER ]

YOUR WIFE WAS HERE LAST WEEK --

SPACE FORCE!

OH MY GOODNESS.

SOMEBODY PUT A LEASH ON HIM,

WILL YOU?

YOUR WIFE WAS HERE LAST WEEK.

AND SHE'S VERY NICE.

AND SHE DID SOMETHING I WOULD

IMAGINE YOU'RE VERY PROUD OF.

SHE WENT TO WASHINGTON, SHE

SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT, AND SHE

ACTUALLY CONVINCED HIM TO GRANT

CLEMENCY TO A WOMAN WHO GOT LIFE

IN PRISON, LIKE REAL LIFE IN

PRISON, FOR A FIRST-TIME DRUG

OFFENSE.

WAS THAT SOMETHING YOU DISCUSSED

WITH HER BEFORE SHE DID IT?

SHE'S SUPER PASSIONATE ABOUT

IT.

AND IT WAS AMAZING FOR TO SEE

THAT DREAM COME TRUE.

WERE YOU EVER

CONCERNED ABOUT HER BEING ALONE

IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH

PRESIDENT TRUMP?

[ LAUGHTER ]

WELL, HE IS A PLAYER.

[ LAUGHTER ]

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

PEOPLE GOT REALLY MAD

WHEN YOU WERE -- WELL, SOME

PEOPLE WERE VERY HAPPY WHEN YOU

SAID YOU LIKED PRESIDENT TRUMP.

DO YOU LIKE -- DO YOU THINK HE

IS A GOOD PRESIDENT?

YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME -- CAN

I ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION?

ANSWER WHATEVER YOU

WANT.

WELL, YOU KNOW -- IT'S FUNNY,

YOU KNOW.

IN THIS WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN,

THERE'S TWO MAIN MOTIVATING

FORCES.

AND I TWEET ABOUT IT ALL THE

TIME.

IT'S LOVE OR FEAR.

AND YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN LOVE.

YOU KNOW, MY COUSIN IS LOCKED UP

FOR MURDER.

AND I LOVE HIM.

SO HE DID A BAD THING BUT I

STILL LOVE HIM.

AND JUST AS A MUSICIAN,

AFRICAN-AMERICAN, GUY OUT IN

HOLLYWOOD, ALL THESE DIFFERENT

THINGS, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE

AROUND ME TRIED TO PICK MY

CANDIDATE FOR ME.

AND THEN TOLD ME EVERY TIME I

SAID I LIKED TRUMP THAT I

COULDN'T SAY IT OUT LOUD OR MY

CAREER WOULD BE OVER, I'D GET

KICKED OUT OF THE BLACK

COMMUNITY BECAUSE BLACKS ARE

SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MONOLITHIC

THOUGHT, WE CAN ONLY BE

DEMOCRATS AND ALL.

SO -- EVEN WHEN I SAID IT RIGHT

BEFORE I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL

AND I EXPRESSED MYSELF, AND WHEN

I CAME OUT I HAD LOST MY

CONFIDENCE.

SO I DIDN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE

TO TAKE ON THE WORLD AND THE

POSSIBLE BACKLASH.

AND IT TOOK ME A YEAR AND A HALF

TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO STAND

UP AND PUT ON THE HAT.

NO MATTER WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES

WERE.

AND WHAT IT REPRESENTED TO ME IS

NOTHING ABOUT POLICIES BECAUSE

I'M NOT A POLITICIAN LIKE THAT,

BUT IT REPRESENTED OVERCOMING

FEAR AND DOING WHAT YOU FELT, NO

MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAID, IN

SAYING, YOU CAN'T BULLY ME.

LIBERALS CAN'T BULLY ME, NEWS

CAN'T BULLY ME, THE HIP-HOP

COMMUNITY, THEY CAN'T BULLY ME.

AT THAT POINT, IF I'M AFRAID TO

BE ME, I'M NO LONGER YE.

THAT'S WHAT MAKES YE.

I ACTUALLY QUITE ENJOY WHEN

PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE MAD AT ME

ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS --

YOU MUST ENJOY IT,

YEAH.

[ LAUGHTER ]

I ACTUALLY QUITE ENJOY IT.

BECAUSE YOUR WIFE WAS

MAD AT YOU, RIGHT?

ACCORDING TO YOUR SONG, YOUR

WIFE WAS UPSET ABOUT THAT.

RIGHT OR WRONG, OR EVEN IF I

CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT IT OR

THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE, WHICH I'M

NOT SAYING I DID -- JUST PLACE

THE THOUGHT OUT THERE THAT

EVERYONE'S BAD THINKING

SOMETIMES.

GALILEO, THEY WENT TO CHOP HIS

HEAD OFF FOR SAYING THAT THE

EARTH -- WHAT DID HE SAY?

THE SUN REVOLVED AROUND THE

EARTH?

VICE VERSA.

RIGHT.

SO WHEN YOU HAVE MODERN --

BUT THE SUN --

I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE

SPECIFICS, SIR.

[ LAUGHTER ]

RIGHT, RIGHT.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

DO YOU EVER REGRET

ANYTHING YOU SAY?

OR IS IT JUST -- YOU LOOK AT IT

LIKE, HEY, I PUT IT OUT THERE,

IT'S OUT THERE, THERE'S NO POINT

IN REGRETTING IT?

I THINK PEOPLE FOCUS TOO MUCH

ON THE PAST AND FOCUS TOO MUCH

ON REGRET.

EVEN LIKE WHEN YOU DEAL WITH

SCHOOLS.

LIKE YOU TAKE LIKE THE SLAVE

IDEA.

MY POINT IS, I'VE HEARD OF

HISTORY CLASS.

I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A CLASS THAT

BREAKS DOWN HOW YOU, YOU KNOW,

BALANCE A CHECKBOOK OR HOW YOU

CONTROL YOUR FINANCES, WHICH MY

FATHER NEVER TAUGHT ME THAT.

AND I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A FUTURE

CLASS.

SO THEY KEEP US SO FOCUSED ON

HISTORY THAT WE START TO BELIEVE

THAT IT ACTUALLY REPEATS ITSELF.

AND WE BECOME OVERLY

TRADITIONAL.

AND WE CAN'T ADVANCE AS A RACE

OF BEINGS.

WE GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE PAST

AND WHAT EVERYONE'S SAYING AND

WHAT EVERYONE'S TWEETING.

AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO

BE FEARLESS ENOUGH TO BREAK THE

[ BLEEP ] SIMULATION.

WHEN I SAY SIMULATION, THAT'S

WHAT I MEAN BY SIMULATION.

SORRY, I KNOW YOU GUYS WANTED TO

CLAP BUT EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO

SAY IS GOING TO BE AMAZING.

[ LAUGHTER ]

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

HERE'S THE IDEA WHY YOU'RE IN A

SIMULATION.

LET'S START WITH ACTING, FIRST

OF ALL.

A 2-YEAR-OLD SCREAMS AT A

RESTAURANT, THE ENTIRE

RESTAURANT SCREAMS, TEACH THAT

KID HOW TO ACT.

WE'RE ALL UNPAID ACTORS IN SOME

GIANT SCRIPT THAT WE DIDN'T

WRITE.

SIMULATION.

A 2-YEAR-OLD JUMPS ON A COFFEE

TABLE AND SOMEONE SAYS, THAT'S A

COFFEE TABLE, DON'T JUMP ON

THAT.

SO IT WENT FROM BEING SOMETHING

THAT MAKES HIM FEEL LIKE

SUPERMAN, HE'S GOT HIS CAPE ON,

TO SOMETHING WHERE HE HAS TO

THINK ABOUT IN THE PERSON'S LIKE

A FAMILY MEMBER, HE'S 2 YEARS

OLD, DOESN'T GIVE A [ BLEEP ]

ABOUT A COFFEE OR A TABLE.

HE'S STARTING TO LIKE CALCULATE

ALL THESE THINGS.

BY THE TIME YOU'RE 40 YEARS OLD

YOU'VE GOT A WALL FULL OF COFFEE

TABLES CALCULATING YOU INTO

CLA

TRAFFIC, CALCULATING YOU INTO

YOUR CAREER CHOICE, CALCULATING

YOU INTO THIS TOWNHOUSE THAT'S

NOT QUITE AS BIG AS THE

TOWNHOUSE NEXT AND IT JUST NEVER

WORKS.

THAT'S THE SIMULATION THAT I'M

TALKING ABOUT.

THAT'S WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY

SIMULATION.

I THINK I UNDERSTAND

WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

BUT I MIGHT NOT.

BUT ALSO MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T WANT

THE KID TO GET HURT JUMPING ON

THE COFFEE TABLE, YOU KNOW?

WE ARE TOO PROTECTIVE.

WE ALWAYS DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO

GET HURT.

CAN YOU IMAGINE ME TALKING TO MY

PUBLICIST BEFORE I SAY I'M GOING

ON TV AGAIN?

[ LAUGHTER ]

[ APPLAUSE ]

YOU SHOULD BE WEARING

A HELMET.

I'M GOING ON TV BECAUSE IT'S

AWESOME.

I LOVE JIMMY.

WE CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE

PRESIDENT AND NOT A DIATRIBE,

YOU KNOW.

IT'S LIKE WE CAN -- I GOT THAT

FROM SARAH JESSICA PARKER.

IS THAT RIGHT?

YES.

[ LAUGHTER ]

SHOUT-OUT.

SHOUT-OUT.

BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK

GETS MISSED ON TMZ IS THE MAIN

THING I WAS STRESSING IS THE

IDEA OF TRYING LOVE.

YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALWAYS, YOU

KNOW -- PUSHING OUT SO MUCH HATE

AND LOVE CAN CURE SO MUCH.

JUST TO THINK, AM I MOVING IN

LOVE?

IS THIS OUT OF LOVE?

NOT OUT OF PRIDE.

PRIDE IS A WORD PEOPLE SAY IN A

POSITIVE CONNOTATION, BUT IT'S

ACTUALLY ONE OF THE SEVEN DEADLY

SINS.

IT TAKES TOO MUCH OWNERSHIP.

YOU CAN REPLACE PRIDE WITH LOVE.

AND WHEN I SEE PEOPLE JUST EVEN

LIKE GO AT THE PRESIDENT, IT'S

LIKE, WHY NOT TRY LOVE?

FOR ONE PERSON TO STAND UP

AGAINST ALL ODDS AND JUST HUG

SOMEBODY THE WAY THAT ALICE

JOHNSON HUGGED HER FAMILY WHEN

SHE GOT OUT OF JAIL.

THAT ONE BY ONE BY ONE WE CAN

DEFUSE THIS NUCLEAR BOMB OF HATE

THAT WE'RE IN AS A SOCIETY BY

THINKING OF EVERYONE AS OUR

FAMILY.

AND HOW WOULD WE TREAT OUR KIDS?

HOW WOULD WE TREAT --

IPY THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL

THOUGHT BUT IN LITERAL TERMS

THERE ARE FAMILIES BEING TORN

APART AT THE BORDER OF THIS

COUNTRY.

THERE ARE LITERALLY FAMILIES

BEING TORN APART AS A RESULT OF

WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS DOING.

AND I THINK THAT WE CANNOT

FORGET THAT, WHETHER WE LIKE HIS

PERSONALITY OR NOT, HIS ACTIONS

ARE REALLY WHAT MATTER.

I MEAN, YOU SO FAMOUSLY AND SO

POWERFULLY SAID, GEORGE BUSH

DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.

IT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT MAKES

YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP

DOES, OR ANY PEOPLE AT ALL?

WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK, WE'LL

COME BACK, AND KANYE WEST IS

HERE!

HIS ALBUM IS CALLED "YE."

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

KANYE WEST.

WE JUST GOT THIS MAGAZINE.

"BAZAAR" MAGAZINE.

THERE YOU ARE WITH THE KIDS.

THEY'RE VERY, VERY CUTE.

CLIMBING ON YOUR HEAD.

DO YOU DRESS THEM?

DO YOU DRESS THEM?

DO YOU PICK THEIR OUTFITS?

UH-HUH.

YOU DO?

IS THAT FUN FOR YOU?

UH-HUH.

DO YOU DESIGN OUTFITS

FOR THEM?

UH-HUH.

YOU DO.

[ LAUGHTER ]

DO THEY LOVE THAT?

YES.

DO THEY UNDERSTAND

THAT PROCESS, THAT YOU DRAW

SOMETHING AND IT BECOMES THEIR

CLOTHES?

MY DAUGHTER WENT TO A FASHION

CAMP FOR FIVE DAYS A COUPLE

WEEKS AGO.

AND I VISITED HER, AND WE PUT --

TOGETHER WE PUT THE THREAD

THROUGH THE SEWING MACHINE.

AND IT REALLY BROUGHT ME TO

TEARS TO THINK ABOUT THE 15

YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

APPAREL AND FOR MY FRIEND VIRGIL

TO BE THE HEAD OF LOUIS VUITTON,

FOR ME TO HAVE THIS, YOU KNOW,

$1.8 BILLION COMPANY OUT OF, YOU

KNOW, A THREAD GOING THROUGH.

AND SHE -- MY DAUGHTER ASKED ME,

DADDY, DO YOU HAVE A SEWING

MACHINE LIKE THIS AT YOUR

OFFICE?

AND I BROUGHT HER TO MY OFFICE.

AND SHE DID A BUNCH OF SKETCHES.

AND MY HEAD PATTERN CUTTER MADE

HER DRESSES RIGHT THERE.

REALLY.

FOR HER.

SO SHE LOVES COMING TO THE

OFFICE AND DOING SKETCHES.

BOY, THAT'S SO MUCH

MORE FUN THAN MY DAD'S OFFICE.

[ LAUGHTER ]

ONE OF THE SONGS ON YOUR ALBUM

IS ABOUT -- YOU'RE IN THE SONG,

CORRECT ME IF I HAVE ANY OF THIS

WRONG.

YOU'RE IMAGINING YOUR DAUGHTER

AS AN ADULT DATING AND MEN

LOOKING AT HER.

UH-HUH.

AND YOU'RE VERY, VERY

WORKED UP ABOUT THIS.

UH-HUH.

PREMATURELY SOME MIGHT

SAY.

DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

YOU THINK THAT FAR AHEAD?

OH, I THINK LIFETIMES AND

LIFETIMES AHEAD.

AND THAT -- AND YOU

ACTUALLY ARE IMAGINING LIKE GUYS

OBJECTIFYING -- DO YOU FEEL LIKE

YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS WOMEN HAS

CHANGED SINCE HAVING DAUGHTERS?

NAH, I STILL LOOK AT PORN

HUB.

[ LAUGHTER ]

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

WHAT KIND OF STUFF DO

YOU LOOK AT, WHAT CATEGORIES?

[ LAUGHTER ]

BLACK IS MY FAVORITE

CATEGORY.

YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO

INTO THAT.

[ LAUGHTER ]

I MEAN, YOU CAN IF YOU WANT.

HEY, I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT

OF BEING KANYE WEST IF YOU

CAN'T?

YEAH, LET'S HAVE IT.

A LOT OF BLACK ON WHITE,

OBVIOUSLY.

OH, YEAH.

[ LAUGHTER ]

IT'S MIRRORING YOUR OWN SELF,

YOUR OWN SITUATION.

MY OWN REALITY.

RIGHT.

IT'S LIKE BUBBLY MASTURBATING IN

A WAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

[ LAUGHTER ]

I NEED THAT DOUBLE --

I'LL SHOW YOU AFTER

THE SHOW.

[ LAUGHTER ]

NO, I DON'T WANT TO.

YOU HAVE SOME REALLY

HEAVY SONGS.

ONE OF THEM IS CALLED "I THOUGHT

ABOUT KILLING YOU."

IS THAT SONG ABOUT SOMEBODY IN

PARTICULAR?

AND IS IT ME?

[ LAUGHTER ]

YOU KNOW, SOMEONE E-MAILED ME

AFTER THAT SONG CAME OUT AND

SAID THAT THEY HAD -- THEIR MOM

HAD PASSED AWAY AND THAT THEY

HAD TAKEN 60 PILLS.

AND THAT THEY TRIED TO KILL

THEMSELVES.

AND THEY WROTE AT THE END OF IT,

"PREMEDITATED MURDER."

SO IT'S --

AND THAT IS A REFRAIN,

YOU SAY PREMEDITATED MURDER.

THAT CAME FROM SOMEBODY WRITING

YOU?

NO.

AFTER THE SONG CAME OUT.

AFTER.

BUT SAYING THAT THIS PERSON

TAKING THESE PILLS AND TRYING TO

KILL THEMSELVES WAS A FORM OF

PREMEDITATED MURDER.

SURE.

AND WHAT I SAID IS LIKE,

PEOPLE ARE SO AFRAID TO FACE

WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DEALING

WITH, WHETHER IT'S OPIOID

ADDICTION, WHETHER IT'S SUICIDE,

WHETHER IT'S ALL THESE THINGS.

WE JUST WANT TO LIKE -- WE WANT

TO PUT A PATINA ON IT AND NOT

FACE IT.

AND I THINK THE BREAK THROUGH

FOR THAT ALBUM FOR ME -- I DON'T

DO OLD VERSIONS OF MUSIC, I'M

LOOKING TO DO SOMETHING NEW.

THE BREAKTHROUGH WAS TO BE ABLE

TO HAVE A SONG CALLED "I THOUGHT

ABOUT KILLING YOU" IN THIS LIKE

SUPER-PC, HOLLYWOOD, YOU CAN'T

SAY NOTHING WRONG DAY AND AGE.

IT'S LIKE, KANYE WEST'S FIRST

SONG 80 THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING

YOU" AND TAKE YOU THROUGH THE

THOUGHTS.

THE OTHER DAY I TWEETED HOW TO

NOT KILL YOURSELF PART 1.

WHEN YOU'RE AN ARTIST AND YOU'RE

CREATIVE AND YOU WANT TO GIVE SO

MUCH TO THE WORLD AGAINST ALL

ODDS THERE'S TIMES WHEN YOU CAN

GO INTO THAT PLACE.

CORRECT ME IF I'M

WRONG, BUT THE HOW TO WAS, DON'T

BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU

WANT TO KILL YOURSELF, RIGHT?

YES.

YEAH.

GOOD ADVICE.

THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE.

I WAS INSPIRED AFTER SEEING THIS

ALEXANDER McQUEEN FILM.

THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING

ARTIST THAT KILLED HIMSELF.

HE'D ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IT.

HE DESIGNED HIS OWN BASKET.

I THOUGHT ABOUT A TOMBSTONE THAT

SAID "ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?"

IT'S FUNNY BUT NOT

FUNNY, REALLY, THOUGH.

YEAH.

BECAUSE, YOU KNOW --

WHEN YOU HAVE THOUGHTS LIKE

THAT, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND

TALK TO PEOPLE.

YEAH.

BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL --

WELL, NOT BE CAREFUL.

JUST BE EXPRESSIVE AND

UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE

ARE SENSITIVE PEOPLE.

LIKE YOU GET THESE CELEBRITIES

AND THEY GET A BAD PHOTO AND

EVERYONE JUST TEARS THEM ALL THE

WAY TO SHREDS AND YOU FORGET

THIS IS A DAUGHTER, A SON, A

MOM, A DAD.

AND YOU KNOW, I THINK I FIGHT

FOR -- I FIGHT FOR ALL OF US.

YOU HAVE A LOT OF

EMPATHY, I GUESS, IF THAT'S THE

WAY YOU'RE THINKING.

I DO.

I DO HAVE A LOT OF EMPATHY.

YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

>WE'RE BACK WITH KANYE WEST.

THIS IS HIS ALBUM CALLED "YE."

A BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH.

YOU RECORDED THIS IN JACKSON

HOLE, WYOMING.

YOU PUT OUT FIVE OTHER ALBUMS

WITH OTHER ARTISTS THAT YOU

PRODUCED BASICALLY WITHIN LIKE,

WHAT, A MONTH-LONG PERIOD OF

TIME.

THAT'S A TON OF WORK.

ARE YOU LIKE -- ARE YOU A

WORKAHOLIC?

ARE YOU ALWAYS WORKING?

NO, I ACTUALLY SLEPT A LOT

DURING THE PROJECT.

WHILE THEY WERE

RECORDING?

YEAH.

I HAVE A TEAM, WE WORKED

TOGETHER.

I SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER

I GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

AND I WOULD GO TO AMOEBA RECORD

STORE AND START CHOPPING UP

SAMPLES.

IT'S VERY THERAPEUTIC BECAUSE I

WASN'T FULL YE -- I DON'T KNOW

IF I'M FULL YE NOW, BETTER OR

WORSE OR WHATEVER.

BUT IT WAS THERAPEUTIC JUST TO

LISTEN TO THOSE SONGS AND SAMPLE

AND GO BACK TO BEING 14 YEARS

OLD AT MY MOM'S HOUSE.

AND BY THE TIME IT'S TIME TO

DO -- TO PUT THE ALBUMS OUT, WE

HAVE A WHOLE TEAM AT YEEZY SOUND

THAT WILL HELP COME AND DO THE

DRUMS, HELP WITH LYRICS, HELP

WITH CHORUSES.

I HAD TO GIVE LIKE SIX, SEVEN

PEOPLE IDEAS THAT I WANT ON THE

SONG.

AND I'D JUST GO TO SLEEP AND

JUST WAIT FOR THEM --

THEM WORKING WHILE YOU

SLEEP, THAT'S A HARD WORKER

RIGHT THERE.

I FEEL LIKE YOU AVOIDED THIS

ALBUM TITLE.

OH, YEAH, I DON'T --

"I HATE BEING BIPOLAR, IT'S

AWESOME."

I HAVE A THEORY ABOUT YOU, TELL

ME IF THIS IS CORRECT.

I FEEL YOU FEEL BY BEING BIPOLAR

IS PART WHAT WAS MAKES YOU

BRILLIANT, PART OF WHAT MAKES

YOU YOU, AND YOU EMBRACE IT.

YEAH, I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER

ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE PEOPLE

ARE LIKE, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

TALK ABOUT IT?

THE FUNNY THING IS, THIS IS

SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE ON THE

INTERNET BEFORE.

IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY.

BUT IT'S NOT AN OPPOSITE.

IT'S NOT I HATE BEING BIPOLAR.

IT'S AWESOME.

IT ACTUALLY DRIVES MORE OF HOW

YOU REALLY FEEL.

IT DOESN'T DO THE OPPOSITE

THING.

I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT, YOU

KNOW -- OPEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

MENTAL HEALTH.

ESPECIALLY WITH ME BEING BLACK.

BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD THERAPISTS

IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.

WE NEVER APPROACHED LIKE TAKE A

MEDICATION.

I THINK IT'S GOOD WHEN I HAD MY

FIRST COMPLETE BLACKOUT AT AGE

5, MY MOM DIDN'T FULLY MEDICATE

ME.

BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE NEVER BEEN

YE.

AND THERE'S TIMES WHERE AT LEAST

I'M HAPPY THAT I KNOW.

LIKE EVEN LIKE FOR THIS

INTERVIEW, I KNEW I WANTED TO

STAY IN A EQUAL STATE.

BECAUSE BY THE TIME I GOT TO TMZ

I WAS RAMPED UP.

WHAT WAS AWESOME IS THE WORLD

GOT TO REALLY EXPERIENCE SOMEONE

IN A RAMPED-UP STATE.

AND THAT'S WHEN YOU GET THESE

COMMENTS THAT JUST SHOOT OUT,

ALMOST LIKE TOURETTE'S.

BECAUSE YOU HAVE HIGHS

AND LOWS.

WHEN YOU HAVE A HIGH, YOU'RE ON

A ROLL.

WHEN YOU HAVE A LOW, YOU'RE NOT?

WELL, THERE'S SOME CASES OF

BIPOLAR WHERE PEOPLE GO LOW.

I'M ONE THAT GOES HIGH.

I SEE.

LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA SAID, GO

HIGH.

[ LAUGHTER ]

?

YOU DON'T HAVE EXTREME PERIODS

OF DEPRESSION?

OH, NO.

BECAUSE I JUST SAY IT.

I SAY IT ON REAL TV.

OH, I THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING

MYSELF.

THEN THE THOUGHT IS GONE.

SO ALL PEOPLE NEED TO

DO IS GET ON TV, THAT'S REALLY

THE SOLUTION.

THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

EXPRESS THEMSELVES WITHOUT FEAR

OF JUDGMENT.

WHAT I LOVE TELLING PEOPLE IS

LIKE, WHO DO YOU KNOW -- YEAH,

ESPECIALLY BLACK MEN.

YOU KNOW, I'M 41 YEARS OLD.

AND I DON'T KNOW ANYONE, YOU

KNOW, THAT [ BLEEP ]ED UP AS

MUCH AS I HAVE THAT'S STILL AS

SUCCESSFUL.

I WANT TO PROVE THAT YOU COULD

GET FAT, YOU COULD SAY THE WRONG

THINGS, YOU CAN PISS A WHOLE

[ BLEEP ] CITY OFF --

AND BE PRESIDENT OF

THE UNITED STATES.

WELL -- YEAH.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

THERE'S ONE PERSON.

KANYE WEST, EVERYBODY.

THIS IS HIS ALBUM.

IT'S CALLED "YE."
