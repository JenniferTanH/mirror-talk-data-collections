[Music]

having the greatest of all time already

at 30 years old how the hell do you do

that I think tell me how the hell

do you go to being working as a plumber

not even a plumber yeah 12 hours a day

tell us about those really is to who you

are today were you one of the most I

just saw the other day I think he really

recognized the most 5th most recognized

athlete on earth 30 years old

they must have miscounted I'd say I'm

number one and number Five's not me you

know it's been and just what got me to

where I am and where I continue to go

and where I will continue to go is an

insane work ethic yes and it's an insane

work ethic that can only be you can only

put in that amount of work if you were

doing something that you are passionate

about and that's what I have engaged my

entire life's work in things that I am

passionate about you cannot you cannot

fully commit to something if you are not

passionate about it so you must look at

your surroundings that the things you

were involved in and ask yourself are

you truly passionate about these things

that you truly want to put every ounce

of your being into these things and I am

blessed

truly truly blessed by something I am

not sure what it is but I am blessed

that I was able to find my passions my

passion the fight game the whiskey game

the fashion game the fitness game these

are my true passions and I am going down

these these avenues that these these

avenues that the fight game has opened

up for me I'm going down them at a 100

mile an hour with no brakes and full

confidence in what lies ahead and and

great things are happening so I'm very

very blessed and very am very motivated

to still you know I'm like you said I'm

only 20 years of age Tony I have gone

through times in my in my in my young

career of lapses in motivation and

seeking that energy and well you know

coming into a place like this and

receiving an invite from yourself a

powerful man you were a powerful man we

are all powerful people here but you you

use your power not to boss like like I

have been thinking we should use our

power to lead never to boss and that's

what I'm trying to

my people around to lead and grow and

and and and and let's see what the next

30 years will bring because I've no

doubt it will be more amazing historical

things sure well where did the hell as

this confidence come from I mean tell us

about the earliest days there have to be

a time when you didn't have it

and where did shift cuz I know you like

me like so many people thought you have

a process of visualizing and

conditioning the mind and training

yourself but tell us what it was like in

the early days growing up what would

your lifetime Tony and I'm not supposed

to be here where I come from it's like I

said it's on my whiskey prop on him but

where I come from a place Dublin 12 it

is a hard-working town a small little a

little suburb a it has it's good and it

has plenty of bad but I always like to

focus on the good because the good

shines true but where I come from we're

not supposed to farm to these Heights

we're told that it's instilled in us and

I wanted to break that mold and paved

the way open up paths and that's what

I'm doing and I'm happy and honored for

it and you know when did it shift for

you though well you always like that or

it's a stage when you start to say I'm

gonna create my life I mean

we're gonna be a plumber I'm sure laughs

like I've heard you working 12-hour day

like driving two hours yeah yeah yeah

you know tell us tell us about those

humble beginnings

nobody else what you like today and then

how'd you make that transition brother

you know like driving on them to the

tours then building sites and I'm I'm

just a young kid I'm a four you know for

sure apprentice plumber on a building

site that a guy that goes to make the

tea the guy that goes and gets the the

the the copper pipes from the storehouse

and carries it up it's the it's the it's

the hard work that that's not respected

and not not admired or not you know so I

was on them building so it's cold and

damp and I was like looking around that

they fully fully qualified people on the

site and their postures not right in

there you know it did that was not me

you know I knew I could do something

better I knew I had something in me I

just wasn't sure even what it was I was

training for a fight game but no one in

Ireland had made it in the fight game

the fight game an Irishman in the UFC

was literally and I mean literally

laughed at we were laughed at

was laughs that when I when I said we

were gonna get to the you see myself on

my team we're gonna get to you see never

mind get a win never mind even get a win

in the UFC then win a belt then win the

second belt you know it's I've continued

I've just used all that that fuel that

I'm not supposed to do it but I'm gonna

do it and I'm gonna outwork everyone

that says I cannot do it and that's what

I did and that's how I rose open long

may it continue your fault yes man how

do you create the how did you do

this we showed a little video of you

when you're just a young kid do you know

yeah you young boy my older sister my

oldest sister you know my family is a

great family my I have a loving family

my mother my father my two sisters but

my lineage the McGregor lineage we are

bled on the battlefield we you can trace

my lineage back to the Highlands where

we fought invaders off of our land with

with our with our family saw at the

Claymore I saw the sword in your office

just early and I was wondering where

that sword was from I have my family

sword it's a claymore it's wrapped in

the attractants sheepskin and I have it

hanging on the banisters of my stairs

just to remind me of where I come from

and who I am we are warriors we are

fighters so my sister when I was a young

kid at around 15 years of age unsure

where I was going

came to me with a book the secret and

I'm preaching the law of attraction and

I was like stop get away from me you're

I'm only a young kid oh yeah I didn't

care about that I want to just go and

play you know it wasn't interested I was

almost laughing at it but then I she

kept on me with it and I eventually

watched a movie on it and read some

books on it and then it started to

resonate with me like to keep positive

and have belief in where you're gone and

and and you're able to you can almost

visually create your entire world no not

almost you actually can yes you can and

then I was like I'm gonna do that and I

will do that and then that's when I'd be

going to practice it I practice it I

used to drive we used to drive and my

girlfriend we used to drive to a food

place in like a shopping mall in Ireland

then it was a very

busy shopping mall and I don't like I

would practice like little parts of it

like when we were driving into the

shopping mall the chiropractor I would

always visualize that the car park space

right at the front door would be empty

for me waiting for us to pull up and

sometimes I get it and sometimes I

wouldn't get it you know but when I when

I got it I celebrated like I just won my

double world tire you know when I kept

building on that and and and I got

better at it and I became I became so

damn good at it that I was able to go

into bouts against undefeated fighters

for non not defeated for over ten years

or you know people with insane fighting

legacies and I was able to go in front

of the world and tell the world I'm

gonna knock this manner with this exact

shot at this exact time and I don't have

back to back to back and tell everybody

tell everyone I think that's a very

important thing it's easy for us to keep

it all in but you're not not you're not

on the line then all-in is a term I like

to use in my ventures all-in we've got

to be all in our adventures I am I'm all

in on my whiskey I'm all in on my

clothing my fitness my fitness regime

the McGregor fast program I am all in on

the fight game I'm I just want my wart

you know we're in there's a lot of

politics in the game the fight game is

full of sharks but I'm the whale

so I want what's mine and that's what

I'm gonna

I heard but even many visualize

language well again

yes see I was visualizing before I even

knew about it obviously soccer is huge

in Ireland than the UK and it was my

force law of most certainly I used to

sneak out of the house late at night and

it used to be a little grass patched by

my home and I would play I'd take the

football out and play on the grass patch

on my own and I would kick the ball

against the wall and when I kicked the

ball against the wall I would imagine it

was a goal the goal net and I scored a

goal and I would run off and I would

visualize a screaming arena cheering me

on

and they were my first visions of of

selling out arenas and and you know and

doing these type of things although

although it didn't end up in the

football game I ended up in a similar

one so it all worked out and it was all

true visual visualization so I was just

a young kid with a dream you know I mean

I know that sometimes my dreams change

and change but it was still a kid with a

dream and a belief in himself and for

many times I was laughed at not believed

in but you know what nothing external

can can can defeat the internal the only

thing that can take someone down or

break you down as internal nothing

external is strong enough it's just

about making sure your internal dialogue

and your internal belief in yourself is

strong enough that it can withstand the

external the external is there it's got

to accept it you've got to embrace it

you've got to understand and be aware of

it but don't let it seep into you into

your internal dialogue and and I am as a

two-year-old man I am I don't know at

all I am only I'm open down and grown

with this I'm trying to continue to

learn it's a daily daily occurrence not

to let that external infiltrate

infiltrate my internal and that's what

I'm trying to do right now because I

have let it infiltrate it at times how

do you keep it out what do you do I

think you know it's a daily team for me

I like you know I'm figuring out my

rituals the only reason the only

yesterday I was like every time I wake

now I put on a song I start every day

with it dance and feel myself Who am I I

Know Who I am I am an Irish animal a

proper Irish animal my career is a

career I've never been done before us no

Irish man has done what I have done I

open the pathways for my people we came

steaming

to the door thanks to my thanks to my

belief in my heart walk so that's yeah

people said you couldn't you couldn't

master the game with your own people and

I really had to come to America but you

took your own team you've been loyal to

you do you know what I do my project I

brought the game to Ireland I said I

would try this promotion back I put my

people on I put my nation on the map

although we are known as the Fighting

Irish in boxing in boxing terms we have

a rich history in boxing but not in

mixed martial arts true fighting a full

fight we had zero history zero impact

we were almost looked down upon the UK

scene had risen up there was cement

there was many stars of course the

Brazilians they invent they invented the

sport valet to door no-holds-barred

fighting then the Americans took it

franchise it into the UFC and built it

up to what it was so the Americans and

the Brazilians dominated the sport and

and then the UK was rising up and the

Irish were just the Irish but I I knew

more but no more exactly now now now my

nations flag is on the UFC belt they

released a new belt because what they do

is they're crafty Bunch the UFC I have

so much respect for therefore I love the

company I love I love all the people

involved but I need time I tip away they

try and reignite my interest and get me

back in there but they Dumas they they I

wound the two belts they're forced to

ever done at the for ever and still the

only to ever do it unified there's been

in from double champions but that's not

unified double champions I'm the only

unified chirp-chirp

Ted Cham Cham exactly exactly the og

champ champ but what they don't want

they they got rid of those old belts and

they created this new belt and they put

my flag on the new Bell selector playing

games with me but I'm playing games by

meanshe my buddy is saw from work we I

have my nutritionist we may have my

doctor with me I have my people with me

I track I am blessed to be able to do

that you know for so long like in my

late went to late twenties when I start

to acquire wealth and acquire Mooney I

was fascinated with materialistic things

I would buy myself cars watches I know

I'm speaking about that I big diamond

watch on my best this was actually a

gift but I I like I I switched off of

that now it's like I realized I was

spending things on material items or not

Kings on myself on my being on my

fitness on my health I've switched that

completely like I said my nutrition has

traveled to me full-time my doctor is my

training partners my coaches I have a

full team and it's all dude it's all for

health fitness and peak performance you

know God we've got to be in shape I

think a trait of the successful is to

train early wake up and train anyway

you've got to be successful you've got

to be you've got to be in shape yes to

be you know you've got to be in shape

physically to be in to be in shape

mentally they go hand in hand

yeah so I'm putting a lot more time into

that and I realized I actually actually

realized that it forced when I read it

on LeBron James he spent one point five

million dollars a year annually on

himself physical therapist masseuse

nutritionist trained all of that right

and you know what I seen that I said I

spent zero

I spent zero I just went to camp forms

when a fight forms I'll gather a team of

people we go into the Vegas desert lock

yourself away for ten weeks and doing

say insanity walk if I'm trying to back

at home during camp I have fighters

locked in in a hotel room waiting on

call to be called them to come and fight

me it's an insane game but it's not it's

it's it's not all in again I'll go back

to that Tim it's it's halfway in and

then you can't be that way and you

certainly cannot be that way in the

fight game but in reality you can't be

that way and any game you're in if

you're in the game make sure you're in

it all the way all in with it and then

that game will be your game and that's

that's where I am right now

and I've only kind of taken this

philosophy recently like I said I've had

dips lots of motivation Gibson in in

commitment and I'm figuring it all out

and I'm feeling good in a great place

and this meeting and this invitation

this is just you know because I'm

seeking inspiration I'm always looking

for inspiration looking to learn looking

to grow and honestly thank you but it's

not grateful for it and I look forward

to continuing this chat there's

absolutes time here too you know I love

your hat you know you are like you're

yourself completely but if there's any

athlete we could relate you - it's

probably Muhammad Ali yeah what did he

have an influence I had the privilege

getting to know him a bit he was just

believed about I saw the book you have a

little

in the submarine big respect Tony man

honestly I I know do your quest you were

interviewing me but I will I want to

interview you as well like your story is

insane it's crazy how you've risen up

and it's true that positive mind do that

conviction that's right commitment that

conviction and big respect like

admitting that you've been off your game

at times like so it was a
yeah so you talk with such

authority that some people assume you

just yeah but you don't tell me

about talking about trash talk

tell me how you Timah dated people and

tell me about was Ollie an influence yes

of course I ally was one of my forced

heroes in combat sport

I watched documentaries on him I read

books on him

even before I actually is a fully thing

even before I actually boxed I've been

boxing a fight in my whole life but even

before I engaged in combat sport I was

interested in like the wrestling side of

things which is a lot more show yeah and

then obviously Muhammad Ali was a

different animal because he was doing it

for real wrestling's not really for real

it's in enemy but Muhammad Ali was doing

for real and he was captivate the

audience he was entertaining and he had

passion and conviction and I was just a

young kid watching this and then what

got me into combat sport originally was

as I grew older and began venturing

outside my home and outside my estate

again like I said Dublin 12 it's a wild

L town you've got to be able to fight

you've got to be able to defend yourself

so when I would when I ventured out

conflict began happening and I wanted to

be prepared for that and be able for

that and confident it anyway man this is

this is like early early teens in like

11 12 did you were you a tough kid to

start with or did you become a tough kid

oh you know I just like I heard your dad

say you came out with I needed to I

needed to how much yes you know that's

that's false toughness the tough guy

does not last in this is in a real game

you know I mean that's that's false I

look at the tough guys back damn here

today now yeah not tough no more ain't

tough in their mother's box room you

know what I'm saying so am I was not

necessarily a tough growing up but I was

I was a hard worker and I was and I was

you know what I was smart that's what I

was that's what I was and wits beat

toughness

any day of the week and twice on Sunday

so I I knew what I needed to do I needed

to learn combat sport I needed to learn

martial arts gain confidence in in

surroundings and then rise up and that's

what I don't and your your psychological

warfare you know where you torture these

that was that a marketing

nice for you to or was it but does it

really feel like you penetrate their

mind and what is your mindset about you

know I simply you know coming up I look

at it's not trash talk to me although it

has in a way become that and what is it

really for you

I look at the opponent I look you know

you know know yourself to no order is

that's a Bruce Lee quote if you truly

know yourself you can know orders so I

know what way I feel I know what way

that man feels I know what I can say to

push his buttons I know I know what he's

thinking I know what he's afraid of I

know his worries and I and I am put them

in under the spotlight I put them out

there I get them thinking about it I

made a Jose Aldo an undefeated champion

yes the first UFC featherweight champion

he was 28 years of age at the time I

made him feel like he was an old man but

he was 28 years of age I went and I told

him what shot I was gonna knock him out

and I knocked him out with that shot so

so how much of the fight game is

psychological how much you know it's

it's all psychological to be honest

you've got to be able to control your

breathing and control your emotions in

there again like I said sometimes I've

been open down on it sometimes I've

riled up too much to and I've I'm only

young tone you know I'm still learning

and learning the game and I don't claim

to know what all but what I do know I

know it I'm well you know and I'm

continuing to learn and continuing to

push on and and that's where I'm at now

so tell us some moments when did you

like saying holy this when I

visualize has become real like on my own

life I know there have been certain

moments right give me a couple moments

the it just right now I'm

out you a blackguard we're in this big

like it what's this like a big mark here

we beat each other back this is

something else nice cream carpet on the

floor

nice pink August McGregor it's my own

line I know David August my business

partner has been dressing you for 30

years 25 he said tortilla is a 24

that'sthat's insane years myself and

Dave and their fashion is a big I enjoy

good clothes I always I always think to

myself exactly

again toplin 12 we are known we are

known to dress well I mean we might not

have the best money or the best sex you

know we can't afford a lot of things but

but we always would dress well and we'd

always be clean and that was up we were

proud of that my people were proud of

that yeah and I always think back to

where my where am I warmed from Mooney

came what made me interested in Mooney

my original you know how did my love for

Mooney begin all right you know what

made me want to acquire that yes and and

when I think about it I wanted to

acquire money so I could buy clean fresh

runners runners sneakers we call the

mooners back home sure but that's that's

where it began so fashion was always

instilled in me and I always talk at

night when I get I'm able to get up and

make some money I'm gonna splash out boy

the finest silks and the finest

materials are wear them proudly and

David I met David a couple of years ago

and you know the partnership has been

amazing we willing to get in there we

have our own line out the August

McGregor line we're on our second drop

now when it's grown really nice just

checking it out we've got you a funny

story about David I remember years ago I

lived in Del Mar California I don't let

Del Mar castles it's Castle both my

places in Europe and we had a fire and

the house burned down

Davison zombie clothing for like 10

years and like you know he's always

replacing it as you but literally we

burned up like $40,000 of the clothing

David company goes in the fight game

when were the moments in the fight game

were you like holy man what I

visualize is real like what there had to

be a couple moments that were the most

important to you you know to fight the

most important one for me the most

significant moment in my career was when

I forced tasted UFC gold it was

UFC 189 in Las Vegas I faced I was

supposed to face the corn champion Jose

Aldo but he pulled out nine days before

the belt would have broken rape someone

to a spinning back-kick on him and broke

his rib broke his rib it was more like a

bruised rib two and a half weeks before

my last fight I drew a front kick at a

shootin Moldovan wrestlers or shooting

wrestlers I kind of shooting in on your

legs yeah I mean he's shot like to the

front kick I true it at his belly and my

two toes the baby toe and the toe next

with bent back like this and stuck in

that position

my doctor who's here when we now had to

come into the cage stretch it and break

it back in the place my foot swelled

like a balloon that was two and a half

two story a fight I wanted to come I

wanted to compete and I want to take it

in there you know one of the things I'm

blessed with I have many shots in my

arsenal at many moves like a box I can

kick have many different weapons in my

in my in my arsenal so that's a blessing

and of course a blessing pretty obvious

I can throw many moves I can stifle an

opponent of course because if I faces a

serious injury where I probably should

have just settled it out reset the match

to a later date but your hunger made you

go by hunger and my my knowledge also

that if if I have one shot that's my

wound Liam that's gone I have another

seven limbs you know the act of eight

limbs this year so I can utilize your

strikes in my ass oh yeah tell me about

the last night we could be because I'm

curious were you prepared for that

approach dude were you able to fight

your fight tell me what you found out

different about this right I was there

by the way yes he literally jumped right

in front of us right on his brothers I

say today a lot of my student on my way

the fight went my way and trust me when

I tell you Tony this war is not over if

this fight does not happen again if it

does not get reset it's on them they're

running away I'm here for the fighting

here for the rematch I know the errors I

know like I said the lapses in

commitment that I've had in that belt I

know my mindset there was a lot of

external things obviously the injury the

what the injury itself led me to ha I

had to half my work I couldn't Road

wrong anymore I or as for we prepare I

wasn't my weight was too high so when

you're cutting weight if I if I can't

get my weight

because of injuries or what rot I have

an more intense wait could so I was

severely dehydrated I didn't sleep for

48 hours before the wait could but these

are all just nonsensical I don't know

that's why I walked in there hands down

ding ding ding and walk forward to him

and he went running away around the cage

he got lucky with that overhand right

drop me

well didn't really drop me I I landed on

my hand but I kept my vision my vision

was clear backed away jumped up landed

shots back and then we engaged in a

fistfight he tried to take it tricky

took me down again after landing

asserting a significant shot the fights

let's fight now instead he's was afraid

and grabs ahold of the leg so but my

whole approach in that camp

the injuries did non-commitment for you

were you trying the game tactics we were

I attack I am an attacker and my attack

defense but in this camp for some reason

the entire focus was defend defense so I

was like every round I would be every

round we would start in the training I

would be having my back against the

fence I would have my back on the floor

and I would always put myself in a

vulnerable position

and I'd be kept well as the camp went on

I'd be just came defensive defensive

well that's never been what idea was

like what like it still it irritates me

to this day because you know the trainer

plan is that I I trained with heavy

people 90 plus kilo I guess told you at

Moldova and wrestler I broke my foot

it's like a horse least like a
human horse and then I've got another

I'm an American Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

world champion to change me

he was like 200 pounds not only a big

beat the big big boy is but I was always

on the defensive with them and since the

fight I've gone back to train with them

and and went with my internal dialogue

not the external dialogue the dialogue

of I can't proper with this man because

he's a Russian guy and he's

wrestled bear since he's a kid in all

this
that's external I let the external

infiltrate my into internal and it

filtered into the fight but after the

belt I went back and train with these

people and attacked and I'm all them so

I'm just here waiting to continue to go

and see where we can get get with this

situation with the UFC

see can we get this fight again and

let's go again and that's that's where

my soul I could you wrote the other day

on Twitter I mean it was a couple days

ago that you were retiring yeah and so

bottom line is you're retiring unless

they give you your terms is that what it

is you're enough of a brand to do it

brother

you're all so strategic tell us

how you made the deal to fight money

Mayweather I mean you're you know like

you talk to his ass how did you pull

that off and tell me what your thinking

was about to start with why'd you want

to do it what was your mindset you made

what eighty-five million dollars give or

take look at the competitive the

competitive aspect of it a new sport the

greatest of all time under that rule

said again more external Dell I love it

give it to me give me all that they'll

tell me I can't do something tell me I'm

not gonna I'm not gonna cross over and

make that jump into a completely new

sport not only against some some not

some random guy yes the damn best yes so

it was just competitive my competitive

nature of course the financial benefits

and the notoriety was great and and two

eggs how'd you get him to do it cuz it

was your idea right we just continued to

poke poke at it and it just happened you

know it happened naturally he well I

went down on his terms I fought him

under his rules and originally the

promise was I'll fight him his game he

fights me my game yeah I haven't heard

of him since so we'll see what happens

but I would love another call when the

boxing arena like that we spoke briefly

about it outside floyd mayweather will

is known for his feeling shell defensive

style of fighting

he has his he has his right arm tucked

in his left sorry is an orthodox so it's

the opposite but he has when I'm tucked

in on his belly and one arm kept up by

his ear and it uses his shoulder to

deflect shots he's a back footed fighter

he fights on the back foot that's what I

prepared for because that's what I

that's all I had seen of him my sparring

partners were fighters on the back foot

fighters defensive leaning against the

ropes and then when I went into the

fight in the early rounds I was whooping

him in the early rounds who was actually

I went back to my corner after the

fourth round said this is easy

I literally set out to my corner man

this is easy and then he had to switch

up

style now you've got to respect that

because that's what that's what a crafty

veteran can do we can switch up a star

he switched it to that all Mexicans

boxing style the Mexican boxing style is

where you put your elbows in tight the

the knuckle you put a two-step of the

the forehead and and connected and walk

forward with heavy pressure

he'd never fought like that in his

entire career but he was forced to fight

that way because he was getting beaten

beaten when he was fighting his ole way

and the the approach caught me off guard

I was not prepared for it I was not used

to it and he walked me down and end up

getting getting the stoppage the referee

I felt could have let the fight go I

would have liked him to see the end of

the round get my get my breathing back

get a little bit more comfortable put I

know he's not gonna come into my game

but I would love to

rematch him on the boxing rules again

and and have that knowledge and have

have my sparring hands come forward with

that style also and see where we go and

I believe I could I believe I would win

actually there I go again with a fake

humbleness

we know longest fight of your career do

right you were incredibly yeah 20 22 22

minutes it was so that was another H

that was in order and focus on the camp

to go from five five-minute rounds which

is twenty twenty-five minutes to twelve

treatment and rounds which is 26 minutes

quite a big jump so my my my entire camp

was almost a switch my time and my

energy and how to develop more stamina

and to go and you know if we didn't get

there in the end I had a ten week period

and that brings me back to that all in

and that before the Floyd fight I was a

tubal weight world champion I doing it

in the fight in mixed martial arts I had

done it I wasn't as committed as I could

have been I wasn't I didn't have my team

around me I didn't have my nutritionist

my coaches my Bonapartist and then the

fight got made the fight was ten weeks

out so now I had ten weeks to adjust

from five five in arounds to 12 three

minute rounds you know and but again

tightly I have my McGregor fans program

that we that we have I said I truly

believe this in this program it has got

the shape I got in in that ten weeks on

that program was insane it was

phenomenal shape and was one of the

reasons why I got to that tent around

you know under that pressure and under

that and that new experience and

experience that I had not felt before so

I'm very confident now on my end

let's keep building as long as I keep on

it and try not not slip and and keep

keep motivated I think like if you if

your lack of commitment is almost an

insult to the people who believe in you

and that's what I'm trying to tell

myself I said there's people in there's

people who believe in me so this is what

I'm telling myself right now today

there's people that believed in me and

and me having this half commitment it's

it's you know it's gonna it's not it's

not a I am it's not all my people

it's not other people who who believe in

me deserve and I want to you know I want

to I want to give back to the people who

believed in me and and give them that

belief you know and prove that belief

correct so that's where we're at now and

let's see where it goes that's let's

yeah I was taught how to talk about you

know you want to take the Island

you burn your boats because if there's a

way back the mind will give you there

right yeah and I heard you say sometime

and I wanna chew you so I don't wanna

die in that arena is that we

might say yes it has to be it has to be

I have what I have seen a man die in

this game I I was wing side I caught I

cornered a man who killed a man I

cornered a man who killed a man an Irish

soil the only death in mixed martial

arts history in Ireland it was

everywhere and a couple of days after

that it was a couple of days after that

they wanted the UFC wanted me to fly all

over the United States of America to

promote the next belt and I was like I

can't do this I need to get away and

just my head needs to be in the correct

spot it's a rootless rootless game you

have to be willing because you can go in

there and when you come out you're a

different person if I could describe it

to two people it's like entering a car

crash you're going into a car crash that

shins are bare the feet are bare you can

strike with the elbows the knees it's a

vicious vicious game and you've got to

be fully committed and you've got to be

willing to go all the way and that's

what I am and that's what I have even I

make correct decisions even in there

even in defeat I know I know when when

it's there if there isn't it's time to

get our I know I know when to live to

fight another day you know so you have

to be intelligent in there as well

otherwise you won't live to fight

another day and that's what happened in

my last bell didn't knock on my way

but then the fight broke out afterwards

I bounced back in Soto's it all happened

so fast it would literally happen right

in front of me what the happened

yes but he jumped affair a jump to Freud

or so he jumped everyone Swiss his feet

jump inland when I was punching you I

saw no no you're much higher to tell

what happened was the fight was doing

their match was doing he climbed over

the fence and jumped into the crowd to

make a bit of noise but as soon as he

jumped into the crowd he cowered away I

like to call it scurried away cuz he's

that little rats they are they won't be

honest we scurried away I know as I get

my respect Congrats you won the match I

get let's see what happens next time I

our confident will get it again let's go

again humble in defeat I am humble in

victory or defeat no matter what it's

it's a sport at the end of the day a

gruesome sport but it's a it's a sport

so I respected I was defeated on the

night he jumped in and caused his case

and went to attack but really it was

just I don't know exactly he was trying

to just hide away when he jumped in so

he didn't really do anything but I saw

this take place I got up off the ground

I said ok now I'm back in the mix jumped

on top of the cage as I jumped on top of

the cage his brother

that's sprinting across and jumped up on

top of the cage also to climb in and

help him and join the fight

I seen him there it was like a Christmas

present he was right there in the eye

socket and we started fighting on top of

the cage it got broken hoped we ended up

in indication he was trying to break at

a capacitor security and I was just kind

of watching everything I'm very self

defense mind that I have been true

growing open

I know where my entrances and my exits

are I know I'm very aware of my

surroundings so when the fight was

breaking breaking out and I knew it was

people in and out that there was a lot

of raw people that I wasn't aware he was

who's with him he was with security

who's who yeah so I backed myself up

against the cage wall where I thought I

was good and what happened was two of

his teammates

ran and turned over right behind me and

from me what my mind said it was

fascinating for me to watch that back

because I got to a safe place I was good

I I well I got to a place where I was

aware and I could see any oncoming trap

and deal with it they came right over my

back right over my back but one of them

the first one a church and man ran in

front of me and went over to the to the

Prada that got smacked and was like what

happened I don't know what he was saying

but then he turned back and saw me but

I'd already saw him so

he toned back balm I smacked him he

wobbled and as I smacked him and rocked

him and neroon jumped in from over the

back and he slugged me from and then oh

cool dope I got separated and then the

final one was the original brother who

was on top of the cage he broke free

from the security ran at a hundred mile

an hour towards me he chew a right hand

as he chewed all right hand I threw a

left hand boom and it's an image an

aerial image of the right hand just

whipping boy me face and Louie left

handle and then flush down the pipe the

final blow up that night said
so tell me something tell me like you

become this amazing entrepreneur

you can unbelievable you know you know

how to get everybody want to watch you

know how to play psychological warfare

you know to win you know to be humble

and defeat and learn and come back and

kick at nothing stop yeah then but tell

me the total fee entrepreneur side like

where's that coming from for you and

tell us all about your Irish whisky what

it means to cuz I know the name itself

has a deep meaning for you yeah well my

whiskey proper 12 we've we have had an

unprecedented launch it is it has gone

to exactly where I knew it would go you

know we ran out of stock we had a

certain amount of liquid and I was like

supposed to do this for the year I was

like that's not gonna do us for the year

we had to I had to ruffle a few feathers

and make it happen and we made it happen

but the launch itself has been

unprecedented whiskey Irish whiskey

you know growing up my grandfather would

always since he he was you know when our

we have master distillers and master

drinkers my grandfather was a master

drinker and he would always instill

pride in me of Irish whisky that we as

Irish men and Irish people had a world

champions and creating this liquid

George Bernard Shaw said whisky is

liquid liquid sunshine and I I believed

him it truly so he is you've got a

respected though no doubt you've got to

respect the liquid but I came up with

pride in my nation that we were the

greatest whiskey makers are world

champions of whiskey and Jameson has

been an untested the own the untested

King of Irish whiskey until now we've

burst onto the scene

I brought new demographic demographics

with me they own you know and then the

oil the old whiskey drinkers they're

trying it as well I'm a continuing to

grow to grow

brant and also broke Rhoda blends it's

currently a 4-year age liquid that we

are aging in baton our barrels we're

gonna experiment put the liquid in

different barrels whale it gets to six

years eight years 12 years you know when

I when I first entered the whisky biz

the business itself I used to after each

Friday I used to have a tradition with

mr. Lorenzo Fertitta the former owner of

the other senior we would toast a whisky

after every fight and it became

synonymous in the fight game and and and

at that time I started getting

approached by whisky companies to do

adverts and things like that I was like

no no no I'm gonna go in onto that field

with silver myself you want your own

whisky company as opposed like most guys

because it was instilled in me it was

instilled in me never you know we we are

the bull champions I can do this if they

can do what I can do what I'm gonna

learn about it study about it and that's

it I have a courage now where we have

crops of barley barley is the main

ingredient in my in my in my proper 12

in my whiskey we take the barley and we

bring it down to the distillery in our

in Antrim Anton's a lovely a lovely area

of Ireland on the island of Ireland

their finest spring water the beautiful

soil it's a seventy seven acre plot of

land

it's the oldest whiskey distillery on

the land I thought we source that like

it was a dream to get that distillery

and have that distillery create the

whisky created there and we have created

Anna Mae an amazing liquid we are

dominating dominating Jameson in the

sales category as we speak so let's keep

going and let's hear them you know most

people you know you get so much press

fear of notorious which is great for

your brand but you're a giver

man that's what the reasons I wanted to

meet you yeah I was like I know you're

the real thing and then tell

people what you do with the hospital's

there and I know I've seen you've done

online for kids yeah well like in Dublin

twelve proper like I said proper twelves

the name Dublin twelve is where I come

from the largest Children's Hospital in

the country is in Dublin twelve so

everyone in Ireland has has a

relationship with Dublin twelve it's

only a small area but we all have a

relationship with it so I have donated

to that hospital many times my son has

visited there I flew to New York for a

dinner and we raised close to a million

for the hospital as well you know spoken

from the crowd and help the homeless

there too yeah well I've helped the hall

I've helped the homeless charities of

course I've also donated to am the Cape

and Kim which is the maternity hospital

when my son and my daughter were born I

donated my there that treatment they

gave me the tree I was actually inspired

by the nurses and the Midwest and the

work that they put in I wanted to give

back to them and we've done that now

currently with my whiskey we have we

have a program where we were with each

case sold in each district it's sold in

we give back five dollars off of each

case to the first responders to the

first responders in that district that's

awesome it's just 1 million the first

responders you know they're the ones

that need back in there was a support us

you know they're the ones that forced

into buildings when we need them when

everyone's running out there running in

I wanted to give back I have a history

with with with the Children's Hospital

with the hospitals I have seen it

firsthand the fireman the fireman us

like imagine imagine sprinting up a

stairs and there's flames everybody know

Newton what's gonna happen once to the

door you know that these are heroic

people these are people I go through

traumatic see traumatic things and do it

to save us and help us and I wanted to

give back and you know what better way

than with my whiskey and with my

donation and it's been it's been it's

been phenomenal it's been received very

well and it's a great feeling I'm very

happy and proud to do it it's beautiful

yeah one of the things I love about you

too is like people look at someone who's

extraordinary and they assume that it's

just like a gift that shows up and they

don't realize some being is rewarded in

for public for the they've done in

private over and over again and you have

incredible discipline yeah I don't even

know where you heared about that the

homeless teens already because I loved

about you don't always tell people like

yeah I know you went to one of the

places the only reason anybody was there

as somebody you knew had their child

there I was like I was touched by that

yeah yes yeah and I have like I go home

now I'm eager to get home to my Island

as well to the island of Ireland have

many great teens plans I'm gonna visit

the Boxing Club in Dublin 12 and I'm

gonna visit my gym in SVG nice as well

I'm gonna put on shows for the people I

meet people because I think you

easy look we're all we're all powerful

people here as well it's easy for a rich

manner it to throw money around and

that's not it it needs to be more

exactly I need to be in the flesh and I

want to be in the flesh I want to give

back I want to give time more than more

than I want to give money generally I

think that's more powerful has more

power more in Zachary and I see that

start something again as I'm learned as

I'm as I'm getting older Isis I can meet

time time is more valuable than anything

I'm not paraphrasing it right but the

essence you said it's all
practices all disciplines tell us what

do you think has really made you

successful because people look at a guy

like you any girls he's so gifted you

are gifted when you developed your

gifts but tell us what's the

essence of what makes that success

happened the same way the same essence

in any hard walk it's ours in any

success it's hard work yeah that's it

hard work you put it in you

believe in it you will succeed and

that's it I am living proof if you want

to look at a man who has clawed his way

fought with every ounce of his being to

get to where he is you're looking at him

right here so that's what I have doing

that's beautiful
