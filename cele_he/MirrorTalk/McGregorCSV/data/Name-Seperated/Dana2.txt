DANA WHITE: What’s up Toronto, how are you tonight? So when we were putting this deal together I told these guys, ‘You don’t do a world tour without stopping in Canada, baby’. And as usual you never fail to deliver. We love you very much. Alright, let’s get this show started.

The reigning, defending 155lb champion of the UFC, ‘The Notorious’ Conor McGregor!

CONOR MCGREGOR: Does this mic work? Well then f*** that mic!

FM: One thing we do know, one thing we do know, one thing we do know, the f***ing fans can’t fight for you.

CM: Shut your f***ing mouth.

FM: We not talking about being at the top one year, two years, three years, four years, motherf***er. 21 years!

Yeh! And they said I’m the motherf***er that can’t read? B****, I do numbers, I make money. You know my middle name, b****!

CM: You owe money.

FM: I do? Let me see the bag! [Mayweather opens backpack on stage]. Yeh he was right, yeh, the bag got books and we gonna show you what the books look like. If you believe in yourself like you say you believe in yourself, bet your whole fight cheque, you b****!

CM: No f***ing problem. Send the contract kid, it’s done.

FM: Let me see what it look like, grab me one [Mayweather crew member gets cheque], let me see what it look like. See if this b**** want to bet this.

CM: Do what you’re told, b****. Do what you’re told, b****.

FM: You know, you know. You know, I like you.

CM: You love me.

FM: You f***ing idiot, you f***ing idiot, that’s the f*** you are. You punk! This your boss, you b**** [points to White].

CM: Good one.

FM: And y’all got the f***ing nerves to believe in a f***ing fighter that like to f***ing quit? This is a f***ing quitter!

Turn the pressure up, I don’t quit, I don’t fold under pressure. I’m the best and I know I’m the best. B****, you know I’m the best. Don’t you ever tell me s*** about a f***ing $3 million fighter. Not no more.

Oh, and I love what I got on. I’m wearing that Toronto flag. I look good in that Toronto gear! Yeh, yeh, I feel good. I’m 40, but I look 20.

CM: And you act 10.

FM: Hey he told me, hey. You see, I’m not going to go there. I’m a’go there in the last press conference, I ain’t gonna go there right now. And we talk about females.

CM: You don’t even know nothing about true fighting. You’ve never been in there. You’re against little boxers afraid. You’re against a different animal here, Floyd.

FM: Shut the f*** up, b****.

CM: Shut your mouth.

FM: Shut the f*** up.

CM: Shut your mouth. They want you off this stage. You’re embarrassing yourself up there.

FM: Yeh I’m going to keep this souvenir. Can I keep this souvenir?

CM: You do something with that flag, I’ll f*** you up.

FM: [Laughs] I like you, I like you.

CM: That’s it? That’s it?! There’s about five grand in here! There’s about five grand in here! F*** me. Just know, you do something with that flag you ain’t getting this bag or this money back and I’m going to f*** you up on this stage.
