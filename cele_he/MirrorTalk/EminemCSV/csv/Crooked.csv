Eminem, yeah you know what I'm saying lying I was like wait a minute since then since anadi.
Interviewer, yeah oh sure this thing for address yeah I saw I saw some people got there and I was like kind of sometimes I don't know.
Eminem, if you ever be sitting around writing some in your life man nobody's gonna get this yeah and then you're.
Interviewer, like oh well let me just try it and see if anybody does like but that's that's the like that's kind of a beauty of.
Eminem, wordplay was like sometimes people ain't gonna get it the first list and they'll get it the second third fourth fifth.
Interviewer, listen it's gonna take a lot of lessons for the new one that you just drop music to be murdered by the line it's so many.
Eminem, lines in your phone what's up y'all sure man can crook it I'm live and dr. Dre's lab right now you.
Interviewer, know what I'm saying and um I could spend the whole episode giving you know props to the man across the road for me.
Eminem, you know his achievements are just incredible you know I mean um what are you doing worse he's oh you thought my.
Interviewer, meat yeah you're saying I got the homie in the house one of the greatest of all times Marshall Mathers thank you thank.
Eminem, you thank you for being here brah absolutely appreciate your time man um let's jump into it man let's talk about.
Interviewer, music to be murdered by Islam inspired by the 1958 release from Alfred Hitchcock with the same title what made.
Eminem, you do that well it was actually Dre had the sample like years ago right and he made a beat to it and one day just.
Interviewer, popped in my head I can't remember why so I hit him and I was like yo what did whatever happened to that beat and he.
Eminem, was like I was still around so but the beat was the beat was different I just updated a little bit with some drums and.
Interviewer, right but like that was but it was based off that that I started thinking like you know the whole concept is crazy.
Eminem,Like music to be murdered by like i wonder if I could play off this whole Alfred Hitchcock thing and and then Dre.
Interviewer,Started hitting me with ideas it was like yo you need to listen to this album that he has so he sent me a link to that.
Eminem,And i started listening you know i was like yo okay I could face this whole album off of that Wow there was actually.
Interviewer,Some stuff that didn't make it on there that I was trying to get on there but we couldn't really work it out with the.
Eminem,Sample clearing but i had it even more intertwine and it was and we wanted you know pick and choose the best pieces to.
Interviewer,Put on there just first sampling issues and but uh samples Yeah right.
Eminem,When i was stuck in traffic for like three hours listening to it over and over and over and I caught something new.
Interviewer,Every single time and it's like this is gonna it's gonna take you know to about twenty twenty-one or some for.
Eminem,Everybody really gets all of and i'm talking about avid fans yeah you know then like when you write in that type of.
Interviewer,On that level you know like you said you say you just put it in anyway even knowing that it could slip by people's.
Eminem,Radar yeah i feel like i feel like you know there's a certain there's a certain kind of fan it will get that and there's.
Interviewer,A certain kind of fan it might just be the average listener who doesn't you know they like hip-hop and and it sounds.
Eminem,Good something sounds good to them right but they might not understand exactly what we're doing how dope it is yeah but.
Interviewer,Well but but that's what's dope about those reaction videos and also the the people who break down the lyrics and.
Eminem,They show you like okay he was hitting these syllable schemes right here every single syllable there's five syllables.
Interviewer,There in hor seven right and he was hitting these right here and he started a new syllable scheme rhyme with that.
Eminem,Syllable scheme and then came back at the end and Ryan with the you know I'm saying I think that that helps people.
Interviewer,Like really understand the genius yeah it's only enough for one joint stopping the limo hop in the window shopping the.
Eminem,Demo gunpoint yeah the outer rhymes are two syllables the inner rhymes of five syllables yeah.
Interviewer,That's in my opinion what makes you want to do this a long time yeah but that's to me my opinion back to you because.
Eminem,When we did the what the was it my house like this is this mean Royce chuggabug this all the time we're.
Interviewer,Like crooks to me on the song alright but uh but we joke about that all the time cuz it's like you and him to me make verses that even if you.
Eminem, laid them first they're unstoppable so it's like I can only hope to tie mmm at best that's.
Interviewer, because we must be a compliment from you dying bro when you did in my house the lights out or utility.
Eminem, in the facility physical life out to wipeout I forgot the next scene but it would utilities in different like he was.
Interviewer, rhyming all that right like that was like and and and and being able to keep it going like that's what I think a.
Eminem, lot of a lot of the average listener sometimes might not understand that we did this you know because some people.
Interviewer, don't catch the syllables they think that were you know rhyming you know my house the lights out utilities in the.
Eminem, facility like house rhymes and out rhymes right they're not catching the full scheme yeah yeah they're not.
Interviewer, catching them my house lights out digital life spouts wipeouts like there's two there but then there's.
Eminem, utilities and the same thing it's like that's the that's the beauty to me of the craft of M scene is that that's.
Interviewer, important to you oh yeah yeah because it's it's and I know it's important to you because it's what makes rap fun.
Eminem, right right so sometimes we might not we might not have a we might we might be in the mood to like not even not to write a.
Interviewer, song that might not have a message to it why not really be saying anything that's important right but it's more about the.
Eminem, craft and we're just trying to go as hard as we can go you know and I think that that to me is what makes it fun.
Interviewer, right it's being able to you you know when you thought of it hey bruh I'll go ham for deaf prisoners.
Eminem, like you feel something right when you think of that your little that's come okay yeah yeah alright let me let.
Interviewer, me figure this out let's go down with this scheme and figure it out but that's that's to me man is beauty of uh of this.
Eminem, culture um younger make a lab come about I was very surprised to hear her on there you know me she's been doing.
Interviewer, damage yeah all around well he put out ooh yo she's dope that kind of started.
Eminem, following a little bit and then it was like I started watching every video she put out why and I was more so like.

Eminem, charisma right right but she also had the bars and I was like man like this is like like she's really got bars like I.
Interviewer, was so then I I just went down the wormhole of like to eat freestyle she did right and then she did flex and how.

Eminem, in like I'm gonna do something with her and hit her up and I was like yo I want I said I got just intro to the album and.
Interviewer, then I want you to be the first thing that people hear after that you know I'm saying like gave it up Ali oh yeah crazy.
Eminem, yes she just went in yes he murdered it is that what you do you go down a rabbit hole with different artists when you.
Interviewer, when you start liking them and you go down to Wormold kinda it's funny because I usually spend I mean this has been.
Eminem, this way for a while I usually spend like an entire Saturday if I'm not at work I'm not at studio I spend like an.

Eminem, his Funk Flex freestyle was just like oh my god I'm in here for 10 minutes yeah crazy crazy.
Interviewer, would but again is what we love about this music right is because especially as a competitive rapper right we're apt.
Eminem, to be we're competitive rappers right we're not just like we're in it we do this this is what we do and it's like.
Interviewer, inspiring to hear that but it also like kind of gets you like yeah yeah like gives you anxiety right but.

Eminem,Didn't i think of that or you know damn I said something kind of like that but I don't say it like that and then it's.
Interviewer,Like okay i can't say that now because he already just said it you know what upset yeah that's always crazy man ah.
Eminem,It's a new era man like i always wanted to know like what's your perspective on people with longevity such just self.
Interviewer,Adjusting to the new era of hip-hop you know I'm saying yeah that's that's you know that's another one of the things.
Eminem,That make it fun too is like being able to watch like Cole and Kendrick come up and seeing how how great they were right.
Interviewer,Off the bat and it's it's like you start my god I mean aside from them like I pay attention to everything that's going on.
Eminem,You know i'm saying like right now all the new I try to stay up on you know who's doing what flow patterns that.

Eminem,Song with with you or him i know what I'm gonna get in the sense of the bar it's gonna be but I don't know what I'm.
Interviewer,Gonna get what what style what you don't I'm saying I don't know I can't predict right.
Eminem,A flow pattern i can't never do anything it's the same thing if I get on us getting on the track with Kendrick I can.
Interviewer,Never tell what the he's gonna do right cuz he is such a chameleon of styles and he can do any pretty.
Eminem,Much anything right any any so proficient at it he's so good at it and you don't know what you're gonna get.
Interviewer,That to me is like a top-tier lyricist because it's like you don't you can get your ass kicked any day you know I'm.
Eminem,Saying like certain rappers get on a certain song and it's like it just depends on ya just like you I mean you.
Interviewer,Probably inspire countless you know stupid bars when people know okay I got to get on a song with em you know I'm.
Eminem,Sayin i mean they just know you know i'm very surprised if you ever have done a song with every time I listen to a song.
Interviewer,That you've done with another artist it's always one of their best verses you see what I'm saying it's like you.
Eminem,Inspired them to push their pin like that you know I mean and that's got to be something to walk in the room and.
Interviewer,Just change the energy absolutely absolutely I mean but it's you know it's it's a.
Eminem,Craft that you know we've i don't know if I've mastered it yet but it's but I'm still trying to figure out like as.
Interviewer,Long as i've been in the game i'm always trying to figure out new flow patterns and you know I'm saying like new cadence.
Eminem,Isn't we're trying to still trying to always get it right you know cuz it's like I up make an album I don't always.
Interviewer,Get it right i don't get it always get every song right I don't always get every delivery right you know those one.
Eminem,Of the things i'm just always trying to improve you your toughest critic absolutely I mean you're probably yours.
Interviewer,Right yeah cuz it's like cuz because you know that you can't sit down with the pan and just.
Eminem,Rhyme the last word of every lie you said that's not fun yeah not fun I was like I cool yeah you.
Interviewer,Know meaning and your love for hip-hop is just evident you know I'm saying like even the t-shirts you choose to.
Eminem,Sometimes i sit back and i see a picture of you rocking my pleasure you feel me yeah that's what I'm saying.
Interviewer,Like like you i think you had like lock him Shabazz oh yes he serves you don't say and a lot of people don't even know.
Eminem,You know who that called themselves hip hop heads might not even know who that is on your shirt that's what you doing.
Interviewer,Purpose i mean it is something i do want a because I love it cuz it's fun for me like it makes me feel like a kid again.
Eminem,It's like oh i got you know i got just help them cover like like think about we're not thinking like iconic.
Interviewer,Album covers nwa's first album cover audio two's first album cover like the color scheme of that like holidays.
Eminem,Wearing the airbrushed shirts right right right like having that on a shirt is a it's dope to me but it's also like.
Interviewer,Maybe if i'm doing a show and some of the younger fans don't know who this is they'll go back and you know look at go.
Eminem,Back and say okay who is that on this show yeah and go back in and and be like oh yeah cuz lock him Shabazz was.
Interviewer, nice i'm brought in rare i walk in the square a pure righteous man and being that much of a you know a part of.
Eminem,The coachee history books are gonna definitely put you as one of the greatest of all time how do you feel.
Interviewer,About the concept of white rappers being a guest in a house a hip-hop well I mean that's the funny thing I I don't know if.
Eminem,I've got a chance to say this yet but the funny the funny is like I with with the whole beef of a certain person.
Interviewer,Right i never said i wasn't a guest right like I'm absolutely a guest like I never said I wasn't right and I never.
Eminem,Said i was king of anything right like i had a song called Kings never die but it wasn't me saying that was one of the.
Interviewer,Beats that khalil sent me with the hook on it that was the concept but a song and I'm like I can't say I'm the king of.
Eminem,Hip-hop right right let's say so i threw Run DMC in there J and Master J you know saying like life and was trying to like.
Interviewer,Because i never want to be like i don't even for the king of hip-hop who the is.
Eminem,The king of hip-hop yeah like is there a king of hip-hop like I don't know like I feel you on that.
Interviewer,People would say people would say just because you sell the most records doesn't mean you're the best just.
Eminem,Because you can rap 40 million syllables doesn't mean you're the best like I care more about rhyming the.
Interviewer,Syllables mmm you know i'm saying like like I more about the craft than any of the other and then that shows you know.
Eminem,Sound like and it goes back to those who know you know I mean if you know you know and I just don't I don't get it.
Interviewer,Sometimes you know i mean i watch these rap media so-called critics and some music journalists and so many of your.
Eminem,Bars and your messages goes over their heads and you know they like even with the content conversation I mean you've.
Interviewer,Been having contests that's day one you got songs to prove it it's like sometimes I'm late what what is content.
Eminem,What are you wanting to talk about think about the first time you heard Rock him right so when people make these lists.
Interviewer,And he's always on the list mm-hmm but he's also always on my list because to me greatness is not only how well you do.
Eminem,Something but if you were the first to do it Rakim was the first person that I heard.
Interviewer,That started taking using like inside rhyme schemes right and coming back at the end and hitting that you know saying.
Eminem,So he did something that hadn't even been thought of yet original yeah it was like and he.
Interviewer,Single-handedly pushed the genre forward to be more complex lyrically and and then and birth Kane and G rap.
Eminem,Right right and man like I like those two will always be on my list too because like.
Interviewer,Kane was doing confused and lose abused and bruised the crews who choose to use my name wrong will pay dues oh man come.
Eminem,On nobody was doing that nobody that was every single word.
Interviewer,He said grind and he just made a sentence with it that made sense you know what I'm saying every person who's.
Eminem,A fan of hip hop might feel like hip hop is about something different hmm right it ain't about lyrics it's about how.
Interviewer,Good you you you flow in your cadence right right or it ain't like but it's it's or or it's just about the beat is.
Eminem,Dope and just having a message over it that could be what your opinion of what hip-hop is about my opinion is hip-hop.
Interviewer,Is about lyricism and the greats who we put up on the pedestal right that's what they were about and that was the the.
Eminem,Beauty of us being able to learn how to do it and learn from them right yeah do you ever agree with any of the top 50.
Interviewer,List they circulate on the internet have you seen one that you'd like oh yeah that's accurate I've seen a couple of.
Eminem,Them why feel like okay that's kind of accurate I'll never want to come off as preachy or be like you know you don't.
Interviewer,Understand what we do we're so much smarter than you no it's not about that but we do the craft and we do rap at a.
Eminem,Certain level where we know late game recognize game right right like you can appreciate Jordan because Jordan was.
Interviewer,Like a spectacle to see right it was just like holy right but I don't even know yes what he was doing.
Eminem,Just like mechanics if i hire somebody to fix my car I'm not gonna hire a painter my iron mechanic I'm Akay knows.
Interviewer,What he's doing under the hood yeah you know what I'm saying and I can't explain what he's doing and you can be like yo.
Eminem,That's the best mechanic i've ever seen right like I saw I saw what does it call my extra expert opinion with math Hoffa.
Interviewer,Right right right right and it was the episode where they were talking about the verse that I did on.
Eminem,The fat joke thing and i was like these are the guys these are the guys who if I was coming up like as a rapper or just a.
Interviewer,Fan of rap or whatever i would want to hear from them because they do this too right you know I'm saying so it's like.
Eminem,Game recognize game like like i don't know if if this guy is the best mechanic in the world oh you know what.
Interviewer,I'm saying it's not my thing but someone who is a mechanic might be like y'all this guy is he's the.
Eminem,Goat yeah exactly changing your muffler then we come and argue with that guy yeah no he's not.
Interviewer,Yeah go yeah again it's like you don't want to sound too preachy and be like you just oh you know we're so much.
Eminem,Smarter than you you don't understand what we're doing like it's not about it's not about that but it but at some.
Interviewer,Point it's just like i can't take your list seriously if they don't have you want it they don't have rice on it I.
Eminem,Can't take it serious i can't take it serious because it's like you don't you don't know really know what you're.
Interviewer,Talking about so i can't even get mad at I can't get mad at you I think that a lot of times when people make these.
Eminem,Lists they're mistaken the greatest rappers for their favorite rappers so what they mean to say is these are my.
Interviewer,Favorite rappers these are my personal favorites right right Jay nas they're always gonna be on that list.
Eminem,Right right you always gonna be on it on some peoples all right doc I've never seen a list without you on it well I.
Interviewer,Mean yeah yeah well you might not be where you deserve to be that's it that's in my opinion that's how I feel when.
Eminem,People don't put you and royce there because the longevity how good you guys have consistently been to be able to.
Interviewer,Keep it up to this level you know what I'm saying and like we're not youngins in this game you know I'm saying so it's.
Eminem,Like we've we put our time in but still even even to this day when I hear a new song by you or a new rhyme scheme I feel.
Interviewer,Like he's still he's still figuring this out like in other words you're you're trying you're trying to figure out a way.
Eminem,To make this verse better than anything you just did prior to it right one each verse is like that's how I feel when I listen to you I'm like oh he's.
Interviewer, still with different flow patterns you know I'm saying like look and cares about it and cares about it in.
Eminem, the pockets and like I don't never I don't ever know where your rhymes gonna fall out and I don't know how many.
Interviewer, syllables you're gonna hit but but that's the other thing is like when people are like we don't care about the.
Eminem, Super Bowls know that you know you need to because that's the craft of doing it yeah a CMC yeah it's up to.
Interviewer, you it's up to you like how you know whatever you whatever you feel you know but like I think that people are just.
Eminem, sometimes mistaken best emcees for their favorite rappers speaking of favorite rappers Trench stretch trench.
Interviewer, I don't see on a lot of lists either yeah that is infuriating to me because I think that again we was.
Eminem, talking about like Rock Emma did something that never been done and can't get something Angie rap did something.
Interviewer, had never been done Treach did do to me I think I think what happened with Treach and this is just in.
Eminem, my circle of friends that we talk about one of the common things said is well he did OPP and he did hip-hop a.
Interviewer,Rake right right but he was still rhyming his ass off on those songs right right but he also did something to me in.
Eminem,My opinion that like his there was a time period probably between 91 and about 95 where every damn near.
Interviewer,Every rapper in the game was true was following him right and trying to do what he was doing absolutely dressing.
Eminem,Like him you know you know i'm saying the whole the whole moving like him exactly.
Interviewer,And he was getting on songs and smoking everybody and it was like yo when I heard yoke the joke of my.
Eminem,Heart sank my heart saying cuz i was like I'm never gonna be this good wow I might as well quit I didn't write a.
Interviewer,Rhyme for the entire summer i said this on the ice-t documentary but this is real I didn't write for an entire.
Eminem,Summer and proof was like proof was like yo man he's good but you gotta keep yeah like you know what I'm saying right I.
Interviewer,Was just like but i'll never be that good by the time he got to wickedest man alive mmm I was like I quit I don't want.
Eminem,To do this anymore you got a favorite treasures I got a lot of fish my my when I heard him dude it when I heard him.
Interviewer,Yoked the joker when he was like oh fuzzy dirty dizzy does he get the fixing these women by blistery you ain't ready.
Eminem,For the freddie your rap he can't kill me I step into your dreams you feel me slicing your life away just like my mic.
Interviewer,Today i eat you the cycle where i'm ripping right away man he was kidding reg I there are there.
Eminem,Are some in this genre that have not even caught up to that all this time is past and and those verses are so.
Interviewer,Timeless to me right like you got people what we do talk to the bunny Sonny he's the man bugs the dog with the money.
Eminem,Funny that you should mention that's my family they're covered what's up to my cousins and my sisters.
Interviewer,That my warner brothers birds of a feather flock to fail to be together no matter what your whatever and never.
Eminem,Found who's better you mean he see them him those are others he's gifted us with one pluck initiate the trouble those who.
Interviewer,Disagree or maybe feel the need in front it show me your whole entire crew cashews and I'm a running on it maybe yo.
Eminem,Yeah i was just like goddamn yeah he was what he did was he did wordplay he did compound syllables multi-syllable.
Interviewer,Rhyming and he did it in different styles right he never had to listening to go back and listen that first album.
Eminem,He never did the same style twice hey i loved his image I loved what he was about he look cool you know I'm saying.
Interviewer,And you you he you believed him right he was believing he looked apart he acted the part he was the part right so that's.
Eminem,Why i think a lot of rappers just kind of started going and I did like with my writing in shape but it's time the.
Interviewer,Second album came out i sounded just like him mmm someone just like trench I sound like.
Eminem,Kuji rat like there's so many errors that I sounded like other rappers you know saying but like it that's what we.
Interviewer,Do more kids yeah we get if we get influenced you know I mean and we're inspired what you think about Royce.
Eminem,That's a producer man is that weird it's really weird it's really I told him yo years ago years ago when we first.
Interviewer,Met i was like yo i was like you should I said because the way he was picking his beats and like his ear form I was.
Eminem,Like yo why don't you just make beats cuz when I first started making beats and learn how to do it you can control.

Interviewer, don't even understand how that even happens you know I mean like I think you rap so well that it kind of just sucks.
Eminem, all the oxygen out of the conversation hmm I mean it's it's it's interesting like the first album you know like I was.
Interviewer, sitting there with the bass Brothers and Jeff vast like played instruments right like he played the guitar he played the.
Eminem, bass he played the keyboards and all that I knew this music better than they did as far as like what did she.

Eminem, me how to work it keep the metronome going and and uh what started coming out of those sessions and I've.
Interviewer, sometimes I'd be like like yo okay what was that chord okay try it what if he tried that now go up with it right and.
Eminem, then I hung them cuz I don't know how to play instruments so I'll be like I would just hum a lot of well you know and.
Interviewer, that's how I started making the beats and Dre was like yo you're producing that's producing.
Eminem, who knows like it is oh okay cool you know the saying like and just fell into you know yeah like it's funny like I was.
Interviewer, thinking the other day cleaning out my closet that's that beat was actually a beat I.
Eminem, was making for Bazaar really yeah and then I don't remember what happened but I ended up taking the beat and I was.
Interviewer, just like cuz sometimes if someone's there yeah like as I'm making the beat and they start wanting to write to it I.
Eminem, usually just give it to him and and I don't remember what happened with that but uh and they're just became the.
Interviewer, stadium mover yeah I'm saying like that's one of my favorite songs to watch you perform.
Eminem, really yeah I'm saying some of my early early was really rough like was really rough late but it was like a lot.
Interviewer, of times late and I in this from coming up in Detroit like proof had to connects right so proof used to know J Dilla.
Eminem, proof used to know everybody who was anybody right so and I don't remember that phase where like rap was going.
Interviewer, through a phase well I mean it still does it but just there was kind of a phase in like the mid late 90s where.
Eminem, like if you could get a chick to sing on your song right and you know I'm saying like an actual singer chick and proof.
Interviewer, would come over with new music and mandilars making the beats and he's got chicks all over his hooks and right.
Eminem, I'm like what the there's like so I would start like thinking of like hooks like that you know I'm saying and being.
Interviewer, like well someone else could sing this and I'll just lay it for right now for right now and then it ended up becoming.
Eminem, a thing where I was just like it I'll just leave it no I did good decision guardzilla man I gotta tell you.

Interviewer, with but the way he was free stood like that's the that's the that we used to try to do at the hip hop shop was.
Eminem, like try to work on our free Styles right but be able to slip in and out of written when you need to you know I'm.
Interviewer, saying if you've got a certain punch line you want to get to to take her take out this dude right so it to be so young.
Eminem, he like mastered that so quickly yeah it's really sad man that like his potential was so off the charts very I.
Interviewer, tweeted one time you know I like this juice world kid and you know I got some real hardcore boom bap type hip-hop.

Eminem, favors on a new joint oh my oh oh joy Oh every single one it's like ya know every single no I mean you know I.
Interviewer, it's funny when like you know when you're making an album and it's like you know sometimes you got ideas already.
Eminem, sometimes you feel like I don't know if you ever feel like this but it's like sometimes I just feel like I don't feel.
Interviewer, like having a message in this one you know I just want to go is hardly as I can you know and then sometimes.
Eminem, like you know I'll get in a certain mood and be like okay like if there's something that I'm passionate about like.
Interviewer, this is making me either angry or excited or whatever it is right you know I might get the idea to do a song about.
Eminem, it like darkness song like when I want to say something when I feel like I really has something to say I'm gonna do.
Interviewer, it the darkness joint did you ever feel like you might get some kind of backlash.
Eminem, from all this gun politics um you know the right side saying they want to take your guns left side saying you know we.
Interviewer, need more gun control did you feel like you would get any backlash from you know I mean I figured I would get some but.
Eminem, it's kind of like you gotta just I'm more so care about what I believe in right and whoever else gets.
Interviewer, pissed off people like that's this is this is my view on it and this is my take it might not be your take so what.
Eminem, about the person who is stockpiling his house with a hundred and fifty guns.
Interviewer, right like what whatever war they're waiting for I don't know what were you waiting for it you need that kind of.
Eminem, Arsenal I think there's also something to be said I know there's avid gun collectors and like that but.
Interviewer, there's something to be said about somebody who's buying that many guns I just don't have a record of it or.
Eminem, you know like there's I'm not on record as having a you know where I'm able to get flagged right so it's like the the.
Interviewer, whole message of that song was saying what about the person that it's the that hasn't you know I'm saying is the first.
Eminem, is gonna be the first time they flip out in the Arsenal to do it with yeah what about that guy yeah there's no stopping.
Interviewer, that guy right and that's what is when it's like okay when you when you start calling for like background checks and.
Eminem, like that instead of the actual problem right you know we got to do something with the gun laws yeah people.
Interviewer,Start to get like no you can't take our guns you can't take our guns I'm not saying that so when you talk about.
Eminem,Things like that i would say that that's content I probably would say that your critics would say that you just rap.
Interviewer,About rapid hmm i just put words together they just run that's what I do unless it is crazy man but to me again.
Eminem,Yeah you got damn right that's what i do like a competitive rap like and sometimes I just want to have fun with.
Interviewer,It sometimes i just want to make a song that might not be about right but for those who can respect how hard I.
Eminem,Push the pen right like you know you get pillows so what you do you can you can wrap that mini you can say that many.
Interviewer,Words that fast you're not saying anything you're not saying yeah it want me to say it takes a skill level to do.
Eminem,That and i feel like they're not respecting that part of the game you know what I'm saying it takes a it takes.
Interviewer,A phenomenal skill level to rap at the speeds that you wrap at syllables within those you know I'm saying it's not like.
Eminem,You like then i'm over here then i'm over there then I'm over here then I'm over there you know some people fool.
Interviewer,People yeah i mean they're just gonna flow in that I'm gonna buzz it down then I'm gonna buddy's like oh you're.
Eminem,Saying like you actually are putting you know syllables punchlines metaphors within that you know cadence.
Interviewer,And people are i just think a lot of times when a rapper says oh he's just rapping about rapping or he's too rapid.
Eminem,E-wrap it usually comes from a rapper who can't rap that well a lot of people diss what they can't do.
Interviewer,Hmm so it's like if i can't do that i'm gonna just I'm just gonna sit on it yeah I'm gonna sit on it and make it like it.
Eminem,Ain't that good anyways right and then people buy the narrative yeah yep and then you know it might maybe it makes.
Interviewer,The person feel good with whatever is going on inside them I saw some dude I don't remember where I even seen this.
Eminem,What show it wasn't like what site it was on or whatever some dude was trying to trash Jake Jake oh about middle child.
Interviewer,And was saying oh i just fell off at the end it was like and I'm like what the are you talking about like I can't take you serious you could take that.
Eminem, right right and then it's like sometimes you'll be like yo would you listen to that and.
Interviewer, then you say this is trash like that that I I can't respect your opinion I can't yeah they're probably the ones.
Eminem, responsible for these top 50 list that go around like people like that we all know saying yeah I mean I mean I know.

Eminem, about people who push the boundaries and like like red man to me like you're not like when it seemed like it was a time.
Interviewer, in hip-hop where and this was like to me it was like the late 80s early 90s where every time a rapper came out with a new.
Eminem, album they would have best rapper for a minute I'm saying like like Boogie Down.
Interviewer, Productions when by all means necessary love criminal minded but by all means necessary he was like the pinnacle of.
Eminem, like rap at that point in time was like what the like and Redman came out was so good right and then like when NAS.
Interviewer, drop right maduk it was like this is as good as it gets right like this you can't get any better.
Eminem, like that was incredible and then Biggie and then to me Redman when he made Muddy Waters I was like yelling at that that.
Interviewer, that was like that was like when he in my opinion just pulled ahead of everybody he just shot ahead like he was.
Eminem, like like the way he man the way he was I can't even think of him yeah he absolutely smashed that even when I.
Interviewer,First heard him on when i first heard him to do the headbangers first the headbangers what the headbangers and I.
