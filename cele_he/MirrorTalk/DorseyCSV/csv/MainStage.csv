Interviewer,I am so excited to be here with jim mckelvey and jack dorsey square's two co-founders to talk about.
Dorsey,Um all things square and how it started what the origination was.
Interviewer,And how we're thinking about the developer community so for those of you who don't know.
Dorsey,Square started because jim who owns a glassblowing factory uh was unable to process a payment and.
Interviewer,Was really bothered by that understandably about losing customers and started pairing up with his pal.
Dorsey,Jack and they came up with this solution um so i'd love to hear from the two of you.
Interviewer,Um how you first connected before square even was born so um jack came to work for me.
Dorsey,At a company that i actually still have um but at the time we were uh very poorly.
Interviewer,Managed and supplemented our bad management with his uh mother's product which was uh.
Dorsey,Chocolate covered coffee beans which we would chew up and uh keep the staff awake so marcia.
Interviewer,Dorsey was effectively our dealer um and we found one day that her son liked computers that's all we knew.
Dorsey,And so my partner invited john invited jack to come over to work with us and he happened to show.
Interviewer,Up in the middle of this chaotic mess and uh pulled an all-nighter with us the first night.
Dorsey,So we sent him home at five in the morning and i guess i'll let jack finish the story since i think it goes on from.
Interviewer,There well i got yelled at by my mom she um she hated jim um cursed his name.
Dorsey,To this day but has forgiven him for some things but no i might.
Interviewer,My parents always encouraged me to follow my own path and competing was one one big part of.
Dorsey,That and uh jim's company and that work was a great way for me to experience.
Interviewer,What i ultimately wanted to do which was programming and i was super early in the programming computers at that.
Dorsey,Point another story some of you may not know is square's very first customer.
Interviewer,Was a woman named sherry who owned lily bell flowers in san francisco and when jack and jim finally had a.
Dorsey,Prototype for their hardware they approached her at a market and asked her if she wanted to try it out.
Interviewer,Uh taking credit card payments she showed a little bit of hesitancy and wasn't quite sure but just as they were.
Dorsey,Having that conversation a customer a potential customer walked up to her um and said that he didn't.
Interviewer,Have any cash but he would go get someone come back and so they waited around and waited around and lo and.
Dorsey,Behold the customer never returned and so that really.
Interviewer,Helped just fuel even more so the need to create this hardware and provide this to.
Dorsey,Sellers who are trying to capture every type of payment um so i'd really love to hear how does.
Interviewer,This kind of customer centricity lead to innovation well i it wasn't one time that we did that like.
Dorsey,We went on a cherry multiple times um and asked her if she would try or work on and she.
Interviewer,Repeatedly said no um until the point when she lost the sale and that was the biggest insight we we.
Dorsey,Originally thought that we were building a credit card reader that plugged in the.
Interviewer,Phone and had an easy app that got you to the visa or mastercard or.
Dorsey,Acquiring gateway but ultimately what we learned in that moment and it we didn't i don't think we.
Interviewer,Realized it in that moment but what we learned over time was it wasn't about building.
Dorsey,The credit card reader is about making the sale helping installer make the sale if we.
Interviewer,Focused only on building a little plastic device that plugged into the headphone jack and built some.
Dorsey,Software around that would be a very very small not very impactful company but because we focused on a deeper.
Interviewer,Problem which was how do we help us all and make the sale in the first place.
Dorsey,We expanded our entire universe of solutions so a credit card reader is one solution that point of sale is another.
Interviewer,Solution because it allows someone to see their entire business and.
Dorsey,Get analytics around how they're doing and make better decisions lending is another solution.
Interviewer,Which came in the form of square capital and so on and so forth so by by going a little bit deeper into.
Dorsey,The observation what we're seeing we created something much more valuable than.
Interviewer,What we started with yeah it was also interesting when we got the first ipad uh.
Dorsey,Because instead of being restrained to you know this much screen area we had a full ipad's worth.
Interviewer,And so that naturally led us to thinking about all the other things that our customers had to do we had some.
Dorsey,Customers at that point but not very many um at least not compared to today and.
Interviewer,It's really interesting if you think of payments as this.
Dorsey,Wonderfully honest form of communication you know what you spend your money on are things you value.
Interviewer,What you think spend your money on is is almost as important as what you spend your time on in some ways.
Dorsey,And so it's a really interesting insight into what matters for a business and if you start connecting to that.
Interviewer,It naturally leads to a very rich ecosystem that's awesome uh talk to me about how.
Dorsey,You engage with the developer communities as you're building up square were there.
Interviewer,Certain forms that you all used or communities that you contributed to how do you think that's changed if.
Dorsey,Any uh to today when we first started we didn't i mean we consciously decided not to.
Interviewer,Engage with the developer community because we you know we had we had a bunch of.
Dorsey,Experience with apis in the past and like how much um they could potentially be abused.
Interviewer,And given that we were dealing with money and moving money around we want to make.
Dorsey,Sure we had a lot of control over how our system was working and we'd have enough people staff.
Interviewer,Engineering resources to make sure that we could build the right constraints um to start so we we didn't really start.
Dorsey,With the developer community until a few years in um and again it was a conscious choice our.
Interviewer,First focus was one specific customer which was a seller who otherwise would not be able to.
Dorsey,Accept a credit card and we just stayed focused until we had a much stronger base and a greater.
Interviewer,Understanding of where to go from there and then as we got the right engineering talent.
Dorsey,And we understood like what we were building and we understood like what the right.
Interviewer,Endpoints were we started building out the developer community.
Dorsey,And um a lot of it came from you know just making sure that anything we build internally.
Interviewer,Ultimately could we export it externally like we should be a client of our own platform.
Dorsey,Ideally and that's how we originally started building the the system and.
Interviewer,You know in many cases we succeeded in some cases we failed but we're up we're able to learn very fast.
Dorsey,And build a platform that i think you know not only exposes a bunch of.
Interviewer,New functionality to the world especially around commerce for sellers but also encourages entirely new ways of.
Dorsey,Doing commerce and doing business and that's just on the seller side we have much more work to do.
Interviewer,On the cash up side which is super exciting as well i'd also add that you know there's sort.
Dorsey,Of an inherent respect for the development community because both jack and i are engineers.
Interviewer,So it's sort of odd to have a company founded by two technical folks but um you know i remember back.
Dorsey,Even when jack was working with me almost 30 years ago he was contributing uh to the open source community he was.
Interviewer,Writing for linux i remember uh twiddler the uh corded input device that you wrote a driver for.
Dorsey,Um and uh you know that plus open source has been an area of you know sort of.
Interviewer,Deep respect and so i think although we kind of came to it late uh i think we came to it well and i.
Dorsey,Think you see that respect in the products that square offers and the way we treat developers.
Interviewer,I want to switch now to talking about uh support and and how we think about the interactions.
Dorsey,That our sellers have with us as lauren mentioned i have the privilege of leading the customer success team.
Interviewer,Here at square so my team knows definitely how critical it is that we are providing great.
Dorsey,Experiences to our sellers and helping them through really critical time sensitive initiatives.
Interviewer,Um that are really challenging to their business so i'd love to hear from you what connections does square enable for.
Dorsey,Its sellers so i i think the most important thing that square does for the sellers is it.
Interviewer,Makes much of the tedium invisible in other words if you use square if you're part.
Dorsey,Of our ecosystem and you're running your business you can spend just a little more time focused on.
Interviewer,Your business as opposed to worrying about accounting withholding and you know paying off this.
Dorsey,Loan and managing all these various connections and one of the great uh tragedies.
Interviewer,That people experience is they're good at something they've got this skill and they say oh i'm good enough i'm going to.
Dorsey,Open a business and then when they open that business they realize that they don't get to.
Interviewer,Actually do the thing they're good at because they're buried with all this other stuff and so.
Dorsey,What we've always tried to do with square is is just sort of make those problems go.
Interviewer,Away and uh you know jack and always jack and i always discussed in the early days.
Dorsey,How the ultimate success would not be famous but would to be invisible to actually be this utility layer that.
Interviewer,Didn't get noticed and i think we still aspire to that and to the extent that people use our products without even.
Dorsey,Realizing how much is going into those products it's a big win i have anything to add there no i mean.
Interviewer,Our the name of our company kind of indicates what we want to be which is plain um.
Dorsey,Out of sight foundational pouring we we didn't want to put our brand before.
Interviewer,Our customers ultimately whether the customer be our seller or a developer.
Dorsey,We we wanted to fade into the background as much as we could and we chose the name accordingly it's a.
Interviewer,Boring brand by design um and uh you know when we were first.
Dorsey,Talking to our designers and brand people they got so upset and insulted that we.
Interviewer,Wanted to build a boring brand because their work is anything but but it takes a lot of work to build.
Dorsey,Something that is so a brand that is so foundational and um nondescript and invisible.
Interviewer,That it is apparent we had a lot going for us and just our hardware the shape of our reader.
Dorsey,Was our name the the structure of our first ipad register indicated the same shape even though it.
Interviewer,Wasn't exactly that so we relied a lot upon what people put on top of their counter.
Dorsey,To reference our brand more so than having a flashy name or something that was truly in your.
Interviewer,Face yeah if you're excited about your payment system it's probably negative.
Dorsey,Energy that's true very true uh jim i'd love to hear how do the connections that square.
Interviewer,Creates uh fit into the notion of the innovation stack.
Dorsey,So i was confounded by something that happened at square which is that we survived an attack by amazon when we.
Interviewer,Were still a startup and i couldn't answer the question.
Dorsey,How did we survive and so what i did was i went on this it was basically a two year research.
Interviewer,Quest looking at other companies that had been in the same situation and i discovered something that was.
Dorsey,Really interesting which was that all the companies that had been in similarly.
Interviewer,Deadly situations and had survived and thrived were all focused on very very small.
Dorsey,Customers and enabling people who had essentially been excluded from the market.
Interviewer,And this was true in banking it was true and furniture was true and in transportation and i found hundreds.
Dorsey,Of examples of of this phenomenon and and when i sort of dove down into it what i saw.
Interviewer,Was that at the core with something i sort of had to come up with a name for i called it an innovation stack and it's.
Dorsey,It's the mess that you have to create when you're doing something new and that was sort of the big insight of.
Interviewer,The book which is that square because we were trying to serve customers who were basically excluded.
Dorsey,From normal rails of commerce as as i was you know as a small glassblower but you.
Interviewer,Know as my friends were like i know it was to be left out and then when we started to.
Dorsey,Build tools for these people what we discovered was that the entire payments ecosystem assumed.
Interviewer,That people like our customers weren't there it just drew the line it.
Dorsey,Said we're not going to serve anybody below this line um and so what square does we started.
Interviewer,Building new tools for ourselves first to make these connections and that collection of tools became an innovation.
Dorsey,Stack and i saw this pattern again and again and again so that's why i wrote the book.
Interviewer,Was because it's this very powerful message which is to say that.
Dorsey,By serving the underserved you can create something that's so powerful that it can you know withstand an attack.
Interviewer,From a company like amazon and ultimately grow it into something that's very very significant.
Dorsey,Thanks for that one of the reasons i personally love working here at square is that we're a mission driven.
Interviewer,Organization with a strong purpose believing that the communities we serve are our most important foundation.
Dorsey,So i'd love to hear from the two of you on um how do the connection square creates um connect with the communities.
Interviewer,We serve or how should they well i i don't think it's any different.
Dorsey,From our customer focus like we have to we have to be in tune with like who we're serving and those people.
Interviewer,Are in tune with a particular community and those communities might intersect with a bunch.
Dorsey,Of other communities that we're not aware of so i think the simplest answer to your.
Interviewer,Question it's just like to be very customer focused and one of the challenges in building.
Dorsey,Square early on was you know jim had a glass factory and would blow glass and sell it but it.
Interviewer,Wasn't his every single day like the people we were serving they were trying to.
Dorsey,Build coffee stores and they were flight instructors and there were flower carts they're going out every.
Interviewer,Single day and selling something so we weren't our customers and when you are building something.
Dorsey,Where you are your customer the next step is fairly obvious when you're not the customer.
Interviewer,The the next step isn't as much so you have to observe a lot more you have to talk with our.
Dorsey,Customers a lot more you have to understand what they're trying to do.
Interviewer,And not take direction from them because if you take direction from them you tend to get into.
Dorsey,A a situation where you're building something for a very specific.
Interviewer,Niche instead of something that's more broad-based so it's observing patterns listening.
Dorsey,Learning like what connects all the dots and then adding our own opinions on top of it and.
Interviewer,Then building ahead of our customers expectations so we to really build up a muscle of.
Dorsey,Getting better at talking with who we serve on a more regular basis and that's why we put.
Interviewer,An emphasis on customer service early on in the company jim was often found in the headphones.
Dorsey,He's wearing right now on the phone with people who are angry at us.
Interviewer,Or in rare cases thrilled with us and um in every one of those conversations we learn.
Dorsey,Something and enough of those conversations informed decisions going forward.
Interviewer,Yeah having seller dna at the core of the company was super helpful uh for instance square didn't hold any.
Dorsey,Focus groups yeah there were like no one-way mirrors um in our early days and i still think.
Interviewer,Today um we stay in touch by a very organic connection to people.
Dorsey,And what their lives are like and how they run their businesses and how intertwined those things are and.
Interviewer,You know one of the things that we saw during the pandemic which i was super proud of.
Dorsey,Was how quickly square responded to this outcry i mean companies were being shut down.
Interviewer,Little businesses were like wiped out um but the thing about little businesses is they're incredibly adaptable.
Dorsey,As long as you give them the tools they need and square was literally on a cadence.
Interviewer,Of releasing a new product on a daily basis sometimes partially you know partial releases in.
Dorsey,The middle of the day it was it was so wonderful in the you know time of the tragedy to.
Interviewer,See a company that was still connected that closely to its customers they couldn't respond that fast.
Dorsey,Uh well as we talked about at the beginning of this session square was born out of gym being unable to process.
Interviewer,A payment um so how is our developer platform an extension of that initial spark.
Dorsey,And what does it mean for square now to have third party developers helping ensure that sellers never miss a payment.
Interviewer,I think it's less about that and more about we realize it's a self-awareness that we're.
Dorsey,Not going to be able to build everything and our value is only as good as who chooses to use us and what how they.
Interviewer,Choose to own what we build in their own way so in some cases it's it's very much you.
Dorsey,Know consumer focus where i'm gonna use what you have and i'll customize it my own way.
Interviewer,Based on the tools that you give me as you go a level deeper developers come in the mix.
Dorsey,And it might be a small business that has four locations that hires an independent developer to.
Interviewer,Do something that the software doesn't do but um the functionality in the api allows.
Dorsey,Or you go a level deeper than that and you create an entire company based on.
Interviewer,The platform but it should scale to every you know every foundational level along.
Dorsey,That so uh it's you know how do we how do we build a platform that enables people to.
Interviewer,As they get more sophisticated with their understanding of what they want they can build.
Dorsey,With complete optionality with complete freedom without having to think about us at all.
Interviewer,And you know i think in both gemiini our cases like as we've learned about technology we've been able to go deeper.
Dorsey,And deeper and deeper and deeper and as the technology unfolds gracefully you can make it more powerful.
Interviewer,And as people make it more powerful square becomes more viable to those developers those customers and.
Dorsey,Also to the world so the more we can open up the more we can um.
Interviewer,We can we can give back uh in whatever way the the more people we're going to be.
Dorsey,Able to serve ultimately jim anything to add there only that you know the.
Interviewer,The humility that you have to have if you start dealing with massive numbers of customers um is is.
Dorsey,Not lost on me or this company um the the needs of the individual.
Interviewer,Businesses these are really very specific and um i love the fact that we've got a.
Dorsey,Developer community right now that's helping us meet those needs better because as jack said we can't build for.
Interviewer,Everybody but we can give an api and expose the things that we need to do uh to make.
Dorsey,Them work and i was literally in a place a couple of weeks ago where somebody had uh.
Interviewer,They were not in the united states but they bought the square hardware because our hardware was so awesome that.
Dorsey,They were using the hardware uh because it was the thing that served their need in a little community that.
Interviewer,Had been just like devastated by the pandemic and i was happy to see that.
Dorsey,You know in that case they were able to pick something from our stack and make it work.
Interviewer,That's great well we're down to our very last question and it's a big bold question.
Dorsey,I'd love to hear from the two of you what is the 5 10 and even 100 year plan for square.
Interviewer,Um well i believe that anyone who has a firm understanding of what.
Dorsey,The next five years or 10 years or 100 years looks like or how they might build is probably wrong.
Interviewer,I think the more important thing is to understand the trends and i think the trends that will affect.
Dorsey,Us the most will be artificial intelligence will be cryptocurrency and bitcoin.
Interviewer,Having a native currency for the internet will be regulatory um issues both defensive and.
Dorsey,Proactive by various governments around the world those are the things that will impact our company our business our.
Interviewer,Customers the most um and it's not a question of like having a perfect roadmap or a vision for.
Dorsey,The next five or ten years it's more about being agile enough to understand.
Interviewer,This is the trend it's obvious here's what we're going to do with it are we going to.
Dorsey,Utilize it to our advantage are we going to react it react to it and block it in a particular.
Interviewer,Way are we going to ignore it at whatever cost it's it's that understanding.
Dorsey,That i think is the most important and um for us over the next five ten years it's to me.
Interviewer,Those are the biggest trends ai cryptocurrency bitcoin and um regulatory.
Dorsey,Yeah i would just say that you know the core of this is humility the thing that you want to not do is.
Interviewer,Think you know what the future's gonna hold because if you do that you'll end up.
Dorsey,Making decisions and then you tend to cling to your decisions uh when evidence tells you otherwise.
Interviewer,Uh and we've seen that you know in the last year uh played out uh i i have to really.
Dorsey,Compliment jack because before it was trendy to do remote work uh jack was at the.
Interviewer,Board of directors saying we're gonna have remote board meetings and all of our board members were like no no no.
Dorsey,We'll miss the dinners and you know larry summers gives great hugs you know and we didn't want to have this.
Interviewer,Um you know we didn't want to have our party broken up but jack was adamant.
Dorsey,That we needed to to do this and then lo and behold we got a pandemic and we don't miss a beat um uh.
Interviewer,The other thing i think is important and it's something that i watch uh through you know these little proxies is.
Dorsey,Is what's our cadence of shipping product what's a cadence of getting solutions out to customers and i've seen.
Interviewer,That cadence you know sort of tick up continually over time and that's so exciting.
Dorsey,Because what companies typically do is they get comfortable and then they go oh yeah we're just.
Interviewer,Going to sit here and ride it you know like when we started square we really looked for innovation in payments.
Dorsey,And we found nothing like the preceding decade was this complete blank as far as stuff that was.
Interviewer,Done uh and i'd say since then um square and companies.
Dorsey,You know that have been inspired hopefully by square have have really taken that innovation up and i.
Interviewer,Just love the fact that we got a developer community because that's just so many more brains.
Dorsey,On the problem although i i will say like that the year the year we started was a very.
Interviewer,Auspicious year because um 2008 2009 is when the global banking system.
Dorsey,Collapsed and we emerged from that and also bitcoin.
Interviewer,And all of cryptocurrency emerged from that moment so there was something in the air where the.
Dorsey,Financial system was ready to be questioned and we had a few answers and satoshi had a few.
Interviewer,Answers and others had more answers as well but there was something special about that.
Dorsey,Time that i think we'll carry forth for the next few decades that you know we're gonna.
Interviewer,We're all gonna learn from and i think will uh impact the world in a positive way.
Dorsey,Couldn't agree more very excited to see what's come down the road uh well thank you so much jack and jim.
Interviewer,For participating in this session and for all of you that are viewing it from home we appreciate you taking out.
Dorsey,The time to hear from square and our co-founder you.
