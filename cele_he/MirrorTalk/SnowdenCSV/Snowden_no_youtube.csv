Interviewer,There is very little information on private individuals the intelligence services cannot get access to.
Snowden,The reality is this
Interviewer,"Snowden waited to release the documents, hoping Obama would bring change."
Snowden,"Obama's campaign promises and election gave me faith that he would lead us toward fixing the problems he outlined in his quest for votes. Many Americans felt similarly. Unfortunately, shortly after assuming power, he closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guant√°namo, where men still sit without charge."
Interviewer,He fears that the US will stop at nothing to silence him.
Snowden,"All I can say right now is the US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me. Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped."
Interviewer,Snowden is confident he has the public on his side.
Snowden,"If the Obama administration responds with an even harsher hand against me, they can be assured that they'll soon find themselves facing an equally harsh public response."
Interviewer,But he is less impressed with the media response.
Snowden,"Initially I was very encouraged. Unfortunately, the mainstream media now seems far more interested in what I said when I was 17 or what my girlfriend looks like rather than, say, the largest program of suspicionless surveillance in human history."
Interviewer,Encryption offers protection.
Snowden,"Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on. Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it."
Interviewer,He isn't too upset about being called a traitor by Dick Cheney.
Snowden,"Being called a traitor by Dick Cheney is the highest honor you can give an American, and the more panicked talk we hear from people like him, Feinstein, and King, the better off we all are. If they had taught a class on how to be the kind of citizen Dick Cheney worries about, I would have finished high school."
Interviewer,And if Snowden had been planning to defect to China he'd be petting a phoenix right now.
Snowden,"The US media has a knee-jerk 'RED CHINA!' reaction to anything involving HK or the PRC, and is intended to distract from the issue of US government misconduct. Ask yourself"
Interviewer,Can you tell us about your interactions with journalists and the press?
Snowden,"One of the most challenging things about the changing nature of the public's relationship to media and the government's relationship to media is that media has never been stronger than it is now. At the same time, the press is less willing to use that sort of power and influence because of its increasing commercialization. There was this tradition that the media culture we had inherited from early broadcasts was intended to be a public service. Increasingly we've lost that, not simply in fact, but in ideal, particularly due to the 24-hour news cycle."
Interviewer,"Let's think about it in terms of your role in changing the world, which is presenting these new facts. There was a section of the technology press and the intelligence press who, at the time of the leaks, said we already know this, except it's hidden in plain sight. Yet, a year after you made the disclosures, there was a broad shift of public perception about surveillance technologies. That may recede, and probably post-Paris, it is receding a little bit. Are you frustrated that there isn't more long-term impact? Do you feel the world has not changed quickly enough?"
Snowden,"I actually don't feel that. I'm really optimistic about how things have gone, and I'm staggered by how much more impact there's been as a result of these revelations than I initially presumed. I'm famous for telling Alan Rusbridger that it would be a three-day story. You're sort of alluding to this idea that people don't really care, or that nothing has really changed. We've heard this in a number of different ways, but I think it actually has changed in a substantial way."
Interviewer,"Former Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson has said her paper definitely made mistakes, ""I wish we had not withheld stories."" What you're saying certainly resonates with what I know and understand of the recent history of the US press, which is that national security concerns post-9/11 really did alter the relationship of reporting, particularly with administration and authority in this country. What we know about drone programs comes from reporting, some of it comes from the story which The Intercept got hold of, and Jeremy Scahill's reporting on it, which has been incredibly important. But a great deal of it has also come from the ground level. The fact that we were aware at all that drones were blowing up villages, killing civilians, crossing borders where they were not supposed to be really comes from people who would report from the ground."
Snowden,"One of the biggest issues is that we have many more publishers competing for a finite, shrinking amount of attention span that's available. This is why we have the rise of these sort of hybrid publications, like a BuzzFeed, that create just an enormous amount of trash and cruft. They're doing AB testing and using scientific principles. Their content is specifically engineered to be more attention getting, even though they have no public value at all. They have no news value at all. Like here's 10 pictures of kittens that are so adorable. But then they develop a news line within the institution, and the idea is that they can drive traffic with this one line of stories, theoretically, and then get people to go over onto the other side."
Interviewer,"Yes, well that's the coming singularity between the creation of journalism and large-scale technology platforms, which are not intrinsically journalistic. In other words, they don't have a primary purpose."
Snowden,"They don't have a journalistic role, it's a reportorial role."
Interviewer,"Well, it's a commercial role, right? So when you came to Glenn and The Guardian, there wasn't a hesitation in knowing the primary role of the organization is to get that story to the outside world as securely and quickly as possible, avoiding prior restraint, protecting a source."
Snowden,I have an unfair advantage.
Interviewer,"You do, but still, that's a big change from 20 years ago."
Snowden,"This is something that we saw contemporary examples of in the public record in 2013. It was the James Rosen case where we saw the Department of Justice, and government more broadly, was abusing its powers to demand blanket records of email and call data, and the AP case where phone records for calls that were made from the bureaus of journalism were seized."
Interviewer,"Right, but that's kind of what happened with the reporting of the story."
Snowden,"And in ways that I didn't even predict, because who could imagine the way a story like that would actually get out of hand and go even further"
Interviewer,"You're actually giving a sophisticated analysis of much of what's happened to both reporting practice and media structures. As you say, you had no prior interactions with journalists. I think one of the reasons the press warmed to you was because you put faith in journalists, weirdly. You went in thinking I think I can trust these people, not just with your life, but with a huge responsibility. Then you spent an enormous amount of time, particularly with Glenn, Laura, and Ewen  in those hotel rooms. What was that reverse frisking process like as you were getting to know them? My experience is as people get closer to the press, they often like it less. Why would you trust journalists?"
Snowden,"This gets into the larger question-how did you feel about journalists, what was the process of becoming acquainted with them? There's both a political response and a practical response. Specifically about Glenn, I believe very strongly that there's no more important quality for a journalist than independence. That's independence of perspective, and particularly skepticism of claims. The more powerful the institution, the more skeptical one should be. There's an argument that was put forth by an earlier journalist, I.F. Stone"
Interviewer,"I hope they're not using Microsoft Office, but you never know."
Snowden,They have the blank page ....
Interviewer,"They have the blank page, exactly."
Snowden,"In their content management system, or whatever. How is that individual going to approach this collection of facts in the next week, in the next month, in the next year, in the next decade? What will the professor in the journalism school say in their lecture that will impart these values, again, sort of memetically into the next cohort of reporters? If we do not win on that, we have lost comprehensively. More fundamentally, people say, why did you trust the press, given their failures? Given the fact that I was, in fact, quite famous for criticizing the press."
Interviewer,"If they had done their job, you would be at home now."
Snowden,"Yeah, I would still be living quite comfortably in Hawaii."
Interviewer,"Which is not so bad, when you put it that way."
Snowden,"People ask how could you do this, why would you do this? How could you trust a journalist that you knew had no training at all in operational security to keep your identity safe because if they screw up, you're going to jail. The answer was that that was actually what I was expecting. I never expected to make it out of Hawaii. I was going to try my best, but my ultimate goal was simply to get this information back in the hands of the public. I felt that the only way that could be done meaningfully was through the press. If we can't have faith in the press, if we can't sort of take that leap of faith and either be served well by them, or underserved and have the press fail, we've already lost. You cannot have an open society without open communication. Ultimately, the test of open communication is a free press. If they can't look for information, if they can't contest the government's control of information, and ultimately print information-not just about government, but also about corporate interests, that has a deleterious impact on the preferences of power, on the prerogatives of power. You may have something, but I would argue it's not the traditional American democracy that I believed in."
Interviewer,"So nothing you experienced in the room with the team, or what happened after, made you question or reevaluate journalism?"
Snowden,"I didn't say that. Actually working more closely with the journalists has radically reshaped my understanding of journalism, and that continues through to today. I think you would agree that anybody who's worked in the news industry, either directly or even peripherally, has seen journalists-or, more directly, editors-who are terrified, who hold back a story, who don't want to publish a detail, who want to wait for the lawyers, who are concerned with liability."
Interviewer,When did that happen?
Snowden,"This was at the height of public interest, basically. The idea here is that a journalist ultimately, and particularly a certain class of journalist, they don't owe any allegiance to their source, right? They don't write the story in line with what the sources desires, they don't go about their publication schedule to benefit, or to detriment, in theory, the source at all. There are strong arguments that that's the way it should be"
Interviewer,Do you foresee a world where someone won't have to be a whistleblower in order to reveal the kinds of documents that you revealed? What kinds of internal mechanisms would that require on behalf of the government? What would that look like in the future?
Snowden,"That's a really interesting philosophical question. It doesn't come down to technical mechanisms, that comes down to culture. We've seen in the EU a number of reports from parliamentary bodies, from the Council of Europe, that said we need to protect whistleblowers, in particular national security whistleblowers. In the national context no country really wants to pass a law that allows individuals rightly, or wrongly, to embarrass the government. But can we provide an international framework for this? One would argue, particularly when espionage laws are being used to prosecute people, they already exist. That's why espionage, for example, is considered a political offense, because it's just a political crime, as they say. That's a fairly weak defense, or fairly weak justification, for not reforming whistleblower laws. Particularly when, throughout Western Europe they're going, yeah, we like this guy, he did a good thing. But if he shows up on the doorstep we're going to ship him back immediately, regardless of whether it's unlawful, just because the US is going to retaliate against us. It's extraordinary that the top members of German government have said this on the record-that it's realpolitik; it's about power, rather than principle."
Interviewer,"But Ed, when you talk about this in those terms, you make it sound as though you see this as a progression. Certainly there was a sharp increase, as you demonstrated, in overreach of oversight post-9/11. Is it a continuum?"
Snowden,"I don't think they are actually contradictory views to hold. I think what we're talking about are the natural inclinations of power and vice, what we can do to restrain it, to maintain a free society. So when we think about where things have gone in the USA Freedom Act, and when we look back at the 1970s, it was even worse in terms of the level of comfort that the government had that it could engage in abuses and get away with them. One of the most important legacies of 2013 is not anything that was necessarily published, but it was the impact of the publication on the culture of government. It was a confirmation coming quite quickly in the wake of the WikiLeaks stories, which were equally important in this regard. That said, secrecy will not hold forever. If you authorize a policy that is clearly contrary to law, you will eventually have to explain that."
Interviewer,What do you think about the relationship between governments asking Facebook and other communications platforms to help fight ISIS?
Snowden,"Should we basically deputize companies to become the policy enforcers of the world? When you put it in that context suddenly it becomes clear that this is not really a good idea, particularly because terrorism does not have a strong definition that's internationally recognized. If Facebook says, we will take down any post from anybody who the government says is a terrorist, as long as it comes from this government, suddenly they have to do that for the other government. The Chinese allegations of who is and who is not a terrorist are going to look radically different than what the FBI's are going to be. But if the companies try to be selective about them, say, well, we're only going to do this for one government, they immediately lose access to the markets of the other ones. So that doesn't work, and that's not a position companies want to be in."
Interviewer,And what are some of the positions you held previously within the intelligence community?
Snowden,"I've been a systems engineer, systems administrator, senior advisor for the Central Intelligence Agency, solutions consultant, and a telecommunications."
Interviewer,"One of the things people are going to be most interested in, in trying to understand what who you are and what you're thinking is, there came some point in time when you crossed this line of thinking about being a whistleblower, to making the choice to actually become a whistleblower. Walk people through that decision making process."
Snowden,"When you're in positions of privileged access, like a systems administrator for the sort of intelligence community agencies, you're exposed to a lot more information on a broader scale than the average employee, and because of that, you see things that maybe disturbing, but over the course of a normal person's career, you'd only see one or two of these instances. When you see everything, you see them on a more frequent basis, and you recognize that some of these things are actually abuses, and when you talk to people about them, in a place like this, where this is the normal state of business, people tend not to take them very seriously, and you know, move on from them. But over time, that awareness of the wrong-doing sort of builds up, and you feel compelled to talk about it, and the more you talk about it, the more you're ignored, the more you're told it's not a problem, until eventually you realize that these things need to be determined by the public, not by somebody who was simply hired by the government."
Interviewer,"Talk a little bit about how the American surveillance state actually functions, and does it target the actions of Americans."
Snowden,"NSA and the intelligence community in general is focused on getting intelligence where ever it can, by any means possible. It believes, on the grounds of, sort of, a self-certification that they serve the national interests. Originally we saw that focus very narrowly tailored, as foreign intelligence gathered over seas. Now increasingly we see that it's happening domestically. And to do that, they, the NSA specifically, targets the communications of everyone. It ingests them by default, it collects them in a system and it filters them and it analyzes them and it measures them and it stores them, for periods of time, simply because that's the easiest most efficient and most valuable way to achieve these ends. So while they may be intending to target someone with an association with a foreign government, or someone they suspect of terrorism, they're collecting your communications to do so. Any analyst, at any time, can target anyone; any selector, anywhere. Where those communications will be picked up depends on the range of the sensor networks, and the authorities that that analyst is empowered with. Not all analysts have the ability to target everything, but I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President, if I had a personal email."
Interviewer,"One of the extraordinary parts about this episode is that usually whistleblowers do what they do anonymously, take steps to remain anonymous for as long as they can which, they hope often, is forever. You on the other hand have decided to do the opposite, which is, to declare yourself openly as the person behind these disclosures. Why did you choose to do that?"
Snowden,"I think that the public is owed an explanation of the motivations behind the people who make these disclosures that are outside of the democratic model. When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to a democracy. And if you do that in secret consistently, as the government does when it wants to benefit from that secret action that it took, it'll kind of give it's official mandate to go, Hey, tell the press about this thing and that thing so the public is on our side, but they rarely, if ever, do that when an abuse occurs. That falls to individual citizens, but they're typically maligned, it becomes a thing of these people are against the country or against the government, but I'm not. I'm not different from anybody elseI don't have special skills. I'm just another guy who sits there, day to day, in the office and watches what's happening and goes, 'This is something that's not our place to decide. The public needs to decide whether these policies are right or wrong.' And I'm wiling to go on the record to defend the authenticity of them and say 'I didn't change these, I didn't modify the story. This is the truth, this is what's happening, you should decide whether we need to doing this.'."
Interviewer,"Have you given thought to what the US government's response to your conduct is, in terms of of what they might say about you, how they might try to depict you, what they might try to do to you?"
Snowden,"Yeah. I could be rendered by the CIA, I could have people come after me, or any of their third party partners, you know. They work closely with a number of other nations. Or, you know, they could pay off the Triads, or any, any of their agents or assets. We've got a CIA station just up the road in the consulate here in Hong Kong, and I'm sure they're going to be very busy for the next week. And that's a fear I'll live under for the rest of my life, however long that happens to be. You can't come forward against the world's most powerful intelligence agencies and be completely free from risk because they're such powerful adversaries that no one can meaningfully oppose them. If they want to get you, they'll get you in time. But, at the same time, you have to make a determination about what it is that's important to you, and if living unfreely but comfortably is something you're willing to acceptand I think many of us are, it's human natureyou can get up everyday, you can to go to work, you can collect your large paycheck, for relatively little work, against the public interest, and go to sleep at night after watching your shows. But, if you realize that that's the world you helped create, and it's going to get worse with the next generation and the next generation, who extend the capabilities of this sort of architecture of oppression, you realize that you might be willing to accept any risk, and it doesn't matter what the outcome is so long as the public gets to make their own decision about how that's applied."
Interviewer,Why should people care about surveillance?
Snowden,"Because even if you're not doing anything wrong, you're being watched and recorded. And the storage capability of these systems increases every year, consistently, by orders of magnitude. It's getting to the point where you don't have to have done anything wrong, you just eventually have to fall under suspicion from somebody, even if it's by a wrong call, and then they can use the system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision you've ever made, every friend you've ever discussed something with, and attack you on that basis to sort of derive suspicion from an innocent life and paint anyone in the context of a wrong-doer."
Interviewer,"We are currently sitting in a room in Hong Kong, which is where we are because you traveled here. Talk a little bit about why it is that you came here and, specifically, there are going to be people who will speculate that you intend to defect to the country that many see as the number one rival to the United States, which is China, and what you're really doing is essentially seeking to aid an enemy of the United States with which you intend to seek asylum. Can you talk a little bit about that?"
Snowden,"Sure. So there are a couple of assertions in those arguments that are sort of embedded in the questioning of the choice of Hong Kong. The first is that China is an enemy of the United States. It's not. I mean, there are conflicts between the United States government and the Chinese PRC government, but the peoples, inherently, we don't care, we trade with each other freely, we're not at war, we're not in armed conflict, and we're not trying to be we're the largest trading partners out there for each other. Additionally, Hong Kong has a strong tradition of free speech. People think, 'Oh, great China firewall.' Mainland China does have significant restrictions on free speech, but the people of Hong Kong have a long tradition of protesting in the streets, of making their views known; the internet is not filtered here, no more so than any Western government, and I believe that the Hong Kong government is actually independent in relation to a lot of leading Western governments."
Interviewer,"If your motive had been to harm the US and help its enemies, or if your motive had been personal material gain, were there things you could have done with these documents to advance those goals that you didn't end up doing?"
Snowden,"Oh, absolutely. Anybody in the position of access with the technical capabilities that I had could, you know, suck out secrets, pass them on the open market to Russia they always have an open door, as we do. I had access to the whole roster of everyone at the NSA, the entire intelligence community, and undercover assets all around the world, the locations of every station that we have, what their missions are, and so forth. If I had just wanted to harm the US, you could shut down the surveillance system in an afternoon. And I think for anyone making that argument, they need to think, if they were in my positionand you know, you live a privileged life, you're living in Hawaii, in paradise and making a ton of moneywhat would it take to make you leave everything behind? The greatest fear that I have regarding the outcome, for America, of these disclosures is that nothing will change. People will see in the media all of these disclosures, they'll see the lengths the government's going to to grant themselves powers unilaterally to create greater control over American society and global society, but they won't be willing to take the risks necessary to stand up and fight to change things, to force their representatives to actually take a stand in their interests. And the months ahead, the years ahead, it's only going to get worse until, eventually, there will be a time when policies will change, because the only thing that restricts the activities of the surveillance state is policy. Even our agreements with foreign governments, we consider that to be a stipulation of policy rather than a stipulation of law. And, because of that, a new leader will be elected, they'll flip the switch, say that because of the crisis, because of the dangers that we face in the worldsome new and unpredicted threat we need more authority, we need more power. And there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it and it will be turnkey tyranny."
Interviewer,What are some operational security practices you think everyone should adopt? Just useful stuff for average people.
Snowden,"Opsec is important even if you're not worried about the NSA. Because when you think about who the victims of surveillance are, on a day-to-day basis, you're thinking about people who are in abusive spousal relationships, you're thinking about people who are concerned about stalkers, you're thinking about children who are concerned about their parents overhearing things. It's to reclaim a level of privacy."
Interviewer,"What do you think about Tor? Do you think that everyone should be familiar with it, or do you think that it's only a use-it-if-you-need-it thing?"
Snowden,I think Tor is the most important privacy-enhancing technology project being used today. I use Tor personally all the time. We know it works from at least one anecdotal case that's fairly familiar to most people at this point. That's not to say that Tor is bulletproof. What Tor does is it provides a measure of security and allows you to disassociate your physical location. ....
Interviewer,"So that is all stuff that everybody should be doing. What about people who have exceptional threat models, like future intelligence-community whistleblowers, and other people who have nation-state adversaries? Maybe journalists, in some cases, or activists, or people like that?"
Snowden,So the first answer is that you can't learn this from a single article. The needs of every individual in a high-risk environment are different. And the capabilities of the adversary are constantly improving. The tooling changes as well.
Interviewer,"What about for people who are, like, in a repressive regime and are trying to ...."
Snowden,Use Tor.
Interviewer,Use Tor?
Snowden,"If you're not using Tor you're doing it wrong. Now, there is a counterpoint here where the use of privacy-enhancing technologies in certain areas can actually single you out for additional surveillance through the exercise of repressive measures. This is why it's so critical for developers who are working on security-enhancing tools to not make their protocols stand out."
Interviewer,"So you mentioned that what you want to spread are the principles of operational security. And you mentioned some of them, like need-to-know, compartmentalization. Can you talk more about what are the principles of operating securely?"
Snowden,"Almost every principle of operating security is to think about vulnerability. Think about what the risks of compromise are and how to mitigate them. In every step, in every action, in every point involved, in every point of decision, you have to stop and reflect and think, ""What would be the impact if my adversary were aware of my activities?"" If that impact is something that's not survivable, either you have to change or refrain from that activity, you have to mitigate that through some kind of tools or system to protect the information and reduce the risk of compromise, or ultimately, you have to accept the risk of discovery and have a plan to mitigate the response. Because sometimes you can't always keep something secret, but you can plan your response."
Interviewer,Are there principles of operational security that you think would be applicable to everyday life?
Snowden,"Yes, that's selective sharing. Everybody doesn't need to know everything about us. Your friend doesn't need to know what pharmacy you go to. Facebook doesn't need to know your password security questions. You don't need to have your mother's maiden name on your Facebook page, if that's what you use for recovering your password on Gmail. The idea here is that sharing is OK, but it should always be voluntary. It should be thoughtful, it should be things that are mutually beneficial to people that you're sharing with, and these aren't things that are simply taken from you."
Interviewer,Do you think people should use adblock software?
Snowden,"Yes. There's disk encryption attacks like evil maid attacks, and cold-boot attacks. There's all sorts of firmware attacks. There's BadUSB and BadBIOS, and baseband attacks on cellphones. All of these are probably unlikely to happen to many people very often. Is this something people should be concerned about? How do you go about deciding if you personally should be concerned about this sort of attack and try to defend against it?"
Interviewer,What sort of security tools are you currently excited about? What are you finding interesting?
Snowden,"I'll just namecheck Qubes here, just because it's interesting. I'm really excited about Qubes because the idea of VM-separating machines, requiring expensive, costly sandbox escapes to get persistence on a machine, is a big step up in terms of burdening the attacker with greater resource and sophistication requirements for maintaining a compromise. I'd love to see them continue this project. I'd love to see them make it more accessible and much more secure.."
Interviewer,People use smartphones a lot. What do you think about using a smartphone for secure communications?
Snowden,"Something that people forget about cellphones in general, of any type, is that you're leaving a permanent record of all of your physical locations as you move around. ... The problem with cellphones is they're basically always talking about you, even when you're not using them. That's not to say that everyone should burn their cellphones ... but you have to think about the context for your usage. Are you carrying a device that, by virtue of simply having it on your person, places you in a historic record in a place that you don't want to be associated with, even if it's something as simple as your place of worship?"
Interviewer,There are tons of software developers out there that would love to figure out how to end mass surveillance. What should they be doing with their time?
Snowden,"Mixed routing is one of the most important things that we need in terms of regular infrastructure because we haven't solved the problem of how to divorce the content of communication from the fact that it has occurred at all. To have real privacy you have to have both. Not just what you talked to your mother about, but the fact that you talked to your mother at all. ...."
Interviewer,"Ideally, governments around the world shouldn't be spying on everybody. But that's not really the case, so where do you think, what do you think the way to solve this problem is? Do you think it's all just encrypting everything, or do you think that trying to get Congress to pass new laws and trying to do policy stuff is equally as important? Where do you think the balance is between tech and policy to combat mass surveillance? And what do you think that Congress should do, or that people should be urging Congress to do?"
Snowden,"I think reform comes with many faces. There's legal reform, there's statutory reform more generally, there are the products and outcomes of judicial decisions. ... In the United States it has been held that these programs of mass surveillance, which were implemented secretly without the knowledge or the consent of the public, violate our rights, that they went too far, that they should end. And they have been modified or changed as a result. But there are many other programs, and many other countries, where these reforms have not yet had the impact that is so vital to free society. And in these contexts, in these situations, I believe that we do, as a community, as an open society, whether we're talking about ordinary citizens or the technological community specifically, we have to look for ways of enforcing human rights through any means."
Interviewer,"On a different note, people said I should ask about Twitter, how long have you had a Twitter account for?"
Snowden,Two weeks.
Interviewer,How many followers do you have?
Snowden,"A million and a half, I think."
Interviewer,That's a lot of followers. How are you liking being a Twitter user so far?
Snowden,I'm trying very hard not to mess up.
Interviewer,"You've been tweeting a lot lately, including in the middle of the night Moscow time."
Snowden,"Ha. I make no secret about the fact that I live on Eastern Standard Time. The majority of my work and associations, my political activism, still occurs in my home, in the United States. So it only really make sense that I work on the same hours."
Interviewer,Do you feel like Twitter is sucking away all your time? I mean I kind of have Twitter open all day long and I sometimes get sucked into flame wars. How is it affecting you?
Snowden,"There were a few days when people kept tweeting cats for almost an entire day. And I know I shouldn't, I have a lot of work to do, but I just couldn't stop looking at them."
Interviewer,"The real question is, what was your Twitter handle before this? Because you were obviously on Twitter. You know all the ins and outs."
Snowden,I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of other Twitter accounts.
Interviewer,"Now you said in the book you wish you had a strategy in terms of a what's next plan once you released those documents. You sit here six years later, in exile in Moscow where you say you don't want to be , was it worth it?"
Snowden,"It was. I mean when we look at all of these complexities and all of the consequences that we have as a result of any of the decisions that we go through in our lives. I think we realize that, look we see chances, opportunities in life when we get the chance to do something. And right now, in 2019, it's hard to look at the world and think nothing needs to change. But nothing changes just if we believe in something, we have to actually be willing to risk something. We have to actually be willing to stand for something."
Interviewer,"But you took an oath to the Constitution, Edward. You took an oath not to betray the country. You know the CIA has what you call an orientation, and indoctrination program, where they have a parade of horribles. And now you are on the list of parade of horribles, your picture is there."
Snowden,"Probably, yes, but that is actually an important point. I was required to swear into oath when I entered into duty in the CIA. It is a very solemn thing. You are in a darkened room in front of a flag, everyone else is there. But it is important to notice that we did not say an oath of secrecy. One of the common misconceptions in one of the earlier attacks, that we heard in 2015, that we don't hear of so much anymore is that I violated this oath of secrecy. That does not exist. There is a secrecy agreement, but there is also an oath of service. An oath of service is to support and defend, not an agency, not even the president, it is to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies , direct quote , foreign and domestic. And this begs the question, what happens when our obligations come into conflict, right? What happens when you have a secrecy agreement, but you have also witnessed your own government, your own agency, your workplace, violating the rights of Americans, and people around the world on a massive scale."
Interviewer,"Edward, this is a very personal book, Mr. Snowden. And as you've pointed out, growing up in the intelligence community, and your parents were in government. It wasn't easy for you to become personal here. But, I am curious, since you grew up in a community where almost everyone was somehow connected to government service, many of them FBI, did you approach your family at all about this? How did they react to it when you went through this process and how do they feel about it now?"
Snowden,"This was actually one of the hardest parts of coming forward, was that I couldn't talk to anyone about it. Because this is the bizarre sort of circumstance is the way that our laws are currently structured. In 2013, I was a contractor working for the NSA through a private company. I worked in the NSA facility, I had an NSA boss, I was working at NSA systems, doing NSA tasks. But, formally, just on paper, I worked for a private company. Now these contractors weren't covered by whistleblower protection laws. If I had tried to talk to a judge, a priest, a congressman, it would've been the same felony. If I talked to my family, it would've been the same felony. And of course, if I talked to a journalist, they considered telling the truth about talking about the government breaking the law is in itself a crime. And so, I couldn't tell anyone. I couldn't tell the love of my life, who is a central figure in this story, Lindsay Mills, my long time partner. Because if I had, the FBI could have charged her, as a part of the conspiracy. They could have charged her as sort of an accessory to the crime, so long as she didn't immediately after hearing from me, you know I'm thinking about talking about journalists, picked up the phone and said help, help, someone is going to talk to the press. And so that made it a very isolating experience."
Interviewer,"Edward, your formal employer at the NSA said they couldn't comment on your book because ongoing investigation. But, they did give us the following statement:Edward Snowden violated his life time obligation to protect classified information and betrayed the trust of his coworkers and the American people. Edward, do you acknowledge that you broke the law and that there are many people in this country that see your actions as traitorous?"
Snowden,"Well, I won't take a position on whether or not I broke the law because that's one for the lawyers. But what I will say is this. You know, it's not hard to make the argument that I broke the law, and I think that's actually the less interesting question. It's funny that whenever the government comes after me they say, you know, these disclosures cause harm. But they never justify the harm, they never show evidence for it. Even though, we are now more than six years on, it would be the easiest thing to show."
Interviewer,"To be fair, sorry to break in there. But on the question of harm. I don't know that you're, forgive me, but how are in a position to judge the harm in your disclosures. Isn't that something that the intelligence community would be uniquely situated to gauge."
Snowden,"Well, I would argue, that I worked for the US intelligence agency for a long time. I am the only one who knows the actually documents that the journalists have, and the ones that they published. We all know, and so it's available to all of us to assess the harms. And again, if they had some classified information. If they had some classified evidence that a hair on a single person's head was harmed, you know as well as I do, it would be on the front page of The New York Times by the end of the day. Because, leaking is not something that only happens to the people that are working to inform the press that are doing. It is also what the government does to sort of backstop their positions. They are authorized leaks, that happen all the time. That are not public interest whistleblowing, right. But back to that question of did I break the law. Again, what's the question that's more important here? Was the law broken or was that the right thing to do? If you look back at the history of the United States, it doesn't take very long for the average person to think about a moment in which it was absolutely illegal to do something. But at the same time, it was absolutely the same thing to do."
Interviewer,"You're living in Russia and have for some time now. As you've pointed out it's not where you want to be, it's where you're forced to be. Have the Russians ever asked for any information from you?"
Snowden,"This is actually a big scene in the book as soon as I landed. And for the audience that might be less familiar with the story, it was never my intention to be in Russia. I was actually transiting en route to Latin America. The United States government, for some reason , we don't know if it was intentionally to create kind of an evergreen political attack against me, guilt by association to be able to point to the Russian government , or they simply panicked when they saw that I might be, what they considered, escaping. They canceled my passport. When I landed, I could no longer travel. So I get pulled out of passport control and brought into a room. And yes! Directly. The Russian intelligence service was like, do you want to cooperate? Do you have any information? Life is going to be very hard if you don't have anyone on your side. And I said look, that's not how this is going to be. That is not how this is going to work. I do not have any information. You can search my bag if you want, because I destroyed my information before I got on the plane. I think that was probably what they expected, because remember, there's about 4,000 journalists downstairs looking for me in this airport at this moment. I'm on every tv channel, I'm on every newspaper. And I was just trying to continue on my journey into asylum. The reason that you know this actually happened, because you might be skeptical, you might think, Oh, well the Russians are just going to let this guy go. Russia has, uh, shall we say, a problematic human rights record, at a minimum. That's if we're being generous. When we look at the opportunities they have to do the right thing on the international stage, it seems pretty few and far between. But here's a circumstance when they don't have to do anything to do the right thing. All they have to do is not hand me over. Even despite the fact that Russia was, probably, the hardest place in the world for the CIA to operate. I didn't go, alright, this is great, let me out of the airport. I was stuck in that airport for 40 days."
Interviewer,"Do you have concerns, Edward, that."
Snowden,27 countries in the world.
Interviewer,"Russia is monitoring your actions today? Do you have concerns that they're gathering intelligence on you? Because the optics, as we sit here in America, looking at you in Russia, you know, the optics are not good."
Snowden,"No, you're absolutely right. You and I are on the same side on this issue."
Interviewer,"Then why don't you come home, Mr. Snowden?"
Snowden,"One of the big topics in Europe right now is should Germany and France invite me in to get asylum, that's how they're handling the response to this new book. But when you look at that kind of thing, of course it's problematic. Of course I would like to return to the United States. That is the ultimate goal. But if I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison, then one bottom line demand that we all have to agree to is at least I get a fair trial. That is the one thing the government has refused to guarantee because they won't provide me access to what's called a public interest defense."
Interviewer,"But Mr. Snowden, in all due respect."
Snowden,Go ahead.
Interviewer,"Mr. Snowden, in all due respect, criminals and alleged criminals barely get to decide the terms of their trial. They broke the law and they face the consequences. What makes you different?"
Snowden,"Well I'm not different. Again, I'm not asking for a parade. I'm not asking for a pardon. I'm not asking for a pass. What I'm asking for is a fair trial. And this is the bottom line that any American should require. We don't want people thrown in prison without the jury being able to decide that what they did was right or wrong. The government wants to have a different kind of trial. They want to use special procedures. They want to be able to close the court room. They want the public not to be able to know what's going on. And essentially, the most important fact to the government, and this is the thing we have a point of contention on, is that they do not want the jury to be able to consider the motivations , why I did what I did. Was it better for the United States? Did it benefit us? Or did it cause harm? They don't want the jury to be able to consider that at all. They want the jury strictly to consider whether these actions were lawful or unlawful not whether they were right or wrong. I'm sorry but that defeats the purpose of a jury trial."
Interviewer,"You were able to steal 1.5 million documents which is an astounding number, do you think that could be done today?"
Snowden,First off that's not correct (laughs). That's the government's number. And all of the journalists that have been handling this archive for years have said that's not accurate.
Interviewer,What is the number?
Snowden,I think that's especially troubling.
Interviewer,"Yeah, what is the number?"
Snowden,"Well, you're asking a privacy advocate for private information. Of course that's not going to go very well. But good try. What I will say is this:I gathered a lot of information about what I believed was evidence of criminal activity on the part of the United States government's unconstitutional programs. And simply, things that were problematic, that were ethically questionable. And I provided these to journalists. And this is critical here, the number of documents that I published is zero. So when the government says 'I caused harm' what do they mean by that? What they mean is the press, having access to things the government didn't want the public to know, decided and made an institutional judgement and these are some of the most trusted institutions in journalism, like The Washington Post. And these guys said the public has a right to know this, and I required them as a condition , these journalists , as a condition of access to this archive of material, to make an agreement that they'd publish no story simply because it was interesting, no story simply because it was newsworthy. They could only publish stories they said were in the public interest to know. And as an extraordinary measure on top of this, to sort of reconstruct the system of checks and balances that have failed internally in government between the executive and legislative and judicial branches, the journalists would then in advance of publication, warn the government about the story they were about to break. They would give the government an adversarial stage in the process and argue against this, saying you guys don't understand this, or Snowden's a liar, or these documents are fake, or even if it's absolutely right, somebody will be hurt as a result of this, and so they could always make these arguments in the publication process. As far as I understand, this process was followed for all the publications. And that is why I am so confident now, in 2019, that despite the evergreen sort-of allegations of government, whenever any whistleblower comes up, they say, it causes harm, it causes harm, it causes harm, we have never seen any evidence of that. And just one last point on that , because I think it is especially critical. Just remember the history of this , we have always seen that in this country. When the country , not the country. When the government is embarrassed after being caught breaking the law, they say the people who revealed that lawbreaking have caused serious harm to national security. This was the case of Daniel Ellsberg way back in the Vietnam War with the Pentagon Papers which was the classified history of the government's role in Vietnam. Now Ellsberg."
Interviewer,Alright.
Snowden,when Ellsberg revealed this they said he was the most dangerous man.
Interviewer,We can't go back into that history.
Snowden,"No, no, no, we are not going back."
Interviewer,Wrap it up.
Snowden,It's just a central point.
Interviewer,Yes you are.
Snowden,"It's just a central principle here. What harms the country? Is it a war built on lies? Or is it the revelation of those lies? Is it the construction of a system of mass surveillance that violates our rights? Or is it the revelation of that by the newspapers that we trust? If we can't trust newspapers, if we can't agree on the basic facts and then have a discussion, about whether this was right or wrong, not what's lawful or unlawful, we're losing our position as a democracy and as a government that is controlled by the people, rather than people that are controlled by the government."
Interviewer,"Alright Edward Snowden, it's interesting you said newspapers released it, but you gave the information to the newspapers to release, minor detail there. We thank you very much for taking."
Snowden,Absolutely.
Interviewer,We thank you for taking the time.
Snowden,Absolutely.
Interviewer,The story's not over. Thank you.
Snowden,You're very professional.
Interviewer,"Well, you know, people are like, ""How do you live?"" and things like that. They might be taking money from the Russians. Of course, the answer's no, but I do this for a living. I speak. I don't have a YouTube channel where I'm Joe Rogan, but I give speeches at universities and things like that. I do a lot of interviews, so I've got my own setup."
Snowden,"We're recording now, right? Is it possible that you could do a YouTube channel? Would that work?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, if you introduced me so like I get followers, yeah, we could do that."
Snowden,Dude! I'm all in! That could absolutely happen. Do you want to do that? Is that something you want to do?
Interviewer,"No, I mean this is a big question. I came on because I had just written a book called Permanent Record, which is the story of my life because that's what publishers make you do when you're writing your first book, but it's more than that because I didn't just want to talk about me. It's actually about the changing of technology and the changing of government in this sort of post 9/11 era, which our generation just sort of happened to be growing up during."
Snowden,"was at the CIA and the NSA all this stuff, but the day that the book came out, the government hit me with a lawsuit, and they hit the publisher of the books with a lawsuit because they don't want to see books like this get written. They especially don't want to see books like this get read, so the big thing was, we didn't know where this was going. We didn't know what was going to happen and my publisher, of course, wanted me very badly to let people know this book existed in case the government leaned harder and harder and harder. We didn't know where that's going."
Interviewer,"e government is still pursuing that case quite strongly. They're more focused on the financial censorship side of it, basically taking any money that I made from it, kind of as a warning to the others and getting a legal judgment against the publisher, saying you can't pay this guy, that kind of thing, more so than taking the book off the shelves, but that's not because they're okay with the book being on the shelves. It's because, thankfully, we've got the First Amendment, so they can't. That's a very rare and good thing."
Snowden,"yway, in the context of that, they were like, ""Well, what about Joe Rogan?"" I'd heard about you at this point, but the only thing that I had really seen that I really understood, had familiarity with, was you talking to Bernie Sanders which, by the way, I very much appreciated hearing then because a lot of people don't give the guy time to talk."
Interviewer,"ah. To hear him in those soundbites, you don't really get an understanding of who he actually is."
Snowden,"ght, and this is the other thing. They're like, well, you can go on all these major network shows, and I did a couple of them. I did a morning show, I did Brian Williams but, broadly, the media, the sort of more corporatized media, as we might say, is exactly what you just described, right? They want you to be able to answer in like eight, 15 seconds, or less. When we're talking about big, massive shifts in society, when we're talking about power, when we're talking about technology and how it controls and influences us in the future, you can't have a meaningful conversation within those constraints."
Interviewer,"Instead, these guys all want to say, repeat these long discredited sort of criticisms. I'm sure you'll ask the same thing, and that's okay. They're fair questions, but it's like we can't have the conversation if we can't have the space to think and breathe and have this sort of discussion. Anyway, they mentioned you, and I was like, ""Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan. Where do I know this name from before Bernie Sanders?"" I looked back through my Twitter mentions, and the funny thing is, your fans have been harassing me to death for like the last year. Wonderful people. Wonderful people. ""Go on Joe Rogan! Go on Joe Rogan!""."
Snowden,"I remember after I had just made a Twitter account. Neil deGrasse Tyson actually helped me get on Twitter, gave me that little initial boost. They said Joe Rogan, so they linked you, and I mouse over your name because I use a desktop and not mobile for this because of security reasons, and it pops up and I get your avatar, man. I have to say, your logo is the worst thing in the world for people who are trying to be politically serious, and they're worried about the National Security Advisor condemning them because this bald guy with this maniacal grin and like the third eye on his forehead, and I'm like, ""Oh, man, that show!"" That doesn't look good, but it's actually when you watch what you do, it's great stuff, man."
Interviewer,"It's great, but that first impression, this almost didn't happen, but everybody who has talked to you, everybody who watches your show, I think they get a very different impression than how you're painted. For me, it's a wonderful thing because nobody understands that better than I do. The government ran a smear campaign against me endlessly for six months when I came forward in June of 2013. I know we got way off topic here. I'll get back to it."
Snowden,Fun! There's no such thing as off topic. We could talk about whatever.
Interviewer,"Great. Okay, so for those people, first off, who have no idea who the hell I am, I'm the guy who was behind the revelations of global mass surveillance in 2013. I worked for the CIA. I worked for the NSA as a contractor at the NSA, staff officer at the CIA. I was under cover working at embassies. I talk about the difference between this and a book and contractor and government official and how it's all sort of lost its meaning, but I saw something wrong, and I saw basically the government was violating the law and what I believe to be the Constitution of the United States and, more broadly, human rights for everyone in the United States and around the world."
Snowden,"There were domestic surveillance programs. There were mass surveillance programs that worked internationally. Basically, everything that they could monitor, they were monitoring, and this is actually like, people go, ""Well, isn't that obvious? Isn't that what they're supposed to do?"" This is weird, but the answer actually is no. Under the framework of our constitution, the government is only supposed to be monitoring people that it has an individualized, particularized suspicion of wrongdoing. We think about this in the investigative means, right?"
Interviewer,"All those TV shows where they go and get a warrant, the reason they have to do that, like we fought a revolution over this a couple of hundred years back, is the idea that, when we had kings, when we had governments with absolute power, they could simply go in your home and go, ""Is this guy a pot smoker?"", get his diary, whatever it is and, if you find evidence of a crime, you march him off to prison and it's all good. You found evidence they're a criminal or you didn't find evidence. Well, no harm, no foul. You're just doing what government does."
Snowden,"We were trying to build a better system where, ""Yes, the government has extraordinary capabilities, but it only uses them where they're necessary, where they're proportionate to the threat that is presented by this person. We shouldn't be afraid of the person who's got a baggie of weed in their dresser or something like that. That is not a threat to national security. That is not a threat to public safety."
Interviewer,"What happened in the wake of 9/11 was a whole bunch of government officials got together behind closed doors, and this was actually led, interestingly enough, by the Vice President of the United States, Cheney. Everybody remembers that name or, hopefully, can look that name up, Dick Cheney, and his personal attorney, sort of the Giuliani of Dick Cheney, a guy named David Addington."
Snowden,"This lawyer, David Addington, wrote a secret legal interpretation that no one else was allowed to see. It was kept in the Vice President's safe at the White House. They weren't giving this... Even when they told people, and it was just a couple of people in Congress... Nancy Pelosi was one of them and a couple of these other folks. When they talked to the heads of the agency at the NSA and the CIA and the FBI and all this stuff, they told them, the White House and the Office of Legal Counsel and the president's attorneys. All of these guys had decided this would be legal to do, but we can't tell you why, we can't show you the legal authorization for it. You just got to take our word for it, so they did this."
Interviewer,"This became a mass surveillance program called Stellar Wind, which they said was supposed to monitor the phone calls and internet communications, emails and things like that of everybody in the United States and around the world who they could get access to for links to Al-Qaeda because, if you remember in the wake of the September 11th attacks, they were saying, ""We thought there could be sleeper cells of Al-Qaeda."" They were just peppered all throughout the country, and they were going to spring up at any moment. Of course, like weapons of mass destruction, it just didn't exist. It was all a power grab."
Snowden,"On that basis, they started doing this in secret, and it was completely unconstitutional. It was completely illegal, even under the very loose requirements of the Patriot Act, but they did it for so long that they got comfortable with it, and they thought, ""You know, this is a really powerful capability. What if we started using this for stuff that was other than terrorism?"" because it wasn't finding any terrorists because there weren't any terrorists in this context that they were looking for them."
Interviewer,"The ones where there were terrorists, the program wasn't effective because these were guys in Pakistan that weren't using email and phone calls. They were getting on a moped with their cousin who was a courier who was bringing a letter to his guy who runs the food stand or whatever. Bit by bit, over time, this grew and grew and grew, and there were scandals. If you want to drill down on these later, I'll go into them, but what happened was, step by step by step, our constitutional rights were changed, and we weren't allowed to know it. We were never granted a vote on it, and even the many members of Congress, 535 in the United States, they were prohibited from knowing this. Instead, they told only a few select people."
Snowden,"In the original case, there were only eight members of Congress, called the Gang of Eight, who knew about this. Then, there were the people on the Intelligence Committees, both in the Senate and the House, who were told about this, but they were only told partially about it. They weren't told the full scope of it. Now that they had been told about it because they had security clearances and things like that, they weren't allowed to tell anybody else, even if they objected to it."
Interviewer,"We had one senator, Ron Wyden, and another one, Tom Udall was the name of him, who did object to this and who wanted something to happen but, because they couldn't tell anybody that it was happening, they were sort of doing these weird Lassie barks to the press where they were like, ""We have grave concerns about the way these programs are being carried out,"" but nobody knew what they were talking about. Journalists were like, ""You know they've got concerns. What is that, Lassie? What are you trying to say?"" Timmy's said, ""Well,"" but they were getting it wrong. They couldn't tell what was happening, so what had happened was that we, the American people, had sort of lost our seat at the table of government."
Snowden,"We were no longer partnered to government. We had simply become subject to government, and I think everybody who's in the world today who is aware of what's going on, whether it's under this administration, the last administration, the one before that, they have seen a constant kind of shift where we, the public, have less say and less influence over the policy of government with each passing year. There's kind of a new class that's being created, a government class and then the public civil class that are held to different standards of behavior. When we start talking about leaking and whistleblowing, this becomes even more clear."
Interviewer,"So, what I did was, I wanted to clarify that kind of Lassie bark. I just wanted everybody to know what was going on. I didn't want to say, ""The government can't do this."" I didn't want to say, ""This is how you guys have to live"" because that's not for me to say, but I do believe that everybody in the United States and, more broadly, people in the world who are having their rights violated by government, should have at least an understanding of how that is happening, what the authorities, sort of the policies and programs that are enabling that are so that they can protest them, so that they can cast a vote about them, so that they can say, ""You know what? You guys say this is okay, but I disagree that this is not okay. I object, and I want things to change.""."
Snowden,"So, I gathered evidence of what I believed to be criminal or unconstitutional activity on the part of the government, and I gave this to journalists, right? Now, I gave this to journalists under a very strict condition here, which was that they publish no story in this archives of information simply because it was interesting, no click bait, not anything just because they thought it would make news, it would get them awards. They would only publish stories that they were willing to make an institutional judgment and stand behind, and this was three different newspapers, that it was in the public interest to know."
Interviewer,"So, then beyond that, there was additional, because if you could see sort of what I was doing here, what had happened, what had led us into this pitfall was that the system of checks and balances that's supposed to self-regulate our government had failed. The courts had abdicated their role in policing the executive in the Congress. Because terrorism was such a hot argument at the time, they were worried about being criticized and blamed if something went wrong and an attack did go through, and they didn't have access to the information that the programs were ineffective, so they were just taking the government's word for it. They didn't want to wade in."
Snowden,"Congress, most of them didn't even know, right? The ones who did know, it was the same thing. They were getting their pockets stuffed with money by the defense contractors that were getting rich for building these systems, or violating the rights of each of us. So, they benefited by just saying nothing, and then the executive themselves, whether we're talking about Bush, whether we're talking about Obama, or whether we're talking about Trump now, all these guys were okay with the constantly growing surveillance state because they're the ones whose hands were on the level at the time they got to aim it. They got to use it."
Interviewer,"If you had a little search box in front of you, they would give you the email history of everybody in the United States, anybody you want, if you could pull up their text messages, anybody you want, if you could see anything they ever typed into that Google search box. Joe, what is the worst thing you've ever typed into that search box? That lasts forever, and they have a record of that. They can get that from Google. This was the whole thing."
Snowden,"How do we correct for that? When you have somebody who wants to inform the public of something, and we'll get into the proper channels arguments later, but you can't go through the institution to get these corrected because the institution knows it's wrong and is doing it anyway. That's the whole origin of the program is, they want to do something that they're not allowed to do. What do you do? So, I didn't want to say, ""I'm the President of Secrets."" I didn't want to just put this stuff on the internet, and I could have. I'm a technologist, right?"
Interviewer,"I worked with the journalists and then, to create an adversarial step, someone who would argue against what I believed and, hopefully, what the journalists believed once they consulted the documents and basically authenticated them, can we get the government to play that role? So, before the journalists published any story,... This is a controversial thing."
Snowden,"People still criticize me for this, actually. They say I was too accommodating of government, and they could be right, is that the journalists would go to the government and give them warning and say, ""We're about to run this story about this secret program that says you did X,Y,&Z bad thing. One, is that right? Two, is this going to cause harm. Is anybody going to get hurt? Is this program effective? Is there something we don't understand? Is there something Snowden doesn't understand? Does this guy just not get it? Are these documents fake? Whatever you want, say we shouldn't run this story.""."
Interviewer,"In every case I'm aware of, that process was followed, and that's why because there's a lot of people out there who don't like me, who criticize me, who go, ""This was unsafe. This caused harm to people"" or whatever. We're in 2019 now. I came forward, and these stories won the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism, starting back in June of 2013. We've had six years to show bodies. We've had six years to show harm, and you know as well as I do, the government's happy to leak things when it's in their interest. Nobody has been hurt as a result of these disclosures because everyone who was involved in them was so careful."
Snowden,"We wanted to maximize the public benefit while mitigating the potential risks, and I think we did a pretty good job. Just to get back to the main thing, the original thing that got us off on that trail, when I came forward in June of 2013, I gave one interview to the people who were in the room with the documents, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald, Ewan McCaskill. I said who I was. I said why I was doing this. I said what this was about, why it matters, and that we were constructing a system of turnkey tyranny. Even if you trust that to Obama, you never know whose hand is going to be on that key next, and all they have to do is turn it and there's nothing we can do to stop it."
Interviewer,"The only thing that's restraining these programs, really, is policy more so than law, and the president at any time can sign a napkin and those policies change. After that, I went six months without giving any interviews because I didn't want people to talk about me. I wanted them to talk about what actually mattered, and the government, of course, was trying very hard to change the conversation, as they always do, to be about who is this guy, what've they done, what's wrong with them, what are their problems, who is this loony guy so they can controversialize the source of a story rather than having to confront the story itself."
Snowden,"That's why I said I really kind of appreciate your take on the media and everything like that because, when you don't tell your story, other people will tell it for you. They'll say so many things about you, and they'll have these misimpressions, like I did, because of something as stupid as the avatar that you were using on Twitter where I think it's a certain kind of show with a certain kind of guy, and it's this crazy stuff but, when I actually listen to you, when I actually look at the facts, and when I hear you just speak, I go, ""Actually, this is a thoughtful guy. Actually, this is somebody who does care, who does want to look at these things deeply,"" and appearances and our first impressions can be very misleading."
Interviewer,I work hard on that. I try to mislead people. It's good. It works to my advantage.
Snowden,"You're doing a good job, man."
Interviewer,"Thank you. I want to bring it back to when you first started with the NSA. You started as a contractor, right? What was your initial impression and when did you know that things were really squirrely with the programs you were ."
Snowden,"I'm not saying this to put you on the spot. I know you've been a busy guy. I know you have done I think shows recently. You come back from a break, right? Have you read the book, because it'll just help me put things in frame?"
Interviewer,Your book?
Snowden,"If you haven't got a chance to read it, yeah, my book."
Interviewer,"No, I have not read your book or got a copy of it."
Snowden,"Okay, well, I will send you a signed copy, brother."
Interviewer,Beautiful. Thank you.
Snowden,"I hope you'll read it, and I hope you will enjoy it. All right, so, I had a really weird history in the intelligence community. I grew up in a federal family, in the shadow of Fort Meade, all these little suburban communities in Maryland where, basically, the entire industry of the state is the federal government, of all these different agencies and then all the subcontractors, all the defense industries that serve that government and really are kind of our war-making machine, our system of control for the country and the world, broadly. All that stuff spreads in a couple hundred mile radius out of DC."
Interviewer,"My mother worked for the district courts, rather the federal courts, and it's kind of funny because she still works there, and those are the courts that are trying to throw me in jail for the rest of my life now. My father worked for the Coast Guard, retired after 30 years. My grandfather was an admiral, and then he worked for the FBI. As far back as it goes, my family, my whole line of family, even generations back, was working for the government, so it was pretty ordinary, pretty expected for me to go into the same kind of work."
Snowden,"Now, I started, I wasn't super successful in school because I felt, and this is the most arrogant thing in the world that anybody says, that I had more to learn from computers than I did from biology class, so I spent more and more time focusing on technology. Then, I got mono, and I dropped out of high school. Now, it's like, all right, how do I make this up? I say drop out of high school, but I'm actually going to community college. They called it concurrent enrollment where I'm not taking any classes at high school. I'm going to community college instead and I'm not doing that great there, either. It's fine. I'm enjoying it, but school is school. I can't wait to be grown."
Interviewer,You were bored.
Snowden,"Yeah. I think a lot of people have felt that, but I ran into somebody at the community college who ran their own home-based business doing web design, and they could see I was kind of technical, and they went, ""Hey, do you want to work for me?"" I was like, ""Well, that sounds great,"" so I started doing web design really, really early on. This is like, gosh, I don't know, probably 1998 vintage during the big boom and then the collapse that followed. The funny thing is, she worked, she was married to an NSA analyst, a linguist, so she lived on Fort Meade, and she ran her business out of their home on Fort Mead that's right up the street from the NSA."
Interviewer,"So, before I'm even working there, I'm driving past this building all of the time and trying to figure out what the next step is going to be. I enjoy this. It's a good thing for me, and it works well. I start getting trained and certified, all these little industry stamps you've got to get as a technologist to say, ""Oh, you know this program"" or whatever and just start climbing the ladder, but then 9/11 happens, and I'm on Fort Meade when 9/11 happens. I'm just going in to work, and I tell this in the book in some detail, and I think it's very much worth reading for people who don't know this because this is forgotten history. Nobody...."
Snowden,How old were you at the time?
Interviewer,"Gosh, I was born in '83, so I was probably 18 years old. Yeah, I had just turned 18 a couple months before. What people forget is who knew what was going on before anybody else on September 11th? The intelligence community, right? What did they do? Did they get out a public warning? Did they tell you guys to evacuate? Did they say do this, that, or the other? No, no, not for everybody, not for a long time but, at the NSA, then Director Michael Hayden, he was a general, he later became Director of the CIA, ordered the entire campus evacuated of thousands, tens of thousands of people actually. He just said, ""Go home."" The CIA did the same thing."
Snowden,"They were running on skeleton crews at the moment the country needed them more than they ever had, and I get a call, well, I hear a call that's from my boss's wife, her husband to her. He's calling from the NSA and saying, "" Hey, you know, I think Ed should leave for the day because I'm the only employee in this business besides her because I think they're going to close the base down."" I'm like, ""This is crazy! It never closes down."" We don't know what's happening. Then, we start checking the news, which is through websites because we're doing all this stuff and, suddenly, it's the big story everywhere. You know, nobody understands how big it is yet."
Interviewer,"Most of us are like, ""Oh, it's going to mess with our workday. Oh, it's going to mess with our commute"" but, when I'm leaving, I hear car horns all over the base. It's the craziest thing because this is a military base, right? It's right outside the NSA, and I entered just this absolute state of pandemonium as I go past Canine Road, which is the road that travels right in front of the NSA's headquarters. It's just a parking lot as far as you can see. They have military police out under the stoplights directing traffic because there's this massive evacuation, and I still have no idea what's happening. The story is still developing, but I will never forget that image."
Snowden,"Why did these people have so much power and so much money and so much authority that, at the moments we need them the most, they're the first ones in the country that are leaving their buildings. Later on, they said, and this is covered in a book, I believe. I think it's James Bamford who interviewed that Director of NSA who gave that order about what was happening. He was going, well, you know, he called his wife and he was asking where their kids were and everything like that and then, after that, he wanted to think about where could these other planes that they knew were in the area that hadn't struck yet, where could they be headed?"
Interviewer,"This sort of shows how self-centric the intelligence community is. This is the DC Metro area, right? They could hit the White House, they could hit Congress, they could hit the Supreme Court, and they go, ""Oh, they're going to fly their planes into the CIA Headquarters"" or, ""They're going to fly their planes into the NSA Headquarters."" Of course, it was never realistic that these would be the targets but, on that basis, they were like, ""Ooh, let's get our bacon out of the pan.""."
Snowden,But why....
Interviewer,I don't say this....
Snowden,"I'm sorry, but just in the interest of... Wasn't it possible that they could've attacked those places? I mean, they attacked the Pentagon. They knew that there were attacks."
Interviewer,"Look, it's absolutely possible they could have attacked your Denny's, but it's a question of risk assessment. If you have planes in the air, if you believe there's an ongoing terrorist attack that's happening in the United States right now and if you have built history's greatest surveillance agencies, the most powerful intelligence forces in the history of the species, you are going to take those off the board, or at least the majority of their personnel off the board then in a chance that you have no sort of grounds for substantiating that they could be targeting you?"
Snowden,"To begin with, simply because they could? Well, somebody else will get hit with those. As you say, it's going to be the Pentagon. It's going to be the World Trade Center. It's going to be someone, somewhere, and the more minutes you're in front of that desk, the higher the chance is, even if it's a very small chance, even if it's somebody who doesn't work on terrorism, maybe if it's somebody who normally works finance in North Korea, but they go, ""Look, this is an emergency.""."
Interviewer,"Everybody understands. You don't need to explain this. You just go stop what you're doing, look at financial transactions related to who purchased these plane tickets, do this... You just go full spectrum and do anything you can do right now. If the building gets hit, we get hit. That's what we signed up for. Nobody wants that. That's not the desired outcome but, if they had asked the staff to do that, they all would've agreed. That's what these people signed up to do and yet, the director goes, ""No. Just no. We're not going to take that ri-... ""."
Snowden,"It says so much about the bureaucratic character of how government works, the people who rise to the top of these governments. It's about risk management for them. It's about never being criticized for something, and this is, if we want to get really controversial, and this is something that'll haunt me because people will bring it up again and again and again, people ask about... People still criticize me. In the book, I talk about aliens and chemtrails and things like that and the fact that there's no evidence for that. I went looking on the network, right? I know, Joe, I know you want there to be aliens."
Interviewer,I do.
Snowden,"I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly wants there to be aliens, and there probably are, but the idea that we're hiding them... If we are hiding them, I had ridiculous access to the networks at the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups. I couldn't find anything so, if it's hidden, and it could be hidden, it's hidden really damn well, even from people who are on the inside. The main thing is conspiracy theories, right? Everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it helps life make sense. It helps us believe that somebody is in control, that somebody is called the shots, that these things all happen for a reason, this, that, and the other."
Interviewer,"There are real conspiracies, but they're not typically that they've got tens of thousands of people working on them unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence community itself, which is basically constructed on the idea that you can get, I think there's four million or 1.4 million people in the United States who hold security clearances, and you can get all of these people to not talk ever to journalists or this, that, or the other."
Snowden,"When you look back at the 9/11 report and when you look back at the history of what actually happened, what we can prove, not what we can speculate on, but what are at least t commonly agreed facts, it's very clear to me that someone who worked in the intelligence community, not during this period, of course, I was too young, but very shortly thereafter that these attacks could've been prevented. In fact, the government says this too, but the government goes, the reason that these attacks happened, the reasons that they were prevented is, what they call, stovepiping. There was not enough sharing."
Interviewer,"They needed to break down the walls and the restrictions that were chaining these poor patriots at the NSA and the CIA and FBI from all working on the same team. To some extent, they're correct on this. There were limits on the way agencies were supposed to play ball with each other, but I worked there, and I know how much of this is bullshit and how much of this is not. Those are procedural and policy limits, in some cases legal limits on what can be shared without following a process, without doing this, that, or the other, without basically asking for permission, without getting a signoff or anything like that."
Snowden,"If the FBI wanted to send absolutely everything they had to the CIA, they could've done so. If the CIA wanted to send everything they had to the FBI, they could've done so. They didn't, and people died as a result. Now, government goes bureaucratic proceduralism was responsible, and it's because we had too many restrictions on the intelligence community, and this is what led to the world post 9/11 where all of our rights...."
Interviewer,"on the intelligence community, and this is what led to the world post-9/11 where all of our rights sort of evaporated was they went, ""Well, restrictions on what these agencies can do are costing lives. Therefore, naturally we just have to unchain these guys and everything will be better. Right?""."
Snowden,"And if you remember that post-9/11 moment, you can understand how that actually could come off as persuasive. How that might be a kind of thing you go, ""All right, well, will that make sense?"" Because everybody was terrified, right? There were people quite quickly who got their heads back on their shoulders the right way. There were some of them who never lost their heads at all and who protested the Iraq War. At the same time, my dumb self was signing up to go fight it. Volunteering for the Army. We'll get into that in a minute."
Interviewer,"But everything that has followed in the decades past came from the fact that in a moment of fear, we lost our heads and we abandoned all the traditional constitutional restraints that we had put on these agencies, and we abandoned all of the traditional political restraints, and just social constraints, ideological systems of belief about the limitations that the secret police should have in a free and open society."
Snowden,"And we went, ""Look, terrorists."" We created shows like 24 and Jack Bauer where he's threatening to knife people's eyeballs out if they won't tell them this, that, or the other. And we entered this era of increasingly unlimited government as a result. And now in hindsight we go, ""Well, we shouldn't have been surprised."" But at the time, everyone panicked, right?"
Interviewer,"But if you go back to, did that help? And we know the answer now is in fact, no it did not. It made things worse. I don't think any historian is going to look at the Bush administration and go, ""This improved the position of the United States in the world."" But if you wind back the tape to that pre-9/11 moment, wind back the tape to those silos and those walls that they said needed to come down because that was restraining government. Instead of the rules, they said, ""Well, you can share these things, but there's got to be a basis. There's got to be a justification."" You've got to go, ""Why are we trading people's information like baseball cards and all of this stuff?""."
Snowden,"It's super easy as an intelligence officer to justify sharing information about a suspected terrorist who you think is planning to kill people, or is even just in a country they shouldn't be, or a place they shouldn't be, or doing something you don't think they should be with another agency, because no one's going to question that. A judge isn't going to question that. Any judge in the world will stamp that warrant without even thinking about it and then go to bed that night without a care in the world. Because you're not spying on a journalist, you're not spying on human rights defender, right? This is not an edge case. This is someone that you believe to be associated with al Qaeda or whatever. Now, this is all a lot of preamble to say that essential fact. The government agrees, everyone agrees the attacks probably could have been prevented if information had been shared. So, why wasn't the information shared? The government says information wasn't shared because of these restrictions. And it's half true, because every important lie has some criminal truth to it. And there were these barriers."
Interviewer,"But the reality is, why were those barriers respected in the case of a major terrorist plot? Why wasn't the CIA sharing information with the FBI? Why wasn't the FBI sharing information with the NSA? Why wasn't the NSA sharing information with the CIA in the case of a major terrorist plot?"
Snowden,"And if you've worked in government, if you've worked in the intelligence community, if you work in any large institution, you know? If you work at a company that sells batteries, you know that every office is fighting the other office for budget, for clout, for promotions, and this is the sad reality of what actually happened."
Interviewer,"Every one of those agencies wanted to be the guy who busted the plot. They wanted to be the one who got credit for it, and they didn't realize how serious it was until it was too late because they were competing with each other rather than cooperating."
Snowden,"That's exactly what I was going to ask you, if that was the issue. The competition between these agencies, because they are very proud of the CIA accomplishing something, or the FBI accomplishing something, and they want to be the one to take credit for that."
Interviewer,"Yeah. And I mean, I think it's important in their defense, because nobody else here is going to provide a defense for them, is that that's actually darkly human. Again, this happens in every industry, this happens in every sort of big corporate thing because you want to get promoted, and everybody's putting in their achievements at the end of the year for what they did, and if you're the guy who does that, you're going straight to the top."
Snowden,But their solution instead of-.
Interviewer,But this was the-.
Snowden,So we have a weird delay here-.
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,... for folks that are listening.
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,"So their solution, instead of having someone be responsible for bridging the gap and providing that information to each individual agency, their solution was mass surveillance?"
Interviewer,"Well, no. They're different things. 9/11 is what woke these guys up."
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,"Basically. And they went, ""Well, we screwed up and Americans died as a result. We really don't want to take the hit on that."" And to be honest, the government had no interest in putting the hit on them. To be honest, the public had no interest in putting the hit on them at the time because everybody understood, terrorism is a real thing. There are bad people in the world, and that's true, right? That will always be true. There's always going to be criminals, there's always going to be terrorists, whether they're at your church, whether they're across the ocean, there are people out there who are angry, they're disenfranchised, they're violent, and they just want to harm something. They want to change something even in a negative way because that's what they feel is all they have left."
Snowden,"Which these are criminals, right? These are people that we don't need to pity. But if we ever want to stop it, we do need to understand it and where those things come from, where there's these drives come from in the first place. But basically everybody went, ""All right, how do we stop this?"" Because nobody wants to feel unsafe. Nobody wants to feel like the building's going to come down the next time you go in it. And so everybody just went, ""I don't care who does it, stop it."" And they said this to Dick Cheney, which is a historic mistake because Dick Cheney knows how government works. He was the person in that White House who was best placed to know all the levers of government, all the interagency cooperation, where we were strong, where we were weak, what we could do, what we were not allowed to do."
Interviewer,"And what he did was he took that little dial on what we're not allowed to do and he changed it all the way until it broke and snapped off, and then there was nothing that we couldn't do anymore."
Snowden,And you were there while this was happening. This was-.
Interviewer,"No, I was not. Again, this is in 2001. I was 18 years old. I was working on the base, I had drove past the building, but that was it. This is all hindsight. This is biography. This is documented history, but this is not the gospel of Edward Snowden. I don't know this, right? This is public record."
Snowden,Okay.
Interviewer,This is what we all know.
Snowden,"What we have though, the reason that I bring this up is this is a teachable moment because there's so many people right now in the Trump administration who go, ""Look, this guy has too much power. He's abusing it against immigrants. He's abusing it against domestic opponents. He's doing whatever. He's trying to hurt political rivals in the next election,"" all of this stuff."
Interviewer,"And we can get into this stuff later if you want in detail, but the bottom line is they're going, ""This is a guy who's in the White House who's throwing elbows, right? He doesn't really care. He wants to hurt people as long as he can convince the Americans that those are the bad guys, right? That's the enemy. It doesn't matter if they're far away. It doesn't matter if they're close at home, whoever he's against, he's going to harm.""."
Snowden,"And the dark thing is, this is actually why he was elected. In moments of fear where the world starts falling apart, and this happens in authoritarian country after country. This is why you have Vladimir Putin in Russia who's been there for 20 years, right? President for basically 20 years. Think about that. He sort of skipped in the middle there because he had to dodge the fact that presidents can only serve so many consecutive terms. So he dropped down to prime minister and then came back as president. But think about that. How do you get that kind of political longevity? And it's because, if you know anything about Russian history, which even I don't know that much about it, the 90s after the collapse of the Soviet Union were an extraordinarily dark time. If you look at Russian cinema, all they had were gangster movies, right? All they had were the disintegration of society, how things are dark and broken, no one trusts each other, pensions were no longer being paid. Social security's not there anymore. There's nothing to buy, there's nothing to do, there's no job. No one had a future."
Interviewer,"And so they went, ""If there's somebody who can lead us out of this, if there's somebody who will fix this, who will find us an enemy and defeat that enemy to restore prosperity, we'll put them in office."" We see it happen in Turkey with Erdogan, right? We've seen it happen successively with bad governments even in Western democracies. We see it happening, sadly, in places like Poland and Hungary. You can even argue it's happening in the United Kingdom, right? And now there are a lot of people arguing that's exactly what we're seeing with Donald Trump's White House in the United States. And this is the lesson that we didn't learn from 2001 is when we become fearful, we become vulnerable, right? To anyone who promises they will make things better, even if they have no ability to make things better, even if they will actively make things worse, even if they will make things better for themselves and their buddies by taking from you, but if they tell you that they'll make things better and you believe them in a moment of fear, that typically leads to unfortunate outcomes."
Snowden,"So, sorry, let me turn this back over to you because we got way off track there."
Interviewer,"No, that's all right. I want to bring it back to the initial question. So you're working for the NSA, when do you realize there's a huge issue-."
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,"... and when do you feel this responsibility to let the American people know about this issue? When do you contact these journalists, and what was the thought process regarding this? What steps did you go through once you realized that this was in violation of the Constitution, and that even with the laws of the PATRIOT Act and the PATRIOT Act II, things had changed so radically that you knew this was wrong and you had to do something about it, or you felt a responsibility to speak out?"
Snowden,"Okay. So since we gave so much historical preamble, let me just give the CliffsNotes version-."
Interviewer,Okay.
Snowden,"... to get us up to that. So after September 11th, I'm a little bit lost."
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,"I'm doing my technical stuff, but it doesn't really feel like it matters anymore. I'm making more money, I'm becoming more accomplished, but the world's on fire, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,"You remember, there was a crazy mood of patriotism in the country because we were all trying to come together and get through it. You remember people were sticking Dixie cups in the top of every chain link fence on every overpass that was like, ""Stand together. Never forget. United we stand.""."
Interviewer,Flags on every car.
Snowden,Exactly.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Snowden,"And I was a young guy who is not especially political, right? And I come from a military background, federal family, all that stuff, and so that means I'm very vulnerable to this kind of stuff. I see it on the news and Bush and all his sort of cronies are going, ""Look, it's al Qaeda, it's terrorist organization, they have all these international connections. There's Iraq, dictators, weapons of mass destruction, they're holding the world at ransom."" You got Colin Powell at the UN dangling little vials of fake anthrax."
Interviewer,"And so I felt an obligation to do my part, and so I volunteered to join the Army. You probably can't tell from looking at me, but I'm not going to be at the top of the MMA circuit anytime soon, so it didn't work out. I joined a special program that was called the 18XRAY Program where they take you in off the street and they actually give you a shot at becoming a Special Forces soldier."
Snowden,"So you train harder in special platoons, you go further, and I ended up breaking my legs basically. So they put me out under-."
Interviewer,Both your legs?
Snowden,"... a special discharge. Yeah, basically what it was, they were shin splints that I was too dumb to get off of, right? So I kept marching under weight and I'm a pretty light guy to begin with, I had a 24-inch waist when I joined the Army."
Interviewer,Girls are jealous.
Snowden,"Yeah. I think I weighed like 128 pounds. I was in great shape in bootcamp because I came up really quick because all I could do was gain, but it was just too much on my frame because I wasn't that active."
Interviewer,"And so when you keep running on a stress injury, right? And you're running under weight with rucksacks and things like that, and you're running in boots and then you're doing a exercise, and the Army is a whole chapter in the book. You've got your battle buddy, right? Because they never allow you to be alone, you've always got to have somebody watching you."
Snowden,"They thought it was funny to put me, the smallest guy in the platoon, the drill sergeants did, with the biggest dude in the platoon who was like an amateur bodybuilder. He was like 230 or 260, something like that. He was a big fellow. And so he would, when we're off in the woods doing these marches and things like that and we have to practice buddy carries, like the fireman's carry and things like that, he throws me around his neck. I'm like a towel, he's just skipping down like it's nothing. And then I got to put him on me and I'm just like, ""Oh God,"" dying. And it was weirdly fun. I enjoyed it, but it was no good for my body."
Interviewer,"And so in a land navigation movement, I step off a log because I was on point, and on the other side of the log, because it's the woods in Georgia at Sand Hill, I see a snake. And so in my memory, it's like time slows down. Because North Carolina, where I grew up, you think all snakes are poisonous."
Snowden,It just popped up.
Interviewer,Speaker 1:.
Snowden, that's fine.
Interviewer,"Okay. Sorry, there's an issue."
Snowden,Do we need to take a break?
Interviewer,No. We're good. We're good. We're good.
Snowden,It's completely fine.
Interviewer,No we're fine.
Snowden,All right.
Interviewer,There was something that happened on the screen and I wanted to make sure it was okay.
Snowden,Oh that's just the FBI joining the chat.
Interviewer,"That's what I was worried about, there's a second image opened up here."
Snowden,"Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, I tried to take a much longer step in mid-air, I land badly and it's just one leg is like fire. I'm limping, I'm limping, I'm limping. But everybody says don't go to sick call, because if you go to sick call, you'll lose your slot, you'll end up in general infantry or regular infantry."
Interviewer,"And so I go back, I just tough it out. I get in my rack. And the next morning when I get out of the rack, which is the top bunk bed, right? I jumped out and my legs, they just give out underneath me, and I try to get up and I just can't get up. And so I go to sick call and I end up going to the hospital and they end up x-raying me. And they also x-rayed my battle buddy because I got to go there with somebody else, and he has a broken hip where they had to bring him to surgery. And it's in the book, there's a lot more detail about it, it was kind of a dramatic moment."
Snowden,"But for me, they just said I had bilateral tibial fractures, right? All the way up my legs. They said I had spiderwebs and the next free phase of the training was jump school, right? Where you've got to jump out of a plane. And the doctor is like, ""Son, if you jump on those legs, they're going to turn into powder."" And he's like, ""I can hold you back. We can put you for like six months, you stay off them, then you can go back through the whole cycle, right? Start basic from scratch, but you'll lose your slot in the Special Forces pipeline because of the way these things are scheduled and everything like that. And then you'll basically be reassigned to the needs of the Army,"" which probably meant I was going back to IT, which was what I joined the Army to kind of escape, "" Or you can go out on this special kind of discharge that's called an administrative discharge, right?""."
Interviewer,"Normally you've got honorable discharge, dishonorable discharge, things like that. This is something for people who have been in for I think less than six months where it's like annulling a marriage. It's as if it never happened. It's as if you never joined. And at the time I was like, ""Wow, that's very kind of him to do that."" And I took it. They sent me to sick call or sort of the sick bay where you're in the medical platoon and you do nothing for, it was I think about a month, and then they let you out once the paperwork all finishes."
Snowden,"But in hindsight I realized that if you take an administrative discharge, it exempts the Army for liability for your injuries. So actually what I thought it was a kindness a was just, now if I had future problems with my legs, they wouldn't have to cover it or health insurance or any of those things. And it was just a funny thing."
Interviewer,"But anyway, I get out of the Army and here I'm on crutches for a long time and just sort of trying to figure out, ""All right, well what's next in life?"" Because I had gotten a basic security clearance just for going through signing up for the military process, I applied for a security guard position at the University of Maryland because it said you had to get a top secret clearance, which was a higher clearance than I had at the time. And I went, ""Well that sounds good,"" because I knew if I combined my IT skills, which were now suddenly much more relevant again to my future, with a top secret security clearance because of the way it works, if you have a top secret security clearance and tech skills, you get paid a ridiculous amount of money for doing very little work."
Snowden,"So I was like, ""All right, well I can basically make twice what I would be making in the private sector working for government at this level, at this phase."" Because what we talked about earlier with September 11th and how the intelligence community changed, they no longer cared that I hadn't graduated from college, right? And I had gotten a GED just by going in and taking a test. So for government purposes, it was the same as if I was a high school graduate."
Interviewer,"So now suddenly it was like these doors were opened. This University of Maryland facility turned out to be an NSA facility. It was called CASL, the Center for the Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland College Park. And all I was was literally a a security guy walking around with a walkie talkie, making sure nobody breaks in at night, managing the electronic alarm system and things like that."
Snowden,"But once I had my foot in the door there, I could start climbing the ladder step-by-step, and I applied for ... or I went to a job fair, actually, that was only for people who had security clearances. And I ended up going to the table for one of the technical companies, it was a little tiny subcontractor nobody's ever heard of, and they said, ""We've got tons of positions for somebody like you. Are you comfortable working nights?"" And I was like, ""Yeah, I wake up in the middle of the day anyway, that's fine with me.""."
Interviewer,"And suddenly I've gone from working for the NSA through a university in a weird way where it's like the NSA holds the clearance, but I'm formally an employee of the State of Maryland at the college and this is government man, it's all these weird dodges and boondoggles for how people are employed there. Now suddenly, I'm working at CIA headquarters, right? The place where all the movies show, you swoop over the marble seal and everything like that. I'm the king of the castle, right? I'm there at the middle of the night when no one else is there, the lights are on motion sensors. It's the creepiest thing in the world. There's flags on the wall that are just gently billowing in the air conditioning like ghosts. The hallway lights up as you walk alongside it-."
Snowden,Whoa.
Interviewer,"... because it's a green building, and they disappear behind you. And there's no one there. I can go down to the gym at like 2:00 in the morning at the CIA and not see a soul on the other side of the building and then go all the way back. And this kind of thing was my in because they were like, ""Look, it's the night shift. Nothing that bad is going to happen."" But it was on a very senior technical team that was basically handling systems administration for everybody in the Washington metropolitan area, right?"
Snowden,"So every basically CIA server, this is a computer system that data is stored on, that reporting is stored, that traffic is moved on, all of this stuff. Suddenly me, this is circa 2005 I think, I'm in charge of, and it's just me and one other guy on the night shift. And if you're interested in the book, there's a lot of detail on this, but I get sort of scouted from this position because they realize I actually know a lot about technology. They were expecting me just to basically make sure the building doesn't burn down, all these systems don't go down overnight and then never come back up."
Interviewer,"But they go, ""Well, are you willing to go overseas?"" And to a young man at that age that's actually like, ""Hey, that sounds kind of exciting."" Who doesn't want to go work overseas for the CIA? And there's a lot of people listening to the podcast who are like, ""Not me.""."
Snowden,I'm one of them.
Interviewer,"Because they're like, ""Wait, the CIA's the bad guys, right?"" Yeah, exactly. They're like, ""What are you going to go overthrow a government somewhere?"" But you have to understand that I'm still very much a true believer. The government is the living compressed embodiment of truth and goodness and light, the shining city on the hill. So I want to do my part to spread that to the world."
Snowden,"I didn't have skepticism is really what I'm trying to establish here. And so I sign up and I go through this special training school, like people hear in movies about The Farm, which is down at Camp Peary in Virginia. I'm sent to this actually much more secret facility called the Hill, which is in Warrenton, Virginia. And this has been covered a few times in open source media, but I think this is one of the few book-length discussions of what happens there in permanent record."
Interviewer,"But yeah, so I go through training and then I get assigned overseas and I end up in Geneva, Switzerland undercover as a diplomat, right? I think my formal title for the embassy is something super bland like diplomatic attach√©, and what I am is I'm a forward deployed tech guy. They send you through this school to make you into kind of a MacGyver, right?"
Snowden,"Yes, you can handle all the computers, but you can also handle the connections for the embassy's power systems, right? The actual electrical connections. You can handle the HVAC systems, right? You can handle locks and alarms and security systems. Basically anything that's got an on button on it at the embassy that's secure now you're responsible for, and I traveled from Geneva to other countries in Europe for sort of assignments, and it was an exciting time. I actually still enjoyed it, but this was where I first, working with intelligence, started to get doubts."
Interviewer,"And the story has been told many times so I won't go over it in full detail here, but the CIA does primarily, and it's not the only thing they do, what's called human intelligence. Now there are many different types of intelligence the intelligence community is responsible for. The primary ones are human intelligence and signals intelligence. You want to think of signals intelligence, right? As tapping lines, hacking computers, all of these sort of things that provide electronic information or anything that's a digital or analog signal that can be intercepted and then turned into information."
Snowden,"Human intelligence is all that fun stuff we've heard of the CIA doing for decades and decades, which is where they try to turn people. Basically they say, ""Look, we'll give you money if you sell out your country."" It's not even your country a lot of times, it's your organization. These guys could be working for a telecommunications provider and they want to sell customer records, or they work at a bank, which was the thing that I saw, and we wanted records on the bank's customers so we wanted a guy on the inside."
Interviewer,"But anyway, that's sort of how it works. And what I saw was they were way more aggressive for the lowest stakes than was reasonable or responsible. They were totally willing to destroy somebody's life just on the off chance they would get some information that wouldn't even be tremendously valuable. And so, ethically, that struck me as a bit off, but I let it pass because what I've learned over my life, short though it's been, is that skepticism is something that needs to build up over time. It's a skill, something that needs to be practiced. Or you can think of it as something that you develop through exposure, right?"
Snowden,"nd of like radiation poisoning, but in a positive way. It's when you start to realize inconsistencies or hypocrisy or lies, and you notice them and you give somebody the benefit of the doubt or you trust them or you think it's all right, but then over time you see it's not an isolated instance, it's a pattern behavior. And over time, that exposure to inconsistency builds and builds and builds until it's something that you can no longer ignore."
Interviewer,"w, after the CIA, I went to the NSA in Japan where I was working there in Tokyo. And then from there, a couple years later, I went to the CIA again. Now I was working as private employee for Dell, but I was the senior technical official on Dell's sales account to the CIA. People in these big companies, they have sales accounts to the CIA. And so this means I'm going in, and now ... it's crazy because I'm still a very young man, but I'm sitting across the table from chiefs of these enormous CIA divisions. I'm sitting across from their chief technology officer for the entire agency or the chief information officer for the entire CIA."
Snowden,"(0 d these guys are going, ""Look, here's our problems, here's what we want to do,"" and it's my job to pitch them a system, right? And I'm paired up with this sales guy, and the whole thing is just to go, ""How much money can we get out of the government?"" Right? That's the whole goal and we'll build them ... what we were pitching was a private cloud system, right? Everybody knows about cloud computing now. It's why your Gmail account is available wherever you go. It's why Facebook has this massive system of records for everyone everywhere."
Interviewer,"(0 e government wanted to have these kinds of capabilities too. Dell ended up getting beat out by Amazon. Some people aren't familiar with this, many of them are, but Amazon runs a secret cloud system for the government. I forget what they've rebranded it now, but there's this massive connection between industry and government in the classified space that just goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper."
Snowden,"But at this point I was already ... I had misgivings because of what I'd seen in Japan about government, but I was just trying to get by. I was trying to ignore the conflicts. I was trying to ignore the inconsistencies, and I think this is a state that a lot of people in these large institutions, not just in our country, but around the world, struggle with every day, right? They've got a job, they've got a family, they've got bills. They're just trying to get by, and they know that some of the things they're doing are not good things. They know some of the things that they're doing are actively wrong, but they know what happens to people who rock the boat."
Interviewer,"Eventually I changed my mind. And when I had gone to Hawaii, which was the final position in my career with the intelligence community, I was ... because of an accident of history here, I wasn't supposed to be in this position at all. I was supposed to be at a group called the National Threat Operation Center, NTOC."
Snowden,"But because of the way contracting works, and again, this is covered in the book, I ended up being reassigned to this little rinky-dink office that nobody's ever heard of in Hawaii called the Office of Information Sharing. And I'm replacing this old-timer who's about to retire, really, really nice guy. But he's spent most of his days just reading novels and doing nothing and letting people be content to the fact ... or letting people forget that his office existed, because he was the only one in it. There's a manager who's over him, but it's actually over a larger group and he just looks over him as sort of a favor."
Interviewer,"So now I come in and now I'm the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing. But I'm not close enough to retirement that I'm okay with just doing nothing at all. So I get ambitious and I come up with this idea for a new system called the Heartbeat, and what the Heartbeat is going to do is connect to basically every information repository in the intelligence community, both at the NSA and across network boundaries, which you normally can't cross. But because I had worked at both the CIA and the NSA, I knew the network well enough, both sides of it, sides that normal workers at the NSA would never have seen because you have to be in one or the other."
Snowden,"I could actually connect these together, I could build bridges across this kind of network space, and then draw all of these records into a new kind of system that was supposed to look at your digital ID. Basically your sort of ID card that says, ""This is who I am. I work for this agency, I work in this office, these are my assignments, these are my group affiliations."" And because of that, the system would be able to eventually aggregate records that were relevant to your job, that were related to you, and then it can provide them, and basically you could hit this site and it would be an update of what we used to call [inaudible boards, which were manually created."
Interviewer,"Then it would go, look, you work in network defense, right? These are all the things that are happening on network defense. You work on, I don't know, economic takeovers in Guatemala, this is what's going on for you there. But in my off time, I helped the team that sat next to me, which was a systems administration team for Windows networks because I had been a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, which means basically I knew how to take care of Windows networks. And this was all those guys did, and they always had way too much work, way too much work, and I had basically no work that I needed to do at all, because all I was supposed to do was share information, which was not something that was particularly in demand because most people already knew what they wanted or what they needed."
Snowden,"So basically, my job was to sit there and collect a paycheck unless I wanted to get ambitious. And so I did some side gigs for these other guys, and one of them was running what were called dirty word searches. Now dirty word-."
Interviewer,"Now dirty word searches are ... Let me dial this back cause I know we're sort of, this is hard to track. Everything that the NSA does, in large part, is classified. Everything the CIA does, in large part, is classified. If I made lunch plans with other people in my office, it was classified. That was the policy. It's dumb. This over classification problem is one of the central flaws in government right now. This is the reason we don't understand what they're doing. This is why they can get a away way. This is why they can get away with breaking the law or violating our rights for so long, five years, 10 years, 1550 years before we see what they were doing. It's because of this routine classification, right? Every system, computer system has a limit on what level of classified information is supposed to be stored on it. We've got all these complicated systems for code words and caveats that establish a system of what's called compartmentation. This is the idea when you work at the CIA, when you work at the NSA, you're not supposed to know what's happening in the office next to you, right? Because you don't have need to know. Right? Again, that thing from the movies. The reason they have this is they don't want one person to be able to go and know everything and tell everybody everything. They don't want anybody to know too much, particularly when they're doing lots of bad things, because then there's the risk that you realize they're doing so many bad things that it's past the point that we can justify. They might develop ideological objection to that."
Snowden,"Well, in the Office of Information Sharing, and actually in basically every part of my career, before that, I had access to everything. I had what was called a special caveat on my accesses called PRIVAC, which means privileged access. What this means is your kind of super user. Most people have all of these controls on the information they can access, but I'm in charge of this system, right? People who need information, they have to get it from somewhere. They don't know. Even the director of the CIA right? He says, ""I need to know everything about this."" Well, he doesn't know where to get it. He's just a manager. Somebody has to be able to actually cross these thresholds and get those things. That guy was me."
Interviewer,"Dirty word searches were these automated queries that I would set up to go across the whole network and look at all of the different levels of classification and compartmentation and exceptionally controlled information. You can think of it as above top secret in these special compartments where you're not even supposed to know what these compartments are for. You only know the code word unless you work in them, unless you have access to them, unless you're read into them."
Snowden,"One day I get a hit on the dirty word search for a program that I'd never heard of called Stellar Wind. It came back because the little caveat for it, they're called handling caveats, which is like you can think of like burn after reading or for your eyes only, but this one's called STLW, which means Stellar Wind. Unless you know what Stellar Wind is, you don't know how to handle it. All I knew was it wasn't supposed to be on my system. I went, ""This is a little bit unusual.""."
Interviewer,"It turned out this document was placed on the system because one of the employees who had worked on this program years before had come to Hawaii. This person was a lawyer, I believe. They had worked in the Inspector General's office and they had compiled a report, part of the Inspector General's report, which is when the government is investigating itself, into the operations and activities of this program. Well, this was the domestic mass surveillance program that I talked about in the very beginning of our conversation. It started under the Bush White House. Stellar Wind was no longer supposed to be really an operation. It had been unveiled and a big scandal in December 2005 in the New York Times by journalist, James Risen and I'm not going to name him, because I don't want to get it wrong, another journalist, you can look at the byline now if you want to see their involvement. There's a lot of history here too. What they had found was of course the Bush White House had constructed a warrantless wiretapping program, if you remember the warrantless wiretapping scandal, that was affecting everyone in the United States."
Snowden,"Well, the Bush White House was really put in a difficult position by the scandal. They would have lost the election over this scandal, because the New York Times actually had this story in October 2004 which was the election year. They were ready to go with it. At this specific request to the White House, talking to the publisher of the New York Times, Sulzberger and Bill Keller then the executive editor of the New York Times, the New York Times said, ""We won't run the story because the president just said, 'if you run this story a month before the election,' that's very tight margin if you recall, 'you'll have blood on your hands.'"" It was so close in 2001, the New York Times just went, ""You know what? Fine. Americans don't need to know that the Constitution should be violated. They don't need to know that the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean what they think it means. If the government says it's all right. It's a secret. You shouldn't know about it, that's fine.""."
Interviewer,"Now, December, 2005 why did that change? Why did the New York Times suddenly run this story? Well, it's because James Risen, the reporter who found this story had written a book. He was about to publish this book. The New York Times was about to be in a very uncomfortable position of having to explain why they didn't run this story and how they got scooped by their own journalists. And so they finally did it, but it was too late. Bush had been reelected. Now it was sweeping up the broken glass of our lost rights."
Snowden,"Congress, the Bush White House, was very effective. As I said before, telling a very few select members of Congress that this program existed. They told them this program existed in ways that they wouldn't object to, but made them culpable for hiding the existence of the program from the American people. This is why someone like Nancy Pelosi, who you wouldn't exactly think would be buddy buddy with George Bush, was completely okay in defending this kind of program, in fact. Later she said, Oh, well she had objections to the program that she wrote in a letter to the White House. But she never showed us the letter. She went, ""Oh well, that was classified."" Right? This is not to to bag on her individually. It's just, she's a great example in here and not named example everyone knows of how this process works."
Interviewer,"The White House will implicate certain very powerful members of Congress in their own criminal activity. Then when the White House gets in trouble for it, the Congress has to run cover for the white house. What happened was Congress passed an emergency law in 2007 called the Protect America Act, which should have been our first indication this is a very bad thing, because they never named a law something like that unless it's something terrible. What it did was it retroactively immunized all of the phone companies in the United States that had been breaking the law millions of times a day by handing your records over to the government, which they weren't allowed to do, simply on the basis of a letter from the president saying, ""Please do this.""."
Snowden,"These companies went, ""Look, now that we've been uncovered, now that we've been shown that we're breaking, or now that these journalists have shown that we've broken the law and violated the rights of Americans on a staggering scale that could bankrupt our companies, because we can be sued for this. We will no longer cooperate with you unless pass a law that says people can't sue us for having done this."" And so we get the Protect America Act."
Interviewer,Jesus.
Snowden,"Which they say is as an emergency. This is all public history too. You can look this up on Wikipedia. Then they go, ""It's an emergency law. We have to pass this now. We have to keep this program active. Bush is going to end the warrantless wiretapping program and continue it under this new authority where it's going to have some special level of oversight and these kinds of things eventually. But for now we just have to make sure people are safe."" Again, they go to fear. They say, ""If we don't have this program, terrorist attacks will continue. People will die. Blood on your hands, blood on your hands, blending your hands. Think of the children.""."
Interviewer,"Protect America Act passes. The companies get off the hook. The Bush White House gets off the hook. The Congress that was then sharing in a criminal culpability for authorizing or rather letting these things go by without stopping them then passes in 2008, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments of 2008 this is called the FAA FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Rather than stopping all of the unlawful and unconstitutional activities that the intelligence agency was doing, they continued it in different ways simply by creating a few legal hoops for them to jump through."
Snowden,"Now, this is not as go say, you know, these things aren't helpful at all. It's not to say they're not useful at all. It's important to understand when the government's response to any scandal, and this applies to any country, is not to make the activities of the person who was caught breaking the law, comply with the law, but instead make the activities of the person who is breaking the law, legal, right? They make the law comply with the agencies want to do rather than make the agencies comply with the law. That's a problem. That's what happened here."
Interviewer,"Now the intelligence community's powers actually grew in response to this scandal in 2008, because Congress was on the hook and they just wanted to move on and get this over with. There were objections. There were people who knew this was a bad idea, but it passed on. Now what the public took away from this, because a part of these laws, was a requirement that the Inspector General of all of these different intelligence community elements and the Director of National Intelligence submit a report saying this is what happened under that warrantless wiretapping program. This is how it complied with the law or how it didn't comply with the law, and basically look back at how this program was constituted, what it did, what the impacts and effects were. That was supposed to be the truth and reconciliation council."
Snowden,"Now, why am I talking about all this ancient history? Well, I'm sitting here in 2012 with a classified Inspector General's report, draft report from the NSA that names names, that says Dick Cheney, that says David Addington, this is Nancy Pelosi that says all these people who are involved in the program, the tick tock of how it happens. It says, the director of the NSA, that guy who was evacuating the building at the beginning of our podcast here, that guy was asked by the president of the United States if he would continue this program after being told by the White House and the Department of Justice that these programs were not lawful, that they were not constitutional. The president said, ""Would you continue this program on my say so alone knowing that it's risky, knowing that it's unlawful?"" He said, ""Yes sir, I will if you think that's what's necessary to keep the country safe.""."
Interviewer,"At that moment, I realize these guys don't care about the law. These guys don't care about the constitution. These guys don't care about the American people. They care about the continuity of government. They care about the state, right? This is something that people have lost. We hear this phrase over and over again, national security, national security, national security. We're meant to interpret that to mean public safety. National security is a very different thing from public safety. National security is a thing that in previous generations we referred to as state security. National security was a term that came out of the Bush administration to run cover for the fact that we were elevating a new secret police across the country."
Snowden,"What does it mean when, again, in a democracy, in the United States, the public is not partner to government? The public does not hold the leash of government any more, but we are subject to government, right? We are subordinate to government. We're not even allowed to know that it happened. Now in the book, I tell the fact that I had access to the unclassified version of this report back in Japan. What's interesting is the unclassified version of a report, and we've all seen this today with things like the Mueller report and all of the intelligence reporting that's happened in the last several years. When the government provides a classified report to the public, it's normally the same document, the unclassified version, the classified version are the same thing. It's just the unclassified version has things blacked out or redacted that they say, ""Oh, you're not allowed to know this sentence or this paragraph or this page or whatever.""."
Interviewer,"The document that the public had been given about the warrantless wiretapping program was a completely different document. It was a document tailor made to deceive and mislead the Congress and the public of the United States. It was effective in doing that. In 2012, what I realized was this is what real world conspiracies look like, right? It doesn't have to be a smoking man behind closed doors, right? It's lawyers and politicians. It's ordinary people from the working level to the management level who go, ""If we don't explain this in a certain way, we're all going to lose our jobs."" Or the other way, ""They go, we're, we're going to get something out of this if we all work together.""."
Snowden,"Civilization is the history of conspiracy, right? What is civilization, but a conspiracy for all of us to do better by working together. Right? But it's this kind of thing that I think too often we forget because it's boring as hell. I want all your listeners to go to the Washington Post, because this document that I discovered that really changed me has been published courtesy of the Washington Post. It's called the Inspector General's report on Stellar Wind. You can look at the actual document that I saw that was unredacted, right? I had no blacked out pages on mine. What I believe it shows, is that some of the most senior officials in the United States, elected and unelected, worked together to actively undermine the rights of the American people to give themselves expanded powers."
Interviewer,"Now in their defense, they said they were seeking these powers for good and just and noble cause, right?They say they were trying to keep us safe. That's what they always say. That's what every government says. That's no different than what the Chinese government says or the Russian government says. The question is, if they are truly keeping us safe, why wouldn't they simply just tell us that? Why wouldn't they have that debate in Congress? Why wouldn't they put that to a vote? Because if they were, and they could convince us that they were, they'd win the vote. Particularly, we all know the Patriot Act passed. One of the worst pieces of legislation in modern history passed. Why didn't we get a vote? I think if you read the report, the answer we clear. I'm sorry Joe. I went on for very long."
Snowden,"No, it was amazing. Don't apologize all. It's just completely fascinating that the continuation of this policy came down to one man and the president having this discussion. That is so ...."
Interviewer,It's much more.
Snowden,"... much more, but literally, the president ...."
Interviewer,"At the heart of it, yes. At the heart of it, in every expression of executive power, and by executive, we mean the White House here. The CIA, the NSA, the FBI, the DOJ, these guys exist as a part of the executive branch of government. In a real way, they work for the White House. Now there are laws and regulations and policies that are supposed to say they're supposed to do this and they're supposed to say they're not supposed to do that. When you look at federal regulations, when you look at policies as an employee of government, when you violate these policies, the worst thing that happens to you is you lose your job, because there's no criminal penalty for the violation of these laws. It's very easy for people who exist in these structures, particularly at the very top levels of these structures to go, ""Look, we have a given set of lawful authorities. These are defined very broadly to give us leeway to do whatever it is we think is proper and appropriate and just.""."
Snowden,"Now take that proper and appropriate and just from the perspective of any given individual, and any given president, now intersect that with what's good for them politically. That's where problems begin to arise. Now, the safety measure that's supposed to protect us from this in the US system and in any democracy, broadly is broadly is these people are supposed to be what are called public officials. That means we know their decisions. That means we know their policies. That means we know their programs and prerogatives and powers, what they are doing, both in our name and what they're doing against us. Because they are transparent to us, we the people, can then police their activities. We can go, ""I disagree with this."" We can protest it. We can campaign against it, right? We can try to become the president, do whatever."
Interviewer,"They are public officials and we are private citizens. They're not supposed to know anything about us, right? We, in relative terms, hold no power, and they hold all the power, so they have to be under the tightest constraints. We need to be in the freest circumstances. Yet the rise of the state secrets doctrine, this whole classification system that goes all the way back to last century about the middle of the last century, I believe, is when it really started getting tested in court. I think you know more about this in many cases than I do when you start talking about what happened in the FBI and the CIA and the NSA's old dirty work in the the 20th century, is they abuse their powers repeatedly and continuously. They did active harm to domestic politics in the United States."
Snowden,"The FBI was spying on Martin Luther King and trying to get Martin Luther King to kill himself before the Nobel Prize was going to be awarded. In fact, after MLK gave his a, I have a dream speech, two days later, the FBI classified him as the greatest national or I think it was the greatest national security threat in the United States. This is the FBI. This is the group that everybody's applauding today saying, ""Oh, these wonderful patriots and heroes."" Now. I'm not saying everybody in the FBI is bad. I'm not saying everybody at the CIA and NSA is bad. I'm saying that you don't become patriot based on where you work."
Interviewer,"Patriotism is not about a loyalty to to government. Patriotism in fact is not about loyalty to anything. Patriotism is a constant effort to do good for the people of your country, right? It's not about the government. It's not about the state. We'll get into loyalty later, because you know, I think one of the big criticisms against me that should be talked about is the go, ""Look, this guy is a disloyal. He broke an oath. He did whatever."" loyalty is a good thing when it's in the service of something good, but it is only good when it's in the service of something good. If you're loyal to a bad person, if you're loyal to a bad program, if you're loyal to a bad government, that that loyalty is actively harmful. I think that's overlooked."
Snowden,"Yeah, when you get back into this whole thing about where it came from, why it happened, how it could come out of just the small group and then they could slowly poison by implication, by complicity, by bringing them into the conspiracy and then having them not say anything about it, wider and wider body of people. Then once you've got enough people in on it, it's much easier to convince other people that it's legitimate. They can go, ""Look, we've got 30 people who know about this. None of them have objected to it. Why are you going to object to this?""."
Interviewer,"All of this derives from that original sin, which is in a democracy creating a system of government that is in fact a secret government, a body of secret law, a body of secret policy did us far what a legitimate government secrets could be. This is not say like government can have no secrecy at all. If the government wants to investigate someone without having them respond, we're talking traditional law enforcement. Sure. You're not going to tell this mobster, ""Hey, you know, we're going to start investigating you."" We the public don't need to know the names of every terrorist suspect out in the world, but we do need to know, again, the powers and programs, the policies that the government is asserting, at least the broad outlines of it. Otherwise, how can we control it? How do we know if the government is applying its authorities that are supposed to be granted to it by us if we don't know what it is that they're doing. This is the main thing and really the story behind the title, Permanent Record is look, Joe, when you were a kid, when I was a kid, when you were a teenager, what's the worst thing you ever said? Did you say anything you weren't proud of? Did you do anything that you weren't proud of? Something that today in the wokest of Twitterland you would get in trouble for."
Snowden,I'm sure. That's one of the horrible things about kids growing up today is that they do have all this stuff out there on social media forever. They can be judged horribly by something they did when they were 13.
Interviewer,"It's exactly that. Our worst mistakes, our deepest shames were forgotten, right? They were lost. They were ephemeral. Even the things we did get caught for it, they were known for a time, maybe they're still remembered by people who are closest to us, whether we like them or dislike them, but they were people connected to us. Now we're forced to live in a real way, naked before power. Whether we're talking about Facebook, whether we're talking about Google, whether we're talking about the government of any country, they know everything about us or much about us rather. We know very little about them. We're not allowed to know more. Everything that we do now lasts forever. Not because we want to remember, but because we're not allowed to forget."
Snowden,"Just carrying a phone in your pocket is enough for your movements to be memorialized, because every cell phone tower that you pass is keeping a record of that. AT&T keeps those records going back to 2008 under a program called Hemisphere. If you search for Hemisphere and AT&T, you'll get a story in the Daily Beast about it. AT&T keeps your phone records going back to 1983. If any of your listeners were born after 1983, born after me, or it might be 1987 excuse me, 1987. If they were born after 1987, and they're an AT&T customer or their calls cross AT&T's network, AT&T has every phone call they ever made, the record that it happened, not necessarily the content that's on the phone call."
Interviewer,"I mean the, let me turn this around for you Joe, cause I feel like I've just been giving a speech. When you look at this stuff, when you look at what's happening with government, when you look and see what's happening with the Trump White House, the Obama White House, the Bush White House, you could see this trend happening. When you look at what's happening with Facebook, when you look at what's happening with Google, when you look at the fact that you go to every restaurant today and you see people looking at phones. You get on a bus, you get on a subway, you see somebody sitting next to you in traffic, you see people looking at phones. These devices are connected all the time. Now people are getting Alexa, right? Now people have OK Google, they have Siri on their phones. They're in their house. They've always got these connected microphones. Where do you think this leads? What is it that gives you trust in the system, faith in the system? Just so we can start a conversation here. What strikes you about this?"
Snowden,"Well, it's completely alien. It's new. This is something that's unprecedented. We don't have a long human history of being completely connected via technology. This is something we're navigating right now for the first time. It's probably the most powerful thing that the human race has ever seen in terms of the distribution of information. There's nothing that even comes close to it in all of human history. We're figuring out as we go along. What you exposed is that not only are we figuring out as we go along, but that to cover their ass, these cell phone companies in cahoots with the government have made it legal for them to gather up all of your phone calls, all of your text messages, all of your emails, and store them somewhere, so that retroactively if you ever say anything they don't like or do something they don't like, they can go back, find that and use it against you."
Interviewer,"We don't know who they are. We don't know why they're doing it. We didn't know they could do it until you exposed it. The connection of human beings via technology is both amazing and powerful and incredible in terms of our access to knowledge, but terrifying in terms of the government's ability to track our movements, track your phone calls, track everything, and under the guise of protecting us from terrorists and protecting us from sleeper cells, protecting us from attacks. Look, if they really are protecting us from these attacks, that's great. There's no provision in the constitution that allows any of this. This is where it gets really squirrely because they're making up the rules as they go along. They're making up these rules, the way you're describing it, is a step by step. This has happened to protect their ass and keep themselves from being implicated in what has been a violation of our rights and our privacies and the Fourth Amendment."
Snowden,"Yeah, I mean, I think one of the things that everybody needs to understand when you look at these things and the reason we talked about before when I got this information, why I didn't just put it on the internet and people criticize me for this. They go, ""I didn't share enough information,"" because the journalists are gate keeping. They've got a big archive. They haven't published everything from it. I told them not to publish everything."
Interviewer,Why did you do that?
Snowden,They're actually following my instructions.
Interviewer,Why did you do that?
Snowden,"Because, so again, it gets back to legitimate secrets and illegitimate secrets. Some spying from my perspective, ""career spy"" is okay, right?"
Interviewer,Agreed.
Snowden,"If you have hacked a terrorist phone, and you're getting some information about that, useful."
Interviewer,Agreed. Yeah.
Snowden,"If you're spying on a Russian general in charge of a rocket division useful, right? There are lines and degrees in that where it's not useful. Now the examples that I just gave you, these are targeted. This is where you're spying on an individual. They're a known, named person that is being monitored for specific reason that is related ...."
Interviewer,"Hopefully, from a warrant."
Snowden,"... broadly to things that people ... Even for foreign intelligence and some indications, you don't need a warrant strictly. Although, I think they should have warrants for all of these investigations because they established a court for precisely this reason called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, right? There's not a judge in the world who wouldn't stamp a warrant saying, ""Hey, spy on Abu Jihad over here."" Right? If you want to a spy on another guy Boris Badenoff of the rocket division, that that's okay. They're going to go with that."
Interviewer,"Then you look at these edge cases in the archive that are provided to journalists that have been stories that have come down where they've spied on journalists, right? They've spied on human rights groups. These kinds of things, I think people miss. I'm going to throw up some slides here, so forgive me if this gets weird, and I put up the wrong ones. Since I came forward, this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the government says authorized these programs 15 different times was overruled by the first open courts to look at the program. These are federal courts here, that said, ""No, actually these programs are unlawful. They're likely unconstitutional.""."
Snowden,"When you start looking at the facts, you see even within the context of the very loose restrictions and laws that apply to the NSA and surveillance, they broke their own laws 2,776 times in a single year. Then you asked about that thing that motivates me, why I came forward. We had been trying as a country, before I came forward, to prove the existence of these programs legally. This is our means of last recourse in our system, right? We got the executive. We got the legislature. We got the judiciary. Right? Congress makes the laws. The executive's supposed to carry them out. The courts are supposed to play referee. The executive had broken the laws. Congress was turning a blind eye to the law. The courts were in, this is just months before I came forward going, ""Well, it does appear that the ACLU and Amnesty International,"" all of these human rights groups in nongovernmental organizations had established that these programs are likely unlawful. They likely exist. They're simply classified. The government responded with this argument that you just saw saying that, ""Well, it's a state secret if they do exist."" You the plaintiffs don't ...."
Interviewer,"It's a state secret if they do exist. You the plaintiffs don't have hard concrete evidence that they do exist and the government is saying, legally, you have no right to discover evidence from the government, right, documents, demand documents or demand an answer from the government as to whether or not these things exist because the government's just going to give it's standard, what they call glamor response, we can neither confirm nor deny that these things exist. Which leaves you out in the cold, which leaves the courts out in the cold."
Snowden,"The courts go, look, the government could be breaking the law here. Look, they could be violating the constitution here, but because you can't prove it, and because the government doesn't want to play ball, and the government says, if we were doing this, it would be legal and it would be necessary for national security or whatever. The court can't presume to know national security better than the executive because the courts aren't elected."
Interviewer,"And so this leads to this fundamentally broken system where, okay, the only way to have the courts review the legality of the programs is to establish the programs exist. But the programs are classified, so you can't establish the exist unless you have evidence. But providing that evidence to courts, to journalists, to anyone is a felony, right, that's punishable by 10 years per count under the espionage act. And the government has charged every source of public interest journalism who's really made a significant difference in these kinds of cases since Daniel Ellsberg, really going back to that, under the same espionage act. It's always the same law and there's no distinction to government between whether you've sold information to a foreign government for private benefit or whether you provide an information only to journalists for the public interest. And that's a fundamentally harmful thing I think. When you look at things that have come in the wake of this, we're talking about the the post 2013 court rulings that found what the government was doing was unlawful. You see the courts saying actually that leaks, or air quotes, leaks can actually be beneficial. Leak is used in the governance, and this is from a federal court, these are not exactly my biggest supporters. They are recognizing that although leak implies harm, it implies something that's broken, it's actually helpful. It's a leak that's letting in daylight, in this context, that is the only thing that allows the system to operate in a context where one year before I came forward, we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff didn't happen."
Snowden,"We had a hang on this famous exchange, which more than anything made me realize this was a point of no return because I've told you this, you've heard this, but if you haven't seen it, you might not believe me, right? Maybe I'm a sketchy guy, whatever. One of those senators I told you that objected to this stuff, that was doing the Lassie barks for all those years, Ron Wyden, was confronting the most senior spy in the United States, General James Clapper, who was then the director of national intelligence, right."
Interviewer,"There's no guy higher than him, the buck stops with him when it comes to intelligence. He's testifying under oath in front of Congress, right, but more broadly, in front of the public, this is televised. And Ron Wyden asked him a very specific question about a program mind you that Ron Wyden knows exists because he has security clearance, he sits on the intelligence committee, and he knows there's domestic mass surveillance and this is how it goes, this is how the top spy responds under oath."
Snowden,Mr. Wyden:.
Interviewer,"So, what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question, does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"
Snowden,Clapper:.
Interviewer,No sir.
Snowden,Mr. Wyden:.
Interviewer,It does not.
Snowden,Clapper:.
Interviewer,Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly.
Snowden,Mr. Wyden:.
Interviewer,All right.
Snowden,"So, that was a lie. Widen knew it was a lie, Clapper knew it was a lie, he actually admitted it was a lie after I came forward three months later. But he said it was the least untruthful thing he could think of to say in the context of being in the hot seat there."
Interviewer,"But what does it mean for a democracy when you can lie under oath to Congress, and the Congressman even knows you're lying to them, but they're afraid to correct you. And by the way, it wasn't a surprise, Widen gave him those questions 24 hours in advance, and he wrote a letter afterwards asking for Clapper to amend his testimony, right. Not even in the press conference, but just to say this was incorrect, whatever, so he could go through the legal process and show his fellow Congressman that there was a problem and that they needed to do it."
Snowden,"But all of that was refused to us. All of it was denied to us. And here I am sitting at the NSA, next to my buddies who I've talked to about these programs. I've gone, look at this, and they're laughing at it. I'm laughing at it. And it's not that we go, Oh ha ha, he's getting away with it. It's like, what are you going to do? These guys, they're bullshitters, that the system is built on lies. That even many people, many experts who have studied this, know are lies. But if you can't prove they are lies, how do you move beyond that? And that's really a question that has never been more relevant than I think it is today under the current White House."
Interviewer,"So, you're in this position where you have this information and you know that these surveillance systems are in place and they're unconstitutional, and you feel this deep responsibility to let the American people know about this, what makes you take the leap?"
Snowden,So this is covered extensively in the book because it took a long time.
Interviewer,I would imagine.
Snowden,"Yeah, right, exactly. People like to think it's like a cinematic moment where I find this golden document, like the stellar wind report, and that's the closest thing to a smoking gun, right, that exists. But look, if you found that, you can read that later, look at that and imagine yourself being like, oh, I'm going to go outside on the courthouse steps, and wave this thing, and burn my life to the ground, burn my family to the ground, I'm never going to be working again, I'm going to jail for the rest of my life. The question is, what would it take for you to light a match and burn your life to the ground?"
Interviewer,"For a long time, too long, the answer was nothing, and I'm ashamed of that. It took me so long to get over that hump because I was waiting for somebody else to do it. When I saw people like Ron Wyden on this, when I saw people like the court case that I showed before where people were actively challenging these programs, right? Journalists had the scent of it and there are a lot of people who are going to be in the YouTube comments or whatever and go, I knew this was happening, no you didn't."
Snowden,"Well, Bill Bimini-."
Interviewer,You had ... Bill Binney.
Snowden,"Excuse me, Bill Binney, he initially was the one that came out and spoke about this issue and i-."
Interviewer,"So, yeah, Bill Binney is part of, shall we say the group of early NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas Drake, Bill Binney, Kirk Weeby, I believe and Ed Loomis. And these guys all got their doors kicked in, they got harassed by the FBI. Tom Drake, who was a senior executive at the NSA, this is guy who had a lot to lose, was charged under the same law, it was the espionage act. And these guys who were doing it earlier, during the Bush administration, some of them were talking to the journalists, maybe it's alleged, I don't want to put them on the spot, maybe they deny, maybe they don't, leave that to them. But somebody somewhere was informing this reporting, right, that got into the New York times about the Bush era warrant less wiretapping program. And eventually journalist put this out there. People knew these capabilities existed."
Snowden,"But yeah, then there's the person in the YouTube comments who was like, we knew all about this, this is nothing new. And the thing is you can know about some programs and not know about others. You can have a suspicion, you can know with a certainty that this stuff is capable or is is possible, the capability exists. You can know that the government has done this stuff in the past, you can know they are likely to do it again, you can have all these indications, you can have them like the Jewel versus NSA case that's run by the EFF, which is about AT&T setting up secret rooms in there telecommunications facilities where they basically drag all the fibers for their domestic internet communications and phone communications into a room that's purpose built for the NSA and then they bring it out."
Interviewer,"But AT&T denies it's the NSA. The NSA denies that these things happen or that are done at all, right. And so this is the context. You say you know, and let me put it either way, maybe you do know, right, maybe you are a an academic researcher, maybe you're a technological specialist, maybe you're just somebody who reads all the reporting and you actually know, you can't prove it, but you know this is going on. But that's the thing in a democracy, the distance between speculation and fact, the distance between what you know and what you can prove to everybody else in the country is everything in our model of government, because what you know doesn't matter, what matters is what we all know. And the only way we can all know it is if somebody can prove it. If you can prove it, and if you don't have the evidence, you can't prove it."
Snowden,"And of course when we talk about the earlier stuff, right, like the more corporatized media, they've got a thousand incentives not to get involved in this stuff. They need access to the White House. They need these officials to sit down with them and give interviews, right, that's constant content that they need, that's access that they need. They need to be taken seriously. They need to be admitted to briefers. It is a codependent relationship. And so the only way to make sure people understand this broadly is if we all work together, right? If we collectively can establish a corpus of evidence, right, a body of facts that is so large and so persuasive it overcomes the natural and understandable resistance of these more corporatized media groups, it overcomes the political and partisan loyalties that all of these political factions in the country do. Where they go, it's my president, even if I don't like this stuff, even if I don't agree with this stuff, I don't want to say it exists. I want to deny it until it's proved in HD on video, signing the order to do this, that or the other because otherwise there's a chance my guy might not get reelected. And that's the only way this kind of stuff can happen."
Interviewer,"And the sad fact is the opportunities that we have to prove this, the moments in history where we do prove something, anything beyond a reasonable doubt are so few and so rare that they almost always only come from whistleblowers. And I think that's one of the problems that we have particularly in the climate movement. . Go ahead."
Snowden,"I'm sorry. Did you take any comfort from knowing that Obama, when he was running for office and in his hope and change website, he had provisions to protect whistleblowers, and provisions to reward people, right? I mean do you remember all that? I mean it was eventually redacted or eventually deleted it from the website, but that's."
Interviewer,"Yeah, it disappeared from the website."
Snowden,"Yes. But that was a big part of his program. What he was running on was that, when people were exposing unlawful activity, he was going to protect those people. Did you take any comfort in that?"
Interviewer,"Well, Obama also, during his campaign said, he campaigned actively against the warrant less wiretapping, the Bush administration because remember bushes in the scandal in the height of this on 2007, the election is coming up right after and Obama is saying, that's not who we are, that's not what we do. And yet, within a hundred days of him becoming the president, now he's sitting in that chair, rather than extinguishing these programs, he embraces them and expands them. ."
Snowden,Why do you think that is?
Interviewer,"I think it's actually again what we talked about earlier. First thing, every time a new president comes into the white house, they get their clearances, right. They get read into all this stuff. During the campaign they get clearances and they get read in on stuff. But when they finally become president, right, now they're the only people who can sign what these are called the covert action findings and things like that. Which are basically the intelligence community wants to assassinate somebody, they want to run this illegal program here, there or everywhere, and they can't do it because they are executive agencies without that top level executive sign off. So they got to open the vest, right. They got to get these guys on side."
Snowden,"And basically every president since Kennedy, they had been successful in what they call fearing up. Where as soon as they come in, they read you the litany of horribles. And they go, these are all the threats that we're facing, and let's be real, it is a dangerous world. It's not just all made up BS. Some of it is, right, where it's inflated, it's not that it's completely false but they make it sound more serious than it actually is. But there are real bad people out there who are trying to do real bad things and you have just gone through a hellish election because our electoral politics are so diseased."
Interviewer,"And now, after you've crawled through fire, you're already thinking four years ahead. How do I stay in this seat? And these guys are basically saying, if you don't do X, Y, and Z, this is going to fall on your lap. And the implication, which I don't think they actually say but every president knows, is these guys can undermine you to death. If you've got the IC against you, right, they can stonewall you, they can put out the stories that are going to be problematic for you everyday of your presidency."
Snowden,"And it's not that it's necessarily going to cast you out of the White House, but it's a problem that as president you very much don't want. So in the most charitable interpretation of this, you've got a new guy coming in, and in Obama's case, this is a pretty young guy. Doesn't focus in this kind of national security foreign policy stuff throughout his earlier career, he's more interested in domestic policy and always has been, that's actually one of the positive things to say about Barack Obama. He's just trying to make things better at home."
Interviewer,"And now suddenly they go, look, you need to worry about this country. You need to worry about this group that you've never heard of, you need to worry about this technology, you need to do all this stuff. And the only reason we can tell you this stuff, and the only thing dividing America and the abyss are these terrible, terrible programs, right, that are in fact wonderful things because they keep back the darkness."
Snowden,"And so here's the real problem, every president hears that and every president, first off, they've got so many other things to do is they just kind of nod their head and they'll go, I'll deal with this later in my administration, and this is one of the ironies. When I came forward in 2013, right, this is now Barack Obama, second term president. One of the responses that they had to the mass surveillance scandal was, yes, we think they went a little too far, this is after the initial thing where they went, nobody's listening to your phone calls, [crosstalk nobody can have perfect privacy and also have perfect security so we got to divide a line here between the constitution and what the government wants to do."
Interviewer,"But they said, we were going to get to it. We knew these programs were problematic, but if they just gave us more time, we would've fixed them. Maybe it's true, right. Seems awful convenient in hindsight throughout the entirety of the first term."
Snowden,"Well, it seems like what you would say if you got caught."
Interviewer,"Right. But look, if we're being the most generous, that we are here, the president is briefed on real and legitimate threats, and they scare the hell out of him."
Snowden,I'm sure.
Interviewer,"And we can all imagine being there, right? Those, those of us who remember what the world was like post 911, fear is a powerful thing. But the guys who are doing that briefing, they're no longer scared of it because they've been dealing with this for years. This is the oldest thing. They've given this briefing times before. People talk about the deep state, right. They talk about it like some conspiracy of lizard people, it's not that, it's something much simpler. The deep state is simply the career government. It's the people who are in the same offices, who outlive and outlast presidencies, right. They've seen Republicans, they've seen Democrats, they don't really care, and they give that same briefing again and again and they get good at it."
Snowden,"They know what they want, they know what this person is saying, where as the president, they don't know who these people are. These people have been there before the president, they're going to be there after the president, and so they give this very effective, very fear inducing speech, and then they follow it up with their asks, which are really demands just politely provided. And anyone in that position who is not an expert on this stuff, who is not ready for this trade off, and who you have to understand is a career politician is entirely used to the horse trading game, right. And go, I'll deal with this later, or not now, or what is the cost benefit here."
Interviewer,"And the intelligence community goes, if you give us what we want, no one will ever know about it because it's classified, it's obviously the easy answer. And maybe Barack Obama honestly did want to get to this later, but what we can say today is, for all the good that may have been done in that White House, this is an issue where the president went through two full terms and did not fix the problem, but in fact made it worse."
Snowden,"ll, it seems like the president has a job that's absolutely impossible and if you come across someone who has been in the position, like someone who's the head of an intelligence agency for a long time, and is very persuasive, and has some legitimate credentials that show that he's very good at his job, but he tells you this is important for national security, we need to keep these things in place, it doesn't seem like any one person can run the country and be aware of every single program that every single agency is implementing. It seems completely unrealistic. And the job itself, it doesn't seem like any person can do it adequately. And when it comes to something like this mass surveillance state, I could see a president being persuaded by someone who comes to him and says, this is why we need to do this."
Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, one of the things that I think is the underlying problem in everything that you just described, is the president has too much power."
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,"And because they have too much power, that means they have too much responsibility. And I don't think people understand, if they haven't lived outside the United States, if they haven't traveled or studied broadly just how exceptional the American presidency is. Most countries don't have a single individual with this level of power. It's really only the superstates and that may be by design perhaps, that's why they're super States. But when we look at complex advanced democracies that are more peaceful, they tend to have a more multi-lateral system that has more people involved in smaller portfolios. And a lot of this derives from just the size of the government."
Snowden,"Like you said, the president is responsible for basically everything in the executive branch, and the executive branch is basically every agency that actually does any work. And so, how do you correct for that without breaking it up where you have smaller ministers and ministries and things like that that have different levels of responsibility? Having a smaller government overall."
Interviewer,"Back in 1776, the federal government was pretty much a dream. We weren't even interested in having standing armies. The idea of an army that existed from year to year was a terrifying forbidding thing. And then when you moved this idea that we have a president, that they have these extraordinary powers, it's okay because the government is very small. The federal government especially is seen as the small and toothless and weak thing.."
Snowden,"Can you pause for one second? Pause for one second because my Air Pods are about to die and I'm going to swap over to another pair. These suckers are good for a couple hours, but we're two hours and 15 minutes here. We'll have a little bit of a weird audio issue with the last half of it but Jamie will take care of it."
Interviewer,"I wanted to talk about you, like where you are right now in your life and how you're handling this because you've been in exile for, how many years now?"
Snowden,It's been more than six years.
Interviewer,Six years.
Snowden,"June of 2013, yeah. I mean, well actually I left May, so."
Interviewer,"What is life like? Are you in constant hiding? I mean, what are the issues like?"
Snowden,"In the beginning, my operational security level as we would call it, was very high. I was concerned about being recognized, I was concerned about being followed, I was concerned really about very bad things happening to me because the government made it very clear that from their position I was the most wanted man in the world."
Interviewer,"They literally brought down the president of Bolivia, his aircraft, and would not let it depart as it tried to cross the airspace of Europe, not even the United States. They wouldn't let it leave until they confirmed I was not on board. So, yeah, that made me a little bit nervous. But you can't live like that forever. And although I was as careful as I could be, I still lived a pretty happily because I was an indoor cat to begin with, right. I've always been a technologist. I've always been pretty nerdy. So as long as I have a screen and an internet connection, I was pretty happy."
Snowden,"But in the years past, my life has become more and more open. Now I speak openly, I live openly, I go out, I ride the Metro, I go to restaurants. I go walks in the park."
Interviewer,How often do you get recognized?
Snowden,"So this is a funny thing is I'm almost never recognized. One of those things is I don't give Russian interviews because I don't want my face all over the news, which is nice because it just allows people to forget about my face and I can go about my life. But it's one of the weird things that I'm recognized a couple times a year, even when I'm not wearing my glasses in a museum, or a grocery store, or something like that, or out on the street just by somebody who I swear like these people are, you might've wrote a story about them, super recognizers the people who just have a great memory for faces because I can be wearing in hood and a jacket, it can have a scarf around my face like in the winter, and you can barely see my face and they'll come up to me and they're like, are you Snowden and I'm like, that's pretty impressive."
Interviewer,What do you say?
Snowden,"I'd say, yeah, it's nice to meet you. And yeah, I've never had a negative interaction from being recognized. But for me, because I'm a privacy advocate, I would much rather go unrecognized, I don't want to be a celebrity. But the other thing is, I'll get recognized in computer stores and I think there's just a mental association where people are like their brain when it's cycling through faces that it recognizes, it's going through the subset of nerdier people or something like that when you're in a computer store because for whatever reason, I'm recognized much more frequently when there's some technological locusts."
Interviewer,"So you're living freely, you had to learn Russian. Did you learn it-."
Snowden,"Yeah. I mean my Russian is still pretty crappy to my great shame because all of my life, all of my work is primarily in English, right."
Interviewer,"Now, you've talked about returning home if you could get a fair trial. Is that a feasible thing? A fair trial for someone like you. Is that even possible?"
Snowden,"Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, look, if we're being Frank, I think all of your audience knows, the chance of me getting a fair shake in the Eastern district of Virginia, a couple miles from the headquarters of the CIA is probably pretty slim because that's where they draw the jury pool from, right? But my objection here is on a larger principle, right? What happens to me is less important, right? If I spend the rest of my life in jail, that's less important than what I'm actually requiring the government to agree to, which is a single thing, right?"
Interviewer,"They say, face the music, face the music, and I'm saying, great, let's pick the song. The thing is, the law that I've been charged under, the one that all these whistleblowers have been charged on her, Thomas Drake, Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning, Daniel Hale the drone whistleblower who is in prison right now going through a trial that is precisely similar to what I would be facing. His lawyer is asking the court or telling the court that we want to tell the jury why he did what he did. That the government is violating laws, the government is violating human rights, that these programs are immoral, that they are unethical. This is what motivated this guy to do it and the jury should be able to hear why he did what he did, and the jury should be able to decide whether that was right or wrong."
Snowden,"And the government has responded to this whistleblower argument basically saying, ""We demand the court, forbid this guy from breathing the word whistleblower in court. He cannot talk about what motivated him. He cannot talk about what was revealed, why it was revealed, what the impacts and effects were, and he can't talk about whether the public benefited from it or was harmed by it because it doesn't matter.""."
Interviewer,"Now this might surprise a lot of people because to a lot of us, we think that's what a jury trial is. We think that's what a fair trial is. But the espionage act that the government uses against whistle blowers, meaning broadly here, the sources of journalism, is fairly unique in the legal system in that it is what's called a strict liability crime. A strict liability crime is what the government considers to be basically a crime worse than murder because if you murdered somebody, if you just, I don't know, beat Jamie with the microphone stand right now, you would be able to go to the court and say, it was self defense, right. You felt threatened, you were in danger for your life, even if you weren't, right. Even though you obviously weren't. Even if you are on tape, you could still argue that and the jury could go, you're full of crap, right? And they could convict you."
Snowden,"But if you were in fact acting in self defense, if the jury did in fact believe you, they could take that into consideration in establishing their verdict, right. Strict liability crimes forbid that. The jury is not allowed to consider why you committed a crime. They're only allowed to consider if you committed a crime. They're not allowed to consider if the murder was justified, they're only allowed to consider if the murder took place. And the funny thing in this case is that the murder that we're talking about is telling the truth."
Interviewer,"The espionage act in every case is a law the government exclusively uses against people who told the truth, right. That's what it's about in the context of journalism. They don't bring the espionage act against people who lied, then they would use fraud or some other statute. They say, the government is arguing in the context of whistle blowing, that telling a important truth to the American people by way of a journalist is a crime worse than murder. And I believe, and I think most Americans would agree, this is fundamentally in defensively wrong."
Snowden,"And so my whole argument with the United States government since the very beginning was, Ben, I'll be back for a jury trial tomorrow, but you have to agree to permit whistleblowers a public interest defense. It doesn't matter whether they are a whistleblower or not, it's just they argued, it's the jury that decides whether they are a whistleblower or not. They have to be able to consider the motivations of why someone did what they did. The government says, ""We refuse to allow that because that puts the government on trial, and we don't trust the jury to consider those questions.""."
Interviewer,"Wow. So you have had these conversations then, so this has been discussed?"
Snowden,"No, this is from the Obama administration. There's been no contact since the Trump administration because the government basically when they got to this point, they went, we have no good argument against this, and we will never permit this to happen. And again, I just want to make clear, this is not speculation, this is not me thinking, this is actively happening in the case of Daniel Hale right now, I hope you guys can pull up a graphic for it because this story just hit the papers like two or three weeks ago saying the government is forbidding this guy from making this argument."
Interviewer,"So, you're seemingly in a state of limbo then. They're not actively pursuing you. It seems if you're able to move around freely, they haven't discovered where you are, you're just free to live your life."
Snowden,"Well, yeah. I mean, it's one of these things where whether they know where I am or whether they don't know where I am, where I put my head on the pillow, it doesn't matter so much. I'm in Russia, right, and we should lean into that because I think people, they hear Russia particularly in the context of today's news, and you see what people are saying about Tulsa Gabbert and things like that. Any kind of a association, anytime your name appears in the same sentence, same paragraph, same story as the word Russia, it's considered a negative thing now."
Interviewer,"And don't get me wrong, I've been a longtime critic of the Russian government. I just actually had a major story written about me in a Russian state news outlet called RIA Novosti, you guys could probably pull it, it's only in Russian though. That saying, because I spoke favorably about a member of the Russian opposition Alexei Nevalny, which I wasn't even speaking positively about this guy I was saying, look, I think people have a right to express their opposition in a country."
Snowden,"... To express their opposition in a country, and they should be able to do that without fearing retaliation the future. Because the background here is this opposition figure has been a long time thorn in the Russian administration side, and they've just suddenly, magically, been accused of being foreign agents or something like that. And so everyone connected to this, which is like a big civil society body, had their doors simultaneously kicked in across the country and they're being investigated for some kind of corruption or something, it doesn't even matter."
Interviewer,"I said I oppose that, just like I was tweeting footage of ballot stuffing in the Russian elections, just like I've criticized the Russian president by name. I've criticized Russian surveillance laws. There's so many things again and again and again and again and again. But yeah, so look, it does not make my life easier to be trapped in a country that I did not choose. And people don't remember this. I was actually on route to Latin America when the US government canceled my passport, which trapped me in Russia. And for those who are interested, again, I wrote an entire book that has a lot of detail on this, but yeah, it's difficult to be a basically engaged in civil opposition to policies of the United States government at the same time as the Russian government. It's a hard thing, it's not a happy thing, but I feel like it's a necessary thing."
Snowden,"The problem is nobody wants to talk about that. Nobody wants to engage in that kind of nuance. Nobody wants to consider those kinds of conversations in the current world. People believe, and this is actually one of the worst things that western media does in the context of discussing Russia, is they create this aura of invincibility around the Russian president. They go, ""This guy's calling all the shots, he's pulling all the strings. This guy's in charge of the world."" And that's very useful for the Russian government broadly, because they can then take that and replay that on their domestic media and they're going to go, ""Look how strong we are. The Americans are afraid of us. The Chinese are afraid of is that everybody's afraid of us. The French are afraid of us. We are strong.""."
Interviewer,"There's no question that Russia's going to be interfering in elections. There's no question that America's going to be interfering in Russian elections, right? Nobody likes to talk about this. And again, I need to substantiate that now that I've said that, I've got an old note that I've signed a billion times. The New York Times published a story in the wake of this contested 2016 election where they looked into the history of electoral interference in Russia and the Soviet union, and they found in roughly 50 years, 36 different cases of election interference by Russia or the Soviets. This is not a new thing. This is something that always happens because that's what intelligence services do. That's what they think they're being paid for, which is a sad thing, but it's a reality, because we aren't wise enough to separate covert action from intelligence gathering."
Snowden,"But in that same study that they found 36 different cases by the Russians and the Soviets, they found 81 different cases by the US, and this was published by Scott Chain in the New York Times and both The Washington Post as well. But this is the thing. There is a way to criticize the Russian government's policies without criticizing the Russian people who are ordinary people who just want to have a happy life. They just want to do better. They want the same things that you do, right? And every time people go, ""Oh, Russia, Russia, Russia."" Every time people go, ""Russia bad."" Every time they go, ""Russia's doing this."" They go, ""Russia's doing that."" Russian people who have nothing to do with the government feel implicated by that. Do you feel like you're in charge of Donald Trump? Do you want to be ... Have Donald Trump's legacy around your neck?"
Interviewer,"Then people go, ""Oh, well, you could overthrow Donald Trump, you could overthrow Putin."" Can you really? Is that how it works? So, yeah, I mean, look, I have no affiliation. I have no love for the Russian government. It's not my choice to be here, and I've made it very clear I would be happy to return home-."
Snowden,"Is there any concern that they would deny you visa? I mean, how are you staying there?"
Interviewer,"It's a good question. So I have permanent residence. People think I'm under asylum, but I'm no longer ... It's like a a green card now. It's got to be renewed every three years. So yeah, sure. It's possible they could kick me out. And this was what the story I was telling you about before in Russian media was, they were saying the Russian government should take some action against me or I shouldn't be welcomed here, or I should go home. Because why is he criticizing the Russian government, when they're the people who are keeping Americans away?"
Snowden,Is that like the Russian version of Fox News? Is that what they have over there.
Interviewer,"I don't know enough about Russian media to tell you. I think it's supposed to be more like a Reuters or Associated Press, but hell by now. But the thing is this. What's the alternative, right? Yes. The Russian government could screw me, but they could screw me even if I didn't say anything. And so should I shut up and be quiet in the face of things that I think are injustices because it makes me safer? Well, a lot of pragmatic people will say, ""Yeah."" They say, ""You've done enough."" They say, ""You've done your part."" They say whatever, ""Be safe, live long, be happy."" But I didn't come forward to be safe. If I wanted to be safe, I'd still be sitting in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of money to spy on all of you. And nobody ever would have known about this, the system would have gotten worse. But the system, the world, the future gets worse every day that we don't do something about it."
Snowden,"Every day that we stay silent about all the injustices we see, the world gets worse, things get worse. And yeah, it's risky. Yeah, it's uncomfortable. But that's why we do it, because if we don't, no one else will. All those years I was sitting hoping for someone else to come forward and no one did, that's because I was waiting for a hero. But there are no heroes. There's only heroic decisions. You are never further than one decision away from making a difference. It doesn't matter whether it's a big difference, doesn't matter if it was a small difference because you don't have to save the world by yourself. In fact, you can't. All you have to do is lay down one brick. All you have to do is make things a little bit better in a small way so the other people can lay their brick on top of that or beside that. And together, step by step, day by day, year by year, we build the foundation of something better, but yeah, it's not going to be safe."
Interviewer,"But it doesn't matter because individually it's not me, whoever you are, that's the iron man. I don't care if you're the biggest doomsday prepper with cans full of beans. If the world ends, it's going to affect you. We make things better. We become safe together. Collectively, that is our strength. That is the power of civilization. That is the power that shapes the future. Because even if you make life great for you, you're going to die someday, you're going to be forgotten someday, your cans of beans are going to rot someday. You can make things safer, you can be more careful, you can be more clever, and there's nothing wrong with that. But at the end of the day, you have to recognize if you're trying to eliminate all risks from your life, what you're actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life. You're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes such that what you've lost is freedom. You've lost the ability to act because you're afraid. That's what got us into this mess."
Snowden,"That's a beautiful way to put it. Are you aware at all of the current state of surveillance, and what, if anything, has changed since your revelations?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, the big thing that's changed since I was ... In 2013 is now it's mobile first everything. Mobile was still a big deal, and the intelligence community was very much grappling to get its hands around it and to deal with it, but now people are much less likely to use a laptop than use a desktop than use, God, any kind of wired phone than they are to use a smart phone. And both Apple and Android devices unfortunately are not especially good in protecting your privacy. Think right now. You've got a smart phone, right? You might be listening to this on a train somewhere and in traffic right now, or you Joe right now, you've got a phone somewhere in the room, right?"
Snowden,"The phone is turned off, or at least the screen is turned off. It's sitting there, it's powered on. And if somebody sends you a message, the screen blinks to life. How does that happen? How is it that if someone from any corner of the earth dials a number, your phone rings and nobody else's rings? How is it that you can dial anybody else's number and only their phone rings? Every smartphone, every phone at all is constantly connected to the nearest cellular tower. Every phone. Even when the screen is off, you think it's doing nothing, you can't see it because radio frequency emissions are invisible. It's screaming in the air saying, ""Here I am, here I am. Here is my IMEI. I think it's individual manufacturers equipment identity, and IMEI, individual manufacturers, subscriber identity."" I could be wrong on the the breakout there, but the acronyms are the IMEI and the IMSI, and you can search for these things."
Interviewer,"They're two globally unique identifiers that only exist anywhere in the world in one place. This makes your phone different than all the other phones. The IMEI is burned into the handset of your phone. No matter what SIM card you change to, it's always going to be the same and it's always going to be telling the phone network. It's this physical handset. Then the IMESI is in your SIM card, right, and this is what holds your phone number. It's basically the key, the right to use that phone number. So your phone is sitting there doing nothing you think, but it's constantly shouting and saying, ""I'm here."" Who is closest to me that's a cell phone tower? And every cell phone tower with its big ears is listening for these little cries for help and going, ""Oh right, I see Joe Rogan's phone. I see Jamie's phone, I see all these phones that are here right now.""."
Snowden,"And it compares notes with the other network towers and your smartphone compares notes with them to go, ""Who do I hear the loudest?"" And who you hear the loudest is a proxy for proximity for closeness, distance. They go, ""Whoever I hear more loudly than anybody else, that's close to me."" So you're going to be bound to this cell phone tower and that cell phone tower is going to make a note, a permanent record saying, ""This phone handset with this phone number at this time was connected to me."" And based on your phone handset and your phone number, they can get your identity, because you pay for this stuff with your credit card and everything like that. And even if you don't, it's still active at your house overnight. It's still active on your nightstand when you're sleeping, it's still whatever."
Interviewer,"The movements of your phone are the movements of you as a person. And those are often quite uniquely identifying. It goes to your home, it goes to your workplace. Other people don't have it. Sorry. And anyway. It's constantly shouting this out and then it compares notes with the other parts of the network, and when somebody is trying to get to a phone, it compares notes of the network, compares notes to go, ""Where is this phone with this phone number in the world right now?"" And to that cell phone tower that is closest to that phone, it sends out a signal saying, ""We have a call for you, make your phone start ringing so your owner can answer it."" And then it connects it across this whole path. But what this means is that whenever you're carrying a phone, whenever the phone is turned on, there's a record of your presence at that place that is being made and created by companies."
Snowden,"It does not need to be kept forever. And in fact, there's no good argument for it to be kept forever. But these companies see that as valuable information, right? This is the whole big data problem that we're running into, and all this information that used to be ephemeral, where were you when you were eight years old? Where'd you go after you had a bad breakup? Who'd you spend the night with? Who'd you call after? All this information used to be ephemeral, meaning it disappeared like the morning dew. It would be gone. No one would remember it, but now these things are stored. Now these things are saved. It doesn't matter whether you're doing anything wrong, it doesn't matter whether you're the most ordinary person on earth, because that's how bulk collection, which is the government's euphemism for mass surveillance works."
Interviewer,"They simply collected all in advance in hopes that one day it will become useful. And that was just talking about how you connect to the phone network. That's not talking about all those apps on your phone that are contacting the network even more frequently. How do you get a text message notification? How do you get an email notification? How is it the Facebook knows where you're at? All of these things, these analytics, they are trying to keep track through location services on your phone, through GPS, through even just what wireless access points you're connected to, because there's a global constantly updated map. There's actually many of them of wireless access points in the world because just like we talked about, every phone has a unique identifier that's globally unique, every wireless access point in the world, right?"
Snowden,"Your cable modem at home, whether it's in your laptop, every device that has a radio modem has a globally unique identifier in it, and this is standard term, you can look it up and these things can be mapped when they're broadcasting in the air because again, like your phone says to the cell phone tower, ""I have this identifier."" The cell phone tower responds and says, ""I had this identifier."" And anybody who's listening, they can write these things down. And all those Google street view cars that go back and forth, right? They're keeping notes on whose wifi is active on this block. And then they build it into a giant map."
Interviewer,"So even if you have GPS turned off, as long as you're connected to wifi, those apps can go ""Well, I'm connected to Joe's wifi, but I can also see his neighbor's wifi here and the other one in this apartment over here and the other one in the apartment here."" And you should only be able to hear those four globally unique wifi access points from these points in physical space. The intersection in between the spreads, the domes of all those wireless access points, and it's a proxy for location and it just goes on and on and on. We could talk about this for four more hours. We don't have that kind of time."
Snowden,"Can I ask you this? Is there a way to mitigate any of this personally? I mean, shutting your phone off doesn't even work, right?"
Interviewer,"Well, so it does in a way, it's yes and no. The thing was shutting your phone off that as a risk is how do you know your phone's actually turned off? It used to be ... When I was in Geneva, for example, working for the CIA, we would all carry drug dealer phones, the old smart phones, the ... Or sorry, old dumb phones. They're not smart phones. And the reason why was just because they had the-."
Snowden,Removal battery.
Interviewer,"... Removable backs where you could take the battery out, right?"
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,"And the one beautiful thing about technology is if there's no electricity in it, if there's, there's no go juice available to it, if there's no battery connected to it, it's not sending anything. Because you have to get power from somewhere, you have to have power in order to do work. But now your phones are all sealed. You can't take the batteries out. So there are potential ways that you can hack a phone where it appears to be off, but it's not actually off. It's just pretending to be off. Whereas in fact, it's still listening in and doing all this stuff. But for the average person, that doesn't apply. And I've got to tell you guys, they've been chasing me all over the place. I don't worry about that stuff. And it's because if they're applying that level of effort to me, they'll probably get the same information through other routes. I am as careful as I can, and I use things like , I turn devices off, but if they're actually manipulating the way devices display, it's just too great a level of effort even for someone like me to keep that up on a constant basis. Also if they get me, I only trust phones so much, so there's only so much they can derive from the compromise. And this is how operational security works. You think about what are the realistic threats that you're facing that you're trying to mitigate and the mitigation that you're trying to do is, what would be the loss? What would be the damage done to you if this stuff was exploited? Much more realistic than worrying about these things that I call voodoo hacks, which are like next level stuff. And actually just a shout up for those of your readers who are interested in this stuff."
Snowden,"I wrote a paper on this specific problem. How do you know when a phone is actually off? How do you know when it's actually not spying on you? With a brilliant, brilliant guy named Andrew Bunnie Huang, he's an MIT PhD in, I think, electrical engineering called The Introspection Engine that was published in the Journal of Open Engineering. You can find it online and it'll go as deep down in the weeds, I promise you, as you want. We take an iPhone six, this was back when it was fairly new and we modified it so we could actually not trust the device to report its own state, but physically monitor its state to see if it was spying on you. But for average people, this is academic, that's not your primary threat. Your primary threats are these bulk collection programs. Your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to these cell phone towers."
Interviewer,"It's doing all of these things because we leave our phones in a state that is constantly on. You're constantly connected. Airplane mode doesn't even turn off wifi really anymore. It just turns off the cellular modem. But the whole idea is we need to identify the problem, and the central problem with smartphone use today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing at any given time. The phone has the screen off, you don't know what it's connected to, you don't know how frequently it's doing it. Apple and iOS unfortunately makes it impossible to see what kind of network connections are constantly made on the device and to intermediate them going, ""I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now."" You know, ""I don't want Google to be able to talk right now. I just want my secure messenger app to be able to talk. I just want my weather app to be able to talk, but I just checked my weather and now I'm done with it. So I don't want that to be able to talk anymore.""."
Snowden,"We need to be able to make these intelligent decisions on not just an app by app basis, but a connection by connection basis. You want ... Let's say you use Facebook, because for whatever judgment we have, a lot of people might do it. You want it to be able to connect to Facebook's content servers. You want to be able to message a friend, you want to be able to download a photograph or whatever, but you don't want it to be able to talk to an ad server. You don't want it to talk to an analytics server that that's monitoring your behavior, right? You don't want to talk to all these third party things."
Interviewer,"Because Facebook crams their garbage into almost every app that you download and you don't even know it's happening because you can't see, and this is the problem with the data collection used today is there is an industry that is built on keeping this invisible. And what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices, whether it's a phone, whether it's computer or whatever, more visible and understandable to the average person, and then give them control over it."
Snowden,"So if you could see your phone right now and at the very center of is a little green icon that's your handset or it's a picture of your face, whatever, and then you see all these little spokes coming off of it. That's every app that your phone is talking to right now or every app that is active on your phone right now, and all the hosts that it's connecting to. And you can see right now, once every three seconds your phone is checking into Facebook and you could just poke that app and then boom, it's not talking to Facebook anymore. Facebook's not allowed. Facebook speaking privileges have been revoked, right? You would do that."
Interviewer,"We would all do that. If there was a button on your phone that said, ""Do what I want but not spy on me."" You would press that button. That button does not exist right now. And both Google and Apple, unfortunately Apple's a lot better at this than Google, but neither of them allow that button to exist. In fact, they actively interfere with it because they say it's a security risk and from a particular perspective, they actually aren't wrong there, but it's not enough to go, ""We have to lock that capability off from people because we don't trust they would make the right decisions. We think it's too complicated for people to do this. We think there's too many connections being made.""."
Snowden,"Well, that is actually a confession of the problem right there. If you think people can't understand it, if you think there are too many communications happening, if you think there's too much complexity in there, it needs to be simplified. Just like the president can't control everything like that. If you have to be the president of the phone and the phone is as complex as the United States government, we have a problem guys. This should be a much more simple process. It should be obvious and the fact that it's not and the fact that we read story after story year after year saying, ""All your data's been breached here, this company is spying on you here, this company's manipulating your purchases or your search results, or they're hiding these things from your timeline, or they're influencing you or manipulating it in all of these different ways.""."
Interviewer,"That happens as a result of a single problem, and that problem is an inequality of available information. They can see everything about you, they can see everything about what your device is doing, and they can do whatever they want with your device. You, on the other hand, owned the device. Well, rather you paid for the device, but increasingly these corporations own it, increasingly these governments own it. And increasingly we are living in a world where we do all the work, we pay all the taxes, we pay all the costs, but we own less and less. And nobody understands this better than the youngest generation."
Snowden,"Well, it seems like our data became a commodity before we understood what it was. It became this thing that's insanely valuable to Google and Facebook and all these social media platforms. Before we understood what we were giving up, they were making billions of dollars. And then once that money is being earned and once everyone's accustomed to this situation, it's very difficult to pull the reigns back. It's very difficult to turn that horse around."
Interviewer,"Precisely because the money then becomes power, right?"
Snowden,Right.
Interviewer,The information then becomes influence.
Snowden,"That also seems to be the same sort of situation that would happen with these mass surveillance states. Once they have the access, it's going to be incredibly difficult for them to relinquish that."
Interviewer,"Right. Yeah. No, you're you're exactly correct and this is the subject of the book. I mean, this is the permanent record and this is where it came from. This is how it came to exist. The story of our lifetimes is how intentionally, by design, a number of institutions, both governmental and corporate realized it was in their mutual interest to conceal their data collection activities, to increase the breadth and depth of their sensor networks that were sort of spread out through society. Remember, back in the day intelligence collection in the United States, even in , used to mean sending an FBI agent to put alligator clips on an embassy building or sending in a, somebody disguised as a workman and they put a bug in a building, or they built a satellite listening site. We called these foreign sat or foreign satellite collection. Or out in the desert somewhere they built a big a parabolic collector and it's just listening to satellite emissions. But these satellite emissions, these satellite links were owned by militaries. They were exclusive to governments, right? It wasn't affecting everybody broadly. All surveillance was targeted because it had to be."
Snowden,"What changed with technology is that surveillance could now become indiscriminate. It could become a drag net. It could become bulk collection, which should become one of the dirtiest phrases in the language if we have any kind of decency. But we were intentionally ... This was intentionally concealed from us, right? The government did it. They used classification. Companies did it. They intentionally didn't talk about it. They denied these things were going, they said, ""You agreed to this."" And you didn't agree to nothing like this. I'm sorry, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Snowden,"They go, ""We put terms of service page up and you click that."" You clicked a button that said, ""I agree."" Because you were trying to open an account so you could talk to your friends. You were trying to get driving directions. You were trying to get an email account. You weren't trying to agree to some 600 page legal form. That, even if you read, you wouldn't understand and it doesn't matter even if you did understand because one of the very first paragraphs in it said, ""This disagreement can be changed at any time unilaterally without your consent by the company."" They have built a legal paradigm that presumes records collected about us do not belong to us. This is one of the core principles on which mass surveillance from the government's perspective in the United States is legal, and you have to understand that all this stuff we talk about today, government says everything they do is legal right, and they go, ""So, it's fine.""."
Interviewer,"Our prospective as a public should be well, that's actually the problem, because this isn't okay. The scandal isn't how they're breaking the law. The scandal is that they don't have to break the law. And the way they say they're not breaking the law is something called the third party doctrine. A third party doctrine is a legal principle derived from a case in, I believe, the 1970s called Smith versus Maryland. And Smith was this knucklehead who was harassing this lady, making phone calls to her house. And when she would pick up, he'd just, I don't know, sit there, heavy breathing, whatever, like a classic creeper. It was terrifying this poor lady. So she calls the cops and says, ""One day I got one of these phone calls and then I see this car creeping past my house on the street."" And she got a license plate number."
Snowden,"So she goes to the cops and she goes, ""Is this the guy?"" And the cops, again, they're trying to do a good thing here. They look up his license plate number and they find out where this guy is. And then they go, ""Well, what phone number's registered to that house?"" And they go to the phone company and they say, ""Can you give us this record?"" The phone company says, ""Yeah, sure."" And it's the guy. The cops got their man. So they go arrest this guy and then in court his lawyer brings all this stuff up and they go, ""You did this without a warrant.""."
Interviewer,"Sorry, that was the problem was they went to the phone company and they got the records without a warrant. They just asked for it or they subpoenaed it, some lower standard of legal review and the company gave it to them and got the guy, they march him off to jail and they could've gotten a warrant. Right. But it was just expedience. They just didn't want to take the time, it was small town cops. You can understand how it happens. They know the guy's a creeper, they just want to get them off to jail."
Snowden,"So they made a mistake, but the government doesn't want to let go. They fight on this and they go, ""It wasn't actually ... They weren't his records. And so because they didn't belong to him, he didn't have the fourth amendment right to demand a warrant be issued for them. They were the company's records and the company provided them voluntarily and hence no warrant was required, because you can give whatever you want without a warrant as long as it's yours."" Now here's the problem. The government extrapolated a principle in a single case of a single known, suspected criminal who they had real good reasons to suspect was their guy, and use that to go to a company and get records from them and establish a precedent that these records don't belong to the guy, they belong to the company."
Interviewer,"Then they said, ""Well, if one person doesn't have a fourth amendment interest in records held by a company, no one does."" And so the company then has absolute proprietary ownership of all of these records about all of our lives. And remember, this is back in the 1970s. The internet hardly exists in these kinds of contexts. Smartphones don't exist. Modern society, modern communications don't exist. This is the very beginning of the technological era. And flash forward now 40 years, and they are still relying on this precedent about this one pervy creeper to go, ""Nobody has a privacy right for anything that's held by a company."" And so long as they do that companies are going to be extraordinarily powerful and they're going to be extraordinarily abusive and this is something that people don't get."
Snowden,"They go, ""Oh, well it's data collection, right? They're exploiting data."" This is data about human lives. It is data about people. These records are about you. It's not data that's being exploited. It's people that are being exploited. It's not data that's being manipulated, it's you that's being manipulated. And this is something that I think a lot of people are beginning to understand. Now the problem is the companies and the governments are still pretending they don't understand, or disagreeing with this, and this reminds me of something that one of my old friends, John Perry Barlow, who served with me at the Freedom of The Press Foundation, I'm the president of the board, used to say to me, which is, ""You can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep."" He said it's an old native American saying."
Interviewer,That's a great expression. That's a good way to ....
Snowden,Yeah.
Interviewer,"I think that's a good way to end this. Ed, thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate it. Please tell everybody the title of your book and it's available right now."
Snowden,"Sure. Yes it is. It's on shelves everywhere, at least until the government finds some other way to ban it. It is called Permanent Record and I hope you will read it. Thank you so much."
Interviewer,"I will read it and I think what you've done is incredibly brave and I think you're a very important part of history. I think when all is said and done what you did and what you exposed is going to change the way we view mass surveillance, change the way we view government oversight, and change the way we view the distribution of information. I really think it's very, very important, and it was an honor to talk to you, man. Thank you."
Snowden,"Oh, it was my pleasure. Thank you so much for having me on."
Interviewer,"Take care of yourself, man. Stay safe."
Snowden,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Interviewer,No. Don't stay safe.
Snowden,Don't stay safe.
Interviewer,Stay free. Open to possibilities. Take care.
Snowden,Take care.
Interviewer,"Mr. Snowden, did you sleep well the last couple of nights? Because, I was reading that you asked for a kind of police protection. Are there any threats?"
Snowden,"There are significant threats but I sleep very well. There was an article that came out in an online outlet called BuzzFeed where they interviewed officials from the Pentagon, from the National Security Agency and they gave them anonymity to be able to say what they wanted, and what they told the reporter was that they wanted to murder me. These individuals, and these are acting government officials, they said they would be happy, they would love to put a bullet in my head, to poison me as I was returning from the grocery store, and have me die in the shower."
Interviewer,"But, fortunately, you are still alive with us."
Snowden,"Right, but I'm still alive, and I don't lose sleep because I've done what I feel I needed to do. It was the right thing to do. And, I'm not going to be afraid."
Interviewer,"""The greatest fear I have,"" and I quote you, ""regarding these disclosures is nothing will change."" That was one of your greatest concerns at the time, but in the meantime there is a vivid discussion about the situation with the NSA. Not only in America but also in Germany and in Brazil, and President Obama was forced to go public and to justify what the NSA was doing on legal grounds."
Snowden,"What we saw initially in response to the revelations was sort of a circling of the wagons of government around the National Security Agency. Instead of circling around the public and protecting their rights, the political class circled around the security state and protected their rights. What's interesting is, though that was the initially response, since then we've seen a softening. We've seen the President acknowledge that when he first said ""we've drawn the right balance, there are no abuses,"" we've seen him and his officials admit that there have been abuses. There have been thousands of violations of the National Security Agency and other agencies, authorities, every single year."
Interviewer,Is the speech of Obama recently the beginning of a serious regulation?
Snowden,"It was clear from the President's speech that he wanted to make minor changes to preserve authorities that we don't need. The President created a review board from officials that were personal friends, from national security insiders, former Deputy of the CIA, people who had every incentive to be soft on these programs and to see them in the best possible light. But what they found was that these programs have no value, they've never stopped a terrorist attack in the United States, and they have marginal utility at best for other things. The only thing that the Section 215 phone meta-data program, actually it's a broader meta-data program of bulk collection, bulk collection means mass surveillance, program was in stopping or detecting a $8,500 wire transfer from a cab driver in California. And, it's this kind of review, where insiders go ""we don't need these programs, these programs don't make us safe. They take a tremendous amount of resources to run, and they offer us no value."" They go ""we can modify these."" The National Security agency operates under the President's executive authority alone. He can end, or modify, or direct a change in their policies at any time."
Interviewer,For the first time President Obama did concede that the NSA collects and stores trillions of data.
Snowden,"Every time you pick up the phone, dial a number, write an email, make a purchase, travel on the bus carrying a cell phone, swipe a card somewhere, you leave a trace. And, the government has decided that it's a good idea to collect it all. Everything. Even if you've never been suspected of any crime. Traditionally the government would identify a suspect, they would go to a judge, they would say we suspect he's committed this crime, they would get a warrant and then they would be able to use the totality of their powers in pursuit of the investigation. Nowadays what we see is they want to apply the totality of their powers in advance, prior to an investigaion."
Interviewer,"You started this debate. Edward Snowden is, in the meantime, a household name for the whistleblower in the age of the internet. You were working until last summer for the NSA, and during this time you collected, secretly, thousands of confidential documents. What was the decisive moment, or was there a long period of time, or something happening? Why did you do this?"
Snowden,"I would say sort of the breaking point is seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress. There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that, for me, really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs. The public had a right to know that which the government is doing in its name, and that which the government is doing against the public, but neither of these things we were allowed to discuss, we were allowed no, even the wider body of our elected representatives were prohibited from knowing or discussing these programs, and that's a dangerous thing. The only review we had was from a secret court, the FISA Court, which is a sort of rubber stamp authority."
Interviewer,"We're not talking only of the NSA as far as this is concerned. There is a multilateral agreement for cooperation among the services and this alliance of intelligence operations is known as The Five Eyes. What agencies and countries belong to this alliance, and what is its purpose?"
Snowden,The Five Eyes alliance is sort of an artifact of the post World War II era where the Anglophone countries are the major powers banded together to sort of cooperate and share the costs of intelligence gathering infrastructure.
Interviewer,"In many countries, as in America too, the agencies like the NSA are not allowed to spy within their own borders on their own people. So, the Brits for example, they can spy on everybody but the Brits. But, the NSA can conduct surveillance in England. So, in the very end they could exchange their data and it would be, they would be, strictly following the law."
Snowden,"If you ask the governments about this directly they would deny it and point to policy agreements between the members of the Five Eyes saying that they won't spy on each other's citizens. But, there are a couple of key points there. One is that the way they define spying is not the collection of data. The GCHQ is collecting an incredible amount of data on British citizens, just as the National Security Agency is gathering an enormous amount of data on US citizens. What they are saying is that they will not then target people within that data. They won't look for UK citizens or British citizens. In addition, the policy agreements between them that say British won't target US citizens, US won't target British citizens, are not legally binding. The actual memorandums of agreement state specifically on that that they are not intended to put a legal restriction on any government. Their policy agreements that can be deviated from or broken at any time. So if they want to spy on a British citizen, they can spy on a British citizen, and then they can even share that data with the British government that is itself forbidden from spying on UK citizens. So there is a sort of a trading dynamic there, but it's not, it's not open, it's more of a nudge and wink. And, beyond that, the key is to remember the surveillance and the abuse doesn't occur when people look at the data, it occurs when people gather the data in the first place."
Interviewer,How narrow is the cooperation of the German Secret Service BND with the NSA and the Five Eyes?
Snowden,"I would describe it as intimate. As a matter of fact, the first way I described it in our written interview, was that the German Services and the US Services are in bed together. They not only share information, the reporting of results from intelligence, but they actually share the tools and the infrastructure. They work together against joint targets in services. And, there's a lot of danger in this. One of the major programs that face abuse in the National Security Agency is what's called ""XKeyscore."" It's a front end search engine that allows them to look through all of the records they collect worldwide every day."
Interviewer,What could you do if you would sit so to speak in their place with this kind of instrument?
Snowden,"You could read anyone's email in the world. Anybody you got an email address for, any website you can watch traffic to and from it, any computer that an individual sits at, you can watch it, any laptop that you're tracking, you can follow it as it moves from place to place throughout the world. It's a one stop shop for access to the NSA's information. And what's more, you can tag individuals using ""XKeyscore."" Where, let's say I saw you once and I thought what you were doing was interesting, or you just have access that's interesting to me. Let's say you work at a major German corporation, and I want access to that network. I can track your username on a website, on a form somewhere, I can track your real name, I can track associations with your friends, and I can build what's called a fingerprint, which is network activity unique to you, which means anywhere you go in the world, anywhere you try to sort of hide your online presence, hide your identity, the NSA can find you. And, anyone who's allowed to use this, or who the NSA shares their software with, can do the same thing. Germany is one of the countries that have access to ""XKeyscore.""."
Interviewer,"This sounds rather frightening. The question is, does the BND deliver data of Germans to the NSA?"
Snowden,"Whether the BND does it directly, or knowingly, the NSA gets German data. Whether it's provided, I can't speak to until it's been reported, because it would be classified. And, I prefer that journalists make the distinctions, and the decisions, about what is public interest and what should be published. However, it's no secret that every country in the world has the data of their citizens in the NSA. Millions and millions and millions of data connections, from Germans going about their daily lives, talking on their cell phones, sending SMS messages, visiting websites, buying things online, all of this ends up at the NSA. And, it's reasonable to suspect that the BND may be aware of it in some capacity. Now, whether or not they actively provide the information, I should not say."
Interviewer,"The BND basically argues if we do this, we do this accidentally actually, and our filter didn't work."
Snowden,"Right. So, the kind of things that they're discussing there are two things. They're talking about filtering of ingest, which means when the NSA puts a secret server in a German telecommunications provider, or they hack a German router and they divert the traffic in a manner that let's them search through things, they're saying ""if I see what I think is a German talking to another German I'll drop it."" But, how do you know? You could say ""well, these people are speaking the German language, this IP address seems to be from a German company to another German company,"" but that's not accurate, and they wouldn't dump all of that traffic because they'll get people who are targets of interest, who are actively in Germany using German communications. So, realistically, what's happening is when they say ""there's no spying on Germans,"" they don't mean that German data isn't being gathered, they don't mean that records aren't being taken or stolen. What they mean is that they're not intentionally searching for German citizens. And, that's sort of a fingers crossed behind the back promise, it's not reliable."
Interviewer,"What about other European countries, like Norway and Sweden for example, because we have a lot of, I think, underwater cables going through the Baltic Sea."
Snowden,"So, this is sort of an expansion of the same idea. If the NSA isn't collecting information on German citizens in Germany, are they as soon as it leaves German borders? And, the answer is ""yes."" Any single communication that transits the internet, the NSA may intercept at multiple points. They might see it in Germany, they might see it in Sweden, they might see it in Norway or Finland, they might see it in Britain, and they might see it in the United States. Any single one of these places that a German communication crosses, it'll be ingested and added to the database."
Interviewer,"So, let's come to our southern European neighbors then. What about Italy? What about France? What about Spain?"
Snowden,It's the same deal worldwide.
Interviewer,"Does the NSA spy on Siemens? On Mercedes? On other successful German companies, for example, to prevail, to have the advantage of knowing what is going on in a scientific and economic world?"
Snowden,I don't want to preempt the editorial decisions of journalists.
Interviewer,Ok.
Snowden,"But, what I will say is there's no question that the US is engaged in economic spying. If there's information at Siemens that they think would be beneficial to the national interests, not the national security of the United States, they'll go after that information, and they'll take it."
Interviewer,"There is this old saying ""you do whatever you can do."" So, the NSA is doing whatever is technically possible."
Snowden,"This is something that the President touched on last year, where he said that just because we can do something, and this was in relation to tapping Angela Merkel's phone. Just because we can do something, doesn't mean that we should. And, that's exactly what's happened. The technological capabilities that have been provided, because of sort of weak security standards in internet protocols and cellular communications networks, have meant that intelligence services can create systems that see everything."
Interviewer,"Nothing annoyed the German government more than the fact that the NSA taped the private phone of the German Chancellor Merkel over the last 10 years, obviously. Suddenly this invisible surveillance was connected with a known face and was not connected with a kind of watery, shady terrorist background. Obama now promised to stop snooping on Merkel, which raises the question ""did the NSA tape already previous governments, including the previous chancellors, and when did they do that? And, how long did they do this for?""."
Snowden,"This is a particularly difficult question for me to answer, because there's information that I very strongly believe is in the public interest. However, as I've said before, I prefer for journalists to make those decisions in advance, review the material themselves, and decide whether or not the public value of this information outweighs the sort of reputational cost to the officials that ordered the surveillance. What I can say is we know Angela Merkel was monitored by the National Security Agency. The question is how reasonable is it to assume that she is the only German official that was monitored? How reasonable is it to believe that she's the only prominent German face who the National Security Agency was watching? I would suggest it seems unreasonable that if anyone was concerned about the intentions of German leadership, that they would only watch Merkel and not her aides, not other prominent officials, not heads of ministries, or even local government officials."
Interviewer,"How does a young man from Elizabeth City in North Carolina, 30 years old, get in such a position in such a sensitive area?"
Snowden,"That's a very difficult question to answer. In general, I would say it highlights the dangers of privatizing government functions. I worked previously as an actual staff officer, a government employee for the Central Intelligence Agency, but I've also served much more frequently as a contractor in a private capacity. What that means is, you have private for-profit companies doing inherently governmental work, like targeted espionage, surveillance, compromising foreign systems. And, anyone who has the skills, who can convince a private company that they have the qualifications to do so, will be empowered by the government to do that, and there's very little oversight. There's very little review."
Interviewer,"Have you been one of these classical computer kids sitting red eyed during the nights in the age of 12, 15, and your father was knocking on your door and saying ""switch off the light, it's too late now?"" Did you get your computer skills from that side? Or, when did you get your first computer?"
Snowden,"hahaha Right, right. I definitely have had a, shall we say, a deep informal education in computers and electronic technology. They've always been fascinating and interesting to me. hahaha The characterization of having your parents telling you to go to bed, I would say is fair."
Interviewer,"If one looks to the little public data of your life, one discovers that you, obviously, wanted to join in May 2004, the Special Forces to fight in Iraq. What did motivate you at the time? You know, Special Forces, looking at you in the very moment, means grim fighting, and it means probably killing. And, did you ever get to Iraq?"
Snowden,"No, I didn't get to Iraq. One of the interesting things about the Special Forces are that they're not actually intended for direct combat. They're what's referred to as ""a force multiplier."" They're inserted behind enemy lines. It's a squad that has a number of different specialties in it, and they teach and enable the local population to resist, or to support, US forces in a way that allows the local population a chance to help determine their own destiny. And, I felt that was an inherently noble thing at the time. In hindsight, some of the reasons that we went into Iraq were not well founded. And, I think did a disservice to everyone involved."
Interviewer,"What happened to your adventure then? Did you stay long with them? Or, what happened to you?"
Snowden,"No, I broke my legs when I was in training and was discharged."
Interviewer,So it was a short adventure in other words?
Snowden,It was a short adventure.
Interviewer,"In 2007 the CIA stationed you with a diplomatic cover in Geneva, in Switzerland. Why did you join the CIA by the way?"
Snowden,I don't think I can actually answer that one.
Interviewer,"OK, if it's what you have been doing there, forget it. But why did you join the CIA?"
Snowden,"In many ways I think it's a continuation of trying to do everything I could to prosecute the public good in the most effective way. And, it's in line with the rest of my government service where I tried to use my technical skills in the most difficult positions I could find in the world, and the CIA offered that."
Interviewer,"If we go back, Special Forces, CIA, NSA, it's not actually in the description of a human rights activist, or somebody who becomes a whistleblower after this. What happens to you?"
Snowden,"I think it tells a story, and that's, no matter how deeply an individual is embedded in the government, no matter how faithful to the government they are, no matter how strongly they believe in the causes of their government, as I did during the Iraq war, people can learn, people can discover the line between appropriate government behavior and actual wrongdoing. And, I think it became clear to me that that line had been crossed."
Interviewer,"You worked for the NSA through a private contractor with the name Booze Allen Hamilton, one of the big ones in the business. What is the advantage for the US Government, or the CIA, to work through a private contractor, to outsource a central government function?"
Snowden,"The contracting culture of the national security community in the United States is a complex topic. It's driven by a number of interests between primarily limiting the number of direct government employees at the same time as keeping lobbying groups in Congress, typically from very well funded businesses such as Booze Allen Hamilton. The problem there is you end up in a situation where government policies are being influenced by private corporations who have interests that are completely divorced from the public good in mind. The result of that is what we saw at Booze Allen Hamilton, where you have private individuals who have access to, what the government alleges were millions and millions of records that they could walk out the door with at any time with no accountability, no oversight, no auditing, the government didn't even know they were gone."
Interviewer,"At the very end you ended up in Russia. Many of the intelligence communities suspect you made a deal, classified material for Asylum here in Russia."
Snowden,"The Chief of the Task Force investigating me, as recently as December, said that their investigation had turned up no evidence, or indications at all, that I had any outside help, or contact, or had made a deal of any kind to accomplish my mission. I worked alone. I didn't need anybody's help. I don't have any ties to foreign governments. I'm not a spy for Russia, or China, or any other country for that matter. If I am a traitor, who did I betray? I gave all of my information to the American public, to American journalists, who are reporting on American issues. If they see that as treason, I think people really need to consider who do they think they're working for. The public is supposed to be their boss, not their enemy. Beyond that, as far as my personal safety, I'll never be fully safe until these systems have changed."
Interviewer,"After your revelations, none of the European countries really offered you asylum. Where did you apply in Europe for asylum?"
Snowden,"I can't remember the list of countries with any specificity because there were many of them. But, France, Germany were definitely in there, as was the UK. A number of European countries, all of whom, unfortunately, felt that doing the right thing was less important than supporting US political concerns."
Interviewer,"One reaction to the NSA snooping is in the very moment that countries like Germany are thinking to create national internets, an attempt to force internet companies to keep their data in their own country. Does this work?"
Snowden,"It's not gonna stop the NSA. Let's put it that way. The NSA goes where the data is. If the NSA can pull text messages out of telecommunication networks in China, they can probably manage to get Facebook messages out of Germany. Ultimately, the solution to that is not to try to stick everything in a walled garden, although that does raise the level of sophistication and complexity of taking the information. It's also much better simply to secure the information internationally against everyone, rather than playing 'let's move the data.' Moving the data isn't fixing the problem. Securing the data is the problem."
Interviewer,"President Obama, in the very moment, obviously doesn't care too much about the message of the leak. And, together with the NSA, they do care very much more about catching the messenger in that context. Obama asked the Russian president several times to extradite you. But Putin did not. It looks that you will stay to the rest of your life, probably in Russia. How do you feel about Russia in that context, and is there a solution to this problem."
Snowden,"I think it's becoming increasingly clear that these leaks didn't cause harm, in fact, they served the public good. Because of that, I think it will be very difficult to maintain sort of an ongoing campaign of persecution against someone who the public agrees serve the public interest."
Interviewer,"The New York Times wrote a very long comment, and demanded clemency for you. The headline ""Edward Snowden Whistleblower,"" and I quote from that, ""the public learned in great detail how the agency has extended its mandate and abused its authority."" And, the New York Times closes, ""President Obama should tell his aides to begin finding a way to end Mr. Snowden's vilification, and give him an incentive to return home."" Did you get a call in between from the White House?"
Snowden,"I've never received a call from the White House, and I am not waiting by the phone. But, I would welcome the opportunity to talk about how we can bring this to a conclusion that serves the interest of all parties. I think it's clear there are times where what is lawful is distinct from what is rightful. There are times throughout history and it doesn't take long for, either an American, or a German, to think about times in the history of their country where the law provided the government to do things which were not right."
Interviewer,"President Obama, obviously, is in the very moment not quite convinced of that, because he said to you are charged with three felonies. And, I quote, ""if you, Edward Snowden, believe in what you did, you should go back to America, appear before the court with a lawyer and make your case."" Is this the solution?"
Snowden,"It's interesting because he mentions three felonies. What he doesn't say is that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court to the public and convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. The Espionage Act was never intended, it's from 1918, it was never intended to prosecute journalistic sources, people who are informing the newspapers about information that's of public interest. It was intended for people who are selling documents in secret to foreign governments, who are bombing bridges, who are sabotaging communications, not people who are serving the public good. So, it's, I would say, illustrative that the president would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial."
Interviewer,"Why did you choose Hong Kong to go to and then tell them about US hacking on their research facilities and universities? How many sets of the documents you disclosed did you make, and how many different people have them? If anything happens to you, do they still exist?"
Snowden,"First, the US Government, just as they did with other whistleblowers, immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home, openly declaring me guilty of treason and that the disclosure of secret, criminal, and even unconstitutional acts is an unforgivable crime. That's not justice, and it would be foolish to volunteer yourself to it if you can do more good outside of prison than in it. Second, let's be clear"
Interviewer,I should have asked you this when I saw you but never got round to it........Why did you just not fly direct to Iceland if that is your preferred country for asylum?
Snowden,"Leaving the US was an incredible risk, as NSA employees must declare their foreign travel 30 days in advance and are monitored. There was a distinct possibility I would be interdicted en route, so I had to travel with no advance booking to a country with the cultural and legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained. Hong Kong provided that. Iceland could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current US administration."
Interviewer,"You have said HERE that you admire both Ellsberg and Manning, but have argued that there is one important distinction between yourself and the army private... Are you suggesting that Manning indiscriminately dumped secrets into the hands of Wikileaks and that he intended to harm people?"
Snowden,"No, I'm not. Wikileaks is a legitimate journalistic outlet and they carefully redacted all of their releases in accordance with a judgment of public interest. The unredacted release of cables was due to the failure of a partner journalist to control a passphrase. However, I understand that many media outlets used the argument that documents were dumped to smear Manning, and want to make it clear that it is not a valid assertion here."
Interviewer,"Did you lie about your salary? What is the issue there? Why did you tell Glenn Greenwald that your salary was $200,000 a year, when it was only $122,000 (according to the firm that fired you.)."
Snowden,"I was debriefed by Glenn and his peers over a number of days, and not all of those conversations were recorded. The statement I made about earnings was that $200,000 was my career high salary. I had to take pay cuts in the course of pursuing specific work. Booz was not the most I've been paid."
Interviewer,Why did you wait to release the documents if you said you wanted to tell the world about the NSA programs since before Obama became president?
Snowden,"Obama's campaign promises and election gave me faith that he would lead us toward fixing the problems he outlined in his quest for votes. Many Americans felt similarly. Unfortunately, shortly after assuming power, he closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge."
Interviewer,Define in as much detail as you can what direct access means. Can analysts listen to content of domestic calls without a warrant?
Snowden,"More detail on how direct NSA's accesses are is coming, but in general, the reality is this"
Interviewer,Define in as much detail as you can what direct access means. Can analysts listen to content of domestic calls without a warrant?
Snowden,"NSA likes to use domestic as a weasel word here for a number of reasons. The reality is that due to the FISA Amendments Act and its section 702 authorities, Americans' communications are collected and viewed on a daily basis on the certification of an analyst rather than a warrant. They excuse this as incidental collection, but at the end of the day, someone at NSA still has the content of your communications. Even in the event of warranted intercept, it's important to understand the intelligence community doesn't always deal with what you would consider a real warrant like a Police department would have to, the warrant is more of a templated form they fill out and send to a reliable judge with a rubber stamp."
Interviewer,"When you say someone at NSA still has the content of your communications - what do you mean? Do you mean they have a record of it, or the actual content?"
Snowden,"Both. If I target for example an email address, for example under FAA 702, and that email address sent something to you, Joe America, the analyst gets it. All of it. IPs, raw data, content, headers, attachments, everything. And it gets saved for a very long time - and can be extended further with waivers rather than warrants."
Interviewer,They say it's a balance of privacy and safety. I think spying makes us less safe. do you agree?
Snowden,"Intelligence agencies do have a role to play, and the people at the working level at the NSA, CIA, or any other member of the IC are not out to get you. They're good people trying to do the right thing, and I can tell you from personal experience that they were worried about the same things I was."
Interviewer,Recently several threats have been made on your life by the intelligence community. Are you afraid for your life? Thoughts?
Snowden,"It's concerning, to me, but primarily for reasons you might not expect. That current, serving officials of our government are so comfortable in their authorities that they're willing to tell reporters on the record that they think the due process protections of the 5th Amendment of our Constitution are outdated concepts. These are the same officials telling us to trust that they'll honor the 4th and 1st Amendments. This should bother all of us. The fact that it's also a direct threat to my life is something I am aware of, but I'm not going to be intimidated. Doing the right thing means having no regrets."
Interviewer,what's the worst and most realistic harm from bulk collection of data? Why do you think it outweighs national security?
Snowden,"The worst and happening-right-now harm of bulk collection, which again, is a euphemism for mass surveillance, is two-fold. The first is the chilling effect, which is well-understood. Study after study has show that human behavior changes when we know we're being watched. Under observation, we act less free, which means we effectively *are* less free. The second, less understood but far more sinister effect of these classified programs, is that they effectively create ""permanent records"" of our daily activities, even in the absence of any wrongdoing on our part. This enables a capability called ""retroactive investigation,"" where once you come to the government's attention, they've got a very complete record of your daily activity going back, under current law, often as far as five years. You might not remember where you went to dinner on June 12th 2009, but the government does. The power these records represent can't be overstated. In fact, researchers have referred to this sort of data gathering as resulting in ""databases of ruin,"" where harmful and embarrassing details exist about even the most innocent individuals. The fact that these records are gathered without the government having any reasonable suspicion or probable cause justifying the seizure of data is so divorced from the domain of reason as to be incapable of ever being made lawful at all, and this view was endorsed as recently as today by the federal government's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight board. Fundamentally, a society in which the pervasive monitoring of the sum of civil activity becomes routine is turning from the traditions of liberty toward what is an inherently illiberal infrastructure of preemptive investigation, a sort of quantified state where the least of actions are measured for propriety. I don't seek to pass judgment in favor or against such a state in the short time I have here, only to declare that it is not the one we inherited, and should we as a society embrace it, it should be the result of public decision rather than closed conference."
Interviewer,How should the community of states react to the new information concerning surveillance? What actions have to be made?
Snowden,"We need to work together to agree on a reasonable international norm for the limitations on spying. Nobody should be hacking critical-to-life infrastructure like hospitals and power stations, and it's fair to say that can be recognized in international law. Additionally, we need to recognize that national laws are not going to solve the problem of indiscriminate surveillance. A prohibition in Burundi isn't going to stop the spies in Greenland. We need a global forum, and global funding, committed to the development of security standards that enforce our right to privacy not through law, but through science and technology. The easiest way to ensure a country's communications are secure is to secure them world-wide, and that means better standards, better crypto, and better research."
Interviewer,"The Ecuadorean Consul in London, Fidel Narvaez, lost his job after his helping you to safety was spun. Message for his family?"
Snowden,"Fidel is an incredibly brave individual, and he did everything that was possible to ensure that the rights of someone he had never met would be protected. He could have turned away from a tough decision, but instead of letting my situation become someone else's problem, he did what he thought was right. That kind of commitment to doing the right thing, even knowing it could get you in trouble, is something the world needs more of."
Interviewer,Under what conditions would you agree to return to the U.S.?
Snowden,"Returning to the US, I think, is the best resolution for the government, the public, and myself, but it's unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws, which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myselfThe hundred-year old law under which I've been charged, which was never intended to be used against people working in the public interest, and forbids a public interest defense. This is especially frustrating, because it means there's no chance to have a fair trial, and no way I can come home and make my case to Maybe when Congress comes together to end the programs the PCLOB just announced was illegal, they'll reform the Whistleblower Protection Act, and we'll see a mechanism for all Americans, no matter who they work for, to get a fair trial."
Interviewer,Do you think that the Watchdog Report by Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board will have any impact at all?
Snowden,"I don't see how Congress could ignore it, as it makes it clear there is no reason at all to maintain the 215 program. Let me quote from the official report""Cessation of the program would eliminate the privacy and civil liberties concerns associated with bulk collection without unduly hampering the government's efforts, while ensuring that any governmental requests for telephone calling records are tailored to the needs of specific investigations.""."
Interviewer,what in your opinion is the appropriate extent of US national security apparatus? Surely some spying is needed?
Snowden,"Not all spying is bad. The biggest problem we face right now is the new technique of indiscriminate mass surveillance, where governments are seizing billions and billions and billions of innocents' communication every single day. This is done not because it's necessary, after all, these programs are unprecedented in US history, and were begun in response to a threat that kills fewer Americans every year than bathtub falls and police officers, but because new technologies make it easy and cheap. I think a person should be able to dial a number, make a purchase, send an SMS, write an email, or visit a website without having to think about what it's going to look like on their permanent record. Particularly when we now have courts, reports from the federal government, and even statements from Congress making it clear these programs haven't made us any more safe, we need to push back. This is a global problem, and America needs to take the lead in fixing it. If our government decides our Constitution's 4th Amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures no longer applies simply because that's a more efficient means of snooping, we're setting a precedent that immunizes the government of every two-bit dictator to perform the same kind of indiscriminate, dragnet surveillance of entire populations that the NSA is doing. It's not good for our country, it's not good for the world, and I wasn't going to stand by and watch it happen, no matter how much it cost me. The NSA and the rest of the US Intelligence Community is exceptionally well positioned to meet our intelligence requirements through targeted surveillance, the same way we've always done it, without resorting to the mass surveillance of entire populations. When we're sophisticated enough to be able to break into any device in the world we want to (up to and including Angela Merkel's phone, if reports are to be believed), there's no excuse to be wasting our time collecting the call records of grandmothers in Missouri."
Interviewer,Was the privacy of your co-workers considered while you were stealing their log-in and password information?
Snowden,"With all due respect to Mark Hosenball, the Reuters report that put this out there was simply wrong. I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers."
Interviewer,do you think it's a shame that #Obama gave his #NSA speech before his Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board reported?
Snowden,"The timing of his speech seems particularly interesting, given that it was accompanied by so many claims that ""these programs have not been abused."" Even if we accept the NSA's incredibly narrow definition of abuse, which is ""someone actually broke the rules so badly we had to investigate them for it,"" we've seen more instances of identified, intentional abuse than we have seen instances where this unconstitutional mass phone surveillance stopped any kind of terrorist plot at all, even something less than an attack. To back that up with the government's own numbers, according to the NSA Inspector General, we've seen at least 12 specific, intentional cases of ""abuse"" by the NSA. In contrast, the federal government's independent PCLOB report on the NSA's mass phone surveillance today (which stated the NSA has spied on at least 120,000,000 American phones under this program) said this"
Interviewer,What do you think about Obama's whistleblowing protection act?
Snowden,"One of the things that has not been widely reported by journalists is that whistleblower protection laws in the US do not protect contractors in the national security arena. There are so many holes in the laws, the protections they afford are so weak, and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing. If I had revealed what I knew about these unconstitutional but classified programs to Congress, they could have charged me with a felony. One only need to look at the case of Thomas Drake to see how the government doesn't have a good history of handling legitimate reports of wrongdoing within the system. Despite this, and despite the fact that I could not legally go to the official channels that direct NSA employees have available to them, I still made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co-workers, supervisors, and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen. The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled, but no one was willing to risk their jobs, families, and possibly even freedom to go to through what Drake did. My case clearly demonstrates the need for comprehensive whistleblower protection act reform. If we had had a real process in place, and reports of wrongdoing could be taken to real, independent arbiters rather than captured officials, I might not have had to sacrifice so much to do what at this point even the President seems to agree needed to be done."
Interviewer,"How quickly can the NSA, et. al. decrypt AES messages with strong keys Does encrypting our emails even work?"
Snowden,"As I've said before, properly implemented strong encryption works. What you have to worry about are the endpoints. If someone can steal you keys (or the pre-encryption plaintext), no amount of cryptography will protect you. However, that doesn't mean end-to-end crypto is a lost cause. By combining robust endpoint security with transport security, people can have much greater confidence in their day to day communications."
Interviewer,Do you think it is possible for our democracy to recover from the damage NSA spying has done to our liberties?
Snowden,"Yes. What makes our country strong is our system of values, not a snapshot of the structure of our agencies or the framework of our laws. We can correct the laws, restrain the overreach of agencies, and hold the senior officials responsible for abusive programs to account."
Interviewer,Can you explain why there's a need for multiple leadership models?
Snowden,"I think because you have multiple situations. So under conditions of certainty where you can apply constraint, you can control by constraints. You can have a very directive style of leadership. On the other hand, if the situation becomes highly uncertain, then there isn't a previous plan that you can rely on, you need people to actually have the right sort of experience, to make some intuitive decisions but also to carry people with them in following that decision. Now those are very different styles in my HBR article, we identified four different general styles of leadership and you could look at subsets of those."
Interviewer,So different situations which call for different models to use in there?
Snowden,"Yes and I think this is not the one size fits all and you see this in the management literature. So you get a leader who has been in the right place at the right time and succeeded. They then assume they have a general model that will work for many other contexts. For example, you get the mayor of New York first time it ever happens to do the right thing in the crisis, he then writes a book about leadership but he can't even get on the Republican short list. So the trouble is we abstract from the single context into a general model and that's not going to work, right? If you look at historical models of leadership, and this actually links to brain facility, there's a difference between leading the tribe and holding the wisdom of the tribe let alone asking naive questions to the leaders of the tribe. So even within a collective construct; there are different models of leadership."
Interviewer,"For those not familiar with the Cynefin, can you briefly explain it?"
Snowden,"Cynefin works off three ontologies so it talks about ordered systems with a high level of constraint where you've got predictability and it divides those into two obvious where everybody knows what the constraints are, everybody buys into then and complicated where experts understand the situation (and you have to trust them) or analysis is necessary to understand what to do."
Interviewer,Can you explain what makes the chaos state temporary?
Snowden,"Well, because it's very difficult for anything to be unconstrained. If you get a crisis, somebody will impose order pretty damn fast. If you look in randomness in chemistry, you get some order within nanoseconds, some sort of structure will emerge. So if I hold something in that state it takes a lot of energy. Like nuclear fusion, the energy to maintain the magnets to hold the plasma is more than the energy you get out of it. So we use chaos for example for distributed decision support and for innovation but it's a very structured process because to create randomness, it takes a lot of energy."
Interviewer,That's why it will self organize?
Snowden,"I mean you can fall into it by accident and then it's catastrophic but sooner or later, somebody will impose constraints pretty damn fast."
Interviewer,Can you give some examples of how the Cynefin framework can be used to keep the user requirements?
Snowden,"Well, that's what we're working on at the moment so what are we doing? We have user requirements against known needs (for example going back a few years we were writing a computer program to actually automate a double entry bookkeeping). In Cynefin terms, that's obvious."
Interviewer,What are the benefits of using this Cynefin approach for capturing the requirements?
Snowden,"You radically reduce the costs in terms of wastage. If you go to any agile conferences, people talk about high levels of failure, now there are two responses to that. One is to accept it, the other is to say, well, maybe it's because we haven't allowed enough ambiguity early on."
Interviewer,It's both for reducing waste in your process but also speeding up the process?
Snowden,"Yes and I think it's more a lean approach to waste as well. So by moving programmers closer to user stories, that's kind of like the lean principle in operation."
Interviewer,Can you elaborate about the key steps that are needed to scale Agile methods to cross an organization?
Snowden,"Well step number one is do not go anywhere near a pyramid planning scheme like SAFe. It's a backwards step. I think the issue on the scaling in the complex system is you scale by decomposition and recombination not by aggregation. So one of the things we're doing for example is take strategic needs, operational needs and technology capabilities, capturing those in real-time, emerge them together in fitness landscapes to see where they start to cluster together and so that scaled by decomposition reactive recomposition."
Interviewer,trains run on tracks and the last thing you want is tracks in a complex system.
Snowden,I'm talking about top-down enablement of bottom-up actions. So the role of top is to create constraints and relax constraint as needed and then dynamically allocate resources where in patterns of success emerge; you don't do that through micromanagement.
Interviewer,Is it like setting the conditions top down and then filling it in bottom up?
Snowden,"Yes but you also need real-time feedback loops. so we are working at the moment to allow executives to ask questions to the whole work force in five minutes and represent the results as a fitness landscape. So you're talking about much more into connectivity and much more necessary ambiguity. Lots of leadership models say that you should remove ambiguity and be very clear, we're saying that if you're in complex, you should actually increase the ambiguity because decreasing the ambiguity is a bad idea, it means you miss things you need to see."
Interviewer,Is this the same kind of thinking that you see in antifragility?
Snowden,"Yes. I have mixed feelings about Taleb all right? He's one of the best of the popular authors, 'Surprise by chance', is a brilliant book, Black Swan less so. Antifragility for me is a sub section of resilience. I think the trouble is he wants to make antifragility unique instead of making a hugely valuable contribution to the field as a whole. Resilience is surviving with continuity of identity at the time. Systems which become stronger when they fail are sub-function of that and not the totality."
Interviewer,What are your thoughts on sustainable change? How can leaders make it happen?
Snowden,They need to know when to apply directive leadership and when they need to change the constraints. There's times where you take control and we have whole models on this
Interviewer,"I recognize the styles of leadership. I'm working with teams all around the world, which are translating my books and I usually start off with giving them as much freedom as they want and usually at some point in time, they say, ""Okay, but we need a little bit more direction, we need a little bit more telling us what to do and then we find a way for that until we get to a point and they say, ""Okay, well we can do this ourselves, so can you back off.""."
Snowden,"In traditional models the apprentices will become a journeymen at which point they teach. Then some of the journeyman will become masters. Experience and peer interaction is key. You can't reduce it to simplistic training courses, competence models and airport books.. That approach is dangerous, and we are seeing it in Design Thinking, management development and many fields, as it is trying to codify an artisan process which cannot be codified. They are trying to reduce something which takes two or three years to understand into a two week training course. That's criminal."
