you know i understand why

you know so many people are fearful and

i guess what people say

is like if you're not fearful they're

quick to just throw the crazy

thing out of you and i just feel like

it's already i have friends that are

respectful to me

that don't want to say crazy and i say

well you could just say yay then you

don't have to say

yay right now you say are we going

you're going yay like if something

sounds like an album title something is

crazy and it's like you don't know if

it's good or bad that could be crazy but

if it's crazy

and you know it's like really good

that's lazy

all right ladies and gentlemen this is

the moment we have all been waiting for

i'm in the presence of someone that i

consider a true friend someone that i

love a man of god

please yeah yes in this corner

the the one and only class is in session

with mr kanye west it's this whole thing

where people are supposed to be

you know these uh

express these powers but then

uh put on like a clark kent outfit or

something like that

and that express themselves like how

they would express themselves

like i always knew that i'm so i should

have a vest on right now like i always

knew i was going to wear vests

as a part of my campaign my dad was like

so why did you wear

a vest i was like i saw one i just

remind me i was like oh man i

really meant to wear a vest that's the

whole thing on my radio show my whole

thing

you said the billboards and stuff i'll

be my best in l.a because it's like

wherever it is we dangerous when we

speak so and

also the rest of my outfit in south

carolina was actually the exact outfit

that the security

was wearing so and the vessels is

actually

security they can't be secure and i'm

not secure i want to be

just as safe as them yeah and just

egalitarian saying

to be you know

you know at the at the beginning middle

and the end of the day

i'm a dad and there's so many fathers

that you know they

they have jobs where

their whole you know their whole point

in life is to

take care of their family provider and

to be a provider

and you know you can get

you know when you're supposed to provide

only one service like we need your new

album

you know it's to to be able to go and

just

provide for your kids but be able to set

a a tone of morality right a tone of

spirituality

like god brought me to my knees multiple

times

the first time that i was put into the

hospital in 2016

i actually started reading the bible

that was part of

what god hit me with and

you know god has a calling

on all of us and he uses us in different

ways

because you know i i'm not going gonna

lie to you i like being cool

i didn't go into an environment to

come off uncool right why would i want

to come off uncool if

i've been you know telling forbes for

three years to put me on the list

and he intentionally snubbed me off the

list i felt like

forbes kept snubbing me because they

wanted to say

we can't show you a person being

successful that didn't do it

the exact way that we told you you need

to do it in order to be successful right

you got to follow the model

yeah so almost everything i break the

model

yeah on it it's my favorite thing yeah

it's like the the model's not even

interested in me

like people a lot of times we point

fingers at

the makers of the world the uh

the the large organizations that created

the school systems

that we we grow up in now and what i'm

saying

now that we're working on schools and

communities and

cities right and i say cities like

people like oh charter city not just

city

because it's charter city's almost like

trying to make it like a it's okay to

say that you're building a city because

that sounds more normal

if i sound normal then then

the whole world failed not just me

i should i should not say nothing that

sounds normal this is a this is a very

super normal situation that we're

dealing with here that's always been

your vibe yeah

man it's an honor to really sit with you

uh on this session of canon's class i

mean it's probably gonna be one

uh to to sit with a true genius a

billionaire

artist so many other things but someone

that i called a friend for so long

multi-billionaire mot genius and multi

genius i forgot i forgot the multi

no but no because you know what my whole

thing i hate

about one billionaires if they

can't stand in one billionaire you know

if they go to taco bell

then they're not a billionaire no more

and like

i love taco bell but i want to still be

a billionaire once i leave

i love taco bell and belle and like i'll

tell you

better not nobody's saying nothing bad

about taco bell

that's that's what's not fantastic

disrespectful

you ain't finna disrespect taco bell or

ramen noodles in fact

we grew up on it i grew up on both of

those after school taco bell

and then dinner ramen noodles nah but

that's the thing man we we sitting here

talking and building out

and i just want to kind of back it up

all the way you know what i wanted to

say though just with the humility that

god brings

what he says is he says none of that

matters right because

i i went in from being snubbed by what

snub by magazine but i was recognized by

god

right where you know i would do sunday

service and it would be

atheists that would come and tell me

well maybe you shouldn't mention jesus

name so much

and um and you you know i just all i

need to hear

jesus jesus jesus thank you for

exactly thank you for inciting the riot

yeah

uh so so look this year it was

except it seemed like you know

there was an accomplishment where you

know i was on

the bloomberg list right for they

finally recognized that

uh that uh my net worth at that time was

3.3 billion and then my net worth

uh almost double after i did the gap

deal to 5 billion

but the accomplishment was to be to have

that

and to be able to still be sensitive

enough

to cry at the idea of aborting

my daughter and to really and people

didn't understand that

like they couldn't tap into it because

they didn't see the the humanity and

the love that you're trying to put it

forward or you got to put on a front

because you're cool like i had a friend

to say it sound it seems like you're not

enjoying it well what's the it

because north don't read forbes

she just know if daddy is home or not

right you know if i'm if i'm away for

two weeks she's like dad i'm i miss you

right it's like our family

family is just the the key to the world

period

from our immediate family

to our friends and family our work

our co-workers and family our city

and family our state and family our

country and family our world

that if we just like everywhere you go

people say hola

hello right niha ma right right i used

to speak chinese

school out there right so um

it's our culture to say hi see our

culture

the culture of humanity uh

needs to be family a culture of

family but the design

of our cities the design of our schools

there's a lot of things designed for us

to not pr

that are designed to not promote family

they're designed to create

uh separation right and in that

separation

there's uh there's cap there's capital

opportunity

there's someone's lonely has to go to

the bar someone misses their friends has

to go to the

the club has someone um

and so i really get into the study of

like the kibbutz designs right and

uh primitive cultures when i'm designing

cities it's like i've been really

going here we checked i see it when we

pulled up out there just that

the whole vibe of the infrastructure the

houses you're building and i'm the

guinea pig i'm guinea pig on myself i

gotta say

i've lived in every form of home i've

lived in

china for a year i was designing my

first two collections that we showed in

paris my

high fashion collections i was living in

london like right where they were having

the riots in london

our design studio was was right there i

obviously was born in atlanta grew up in

chicago

lived in new york and lived in

california and now i live in

wyoming um it's

you know when i came to wyoming one of

my favorite

visuals was seeing a family of three

deer right in front of a cabin

that just it felt like it's god

right and man and just a simplicity

and here it's you know the church is

within walking distance some

it's one school that i that i had made a

donation to with the

the school is inside the church wow i

remember when i was growing up there

would be times where the school was

actually inside

of the church when you remove

the fear of god the fear and love of god

you create room for the fear and love of

everything else

right now i'm really into wording things

in a positive affirmation

i i would like to get to a point we

shall get to a point where see i said we

because

i intentionally didn't want to say i so

we shall get to a point where we can

communicate

as simple as yoda there's so many

words and people get caught up in the

words and we're having

fights over words words but in the

future we're going to be having wars

over water

actual essential let let us pray right

that the kids at mit and

the ecologists can figure it out

we could figure out so we don't get to

that point but just

you know you start to learn what the

essentials are like

it's why you could just see a picture

because like i

i've like bought mick mansions and redid

them

and and try to have uh

add taste uh still fitting into some

kind of a mold

yeah something some construct keeping up

with the joneses yeah

somebody else's house is right there so

my i got to make sure mine is flying in

theirs

yeah one of the things where i

disappointed myself is when we went to

architectural digest

when we put the i've been reading

architectural digest since i was 18

years old so it was always

a dream of mine to be an architectural

digest but i always promised myself i

wouldn't start buying like

million multi-million dollar piece of

art sure enough

by the time we get there i got this

anish kapoor it's this million dollar

piece of art that acts of a voice so

many live [ __ ]

yeah and i'm just but nah it's like why

you got a million dollar piece of art

when there's like

homeless people in front of the gucci

store

and it's like i start to

you know to get pulled into that and

this is the reason

why um you know

creating clothes at the gap where

everything is affordable

yeah under a hundred dollars like old

navy prices

but then having the apple of design the

highest

we got designers that worked at louie we

got designers that worked at

uh celine so when i was really going on

the waterproof bags

this is how god is one of my favorite

designers that works with us like this

girl is

super cool like she walked in like a vet

model balenciaga show and everything

she's one of our designers she worked on

a season eight show

she has a pet the the freshest

references

and we're talking about these um this

bag the idea of waterproof bags

and i and i i'll just say right out back

when me and virgil used to go

and intern with giuseppe zinodi and he

was teaching us how to design chews and

everything

we would be in the airport and we saw

the shoe by nike called the roche

and it was the number two selling shoe

that nike had the number one is the

monarch which is like

the main dad shoe so and this is before

dad shoes became cool

so i looked at that roach and i said

i need to replace that shoe and now when

you go to the airport you

definitely see 350s and you don't really

see

the uh the roche anymore so now when i'm

talking about bags

you about to replace it i'm looking at

what's that we looking at that louie

back that louis duffy

i remember how the louis duffel made me

feel when i would go to atlanta to work

with jermaine dupree

yeah and it'd be somebody with like a

throwback jersey

a rolex a louis duffel yeah

um maybe a polo shirt yeah some jordans

yeah man i was just thinking man in my

contract my adidas contract it just

i definitely should be able to wear

jordans man you can't jordans need to be

part of reparations you can't tell a

black man not to wear drawers

that's part that's just in our dna any

deal

but you can wear jordans and also you

could wear your friend's clothes yeah

also that was a

all of this kind of divide and conquer

thing mine is better than yours

yeah that's why i had to like there was

like this designer that we

uh that we visited before named walter

van varendunk

is a talented guy and you know

he he was coming out uh

had something to say about virgil's last

show and

what happens is a lot of times like

i don't know if it's called jim crow but

in the media

with black people we're always on our

own we can get to a place of success

and we'll tear ourselves down virgil you

spend fifty dollars on

man if y'all shut up leave virgil alone

but all of us yeah you me virgil anybody

in that position it's always about

how we gonna tear each other down so i i

i came i said

walter verum vera i can't ease walter

walter um look at this

african cubism right here now look at

picasso the most famous artist in the

world

some look similar to you right picasso

copied

african cubism right and that's what's

been happening to black artists

our entire life existence our whole swag

get knocked off

so now virgil makes it out of the murder

capital of the world

to the number one fashion house in the

world

and somebody got something to say what

you

it's just like me yeah me

virgil when he went to louie that that

hurt me that definitely really

oh absolutely bro because i was the

louis vuitton don

i was like you put you open the door for

me i know i opened the door but then i

i wanted to i wanted to be i wanted to

be the louis vuitton

but you've done so you did what you did

at louis you did you did nike you did

what you did

yeah exactly and someone from gap i said

man it was always my dream

and he was like so he's like louis

vuitton was your life dream i was like

no

decree look how god is actually gap was

my dream because i was working

getting fresh at the gap not being able

to afford amber combi and getting polos

off the layaway at t.j maxx and

marshalls

before i even knew what louis vuitton

was

before i knew the idea i never heard the

word high fashion

right we was just getting getting fresh

with polos and khakis yeah

jabo yeah yeah yeah

yeah gap whatever so it's one of those

ones where

we got pulled in culturally by what mark

jacobs was doing

because he he was tapping into our

culture and connecting with us

when he did the millionaires yeah with

pharrell when he did these glasses

called the millionaires with rec

and when he did the shoes with us and

it's funny how like

non competes they if you get these deals

and they have non-competes right

so god had a plan right

there was no non-compete the high

fashion was never in a competition

with sportswear so when my first shoes

came

god had the nike yeezys and the louis

vuittons

that's what i'm saying you is the only

one to have louie

and nike at the same time and both of

the shoes was fresh yeah

yes and they and i had a lot of louise

right and um that's when they were like

they were upset they were like oh man we

didn't think of that we had no idea

that you were gonna have a nike come out

at the same time

that your louis vuitton uh sneaker came

out

so then they started putting these

non-competes and the funny thing is i

was talking to a

a gentleman that works at an ad agency

and he said that

right when i went to the gap gap we

don't say the gap it's

gap with no t-h-e so right when i went

to gap

gap got put on the non-compete for

everything

wow instantly boom

now this is now on everyone's

non-compete

list so um what i'm saying so back to

like when virgin went to louie

it was he had to break me down bro

and this is what i love about me crying

about my daughter and it's what i love

about people ridiculing me about it

cause i need all that yes because he

about to take it to another level

i need all that smoke i want i want

i need all that because i got a big head

yeah

and you need to hear that and i i need

to hear that and use it as fuel

and all but i it's a fuel but also it is

truly a humbling

like people say i feel closer to god

when

i'm at the top of a mountain i feel

closer to god

when i'm on my knees talking to my

children the lower we get the closer we

get to god we are earthbound creatures

we gravity bound

the fastest jet goes mach3

the fastest sled goes mach 6 closer to

the ground yeah when i did coachella

we built this this mountain and then

afterwards

we tried to do like this mountain in our

uh

and this park in our backyard and and

ray romulus who worked with us

on sunday service said it seemed it

sounded like we just had a coachella

hangover

or something and then we took it and we

took the mountain

and we shaped it this way do you know

what happened with the sound have you

ever put an iphone in a cup

yeah it's amplified amplifies yeah so

actually for the fact that we got

lower our sound amplifies we are

lower the more humble we are yeah

because i'm walking around

like now what y'all said i'm crazy

i said this i said that like i got the

forbes list i got this

i got that and god was like shut up yeah

it is about

my son jesus christ right and it is

about what i have given you

my son has died for you right

it's nothing that you can do more than

this

like and me and me and don c be arguing

about this because he's catholic i'm

like man

i don't want to argue with none of my

christian brothers about acts

you know like that's the whole thing

it's like catholics are like

these acts and you perform and we be

feeling like man

yo we got a special place in heaven and

there's certain certain sects of

christianity

denominations there's 16 000 of them

just in america okay

boom so there's and then somehow have

multiple levels of heaven and sometimes

you think you do

something good and you're like man i

know

this right here and it's like bro god

had his son

die right you can't go you you can't he

he's

already paid the price and

we are living inside of his house life

is a gift

right that he's given us and to be in

service is the greatest thing that we

could do for ourselves for each other

and for god and there's studies on this

it's about five of these things i can

only name two of them

but your dopamines and your serotonin is

like about three more of these

and the studies are when you talk about

the happiest countries in the world

that uh your happiest when you're giving

when you're

yeah again but not even for you that's

how you find yourself

yeah that they say let me not be

in the way of me

or in the way of blessings that god

might have for me

because if i hadn't have came

and gave virgil that hug at the louise

louis god wouldn't have came back and

blessed me

right with this uh with this opportunity

because

what i love about this the opportunity

at the gap is

this opportunity to be in service right

because i remember being a 14 year old

that couldn't afford things right so i

was always interested in costco

right walmart walmart was like

disneyland to us

yeah because it's yeah it's a man or

best buy

hanging by about a flat screen exactly

dvds

cds hoping they got one of the little

video games that you can play for free

remember you just had to look at a cd

and decide you start looking at the

track list

my dad would be like man you can pick

one tape for the summer

i'm like dad i do music this is going to

take me to the top

i remember looking at a umc tape at a

peat rock tape

wow and i end up figuring out how to

you know figure out what's up and be

able to get both

and yeah i see the love that you have

for hip-hop and like like man we go back

almost 20 years now man and just like

you said day one

we was broke type of thing but one thing

i've always known about you you've

always been the same person

that have the same sincerity and the

same love for god

like even from jesus walks to where we

are today

and then even now your messaging is a

message of love and that's where people

you know i think martin luther king said

it you know the best that it's like

it's before the victory is won it's it's

going to be a lot of us

that are actually going to be

misunderstood and call bad names

but we got to embrace that and just walk

in that into the

job you think people don't be

understanding me

[Laughter]

hey people don't be understanding us

together yeah

yeah and i say that too because like

even and i'll tell you exactly how

you know a lot of this even came out i'm

walking through the through the airport

dealing with all the drama that i'm

dealing with

and you know you and i have been

communicating daily i appreciate you

just

person to person reaching out checking

on me and all of that and then you know

i see this

white man come up to me just stick a

camera in my face like all right here

you go he about to ask about all this

stuff

and then when he saw he had no entry

because i had an answer for him every

time

just based off of my own atonement then

he was like well what about kanye west

and i'm like what about that small man

you know like and i was like okay

this is like when malcolm x talks about

the media you know what i mean like you

gotta

what they try to turn the guilty

innocent the innocent guilty that's the

most powerful entity

because it's going to have you hating

you uh the people being oppressed and

and loving the oppressors i'm already in

that zone and then soon he bring your

name up i was like i'm not gonna let

this man try to make me

ridicule my brother based off of

something that

he knows gonna be click bait or he's

like oh that's my family i love it first

thing i said i love it i love what you

ain't doing

and then he's like so he's like come on

man you're not gonna vote for him like

i'm not gonna i'm not gonna give you

what you need so if you're trying to

make fun of me or him you're not gonna

get that i'm gonna stand by my man

because i'm nev

i vow to never make to to talk bad about

any other black person in public

especially in media but especially

somebody that i love and consider

my brother so whatever he was trying i

was like i knew i saw where they was

going to go with this

so i'm like yeah whatever you saying so

i was like i'm not gonna let you

make me talk bad about my brother but

then now even like

they they mad at the process because and

we'll let's

unpack that but even like i saw somebody

i loved dearly stephanie mills said

that you and i are paid slaves

like and playing and acting like we're

toys or playing with our toys and we

need to take our toys and go back home

because it's people well she's not wrong

people you know losing their lives

losing their

jobs his time is serious and that we not

taking what

are our powerful voices serious enough

uh to help when like i said all i've

known you to be ever be

is someone who wants to help and be

sincere and of love and even everything

that you're doing

and it's like how do we deal with that

when we when it's coming at us

and where and where is home exactly

where is home exactly stephanie you know

did she

does she have a song about being at home

she thinks it's a place

and the wiz look at you

look at our names yeah you know what i'm

saying it's like

our names look at my last name my last

name is a slave name

right where is home exactly but even for

somebody else to call us that no no what

i'm saying is like we've never

we don't know what kings really look

like um

we don't know we we we're seeing them

for the first time

and it's like the media would like to do

anything

to make you believe that that's not what

we are

and that's not who we are and

honestly you know

we we we're two of the most honest and

expressive people

in media as far as as far as

black people right go and with me it's

like

i don't use my mind

obviously i mean people like well

obviously

my instinct is infinite my mind is

limited

and only an instrument mars

bars nah

man and you you touch on that in that

same way to where

you know even that you talk about you in

in south carolina and being vulnerable

and opening up and

and you have such a passion one for your

own children but children around the

world

and people feel like they want to say oh

well yay doesn't know what he's talking

about when he's coming at or why is he

crying and all these things where

why not it's the world that thinks that

you shouldn't cry

and be in repentance when you just

even to think and to fathom the thought

you know is you know that is the world

that is sick

the world is sick but i'm gonna tell you

one thing about media we're not i i'll

hop in the car with the paparazzi i hire

paparazzi right now i'm saying if i

could

hey i know y'all i let me tell y'all i

know y'all are right call the paparazzi

i know it's down because of covet i am

hiring

i i buy all the paparazzi companies i

want to pick the exact photo

billionaire talk right there ladies and

gentlemen

i want to get the exact it's always been

an idea of mine i said man i should just

uh

i should just purchase the paparazzi

companies you know pretty sure tmz is

for sale

man in america everything is sell for

sale except for our souls

come on now and it's location location

location now people talk about location

on some

you thinking i'm saying like you should

spend more i'm saying

you should spend less you could spend

100 million

for neighbors if you want right i ain't

finna spend 100 million for neighbors

right in fact i need no neighbors

right there's definitely no i'm dropping

here

if i'm dropping that i need i need to

have absolutely

look so the idea

of life there's a

there's there's there's some harsh facts

that deal with

um uh the black

uh genocide that is abortion

and it's happening every day and

right now god has given me the

information and he ain't gave me

no other information other than this

information

and we have this right now so that means

he wants me to say this now

if god didn't want me to run on stage

and say beyonce had the best video

he would have sat me in the front row

i would have been sitting in the back

they would have made it the first award

and would have made it so ridiculous of

an idea because i had never heard of

this person before

and this single ladies is like one of

the greatest videos of all time so you

spoke your mind you spoke your truth

i spoke and i i was only drinking

hennessy i was about to say you had a

bottle of hints because i didn't want to

go to the award show because it was a

setup

right now okay so let us get to let's

get to life

um in 50 years

there's 20 there's been 22 million

over 22 million 500 000

black people aborted

strategically and on purpose

planned parenthood was set up and placed

in minority

communities to

kill black people you're talking about

when margaret sanger the originator of

planned parenthood at the time

because a lot of people when when you

say things like that to in their defense

they say well planned parenthood today

is a different organization but but

here we go margaret sanger the founder

of planned parenthood

was an avowed racist whose goal was to

reduce the black population

in america and she succeeded 80 percent

of abortion clinics

in america are in minority neighborhoods

over 22 million

500 000 black babies have been aborted

in 50 years

over 1 000 black babies are aborted

every day so that means we are

inside of it as we speak this is

genocide so wait we are

inside of genocide what about the people

that are gonna argue

and say but you know kanye doesn't have

the right to speak on that

uh because he's not a woman uh the fact

that

planned parenthood does a lot of amazing

things and they're in those communities

because they

need to be in those communities i have

to go to the word

god says he knew you before you were in

the womb

yup jeremiah 1 5. yeah so i got a

one one other statistic abortion is the

number one killer of black

lives in the united states according to

the centers for disease control

and prevention abortion kills more black

people

than hiv homicide

diabetes accidents

cancer and heart disease watch this one

combined yeah combined 3 000

shootings in chicago a year 700 murders

you got to put that with heart disease

you got to put that with hiv you got to

put that with diabetes you got to put

that with just

accidents and you put that with cancer

and it doesn't add up to

specifically abortions and if you think

about that number

1 000 black babies

are aborted each day and it's funny

because i've sent this to people

and people there's some people that say

wow that touches me that some people say

i feel that

and there's an overwhelming amount of

people

that i sent it to and their response was

thank you for sending that with no

emotion

with no emotion thank you for sending

thank you for why would why would you

thank

anyone for sending you that i didn't

even want to have to say

the information out loud i i but god

said yay i need to use you

i'm i'm one of the i'm one of the bull

horns he just been

prepping me and he he's been protecting

me yeah we've been talking about this

for years i mean

you and i put can i live together my you

know and uh

probably my best record you know

co-produced by kanye west

uh well most people's records that are

co-produced because usually are they

that's right

no but but we we we joke but in some

this is something that's been you know

close to us because we both grew up with

single mothers who probably who were

putting that i had a non-custodial

father that's my dad was very if and

also what i want to say is

i love i love my mom

my mom and my dad had an agreement that

i would see

my dad every other week see my mom every

other week

she took a job in chicago because it

paid more

and then i would only see my dad

in on spring break and in the summertime

so same a white organization

offered this black woman

more money and i saw my dad less

wow and that i mean and see this is

where i see the passion like i said

we've both been put into situations to

where

you know our mothers were young they had

us so we we feel a certain way my mom

was on the way to

the abortion clinic you you know yeah

our fathers

had very similar situations about you

know not necessarily

being ready or wanting a child in that

moment but we're here because of that

is this the reason why you know is this

what you're utilizing your platform now

because with the whole presidency thing

because that that's the other thing like

because people ask me like

you yay's vice president now and what

are like like

where is the message and is does can you

do all of this

without the presidency or is this really

important for

kanye 2020 well

it hit me to

uh to run for president

uh in 2015. right we saw that yeah it

was about three days before the award

show

i was there i was like and and it hit me

and it was it was funny to me uh

when i said i was like this is it i'm

gonna say this

and then also when i came up with the

name of my party the birthday party

it was funny to me just crazy it was

jay-z i was like crazy

that's it jesus at the same time

and you know what made it so i can only

give god the glory

because of the connection point to the

birthday the connection point to the

birthday party

is dealing with life and pro-life

because these are kids that now are

going to get a chance to have birthdays

like for a date for daily mail who want

to tear me down for it

all for anyone who wants to tear me down

for crying you realize that because of

south carolina

there are people who have decided to

have the child

because they connected and if they were

on the fence about it

they they never saw anyone in my

position

take that position and say

look at this this is a seven-year-old

right here

and she she might have never made it

here and so when i talked to my father

my father made me

apologize to him for bringing this up

publicly i've had that conversation with

my father as well

he also said you know the abortion

culture teaches

people that a child isn't a real soul

and it was my wife that said this is a

soul

and the scariest thing is

she had the pills you know you take

these pills you take them and the next

morning

the baby's going she had the pills in

her hand

and a lot of times people say well this

is they want to jump

to the most radical reason of

why someone would not have a child

i said now you know why i said i have a

child because i'm still

so mindful as a man about using the word

abortion

that's how shook we are about using the

word

abortion that they say as men

we should not be able us two men sitting

here we should not be having a full

conversation about abortion well that's

a

that's a strategy to take the male

opinion out of

any conversation just taking taking the

leaders and the males

out of neighborhoods in the 80s it's

like you take

that opinion because you need both

opinions right you need the male

and the female opinion and also it's

both

people's child now i can get into you

know the funny thing is i

i posted a picture because i read that

in new york

uh i heard that they could go

you can abort after nine months but i

saw on google they said 24 weeks

and i showed a picture on my twitter

of a 24 week year old uh fetus would

that be the term

um and

i got backlash how you gonna put up that

abortion tweet

and you know it is i was trying to

appeal to humanity

but we could see in this world by the

reaction that people had to me crying

that there is no humanity you could see

the state of the world it's a lot of

people

no pain yeah like that's a lot of people

so they focus on their pain and like

they want to

they want to polarize they want to say

this is where you wrong you can't do

this you can't do that or

ridicule or make fun of it so now

since there is no humanity then

there has to just be god and man and

you can't serve two masters so

who are you working for right and that

that's that's the question for the ages

so the fact that

you know you you have such an influence

such an amazing power you've

you've proven people wrong time and time

again so

people take you very seriously when you

say these things so when you speak on

topics

that are polarizing like abortion when

you speak on topics

even like the the man's place the black

man's place in society when you speak on

uh the efforts of being able to say what

you want to say

um does that ever because i know you're

a man of instinct

but does that the backlash that you do

receive do you ever get

concerned about that because i i don't

and i didn't but now

when i hurt people with my words i

didn't mean to do that and that's where

i was like all right

this is a different energy for me

because i used to be like you know how

we vibe like

say what the hell i want to say but when

people are in pain and then you see

people come to conflict because of what

you said

that can't be what you want bro

we be having to act

like housekeepers in america the most

influential

strongest black voices have to act

like housekeepers and what i mean by

that is and i love housekeepers

right the but a housekeeper if one

housekeeper speaks up

they're gonna say shut up you're gonna

get us all fired

that's our position we were brought over

here in servitude

to this country so as soon as we

start to make any moves

if it's not the way that we were told

the way that we were bought

the way we then then you crazy

bro i got snubbed off the forbes list

for two years that they said i wasn't a

billionaire

how do you jump from a net worth for 240

million to 3.3 billion

right unless you've been snubbed and it

felt

like we're not going to allow people

to know that someone that didn't follow

our rules

could actually make it right then

god gave increase right you know

and when i had sunday service when i

went to the hospital the first time one

of the things i wrote down was

start a church in calabasas and we sang

jesus name to the hills

in the center of the city of lost

angels

well actually in a suburb of the city

but that just didn't sound as fresh but

but i i stood in the gap

you know we say that we said we stayed

and said we standing in the gap and god

said i got something for you

i'ma have you standing in the gap for

for real for real for real

and the funny thing is you know and it's

full circle for you yeah

yes 27 years right 27 years

since i got fired uh at the gap

honey let me not even put that out yeah

[Laughter]

so you've had those conversations too i

see

you don't mess this up the shareholders

are

they they're betting on you so so god

had me

stand in the gap and just much

much like david now even if you

non-christian you know the story of

david and goliath but just to get

uh and and i'm a new christian you know

i'm just a year recent convert

uh grew up in the church but i'm a

recent convert

so god had david tend to the sheep

and when goliath came to town no one had

known that david had to fight a lion

had to fight a bear and he said i just

need these three smooth stones because

we know everybody knows the story yeah

yeah yeah so one of the interesting

things is sunday service

i actually had to design wardrobe

all the time and i spent every dime that

i had for marketing from

from yeezy on sunday service wow

every dollar i had i spent 50 million

dollars last year

wow on sunday service if you add up the

operas

if you add up the flights if you it was

120 people going to jamaica

but the yeast all out of your pocket

well to spread the gospel

yes you know it's it with the um

uh the yeezys they they were selling

themselves

so instead of paying for ads i i

invested it in the church i invested in

spreading gospel investments like ties

to me

i invested in saying jesus name

on high yeah and then when people talk

about

increase bro

look how we just hit that bro at the

same time that's the zone

that's the zone because even a lot of

interviews you go especially like in

a hollywood and a la uh situation

um the whole setup of being

set up the whole setup is a setup they

trying to get something out you they

trying to get a sound bite they trying

to say something

opposed to being on a vibe somebody

stand up you got to tell them shut up

the whole setup is a setup hey boy get

up let up

we fed up i'm going head up i'm not

going to join him this bars

he's going crazy right there he's going

yay yeah

but they have it where they'll have a

person

that's just there just to antagonize

black people

right and we're used to us getting

ripped apart so what i'm saying is

like we say walter van buren dunker

anybody even like

black designers i know for me like

like everybody been jealous of

um everybody that's designed a lot of

people that have designed this a lot of

people have been jealous of virgil

because he got that spot that's the

number one spot

so everybody can be frustrated you know

but

when i spoke out on twitter that was not

christ-like

you know that's why i had to go to my

wife and say

um you know i didn't cover you

the way the way that i i should have and

i even said something because we were

listening to a christian a playlist

and it was all these like new edition

songs stuff i was like

well she is good at black playlists

but you say that and we have a good time

man we

laugh and stuff but on on quite often we

share

share scripture and words of inspiration

with each other and one thing that

sits on me one time is like i love

proverbs and like proverbs 2

2 says turn your ear to wisdom in your

heart to understanding

and i feel like that's what

i don't know i tell myself that daily

and i feel like i've shared that one

with you and and we talk you know cause

i always say utilize your voice be the

leader that you are you've proven people

so

proven people wrong so many times so

that they

don't understand you so when we seek our

own understanding through

through the word uh it has to like

we connecting in a different way but

other people ain't going to understand

it

they've caught they they've called both

of us coons they've called us crazy they

call these

all of these names but when you see like

two brothers having a friendly

conversation

i feel like anybody can tap in and

understand that yo this is a man

who who loves his family it's a man who

has passion for

for art for for create creative ideas

anything in a creative space

but why do you think that you you're so

misunderstood when trying to seek your

own understanding

i just think i say what i feel and i

keep it real

in a phony situation so that looks wrong

truth to power that's what that is yeah

that just looks wrong to people

you know like uh let's take when i met

with jared kushner

yeah let's talk about that in colorado

yeah cause they said there was a secret

meeting that you guys set up in that

yeah and ain't no secret he's using you

as a puppet that's what they're saying

yeah so the thing is

i'm not one of these i'm black so i'm

democrat

95 95 of black people

are democrat yeah

i wanted to meet with bernie sanders

before he wouldn't meet with me

now i'm fine to meet with biden

i mean he probably with me with biting

right now i would be with anybody

i love everybody jesus loves everybody

i love kamala harris that's a personal

friend hu howard you know but uh but i

understand like these

this politics is and you you just want

to talk to people who

share your passion yeah well you know i

met with

jared that's a that's a friend of mine i

knew them before they was in the white

house

right trump used to go to award shows of

puff daddy

that is true we all used to put trump in

our raps people i was that was

that was the american dream to ball out

like trump i

always remember who someone has been to

me

um you see i'm saying like that's why

when i had an opportunity

to do nasa's album this person made

ill-matic in fact

people was bugged out because it was

like you could you even gave him a

better album than you gave yourself

it's like this man nas is like one of my

heroes

right he was one of my father figures

right nas

was one of he was my he was my brother

he was he was a uh uh he was my my

stylist from a distance

what fresh cut what what would nas wear

how would nasa

cut his hair yeah you know uh and so

when i had

an opportunity to make music for him

i'm gonna give everything i got my

grandfather used to say

if you're a janitor be the best janitor

that you can be

and what i like about producing is

producing has always been

a service position to say let me find

something that's going to be

in service to you so let me talk about

the jared thing i always feel like

i keep getting pulled over in my fancy

car like when i was

19 i got pulled over for driving a white

expedition i had braids peli jacket

and when my mom uh came to bail me

out um i saw on the police report it

said

cream ford explorer uh

that was crossed out and it said white

expedition so

i wasn't even the one they looked they

just got close enough yeah and they they

threw me in jail

okay i meet with jared kushner

and everybody want to ask me questions

this is my

this is my expedition i'm driving i

ain't got to tell you i don't care if we

got ice cream

i can meet with whoever i want you know

why because i'm free

right and so many black people so many

people

are just not free right i have the

freedom

to vote for who i want i have the

freedom to

meet with whoever i want like for me

it's like i got friends just like well

because of the riots i i know a bunch of

people that's like oh we like trump now

and then after the riots it was like we

hate trump

we just got to do everything we get them

out i mean it's the protests and all

that that's appropriate

but let me tell you something people

keep on saying

i think that y'all you and republicans

are

in cahoots and cahoots they saying that

they paying you to

to do what you're doing to be a

distraction bro can't nobody

pay me you got more money i got more

money than trump

so you doing this praises through god

yeah so what is the purpose of meeting

with jared kushner what is the purpose

of you know by the way

i don't need no purpose now the thing is

i have a reason

that people would like like that man

came out with a printed copy because he

couldn't

get the paperback version of dr claude

anderson's book

the power nominee for paranomics and he

said so wait jared kushner had power in

omics

jared kushner talking about black

empower comics and had

notes red lined underlined

quoting lines awesome so anybody who's

not familiar with claude anderson this

is a dude who's been

started in education and just been

building for the wealth of black people

and the empowerment of

black people closing the wealth gap for

so long he's one of

the things from power nomics that i

always relate to is when he talks about

blacks are the only people

in the united states that don't have

communities they're

like we occupy residential areas

you know what i mean but everyone else

has their own community and this is the

plan

right here

claude anderson has a four-year plan to

rebuilding the black community

right that is what we talked about

that's what you and jared talked about

yeah but i don't care if i talked and

you got some ice cream

i could get ice cream that's what i'm

saying i don't have to

justify right none of my actions

period yeah you're because you're free

you're free i'm not no housekeeper

right what what what has biting done for

me

that's so special what has he done for

me

that's so special to make me vote for

this man and i don't care about

likability right so then

and this is you're speaking

i'll be frustrated because let me tell

you who the most racist

the liberal racist when a white person

could tell me you gonna split the vote

better not step past the line boy right

so now but let me tell you here's the

one here's the one deep yeah

here's the one so this is what this is

where i go to a place and that's why i

even i

i brought up this book by the the great

dick gregory

god russ is so uh he's our ancestor now

but in 1968 one of the most pivotal

years like

2020 he ran for president i wouldn't

mind the first four years of me

that's what so he that's what dick

gregory said and he said to be forced to

select between

a two dominant uh party choice is to

have no real choice at all

and it's almost that goes back to like

what w.b du bois says there's no such

thing as two parties there's just one

evil party with two names

so you are stepping out as pretty much

what the declaration of independence

says is when you see

a flawed government you gonna speak to

it for the people

but people are saying you're a

distraction and because they don't want

four more years of trump

maybe you might i don't i i don't but

but you want an alternative of four

years of yay

is that realistic right now in 2020

well god has made unreal things happen

i'm here for you many times is it

realistic for me to be here

nah you know you done you didn't cheated

death several times you didn't

accomplish what most people said you

would never accomplish you

certified yourself as a multi-genius and

a multi-billionaire

we just came up with multi geniuses but

no

because i had people keep on telling me

man it's just rude to call yourself a

genius

okay how about a multi genius

and that's something people don't

understand yay's sense of humor

so he like this all the time and they

will say oh well there he go acting

crazy again and saying crazy things when

really

you have a different perspective and you

come from it from a place

where you're not really trying to this

that's what i'm going to say like

when people all right so look at this

right so this i was

wearing it walking through the domes and

the ranch all right

but i could wash these off and it'd be

brand new yeah box fresh

now i i saw people talking after the

i just saw black people on tv like

ridiculing me and dissing me

for crying on tv and i you know the

whole thing about the harriet tubman

thing is

we we don't need to tear our statues

down

to build new ones because we don't got

enough statues that's what it is

but the only icon is jesus but what i

want to say is those people that's

ridiculing me

bro yin design this

come on man so they can't but okay so if

they if they ain't make

dark fantasy no no dark fantasy

and watch the throne right and cruel

summer talk your talk

and good fridays and late registration

i'm just talking about just 12 months

i'm just talking about 12

months oh you're right you're right i'm

talking about 12 month period yeah

i had a friend man i ain't going to go

we could edit this out but i was saying

that and he was like

man cruel summer's trash i said boy you

ever made something like mercy

mm-hmm like but that's okay so what

about all those people who are saying

cause granted all of those are genius

moves but

what about the people are saying you are

out of touch so

that you can't that's the dream come

true

but as a leader as someone who's

supposed to be guiding people and

running for president they want somebody

they can relate to so exactly

so am i out of touch when i break down

at the drop of a dime or the thought of

aborting my daughter

but some people can say that's

instability some people though oh look

yay needs

needs help because i would say that the

world

is what's unstable america is what's

unstable it would be 100

accurate 22 million 500 000

black people have been executed through

abortion

culture every so many things that are

for the culture do it for the i do this

for christ boy

this ain't for the culture this is for

jesus christ so what about people saying

you're a little too religious

especially to be running for office uh

that's that's what we need

and that's who i am and i always been

who i am

and it's worked out thus far right and

i shall be president at some point in

our lifetime

so maybe not 2020 so what about j 2024

because now because kamala in there i

know you don't like biting but you know

that to see a woman

operating a black woman from oakland

went to

hbcu to be in the white house you got to

want to support that you got to want to

see that

that's a good thing for the culture and

you can follow up

2024. is it a good thing for christ

what's your position i i don't know

that's a great because when you're a

democrat you're not allowed to talk

about christ

republicans are allowed to talk about

christ democrats not allowed to talk

about martin luther king was a

republican right

blacks used to be the republicans back

then absolutely

blacks used to be and if you're a

christian you're

most of your values going align with

republicans

more now you're such an out-of-the-box

type of person and you talk you got your

own party now the birthday party why

why does this is our party this is not

just my party our party

this is our party the birthday party and

and and it's funny because it reminds me

of one time we was on

and this is when i got kanye we were

young we were one of the recording

academy packs both trying to get

get our grammy grind on and it was a

bunch of kids and he was like yo people

always treated me

all my life you know like tell me to be

quiet and all that stuff and he was like

no

i live my life like it's my birthday

it's like you ever go to like

chuck e cheese or show biz or whatever

and they'd be like yo you making too

much noise over there he's like i'm

supposed to make this look it's my

birthday

and i was like i understand him now like

he lit

you've cheated death you've done

something to you you've been that quiet

kid in the back so

if i was never married to death how can

i cheat

we've people don't even know you have

more than one car accident and things of

that nature of like you

we've seen you beat the odds many times

in so many ways and so that's why you're

so

outspoken when i said i was gonna run

for office

and people asked hillary clinton before

she ran and they said what do you think

about

kanye running for office her response

was i wouldn't want to run against him

who would and when i said so they're

scared of you mainly is what this

is yeah because the funny thing is even

though

blacks due to abortion not due to kanye

west

due to abortion are only we are only

thirteen percent

of the entire population the entire in

america yeah of the vote

you know that 13

can make a difference if you ask lewis

hamilton that small percent could be the

difference

in especially when we have the influence

the influence that you have and do you

see that as a responsibility because

you're speaking on some heavy topics

from abortion from economics to

these things now you know even more so

with children

when people hear you speak they want

they want you to to speak in a direction

that one

gets rid of the oppression that this

administration has put upon our

community

people live in a sound bite community a

sound bite culture where you think

one line is going to change everything

not no one like do you know how long me

and jared

sat there and went through

uh point by point from claude anderson's

book and the

time i spent on the phone with claude

anderson's wife for the time i spent

talking to charlemagne about this this

is just the beginning of a journey when

we talk about sustainable

you know they get all these the

democrats are really good at using

or the left are really good at using

social media to try to cancel people

to try to bring them down to try to

discredit i think it's four d's it's

discredit

dismiss yeah and i saw you you wrote you

wrote to me about that

you know the i i feel like

i made a steal like i can't even be you

can't be canceled

like i can't be cancer but also like i

couldn't be hurt

i felt like i couldn't be hurt anymore

right

until you know we we spoke about the

idea of aborting my daughter

and then that's when you got vulnerable

like that that's when i was like i had

to i had to i had to feel that because i

feel that people

might say i'm out of touch because i'm

not letting the smoke screen stop my

decisions to move forward

think about the way the slaves was

always controlled it was so many more

slaves than the slave master

but we were we were brainwashed and we

still are

right and that's in the past statements

when you've made statements whether it's

about

harriet tubman or even slavery being a

choice that's what you were

pretty much touching on is like we were

brainwashed and we were controlled by

the system like carter g woodson says

uh once you control a man's mind you

don't have to worry about his actions

and that's the thing they're not

controlling my mind so they're worried

about my actions

and uh and i'm these are not reactions

god is using me and god

covers me and won't nothing happen

until he's done with me right

i mean that's evident the fruits of your

labor are evident look

the um what about the people who say the

devil is

because the earth is you know the

devil's domain and his dominion and all

of that stuff

and he said just like the devil tempted

jesus and said you can have all i can

give you all of these things in the

earth

do you see like is because i've seen

that as well as like oh that's the devil

that's the devil especially some of them

super duper

church going type of christians they

want to go oh that's not chris they they

hate on sunday service they say

oh no that's the devil that's the world

that's secular

playing and and and being

a facade for what christ really is

i mean a lot of people got opinions on

how to represent christ and some people

they argue about the image of christ

because you have an abundance you know

what i mean like

i always said come so you got life and

have it abundantly but jesus was me

at the same time people were saying oh

god told you this god told you

god that how god told you god told you

but through me god showed you

come on bars

god told you before me god showed you

hey

what are we talking about and by the way

it

it even if i had to go through what job

went through

where everything goes away you know what

i'm saying when i when i because and the

reason why that

joe went through that is because he

feared all of those things you don't

have no fear

man i see mandela's prison cell and i'm

like

all right we would ever we would

whatever

we're not afraid of death 27 strong ones

and for his people

yeah we're not afraid of prison we're

not afraid of death

we're just not afraid we ain't going

that's period

now let me explain something about with

me i'm a freedom fighter

so my comment to harriet tupman

or of her was yeah we got clean more

we got to be reminded of how white

people did us dirty yeah or how we were

slaves or even go to african american

history museum they don't start off with

the african drums

it starts off with the slave boats

because

i mean it depends what door you going it

could be

it could be more motivational

but they don't they don't they they

don't want us to get

i say this all the time you're not wrong

when they say well our our culture is

much more than slavery and that's when

we want to talk about

you know if we have black history month

we need to have black future month

just like just like that uh you know i

make black history every day i don't

need them on i would

we was there when yeah i think you gave

me that bar i gave him that seat i told

y'all

i told y'all i gave him the bar but in

that sense you you've always

exemplified that and it goes back to

like you know the richest man that ever

lived this is

this is who if you ever did a movie or

you had irritation you should

uh be uh the sultan of mali mansa musa

is to this day he his gifts threw off

the economy

in the 1300s just the richest man ever

lived richard and jeremy

was like in the trillions but he was an

african in in the 1300s

he was explorer all of this type of

stuff but they

they don't teach us about those type of

individuals because they want to start

with slavery because everything looks

better

from slavery if you start that flavor

everything's going to look like that

progress don't give you nothing and if

you just get a little sip of water

then you look like a horse with a sugar

best water i ever had

that's how they be happening so they so

why don't

so that's the whole thing like they

don't they show us that we're more than

slaves

see when people say oh the republicans

paying kanye

that's like you acting like they got

more money than me

you acted like i could be paid right bro

i saved 100 million in taxes this year

right i saved 100 million in tax in

taxes

right this ain't got numb to deal with

one thing i know i know yay for a long

time can't nobody tell him

to do anything he don't want to do can't

nobody convince him with no money he

can't nobody convince him

it's he's gonna do what he wants to do

and it seems that your passion was to

show people how much you care

i never did it for the money but the

funny thing is

people call me crazy and they

discriminate against people with mental

illness

or mental mental health abilities

right mental abilities because it's

actually an ability

it's a superpower tell me it's an

illness

right because i'm seeing the truth

inside of a phony world

and then people want to lock her up lock

me up they want to lock

me up for expressing myself do nothing

but

i don't even do anything but express

myself and i'm gonna get hit with the

needle

and and throne you know what would

happen if i got thrown in a crazy home

it would drive me crazy that's normally

what happens

that's what it like and even the

infrastructure of what big pharma is and

how they

you know even from young black boys they

always want to diagnose them with

something whether they diagnosed me with

adhd when i was a kid because they want

to get you hooked on drugs early they

want to say

that they want to give you put you in

special education when really you're

just on a different frequency and you're

on a different way

so let's talk about that the fact that

people have called you crazy

do you see that as irresponsible well i

just see that that's a new

discrimination that people have to

understand because there's even people

that are mindful of the word crazy

like how post me too men were very

cautious in the way we didn't

we get

you got you got to be careful with your

compliments

and so now people are sensitive to it

and so now whenever i express myself the

only problem is

people will be quick to be like oh he's

going through something and then

they try to discredit what i'm saying

and we talk about credit a lot of times

credit deals with money well i've never

cared about money and then people

started calling me crazy

so then i said you know what i'm gonna

do i'm gonna go out and just make more

money

and y'all gonna stop calling me crazy

because i get to a billion you can't

call me crazy yeah and then it was two

years where i wasn't called a

billionaire and then i came out

three billion right they even forbes

exposed themselves and showed like how i

was talking to

say y'all can't count right i better

count that up count that up again forbes

and i really when when bloomberg was

coming i just thought about nike and

louis vuitton i said yeah i bet you i

can get forbes and bloomberg

to deliver the message at the same time

like when nike and louis vuitton

uh delivered and they did but i that's

why i like love

i love man forbes is some of my favorite

white supremacists man they cold bro

this is about this like my most favorite

white supremacist is forbes

uh is tell me why yeah because

bro i just gotta like respect they

gangster bro cause they

they don't live in 2020 they act like

it's 18

you know hunted still because they'll be

like read the forps

it's crazy racist every time they write

stuff

and people and people would do articles

but it'd be like so but now what they

keep moving they still in business

right so bloomberg was coming and they

had an

accurate net worth of 3.3 billion and

forbes

purposely landed an article to dispute

that and said well the way we counted

it's 1.3

and they dropped it at

um 505 or something right at the end of

the week

so that would go into to the weekend to

the weekend right and that would be the

story

that that it was confusion they could

just cause confusion that's something

the devil could do is like

call devil is the author they're

confused they they authored confusion

they offer and the funny thing is the

guy will still text me and he'll be

talking about his daughter i'd be like

tell your daughter you got a cool dad

and then he'll write an article it's

like

like you know the funny thing i i was

going to curse because i'm like [ __ ] you

yay but i really realized

just like when you when you say

curse what you really do run out of

words so let me tell you so

i'm thinking people calling me crazy so

i'm gonna show them

i'm gonna even show my big bro i'm not

crazy i'm gonna show jay-z

i'm a you know i'm gonna show them that

you know

that my value that you could be

diagnosed and people could point fingers

at you

and you could still be a citizen and you

can still have value he said don't let

that stigma define who i am i didn't let

the stigma define who i was so the funny

thing is

so i'm like boom it's gonna be you know

they're gonna

see that you know i i ate them i ate up

all my vegetables

i did the right thing and

i got up to 3.3 billion i have all my

vegetables look guys i'm not crazy look

guys i ate up all my vegetables i got

three point three and then it's like

that guys i got five billion i have all

my vegetables

and then i cried for my daughter and now

he's crazy

and they said he's crazy again so that

that made me tell us like

forget valuing money in that way

because i thought that if i

would become a billionaire

that it could help me beat the stigma

but it was because i it's funny because

i got friends

that soon as someone says oh yeah ain't

take his meds or this that they could be

like

you ain't need to take your and they can

send me and it's literally

wow like how people would treat black

people

100 years ago wow people who are

diagnosed can get treated like black

people were treated

now we're more subtle deep that's deep

like

nah cause even when you say that because

as someone who they've you know

called me crazy and you know said i had

mental health issues and someone who's

actually

dealt with many people my family and

that thing where that stigma that's

placed on you

can drive you to a place of depression

or

um and who who are they to say

that you are crazy or who are they to

say that you just having a

moment and i guess because i feel like i

know you and i you know i know the

the frequencies we be on like it's not

about

being defined and that's where it even

goes back to

the the politics like why do we have to

classify or identify with what you deem

to be normal

and people all human beings have a

opportunity to

go crazy without being

defined as crazy right like when people

go to a soccer game

they go crazy they go crazy so

you put me in certain environments my

family would come with me and be

paparazzi follow us around

and they say what'd they say i couldn't

do this i go crazy

like there's no human rights in the

world i couldn't live your life

that would drive me crazy drive me crazy

right and so

i saw the other side and come back and

now

it's like a superhero because i

really can understand how to use this

heightened sensitivity because that's

all it is

to get more work done think about all

the people who have done

great things in history think about

einstein yeah was was noah crazy when he

was working on the

the ark as he said don't listen to him

no just keep building your art

just keep just keep building the ark

because by the way it's like even this

i i the whole i i speak from the future

to the future so even right now this is

just documentation

that might only make sense to some in

the future oh no it's going to be

classic

it's a classic one right and that

because what people always do

every time something happens what people

got to do go to my old interviews

because my only my old interviews can

apply to now

the majority of the things that i'm

saying don't even apply to now yay

talking to the future

he's teaching us from the future

absolutely if you're living in the

president

if you're living in the future then the

presence is your past my presence is the

president kiss my ass

bars but that's the thing man like and

and to relate back to the identity of

you know because that's the thing

everybody want to talk about is what's

going on with yay for

2020 is is you've cleared it up with the

whole jared thing and that trump's not

paying you and you're not the

republicans aren't using you you're

doing this

solely for the people can we talk about

that next step the republicans and the

democrats

they couldn't afford me bro

so let's talk about where you put in the

money yeah the children man like

and and i really want you to touch on

your your love and compassion like we we

touched on the heavy

subject of abortion but let's talk about

the orphanage and the idea of what you

want to do moving forward since we talk

in the future

and even while we're sitting here in

wyoming or what you really want to do

for

what i like about this whole thing is

it can be just like how we do a verse

because it could be things we kind of

hit a point

like six seven times in an interview and

you said i might wanna hit that twice

yeah yeah and it's other things you can

hit it in so um

we're building plan a and people could

say how are you building planet well

plan a is exactly what you think about

you know

planned parenthood and plant plan b

well this is plan a and it's exactly

what you think that would be

that would be given stipends that's

creating an orphanage

so right now i'm donating my land to

build an orphanage all of these acres

that we're sitting on right now

yes wow so um

and that's an openness for for kids from

all over the world well it's just to

look at

orphanages you know we've difficulty

yeah we look at them a different way

like when i made this foam runner or

when i made

jesus or mma 808s just to have an

opportunity i'm a creative that's the

way

god uses me through my anointing is due

creating with these interviews they'd be

funny to me though because i get to

create in an interview yeah

you painting the picture yeah the

interview i i don't know if i

you know what people say he's not the

best communicator no y'all just don't

want to hear what i'm communicating

and it's too busy they'll be trying to

cut you off and get to the point that's

why i hear you

have an open forum we chop it up like we

chop it up on the phone oh yeah

and my new thing is just if someone asks

me a question don't give away the

secrets

don't give it away then they gonna jump

in there and try to

try

exactly exactly not but man to be able

to

i was like like you live i've watched

you from

from when your career started to where

you are now and

everything you put your mind to

everything you said you were gonna do

you did

you know what how everything i put my

heart to

everything i put my gut to if my heart

is in it

it's gonna work if my mind if it was

just my mind a lot of times people put

their mind into delegation let me

delegate this let me not

put my heart into that that's that time

when you

are in front of it it's funny it's like

with my children

i have to be in front i have to be

there i have to be present not just

the dad that comes with the cool

presents uh i have to be present not

just the dad just comes with the cool

presents um uh

a dad or jesse and i have to speak up

not just a dad with the cool presents

triple entendre for you all one time so

because sometimes i've had to speak up

i've had

i've had to raise my voice certain times

on things that i stood for

morally right and it's

there was a there's a fight for our soul

right you know like

i struggle with pornography from six

years old

right um

so if i see i remember i went to the

library

and i and i started taking out all the

books

that had um

you know sexual imagery in it right it

wasn't just specifically nudity

it could be a swimsuit picture that was

hype very hyper

sexual right bro it was crazy it was

like half of the library

because we'll put like a big coffee

table book because it's cool in it

right and it was like half you know

naked woman on the front and then you

open it

and it has naked and we're so used to

that kind of

culture that we don't realize that sex

is a drug

right and when you orgasm what is it

endorphins

yeah you're releasing all of you and

that endorphin is very similar to the

feeling of heroin

which is which percocets are also

a similar feeling to that so so don't

mix it

right don't have perks and sex

and add something to drink you know it's

like you don't know which way is up or

which way

is down right um and that's why like

these

boxers they'll like sustain they'll

sustain

for six weeks before the fight that just

to sustain

and you know to focus to so they get

locked in and they they

they take the that moment to come combat

serious so they don't have any

distractions yeah and and

even with me as a christian it's like

i'm i'm a new christian and i and i

backslide

and it's funny like the world new world

thinking uses the world

word karma you christian it's

uh you reap what you sow right but karma

is

new age right that's not the way we even

uh that that's not the terminology for

it

and it's fine god snap pet he knows what

we mean

but i remember these times where i was

under

high pressures and high tests from from

god

and it was like i was passing the test

and i saw miracles happening just

amazing things just kept on happening

and i said

well god i know you know the the the

form of christianity we believe in we we

don't believe in

acts so it's some of the acts and i know

it's not it's not karma so god

why are all these blessings and why all

these miracles happening

and i had an explanation from a pastor

that me and my friend chris julian had

picked up hitchhiking

that we um then dropped off and uh

gave him some money for something like a

good samaritan

but when when he was talking he was

talking about how he backslides

but what he said is like when when your

lamp is clean

when your faucet is clean that god can

perform

miracles yeah it's like you are getting

in the way

of your own miracles don't be enough

don't be in the way of your own miracles

and every time that i pop off all that

cocky stuff or we talking that money

talk and all that

i'm in the way of my own miracles that's

why i'd like for us to be able to

um to create this in a way where people

saw that point there was a point that

was building up but we started having

these sub points to it

but the point was saying that how i

thought that money was going to validate

me and then i got money as soon as i

cried for my daughter people said you

crazy

and everyone felt like that was a way to

down me and that to really understand

that that my

validation will not be from

man and i'm happy that we're as we're

here as brothers to be

to be next to each other we brothers you

know

for real because we're going through a

lot

ridicule yeah a lot of the similar

things and i'm happy

to just be able to have a conversation

because people will say

look at this this is the first time that

i'm speaking in public

since south carolina right and i'm doing

it here

right here on your show yeah with

another person who hasn't spoken

since my own controversy so yeah yeah

and it's and to speak if you are a

public

figure speaking in public is therapeutic

i use the crowd uh often i use the crowd

as my audience that's your therapy right

and also you use it to try out some

ideas right he said let me try this

let me see how the crowd responds to

this

the reason why i know that

i will eventually eventually could be

three months

eventually could be three and a half

years ago four years so um

the the reason why i eventually will

make

a great president is because

i'm sensitive i'm here i'm

i'm here to serve even as a gemini i

feel the energy

in the room i read body language i read

this energy and i and i hurt you know

the thing is this

you got that spirit of discernment yeah

i i hurt

for the country i heard for not just

black people but i heard for

all all people of america and i heard

from all people of the world i heard for

everyone's

children i heard for the situation i

heard i heard for illegal

aliens that that have put in their work

for 20 years

immigrants yeah it's like there's a

nation of immigrants that uh john f

kennedy wrote like that's

yeah that's what this country truly is

and for somebody

that's that would be probably wrapping

it up i would want to talk about

the hurt that is going on in this

country specifically

and the pain that people are

experiencing and i feel like that's why

a lot of

the frustration towards you where they

might call

us out of touch or crazy or coons or

whatever

term it is when really it comes from a

place where

there's a lot of pain going on yeah

your music has healed so many your your

words your you your outspokenness has

healed so many

so if they're used to yay healing

how in this moment does kanye hill

we're building factories we're building

farms we're reinstating agriculture talk

about the ecology for a minute because

people

like you said dr claude anderson he put

us up on game he said

right after the civil war during the

reconstruction time where some of the

best times that's

when america was great uh black people

were

over 55 of the farmers in this country

and now they're less than one percent

like that agriculture is where the where

the wealth

truly was created for this country until

this day can continue to be that and now

you even

stepping into that world yes and for us

yeah and yeah and for us and us is

you know what is beautiful about the

black existence

in america it is it

it sharpens you just to be a black

person in america

like i i'm billions i remember spending

uh three hours explaining what the white

voice was

to my to my wife because for her it's

just her voice you know

it's just the voice just answer the

phone the same way hello

but i had to explain that

in order to get a job depending if you

want a job downtown you had to

act white and you could lose your job if

you acted

black but the thing is yourself you

that's the thing you're not acting

if you act black you're actually being

yourself so your existence

just to be able to pay for your

well-being you literally have to

act like a white person it's so funny

when i go

to like a wedding and it'll be a black

pastor and they'll say he speaks so well

he speaks so well that's that chris what

what do you mean american

like i like did you think he was going

to talk but

yeah it's like how we supposed to speak

perfect like

i love incorrect english my mom is an

english professor i heard her use the

word

ain't i say don't use ain't mama she

said no you could

use colloquialism correct english is

using the english that's appropriate to

who you talking to

this is from an english professor come

on now so we

are way simpler i play this dictionary

game where

we take a a pocket dictionary and all

the people in the room we all get a

pocket dictionary we pick a page

and you highlight the words that you

feel are positive

and you read all the definitions now i

want you to read the definition of help

you think that help is a positive word

right yeah the fourth definition is to

avoid

because you think that help is a

positive word

but look at how many times where

uh look at this even if you meet with a

an exec

in la they'll not give you the deal but

they'll say

well how can i help you help me to like

i'm gonna give you somebody else number

yeah help me understand

why oh yeah or how many times something

didn't get fixed but a bunch of people

helped yeah right

the word is to ensure and a lot of the

words

uh ure at the end have a

a a confidence in it and it uh not

it's not a word i don't say confidence

they have an assurance in them yeah yeah

they have

a future like oh i see what you're

saying

and and people can get to that like you

can get into the it has

affirmation in it negro negligent

you could do words that have the because

the tower of babylon has caused so much

confusion

that's why i love you we're trying to

get to god yes and then he said

boom we're going to give you all your

separation yeah so when the pope talks

he got to talk in

27 different languages right

the the this is why i love non-verbal

communication

and things where you just see it because

you can interpret it for whatever all

this senator adams

cause you asked me you know what are you

doing to heal well

i understand words could be healing but

i'm not a professional orator

i understand you know books can be

healing

but i'm not a professional book writer

you're a professional creative you're a

professor exactly

i'm a producer but before i was

producing

things that were non-tangible

music in a way you get the feeling but

you can't grab it

it's an invisible thing you can't eat

music teach come on now you can

dance for your dinner you could like

music could

you know it's set up thank you but it's

a feeling it's a vibration it's a

vibration it's a beautiful thing

but i've stepped into a place of

actually learning to build

physical things yeah physical things

building homes

building domes a friend of mine said are

you building single family homes i said

i'm building single family don't

homes bars

that's how big you were in the verse

so um it's that's what i'm doing i'm

physically building things like the

the thing about this shoe right here it

was made in america

and my concept is not that my concept is

just local

manufacturing especially we post cover

we decentralize

so if you buy this shoe in china it will

be made in china

if you buy the shoe in america it'll be

made in america it's like the idea for

manufacturing is the

uh the mcdonald's of manufacturing and

this

is something that we're in stating in

the gap like

i love the movie the founder and i love

the scene when they built

the kitchen yeah that was my these are

these moments i

i watch the making of of movies more

than the movies

because i want to know how to make them

right it's like when you were just

talking about hey man i'm an engineer

you just kept on saying

how was this made because everybody can

have a sketch it's another thing to

materialize it

you know you can ask don c he like

travel and

if you go to an italian uh factory they

have a cup sole you put it there

the reason why we up to this point we've

had to

always collaborate with uh organizations

like nike and adidas because they're

best of class

at materializing this they knew the

factories

and the biggest fight that i had

uh was to get my own factory now we have

a factory in cody but this shoe is made

in atlanta georgia

but we have a factory in cody that can

make these eva

foam-injected shoes and bring jobs to

america

truly bringing jobs to america and truly

bringing jobs to the community

yeah and and redesigning communities and

the thing is

they don't give you that credit though

yeah they want to they want to write you

off when you're actually doing so much

work

but but i'm predicting the future i'm

not a i'm not actually talking about the

what we're doing right now

yeah but but in that in that vibe and as

as we as we wrap up you know i mean like

i said if you drop so many gems it's

gonna be an

outstanding canons class but to

to clarify and to clear up some things

just based off of

you running for president right now

is that something that you're you're

comfortable speaking about because

it is it is unclear and i think that's

where people could come up with these

theories and what you're really trying

to do because they're not clear on what

your actions are i'm not running for

president

i'm walking so that's gonna take a

little bit more time so you might not

get there at 2020 would you say

you're walking your way to president

we'll take that i'm like spraying the

ankle

if i run man it's a genius

ladies and gentlemen a multi genius we

we

patent that term and man we got three

people yeah yeah yeah

but i do want to give you some some

content to work with on the the

uh the uh running for president thing i

believe that

you know you jump into the deep end like

i i like how trump was never governor

wouldn't i'm not even going to go to

people saying if he was governor he had

been a better president yeah

and you got you can admit that trump

wasn't the greatest president though

right

we we know that otherwise you wouldn't

be running

like that that is a really no i'm i'm

running because

i was hit with the idea to run

in 2020 right now the outcome

is up to god right but if i hadn't ran

for president 2024 sounds good too yeah

if i hadn't ran for president i wouldn't

have been

in south carolina and you wouldn't have

had that moment if i wasn't in south

carolina

god wouldn't have broke me down and had

the media

ridicule me in this way right and

that ridicule and that being torn hit so

home so close to your family

yeah to be ridiculed for crying for your

daughter

the world needed to see me

the world needed to see themselves the

fact that they would

do that right but also i needed to see

myself right i needed to see

to to to just to recalibrate you know

you can

you don't learn a lot you don't learn a

lot from doing things perfect

you learn a lot from things that could

be considered a mess up or screw a

mistake

you say from a mistake not a hell it's a

lesson it's because it's a lesson it's

not ever say because god don't make

mistakes

i remember when i was at tmz i said you

don't think i told one of my friends i

said

you don't think that god may have

planned for me to be a tmz and his

response was i'm agnostic

[Laughter]

good luck good luck with that that's

what you tell atheists

good luck because they don't they don't

reply to them

with the craziest atheists i mean is

therapist need a therapist i mean they

was pissed as asparagus

[Laughter]

so look man we could do this for hours

because we do this like

this we're just letting y'all into how

how we vibe and you know

a lot of people like man it was just too

crazy [ __ ] talking but they might they

might want a part two

you know we gotta do it in a all right

so cool let me get back to the gap

[Laughter]

but nah man i say this and with all with

all seriousness you know every day i try

to send you

uh some scripture and i think it's like

in second corinthians i believe like

eight nine it talks about

uh where um

i think what it is it's like 12 12 8

through 9 that's corinthian

second corinthians 12 8 through 9 it

talks about uh

we're weak for he is strong i mean

that's in that yes jesus loves me song

but the

the part uh before that actually talks

about

when it says i delight in my weaknesses

in the outside insults hardships and

persecutions

and i feel like you're an example of

that of someone who

you welcome all of that because you can

show god's strength

yeah does he say he is strong in our

weakness or he yeah yeah

it says all that and says therefore i'm

weak but he is strong

and it shows like he's where i'm weak

he's strong and and that's and it talks

about

the insults the hardships the

persecutions people

trying to ridicule you and through all

that you can show god's strength and i

think you've done that time and time

again

and people could take what you call you

can call him call me call

us whatever you want but when you can

see the presence

of of a higher power the creator working

and walking it whether it's faith

whether it's your

opportunity to show your love for your

family and humanity

i don't see any negative all i see is

love and all i see is god in it

that weakness is beautiful yeah i'm

happy that people

got to see that yeah got to see that

vulnerable and i'm happy that i've grown

through it

i'm happy to get to see that i had it

because i've had to be so strong

that i didn't even know that i could

break down yeah i've been through

so much i didn't know that i could break

down

um and we're not just going through it

we're growing through it yeah

bar yeah there it is i probably got a

bar here so we're gonna end it right
