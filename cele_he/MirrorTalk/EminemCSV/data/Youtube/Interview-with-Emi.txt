some guy named kmart

and it's his place this one's kmarts

yeah

that's a very grammatically correct way

of explaining it

man i've known you for 20 maybe years

now

you know that's crazy yeah that's that

is crazy

time flies but d.o.c told me once he

would write him

to a beat he's like he watched you and

he watched you write it

and he said you went in the studio and

you start spitting the verse

and then i think you left whatever it

was you wrote and he was like man i

couldn't believe this dude wrote that

spit it

killed it and then i went to go see what

it was he left a piece of paper what he

wrote

and he said you wrote your rhymes it was

all though

in a circle or something yeah what was

that

is it because because what there's two

reasons

okay a is because if anybody ever finds

it

they're not gonna be able to decipher

the puzzle okay

but also really where where that that

helps with that

but really where it comes from is when

i'm getting ideas i have to write

a couple words down right away wherever

they're at

it doesn't matter i just have to get

them out before i forget them

these are the thoughts you know these

words are connecting with these words

beautifully right here and this is a up thought

and i probably shouldn't say this but

it's s up that you know people

are gonna know i'm joking i hope maybe

not i don't know

[Music]

i've come here many times over the years

what i would say doesn't look like it's

looking right now

at that time it just seemed like detroit

was just

kind of struggling you know we claimed

bankruptcy in 2013.

i feel like there is a new energy right

now and we're definitely on the upswing

a little bit

detroiters feel like they're kind of the

underdog yeah like people look at us

like

we're kind of the underdog it's it's

almost that it's fighting spirit or

something

you know it's that that whole concept

detroit versus

everybody that's kind of yeah that's

kind of where that's that's the attitude

of

you know it just i don't know it's

always felt like that i remember coming

up

you know in the in the in the battle

scene it was

very it was very

it was doggy dog and i tell you why when

you get on that mic

you've got like two to four bars

and you better impress you know what i'm

saying or you get booed

like you need to prove yourself or we're

gonna cal

downtown was like a source of

opportunity but a lot of detroiters they

didn't

live downtown seemed like they lived

outside of downtown

detroit is a big city so you can still

be in the city but

on the outskirts of it or you could be

downtown but it spreads out

who was the artist back then that that

would like the local heroes dilla

dilla dilla slim village damn man

man i remember those days too man proof

proof had really started making a name

for himself

it was a weird time in my life i

remember something fell through when i

was

super down and i had wrote a rhyme in

probably three months

living upstairs in the attic that we

turned into a bedroom at

kim's mother's house right and

i get a call from proof and he's like yo

what are you doing

i'm like nothing man i'm just about to

go to work and he's like yo

you need to come down to the shop

tomorrow i hadn't even wrote anything

like you know i'm saying like i didn't

have anything and then i'm like all

right i'm gonna have to write something

so i remember going to work and thinking

of the rhymes and then

trying to learn it and he was like he

basically explained to me he was

i said yo i don't know if i'm ready for

that man and he was like

look you come down i'm telling you i'm

running this place now

he was like you come down i'll shut it

down just have a few people in here

rap in front of him if you don't like it

bounce you know leave don't you don't

have to come back and i'll say all right

cool

i was writing in the mind frame of every

bar needs to have something that's going

to get a reaction

every bar because if i'm in front of the

crowd

i'm going to get booed if i don't

come with it i'm saying so so that's

kind of how

in that in that same kind of

spirit or that same kind of mentality is

kind of how i still

write today multi-syllable rhyming

is kind of the thing i got addicted to

and when you start thinking of like

whole sentences that rhyme with each

other

but in order to make that rhyme and do

that

sometimes you might be pushing the

envelope a little bit yeah

you know but that's why i've always been

just like you know freedom of speech man

there's a parental advisory

you know listen if you if you don't want

to listen

turn it off don't buy it don't listen

you know what i'm saying

like i mean but it's hip-hop

that's hip-hop man you talk about

writing that perfect search for that

perfect verse

yeah yeah that have you found it uh

i need any verses you wrote you feel

like it'd be i

i'm gonna be a hundred percent honest

yeah i'll keep it 100 right now i feel

like

i've felt this way for a long time i've

always been chasing the marshall mathers

lp

because i know that that captured a

moment

you know what i'm saying like it's kind

of like a time capsule when i look back

at it

the the times that it was back then and

the turmoil that my life felt like was

happenin was happening so fast

i was spiraling out of control and i had

a lot of rage

when people say they missed the olympian

and i feel like it's probably

that you miss the rage and you miss me

you know what i'm saying like

i i don't have the rage anymore that i

used to have but i still have the exact

same

passion sometimes it doesn't always come

out the right way you know what i'm

saying sometimes it's just like what the

is that and then take a pause man you

know what i'm saying like

who are you like i don't know who i'm

competing with but i just want to be

there's a lot of great rappers there's a

lot of great artists there's a lot of

great rappers coming up in this

generation now that it's like

[Music]

how has detroit informed you

as a person on a larger picture of the

of the country as a whole

just being from detroit you mean in the

hip-hop sense just as a whole

even in a social sense if we're talking

about hip-hop for a second okay

i think that one of the great things

about being from detroit is just we just

we

we i don't think in the very beginning

when hip-hop first started coming about

i don't think we really knew who we were

yet

as far as what's going to be our style

what's going to be our

you know sound what is going to be this

you know what i'm saying

what are we going to be i think

especially back then we used to think

like

nobody comes to detroit they look at us

like a ghost town

you know what i'm saying we want to be

somebody we want t

we want to stand up we want to be that

was always the thing back then too was

put detroit on the map everybody wanted

to put detroit on the map because we

felt like

yo no one's listening to us you know and

nobody takes us serious you see

like you know if you go to new york and

you're a detroit mc what it would seem

like back then is you probably would get

kissed

just being from detroit didn't matter

how good you were

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

i mean i remember when you did white

america somebody from your point of view

being white pointing out the injustice

as we see in the country

what untouchable you said some things in

that song that

really made me go man i never even heard

anybody say this

when and i'm paraphrasing but when you

said sometimes

i'm embarrassed to be white you know

what what does that mean like i've never

heard someone say that

because i feel like okay when at the

time

one of the the things that inspired that

song

was there was a time a couple of years

ago

if you remember this that you would turn

on the news

and literally every other day

it was a black man getting shot by

police and killed

and i remember seeing the thing

where michael slager the cop shot walter

scott in the back he pulled him over for

the tail like being out or whatever

when walter scott started running he's

like 50 something feet away from him and

when you see him shoot him in the back

and the dude thank god that the dude had

the camera

right and you watch him walk up and

place that taser

he's already got his story in his head

you know what i'm saying

and i'm on the phone calling paul like

yo did you see thi again

i would just go off like 45 minutes on

the phone talking about it in

uh philando castile like just re trying

to tell you like i i have a gun i'm you

know what i'm saying like i have a gun i

have a

license to carry this and getting shot

[Music]

what's up with the weather in detroit

man

is it always like 30 below right now

it's 30 below and it's hot

and it's hot yeah it goes down to like

460 below or something all right

our record tim was probably 620 below

okay so y'all beat out antarctica

probably

probably okay

you've been all around the world you

could live anywhere you want

but you still have a presence here you

still have a home in this area

yeah why

i'm very much a creature of habit

i feel like this is what i know and i

don't really know anything else i mean

i've been

obviously a lot of places but

this is to me home

it's just home

the spirit the people here

everything is this is what i love

[Music]

y'all got a symbol to represent the

detroit spirit right you know the fish

the fish right yeah the joe lewis yeah

joe lewis fest we've been kicked around

to long

so now we want to use our voices it's

[Music]

incredible

[Music]

so

[Music]

[Music]

do you feel like you've accomplished

your dreams

you know there's aspects of it where

you're like

i literally gave up my life for this i put my

life into this study this game inside

out every single aspect of it every

single

everything all it is is a stage

and you just walk out on that stage and

say your words to him

[Music]

hip-hop hasn't really been around long

enough to know how long somebody can

actually go for

[Music]
