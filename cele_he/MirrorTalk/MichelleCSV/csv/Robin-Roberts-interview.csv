Interviewer,What is it about Chicago?
Michelle,I've traveled all over the world. And Chicago still by far is one of the most beautiful cities.
Michelle,We're on Jeffery Boulevard. This was the this was where the rich kids lived. And then you'll see. We'll cross the tracks.
Interviewer,Uh oh.
Michelle,And we'll get in my neighborhood.
Michelle,So we're crossing the tracks. This is still South Shore. This was my walk to school. Across the street I usually meet my friend Terry Johnson right in front of that garage. This is my block.
Interviewer,So this is the house.
Michelle,This is my house.
Interviewer,Wow.
Michelle,"And that was that's where we lived, upstairs. The Robbie and Terry lived downstairs. That was my bedroom. So you see the four windows? I walk in there and I think, My God, how four people."
Interviewer,"Well, what."
Michelle,"Lived a full life in that little, bitty space, up there. Yes, yeah. Up until recently this little apartment was sort of our inheritance. So any time anybody hit on hard times, we'd just move back up there. You know?"
Michelle,"MICHELLE TOLD ME, SHE WOULDN'T RUN INTO ANYONE SHE KNEW BUT, SHE DID."
Michelle,"Hey, hi, oh my God, it's good to see you."
Interviewer,"Nice to meet you, Mr. Reed."
Michelle,How's everything going in the neighborhood?
Interviewer,Going well. How's Miss Robinson?
Michelle,"She's good yeah, yeah, I'll tell her that we saw you."
Interviewer,"See this is what you're talking about, it's a small town."
Interviewer,"There was one time you write about that I think you were about ten years old at the time. And you cousin said to you, Why do you talk like a white girl. How do you square who you are, where you come from, with where you wanna go?"
Michelle,"It was one of those kind of moments where it was, like, Pssh, you're not like us. And it was because of my speech. At this point the viewers who are watching this, there're a lot of people nodding because when you grew up in the neighborhood, you know, you could get your butt kicked goin' to school if you looked too uppity or if you were studying too hard. So I had to grow up learning these two languages of how do I fit in with my family and my community and still excel? This wouldn't be the first time that my identity would be challenged. You know, where people couldn't figure out who I was with how I talked and what they who they thought I should be."
Michelle,"My parents from early age encouraged us to put our opinions on the table, to ask questions. To question context of situations. They encouraged us to understand the context."
Interviewer,"they weren't there to prevent you from falling, but to pick you up when you did."
Michelle,"Yeah. You could speak your mind, but you had to be respectful, you know? And if you got outta hand, you got a look. You'd get a spanking. They weren't free wheelin' parents. They were still black parents. But they believed in teaching us to think for ourselves."
Michelle,"My parents were very clear, you know we weren't rich. I remember there was a time my brother wanted to understand 'cause he couldn't get somethin' that he wanted. And my father laid out all the bills, brought home his paycheck in cash. And took every bill and put money on top of it to show what it costs and how much he brought in and what was left. They wanted to make it clear. You know, there was money earned and money that went out."
Michelle,I was nervous about going. I wondered if I was good enough and could I make it in this highly competitive magnet school.
Interviewer,"You write about foolin' around with your boyfriend. Oh, and smokin'."
Michelle,Which which one?
Interviewer,"Oh, well, we'll talk about."
Michelle,"Oh, high school boyfriend."
Interviewer,"Yeah, the high school boyfriend. And you even write about smokin' pot. Now, you didn't go into great detail, but you did you could've left that out. So why'd you talk about that?"
Interviewer,"MICHELLE OBAMA That's what I did. That's part of the becoming story. Everybody had something that they had to work through, something that they were figuring out. Why would I hide that from the next generation?"
Interviewer,"IN THE FALL OF 1981, MICHELLE ENTERED PRINCETON UNIVERSITY'S FRESHMAN CLASS. SHE SAYS PRINCETON WAS ""SCARY."" FELLOW STUDENTS AND MENTORS GAVE HER THE CONFIDENCE TO SUCCEED. AS SHE EXPLAINED IN THIS INSTAGRAM POST SHARING A YOUNG PHOTO OF HERSELF IN FRONT OF PRINCETON'S LIBRARY."
Michelle,It was the first time I had been in a predominantly white situation. So I had to learn how to adjust in this new world of wealth and privilege and kids that I didn't realize had come from prep schools that had prepared them. And I didn't even know the language of that college. What was a syllabus? Never heard of it.
Interviewer,You really blazed a path for others. We went back to Princeton. We spoke with grads recent grads and people.
Michelle,You did?
Interviewer,"Yeah, and people that are and young women who are still in school at Princeton. And they spoke about the example that you set for them, I want you to hear it."
Michelle,Oh.
Interviewer,This is.
Michelle,Robin. (watching video of Princeton students).
Interviewer,"Yeah, these these are your."
Michelle,Oh my gosh.
Interviewer,"It's just incredible walking the paths of Princeton, knowing that Michelle Obama was one here."
Michelle,Oh my gosh.
Interviewer,"Knowing that Michelle Obama came from, like, a working class family. Like, Michelle Obama's parents didn't, like, come here and she still came, thrived, found her place. And had a productive experience at a school like this, it inspired me. And it's just one of the reasons why I applied to this school."
Michelle,"They're standing where I was. Oh, of course, you did that."
Interviewer,"She's inspiring us today. And the current students are Princeton, the people applying to Princeton and just every little girl in America today, I don't think she even knows. Thank you just from the bottom of my heart. I can't thank you enough. And I hope to one day be able to convey that in person. But thank you."
Michelle,Oh my goodness.
Michelle,Why'd you do that?
Interviewer,"I know, I know. I didn't, we did feel bad at that point because she thought she thought it was, like, one of those."
Michelle,"With, like, the cameras."
Interviewer,TV shows.
Michelle,"And it's, like."
Interviewer,And a TV show.
Michelle,"And it's, like, she's gonna come out from the."
Interviewer,"How does that make you feel when you see these young women who said that, because of you, they're there?"
Michelle,"Yeah, it's yeah. So what'd you do that for, Robin? It feels, you know, I'm glad. I'm glad that they."
Interviewer,You proud?
Michelle,Yeah. I am. I am.
Interviewer,You talked about lust for your man. That's not something you expect to hear or read from a first lady.
Interviewer,You ready to talk about Barack?
Michelle,Who?
Michelle,"I was a box checker. And I was checking off my box. You know, I got into Princeton, great. What am I gonna do next? I don't know. Why don't I go to law school? Got into Harvard, I'm going to Harvard, check. You know, got my you know, got my big firm position, check."
Interviewer,You're at this law firm.
Michelle,Got it all together.
Interviewer,You got it all together.
Michelle,I had made a declaration that I was off men. I was focusing on my career. I had my checklist. I was.
Interviewer,You were.
Michelle,Getting' it down.
Interviewer,"Locked, focused."
Michelle,Was focused.
Interviewer,he's still a law student.
Michelle,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,at Harvard.
Michelle,Right. A first year.
Interviewer,"First year. You're gonna be his mentor. He comes blowing into town, a little bit famous already. Late for the first meeting."
Michelle,"Late. Late. I was, like, Is he trifling?"" This the black man's gonna be late on the first day? I was."
Interviewer,You you weren't overly impressed in the beginning?
Michelle,"I I wasn't, you know? I have my suspicions when a bunch of white folks fawn on over a black man 'cause I sorta think, Okay, he can talk straight so they think he's wonderful. So so that was my theory. And then his name was Barack Obama. He was from Hawaii. I thought, What, you know? So I didn't really know what to expect. And then in walks Barack Obama. And Barack Obama has always walked like Barack Obama. Like, he's got all the time in the world. He's he had that stride. I was, like, Dude, you're cute. But in my mind, I was, like."
Interviewer,Not interested?
Michelle,"Off limits. Not even not interested. I'm not gonna date the one of the few black summer associates. Robin, how tacky, you know?"
Michelle,"We had been hanging out, getting closer. Barack had suggested that we date. But I was, like, No, no, meet my friends. Do this, do that. It wouldn't be right, no. And he was, like, You're crazy. We should date. I like you, you like me. And he was very and I liked that about him. He was very straightforward. He wasn't playin' games. I say that to the ladies out there. Not a game play. Very clear about what he wanted. When we stopped for ice cream and he got the sense that I was starting to open up. And he, you know, he played it real smooth. He just leaned in for a kiss. And that really was it. You know, from that kiss on, we were it was it was love. And he was my man.\."
Interviewer,"You realize there's a plaque there, right?"
Michelle,I know. The kids are highly embarrassed that there's a plaque about their parents' first kiss.
Interviewer,There're many things in reading that your book that I don't think I would ever imagine hearing from a first lady. Lust. You talked about lust for your man.
Michelle,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,That's not something you expect to hear or read from a first lady.
Michelle,But it's there. I don't know what to tell you. It was it was there. It still is. I love my husband a lot.
Michelle,"I felt lost and alone. And I feel I felt like I failed because I didn't know how common miscarriages were because we don't talk about 'em. We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we're broken."
Michelle,"The biological clock is real because egg production is limited. And I realized that as I was 34 and 35. We had to do IVF. I think it's the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work and how they don't work."
Interviewer,You write about at one point in your marriage that you and Barack went to marriage counseling. Why did you think it was important to share that?
Michelle,"And marriage counseling for us was one of those ways where we learned how to talk out our differences. What I learned about myself was that my happiness was up to me. And I started working out more. I started asking for help, not just from him, but from other people. I stopped feeling guilty. I know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them. And I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage. And we get help with our marriage when we need it."
Interviewer,"As much as you love your husband and gave him your blessing to run for president, you didn't think he would win."
Michelle,Oh yeah.
Interviewer,Not that he shouldn't win.
Michelle,Um hm.
Interviewer,"And you saw Time Magazine. And I think it was, like, October, 2006. And on the cover it says, Could Barack Obama be the next president? And you looked away."
Michelle,Um hm.
Interviewer,You didn't even wanna see that. Why?
Michelle,"I think I did what a lot of black folks were doin'. We were afraid to hope because it's hard to believe that the country that oppressed you could one day be led by you, you know? I mean, my grandparents, you know, lived through segregation. My grandfather his grandfather was a slave, you know? So this these memories were real. And they didn't think the country was ready. And so my attitude was a reflection of that skepticism."
Interviewer,"Ten years ago we were sitting down in Norfolk, Virginia. This is pre-White House. And I want you to take a look and tell me what you see about this version of yourself."
Michelle,Wow.
Interviewer,What do you wish you could tell your pre White House self?
Michelle,"Whew. You know the hard parts were the things that I expected. That it was gonna be hard, you know? So much of this country lives in isolation and we just don't know each other. And so there were people who didn't know what a black woman was and sounded like. And so I knew that I'd have to earn my grace."
Michelle,"People called me Barack's baby mama, you know? Accused me of not loving my country. You know, told me I was angry. You know, it was the first time I really experienced someone taking my voice and ballin' it up and distorting it. And I was, like, This isn't me. Wait, wait, people. This isn't who I am."
Interviewer,"I remember talking to you during the campaign about the criticism. And you said you didn't really pay attention to it. In the book, you admit it. You said, This stuff hurt."
Michelle,"Yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,This stuff hurt.
Michelle,"I don't think we do each other a service by pretending like hurtful things don't hurt. And that's what I've come I came to after that experience. I need to own that hurt. I need to talk about it. I need to put it out there for myself so that I can heal from it. But at the time, oh gosh, you know? I wasn't gonna allow myself to feel victimized from it because there was no time to hurt in that role."
Interviewer,Is the current first lady how do you think she is doing in defining who she is?
Michelle,"You know, one of the things you learn as a former, it's, like, I don't judge, what a current is doin', you know? So I'd prefer not to, you know, speak on what she's doing versus what I did because I think every first lady approaches this job differently."
Interviewer,"I know that Laura Bush reached out to you and said, If you need any help, I'm a phone call away. You wrote about how and have talked about how you extended that same courtesy to Melania Trump. Has she reached out they and asked-."
Michelle,No.
Interviewer,For any help?
Michelle,"No, she hasn't."
Interviewer,"What you haven't said before, you said, I will always wonder about what led so many, women in particular, to reject an exceptionally qualified female candidate and instead choose a misogynist as their president. Some powerful words."
Michelle,"I implored people to focus and to think about what it takes to be commander in chief. It's amazing to me that we still have to tell people about the importance of voting. You know, that almost every two years, we're having this conversation to get people to the polls. And in the end, that's how our democracy works. People have to be educated, they have to be focused on the issues and they have to go to the polls if they want their politics to reflect their values."
Interviewer,"People want to hear more from you about what's currently going on. And there is a fine line that you and your husband, as previous administrations have done, is that you have to step, step back and let the current one do what it's doing. But I think it's safe to say that during your husband's presidency, it was no drama Obama. No drama Obama. So what goes through your mind when you read and hear all that's going on right now with this administration?"
Michelle,"I said what I continue to say. Being the commander in chief is a hard job. And you need to have discipline and you need to read and you need to be knowledgeable. You need to know history, you need to be careful with your words. But voters make those decisions. And once the voters have spoken, you know, we live with what we live with."
Interviewer,"There're some people that feel that the seed of discontent that led to Donald Trump being elected president, that the seed of that discontent happened during your husband's presidency."
Michelle,"I would like to indulge the question, but it requires a level of speculation about how people are feeling and thinking that I don't have. And I think we're gonna have to figure that out as a nation."
Interviewer,"How is Chicago, and in particularly your neighborhood how is it the same, when you were growing up, and how is it different?"
Michelle,"You know when we moved in, it was a coveted neighborhood. But from time I was young until the time I was high school. It became a neighborhood that you didn't wanna live in."
Interviewer,Wow. Just that time.
Michelle,"And that, you know, and that's the story of urban neighborhoods all over the country."
Interviewer,Not just Chicago.
Michelle,"Not just Chicago. Over on this area, this is North Kenwood. This is where the Hadiya Pendleton family lived."
Michelle,"You're in the wrong place at the wrong time, even if you're doing the right thing, you could lose your life."
Interviewer,Very impressive.
Michelle,I have not played the piano in so long.
Interviewer,"That's it, di di di di..."
Michelle,Now that I taught myself. I grew up in a household of music. Music was important and it still is. It really set me on a course.
Michelle,"It was important to me for young people to know that the White House was theirs too. We didn't want them to just be looking in through the wrought-iron gates, thinking, I wonder what's goin' on in there."
Michelle,"Whether it was a music event, or whether it was the state dinner, during that earlier part of the day we'd have a companion event with young kids from around the country. They could eat the food as well and meet the entertainers."
Interviewer,"And did it mean something to bring something different to the White House, different music that had not been played there."
Michelle,Different.
Interviewer,"Before, artists."
Michelle,"Different music, different people. Yes absolutely. I mean it's why our first cultural event was spoken word."
Michelle,He said he was gonna perform a piece on Alexander Hamilton.
Michelle,"And Barack and I almost laughed in his face. And he went out and performed the first number of the now award winning musical. And afterwards he said, I think I'm gonna go and turn this into a Broadway show."
Michelle,"And we were like, Good luck with that, kid."
Michelle,You were encouraged to work hard here and to excel. And it wasn't unusual. And you know. So I felt free here.
Interviewer,"Can I have everybody's attention? Can you turn that off? You guys, we have a very special guest for you guys to meet and be introduced to."
Michelle,"How are you guys doing? Who's that? Oh my goodness. Look at you guys. So what, what, what is this? What are you all doing? (Class"
Michelle,"You know, I wasn't, like, in a dance troupe like you guys. I was, like, doing my kick with a bad extension. You know my knee wasn't straight, my toe wasn't really pointed. But there was effort there in that face. (Student"
Interviewer,"I know you see her right now. And you would not know that she walked around in these halls saying, Am I good enough?"
Michelle,Mmhmm.
Michelle,I talked about I write about a story here where the college counselor I wanted to apply to Princeton. She told me I wasn't Princeton material. Can you imagine that?
Interviewer,She doesn't work here anymore.
Michelle,"But that was just one of many examples, the doubters. Instead of walking away going, Yeah, you're right, maybe she's right, I would always think, I'll show you. And I'm gonna work hard and I'm gonna make sure that people know that I am substantive and smart and kind and patriotic and hard working."
Michelle,"Alright, I'm going to get out of your hair because you guys have big things. You gotta practice."
Interviewer,Can we dance for you?
Michelle,Yes. I would love that. Oh yes.
Interviewer,We're performing for Michelle Obama.
Michelle,"You can do that? Is that what you all are doing in this room? I'm so proud of you. I'm gonna cry. You guys are gonna make me cry. Do not doubt anything. Anything. If you can get out here, look you got cameras and Secret Service and Robin Roberts, (Teacher"
Interviewer,Could we get you to sign the poster?
Michelle,Yes.
Interviewer,We love you.
Michelle,I would love to hug each and every one of you. I'm proud of you guys.
Interviewer,How important was it to put it there?
Michelle,"It was important for both me and Barack. Because, first of all, we both lived together in South Shore. We lived in Hyde Park. These communities are ours. Our kids went to school here. I grew up here. So symbolically it was important."
Michelle,"The Presidential Center, the library, can play a big role in bringing resources and tourism and jobs and opportunity to the South Side."
Michelle,"I say this to my kids now, this is one of the greatest lessons that my mother taught me is that children you aren't raisin' babies. They're only gonna be cute and little for a little while. But then they grow up and they have to be adults in the world. And everything we do was a parent with our children, we're preparing them for adulthood."
Interviewer,You excited about the book?
Michelle,I am. I'm excited. I'm a little nervous.
Interviewer,Why?
Michelle,"Well, because it's my work being put out there, it's just like anything. It's, you know, I'm still that kid, What grade am I getting? Did I do okay? Do people like it? So I'm excited and anxious to, you know, see what people get from it. I'm hoping that it generates a conversation."
Interviewer,What do you want your legacy to be?
Michelle,"Young people are the future. And if my story, my journey, somehow gives them hope, if I played a role in that for some young people comin' down the line, then I'll feel good about it."
