Interviewer,What's is going to happen with the Red Octobers?
Kanye,"You know Nike told me when I asked them? We ain't sure. You know what they told the store though, of my- of my boy that run the store? They said if you want that Red October, you gotta take these 10 other shoes. So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you want that Red October- but legally, we gotta both sign that contract, Mark Parker. I'mma put Mark Parker all on that Summer Jam screen. And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in Donda. I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes. But if you guys that're investing in the arts, y'all don't want to invest in the school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to Africa, I am standing up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney. Nike. Google.
