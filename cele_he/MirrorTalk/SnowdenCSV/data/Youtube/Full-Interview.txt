so add Snowden a lot of people in this

country are probably curious when was

the last time you had substantive

discussions about coming home to the

United States and would this still be

your preference do you still refer to it

as home the United States will always be

my home and I'll always be willing to

come back on a single condition and I've

been quite clear about this over the

years this is that the government

guarantee that I have the right and

every whistleblower has the right to

tell the jury why they did what they did

right we can disagree about whether this

was right or wrong we can disagree about

whether this is good or bad we can

disagree about whether this is legal

early illegal that's right and proper in

a democracy but we have to agree that

the jury is supposed to be the proper

authority to ultimately decide was this

right or wrong and I hate to say it but

under current laws that is explicitly

forbidden under the Espionage Act which

as you know it's increasingly being used

against the sources of journalism

instead of foreign spies the law makes

no distinction between someone who tells

a secret to a journalist and someone who

tells a secret to a foreign government

and and so yeah there have nots there

has not been any movement unfortunately

on that conversation since the Obama

administration when I told that the

government that all they need to do is

give me the right of what we call a

public interest offense this is a fair

trial an open trial where the jury hears

what is happening and they decide was

this justified or not and unfortunately

a then Attorney General Eric Holder

responded and said we can't promise that

we won't promise that we will promise

not to torture you unfortunately I'd say

that's not quite enough something you've

said repeatedly is that you would expect

and you would accept a certain

punishment for your actions what if that

package of punishment in

working for the home team what if

someone said help us harden our

elections from attack using your skills

I would volunteer for that instantly you

know they they wouldn't even have to pay

me for that remember I volunteered to

work for the CIA

for the NSA when I came forward to

reveal mass surveillance which we need

to be clear the courts have found was in

fact unlawful on the part of the

government and one court said likely

unconstitutional so I have no objection

to helping the government I came forward

not to burn the NSA down I came forward

to reform it to help it return to the

ideals that we're all supposed to share

so there will never be a question of

when my government is ready when my

government wants me to help I will be

there

how has your opinion changed about mr.

Putin since you've been in Russia well I

don't think it really has changed

because the question might presume that

I had a positive opinion at some point I

think everyone would agree probably

including the Russian President himself

that he is an authoritarian leader I

think the Russian government broadly

does not have a good record on human

rights and that hasn't changed how odd

is it to you that while you've been

there consensus here has hardened that

they are the actors who interfered in

our last presidential election I don't

think that's especially surprising there

was a story published in The New York

Times actually reporting on a study in

February of 2018 and was also done in

the Washington Post a few months prior

to that about the record of electoral

interference and they looked at the

history of Russia and the Soviet Union

and an electoral Intel interference by

intelligence agencies and they found I

think 36 different cases of electoral

interference over roughly the past 50

years

but then they also looked at the United

States intelligence services and found

that we hit enter feared in foreign

elections eighty-one different times now

this is not to say one is better than

the other it's not about that it's about

budget about capability but we do what

we do see from this is that what

happened in 2016 actually was not

unusual from the perspective of

intelligence agencies this is what they

believe are they are hired to do what we

have to do is find out how to secure our

systems against the attacks that we know

are inevitable something you've been

asked before something you have answered

before but since this is a fresh

occasion we'll will ask it again why not

stay in this country and face the music

if you believed in the strength of your

conviction this is a great question

Brian and I'm glad you asked it when we

say face the music the question is well

what song are they playing I was

intentionally charged as every major

whistleblower in the last decades has

been with the very particular crime this

is a violation of the Espionage Act of

1917 and and this is a law that is

explicitly designed to prohibit a

meaningful defense in court this is

applied or this law is used against

people who's the only thing that they've

done and this is by the government's own

terms the only thing the government

accuses people defending themselves

against this charge I have done is that

they have told something to a journalist

that the government considers classified

that is the whole of the crime they

don't consider whether it was good or

bad they don't consider whether or not

it caused harm simply did you tell

something classified to a journalist if

you did the jury is not allowed to

consider and in fact they're explicitly

forbidden from considering why you told

journalists they're explicitly forbidden

from considering did it result in a

public benefit right did it further the

public interest instead they simply say

did you tell a journalist let the glass

buy so I am NOT if I had stayed in the

United States and my good friend Daniel

Ellsberg by the way that has told me

that I was right not to stand and wait

for an inevitable arrest because the

laws and the way they're enforced today

is not the same as the 1970s when he

came forward with the Pentagon Papers I

would not have received a fair trial

there would not have been much of a

trial at all I would only have received

a sentencing and the question there is

what message does that send whether you

like me or not

I could be the best person in the world

I could be the worst what message does a

conviction where you spend the rest of

your life in prison for telling

journalists things that change the laws

of the United States that have resulted

in the most substantive reform so

intelligence authorities since the 1970s

if the only result of doing that is a

life sentence in prison the next person

who sees something criminal happening in

the United States government will be

discouraged from coming forward and I

can't be a part of that where do your

parents come down on what you did in the

book we learn a lot more than we knew

about them they were both we say this in

quotes deep Staters we learn that they

both had varying degrees of security

clearances in their lives yeah I come

from a federal family my father worked

for the military my mother works for the

courts my whole line going back has

worked in the in the government service

so I think this was difficult for them

and in fact one of the things that I

will be eternally grateful for is the

fact that they still stand by me today

and believe that I did the right thing

were they present for your wedding

you've gone and gotten married in the

years since we've last spoken there

hasn't been a wedding yet actually we

were married but it was just a paperwork

sighs in a courthouse because Lindsay

and I had been living together we had

been in love with each other we had been

in a relationship for more than ten

years there will be a wedding someday

Brian and I hope you'll be there

what do you make of Donald Trump there

are so many things that are said about

the president right now and so much

thinking and honestly I try not to think

about it there's so much chaos and there

are so many aggressive and offensive

things said I think even his supporters

would would grant that but I think he's

actually quite simple to understand

Donald Trump strikes me like nothing so

much as a man who has never really known

a love that he hasn't had to pay for and

so everything that he does is informed

by a kind of transactional ism I think

and what he is actually looking for is

simply for people to like him

unfortunately that produces a lot of

negative effects do you believe he is a

threat to national security I mean this

is the question of who defines national

security what is national security when

we used to talk about national security

we thought about public safety but now

national security really means the

security of the system itself the

institution of government and I think

he's made it his stated goal to change

the way that system works I think we

have seen tremendous harm done to civil

liberties in the United States

increasingly since September 11th and I

haven't seen any reduction in the rate

of that we have several important jobs

vacant in this country including

director of national security national

security advisor is that a threat to our

security

I think it really says something about

where we are what this point in our

history looks like when we find that

there are not enough people in the

country that are willing not to serve in

the White House and qualify to serve in

the White House who all sides of the

government feel comfortable working with

and who they can back we are in a time

that is increasingly fractured and I

think that's a product of the fact that

look if you look around at the world

right now when you look at news when you

look at news coverage when you look at

every controversy that we see something

has changed and that is that it has

become increasingly popular for your

feelings to matter more than the facts

and I think that's toxic to a democracy

because if there's one thing that we

have to have to be able to have this

discussion to be able to learn to live

with people that we disagree with we

can't have a conversation about what we

should do we can't have a conversation

about where we are going if we can't

agree on where we are if we can't agree

on what is happening facts have to

matter more than the feelings you've

said your greatest fear over what you

did was that things would not change

have things changed would you do it

again today knowing what you know now

this is a significant portion of the the

final chapter of my book things have

changed and I would do it again if I

changed anything I would hope that I

could have come forward sooner it took

me so long just to understand what was

happening and it took so long

not to realize that nobody else was

going to fix this believe me when I say

I did not want to light a match and burn

my life to the ground no one does nobody

really wants to be a whistleblower but

the results of that

have been staggering I thought this was

gonna be two days story I thought

everybody was gonna forget about this a

week after the journalist ran the first

stories in 2013 but here we are in 2019

and we're still talking about it in fact

data security surveillance the internet

manipulation and influence that's

provided or produced rather by a

corporate or governmental control of

this permanent record of all of our

private lives that's been created every

day by the devices that we have before

2013 if you said there's a system that's

watching everything you do the

government is collecting records of

every phone call in the United States

even for those people who are not

suspected of any crime it was a

conspiracy yes there were some people

who believed it was happening yes there

were academics who could say this was

technically possible yes there were

technologists who could went this is

something that could be done but what we

didn't have it was we the world of 2013

we suspected some suspected that this

was happening the world after 2013

we know that it's happening and this is

the critical importance of journalism

particularly in this moment that we have

today

the distance between speculation and

fact is everything in a democracy

because that's what what lets us as we

did post 2013 change our laws now the

very first program that was real to

newspapers I has since been terminated

Barack Obama who criticized me so

strongly in June of 2013 by January of

2014 was proposing that this program be

ended eventually it was ended under the

USA Freedom Act the NSA argued that mass

surveillance was legal bulk collection

as they they call it they said 15

different judges authorized this what

they didn't tell us was that those 15

judges all belonged to the rubber-stamp

FISA Court that over 33 years had been

asked 33 thousand nine hundred times by

the government to approve surveillance

requests

only said tow in 33 years 11 times now

this was a court that was never designed

to interpret the Constitution right it

was never designed to create novel

powers for the intelligence community

it was just designed to stamp basic

routine warrants now we know what has

changed the very first open court

outside of these secret rubber-stamp

courts that got this case in front of

them I was judge Leon in a federal court

and then a court of appeals and said

that the NSA's mass surveillance

activities were violating even the very

loose standards of the Patriot Act they

broke the law he further said these

programs are likely unconstitutional and

this would not have happened if we

couldn't say this is real this is

actually happening and I just want to

make clear that's not me saying that

that's not speculation that was the

determination of the Supreme Court just

a few months before I came forward in a

famous case Amnesty versus clapper I I

believe it was in February of 2013 or

door December of 2012 all the way to the

Supreme Court these surveillance

authorities were being challenged the

plaintiff said the government has a mass

surveillance program it has impacted

this human rights organization they have

been spied on in secret by the

government the government said that may

be but if it's happening we will neither

conform confirm nor deny that it's

happening it is a state secret and

because you can't prove it the court

should be forbidden from ruling on the

constitutionality of this program and

sadly the Supreme Court of the United

States agreed

they said this program could be

unconstitutional but if you cannot prove

it exists we cannot evaluate it that's

what 2013 changed on the legal side we

have now had the GDP or we have firt had

the first European regulation

that are trying to limit the amount of

data that can be collected secretly and

used against populations broadly and we

have also seen the basic structure of

the Internet itself change in response

to this understanding that the network

path that all of our communications

cross when you request a website when

you send a text message when you read an

email for so long those communications

have been electronically naked or

unencrypted before 2013 more than half

the world's internet communications were

unencrypted now far more than half are

measured by just web traffic from where

the world's leading browsers the Google

Chrome browser some figures showed it

more than 80 percent the entire world

has changed in the last few years it

hasn't gone far enough the problems

still exist and in some ways they've

gotten worse but we have made progress

that would not have been possible if we

didn't know what was going on related

question what today can the government

do to your phone and your laptop the

phone and laptop of any American what's

the extent of the government's reach if

they're determined to reach into your

life we could talk about this question

for hours Brian but we don't have time

so I'll try to summarize hacking has

increasingly become what governments

consider a legitimate investigative tool

they use the same methods and techniques

as criminal hackers and what this means

is they will try to remotely take over

your device once they do this by

detecting a vulnerability and in the

software that your device runs such as

Apple's iOS or Microsoft Windows they

can craft a special kind of attack code

called an exploit

they then launch this exploit at the

vulnerability on your device which

allows them to take total control of

that device anything you can do on that

device the attacker in this case the

government can do they can read your

email they can

collect every document they can look at

your contact book they can turn the

location services on they can see

anything that is on that phone instantly

and send it back home to the mothership

they can do the same with laptops the

other prong that we forget so frequently

is that in many cases they don't need to

hack our devices they can simply ask

Google for a copy of our email box

because Google saves a copy of that

everything that you've ever typed into

that search box Google has a copy of

every private message that you've sent

on Facebook every link that you've

clicked everything that you've liked

they keep a permanent record of and all

of these things available not just to

these companies but to our governments

as they are increasingly deputized as

sort of miniature arms of government

what about enabling your microphone

camera if you can do it they can do it

it is trivial to remotely turn on your

microphone or to activate your camera so

long as you have systems-level access if

you had hacked someone's device remotely

anything they can do you can do they can

look up your nose right they can record

what's in the room the screen may be off

as it's sitting on your desk but the

device is talking all of the time the

question we have to ask is who is it

talking to even if your phone is not act

right now you look at it it's just

sitting there on the charger it is

talking tens or hundreds or thousands of

times a minute

to any number of different companies who

have apps installed on your phone it

looks like it's off it looks like it's

just sitting there but it is constantly

chattering and unfortunately like

pollution we have not created the tools

that are necessary for ordinary people

to be able to see this activity and it

is the invisibility of it that makes it

so popular in common and attractive for

these companies because if you do not

realize they're collecting this data

from you this very private and personal

data there's no way you're going to

object to it what about its ability to

track its own

and talk to me specifically about the

case of Jamal khashoggi so in the case

of Jamal Khashoggi

this is a Washington Post reporter and a

primary critic of the Saudi regime he

was lured into the Saudi Arabian

consulate in Istanbul in Turkey and

while his fiance waited outside for him

to get the paperwork he needed in order

to marry her he was murdered by the

Saudi government allegedly on the orders

of the Crown Prince now we have to ask

ourselves how did the Saudi government

decide that he was worth killing how did

they decide when and how they would kill

him how did they know this opportunity

was going to arise how do they know what

his plans and intentions were that they

needed to stop from their perspective we

don't have evidence that his phone

personally was hacked unfortunately

because we do not have his phone but we

do have the phones of his friends who

were living in exile in Canada and we do

know thanks to the research of a group

called the citizen lab affiliated with a

university in Canada that their phones

were hacked which means their

conversations with Jamal khashoggi were

intercepted and this allowed the Saudi

regime to know that he was intending to

create an electronic protest movement

they didn't need to know from his

friend's phone or even from his phone

that he was travelling to the consulate

because he had to make an appointment

but it did tell them his private

intentions his hopes and dreams for a

different government for their country

and perhaps although we do not know for

sure on that basis they decided to

murder him once your phone is hacked

what is in their hands is not simply

your device it is your future

it's important also to remember how did

the government of Saudi Arabia manage to

hack these people's phones which are

modern phones well they didn't have this

capability in their government they

didn't have this level of intelligence

capability available to them directly so

they purchased it from a digital arms

broker a company called the NSO Group an

Israeli company in this company the only

thing they do is manufacture digital

weapons kind of hacking tools they can

be used against the critical

infrastructure that all of us rely on

the phones and our pockets they

primarily target devices such as the

Apple iPhone and they sell this

capability to break into phones of

people around the world for millions and

millions of dollars to some of the worst

governments on earth and the only

meaningful oversight that they have

unfortunately because the export control

laws for these kind of digital weapons

are extremely weak in Israel is their

own internal ethics board this is oh it

was fine

we didn't break any rules that has to

change what about the public attitude

held by millions of everyday Americans

all I've got on a computer is pictures

of my family CCTV cameras that are

prevalent in a ton of American cities

and overseas capitals those cameras are

your friend if you're innocent and have

nothing to hide well I'd say that's very

much what the average Chinese citizen

believed or perhaps even still to this

day believes but we see how these same

technologies are being applied to create

what they call the social credit system

if any of these family photos if any of

your activities online if your purchases

if your associations if your friends or

in any way different from what the

government or the powers-that-be of the

moment would like them to be you're no

longer able to purchase train tickets

you're no longer a

to board an airplane you may not be able

to get a passport you may not be

eligible for a job you might not be able

to work for the government all of these

things are increasingly being created

and programmed and decided by algorithms

and those algorithms are fueled by

precisely the innocent data that our

devices are creating all of the time

constantly invisibly quietly right now

our devices are casting all of these

records that we do not see being created

that in aggregate seemed very innocent

you were at Starbucks at this time you

went to the hospital afterwards you

spent a long time at the hospital after

you left the hospital you made a phone

call you made a phone call to your

mother you talked to her until the

middle of the night the hospital was an

oncology clinic even if you can't see

the content of these communications the

activity records what the government

calls metadata which they argue they do

not need a warrant to collect tells the

whole story and these activity records

are being created and shared and

collected and intercepted constantly by

companies and governments and ultimately

it means as they sell these as they

trade these as they make their

businesses on the backs of these records

what they are selling is not information

what they're selling is us they're

selling our future they're selling our

past they are selling our history our

identity and ultimately they are

stealing our power and making our

stories work for them what devices do

you use in your life now and have you

accepted the notion that you are watched

rather constantly well probably every

intelligence the world is definitely

targeting me in trouble

anything they can just as they did with

Jamal khashoggi in regards to what are

my plans and intentions I try not to

make that easy for them if I get a smart

phone and I need to use a phone I

actually open it up before I use it I

perform a kind of surgery on it to

physically desolder or sort of melt the

metal connections that hold the

microphone on the phone and I physically

take this off I remove the camera for

the phone and then I close it back up I

seal it up and then if I need to make a

phone call I will attach an external

microphone on and this is just so if the

phone is sitting there and I'm not

making a call it cannot hear me now this

is extreme most people do not need this

but for me it's about being able to

trust our technology my phone could

still be hacked my laptop could still be

hacked and just as I told you before the

same principles applied to me if it is

hacked they can do anything to the

device that I can do so my trust in

technology is limited but just because

that's how it is today doesn't mean

that's how it has to be and a large

majority of my work with the freedom of

the press foundation where I serve as

president of the board is dedicated to

trying to make technology more secure to

try to create programs and protocols by

which we can make the communications of

sources and journalists more

confidential because if we lose the

confidentiality between sources and

journalists we lose access to those

essential facts that let us understand

what's happening in the world and

unfortunately under this White House

just like under the prior White House we

see the sources of very important

stories that have advanced the public

interest facing retaliation from a very

angry government I believe it's in the

first half of the book and I'm

paraphrasing you come out and just say

the computer guy knows everything or at

least he should

what part computer guy are you were you

and what part trained spy

well for the vast majority of my career

I was what was called a systems engineer

or a systems administrator an

administrator sort of maintains and

expands a system that they have

inherited and a systems engineer sort of

develops new projects new capabilities

for these systems roles what this means

in short was that all of the systems the

NSA and the CIA that I was put in charge

of I had total access to and this is

just what happens with the systems

administrator when you think about a

computer system who gives someone else

access well someone has to be the

original authority that has access to

everything that was me and so I would

say the computer guy knows everything

that's not a boast that's simply the way

these systems are designed that's the

way they're structured and this is very

much a vulnerability because it means

that you have to trust this this

administrator will work to the good of

the users but what happens when the

people using that network the people

constructing that network are going

against the benefit of the broader

society and this put me in a very

interesting kind of conflicted position

I could do what the NSA wanted me to do

or I could do what the Constitution of

the United States the the public of the

United States needed me to do which was

report that my agency had broken the law

do you regard yourself as a journalist

these days I'm not I'm not I have

tremendous respect for journalists but I

try to keep a distance particularly in

this moment where so much of journalism

is coming under attack because the

government has a tremendous incentive to

discredit me to make people distrust me

and so if I hold myself out if I start

reporting stories if I start talking to

sources if I try to start advancing what

the public knows on a personal level my

reputation could could sort of poison

instead I keep a distinction what I do

is I try to aid the work of journalism

but I am NOT myself a journalist your

book is highly personal tell us about

the price your then girlfriend now wife

paid for your actions and how you feel

she was miss portrayed in the eyes of

the world when we got that first kind of

thumbnail sketch of who she was so in

the wake of the revelations of mass

surveillance in 2013 this was suddenly

the world's biggest story in every

country they were talking about the same

thing and unfortunately that meant that

everyone who was connected to me in some

way they were also talking about because

they were trying to say who I was where

I came from and this unfortunately meant

that Lindsey my lifelong partner was

intensely investigated both by the FBI

in the United States she didn't know

what I was doing I could not tell her

what I was doing because if I had they

would have said she was an accessory to

the crime they would have said she was

part of a criminal conspiracy so long as

she didn't immediately pick up the phone

and say help help someone's talking to a

journalist and so this meant that I

couldn't tell her she learned about what

was going to happen the same way

everybody else did about what is

happening the same way everybody else

did she saw me on TV which probably

makes me the worst boyfriend in the

history of the United States but she

stuck by me and we are reunited and

together today and I will never be able

to repay her for the faith that she's

shown me but the media had a tremendous

amount of salacious reporting when they

realized that she taught toll pole

fitness classes which are quite popular

for him in these days they called her a

stripper even though she's never been

one even though she's a poet even though

she's a photographer

they sexualized her they focused on her

body they focus on her image because

that's what got attention she's a much

more complex and deep figure than the

media ever gave her credit for she is

more brave then anyone can possibly

understand and she's more political and

intelligent than any of these reporters

at the time could appreciate her

politics in fact influenced mine and I'd

like to think I learned as much from her

or perhaps even more than she ever

learned from me you paint a portrait of

what some of us knew and that was that

you were a thoroughly American kid in

your upbringing you wake up every day in

Russia you go to sleep every night in

Russia are you actively seeking to get

out are you as has been reported looking

for asylum

elsewhere well this is not an actively

seeking this is not a new thing and this

is important history especially for

those people who don't like me for those

people who doubt me who have heard

terrible things about me it was never my

intention to end up in Russia I was

going to Latin America and my final

destination was hopefully going to be

Ecuador when the United States

government heard that I had left Hong

Kong where I met the journalists they

canceled my passport they gave press

conferences about it which meant I

wasn't allowed to board my ongoing

flight which was going to take me

that's a Latin America rather than

applying for Russian asylum rather than

saying I'll play ball with any Russian

intelligence service just please protect

me I said no I will not cooperate with

the Russian government or any government

instead what I did as I was trapped for

40 days in an airport I don't know a

year longest layover is but 40 days was

was a tough stint I applied for asylum

in 27 different countries around the

world

traditional US allies places like France

and Germany places like Norway that I

felt the US government

and the American public could be

comfortable that was fine for

whistleblower being and yet every time

one of these governments got close to

opening their doors the phone would ring

and they're in their Foreign Ministries

and on the other end of the line would

be a very senior American official it

was one of two people then Secretary of

State John Kerry or then Vice President

Joe Biden and they would say look we

don't care what the law is we don't care

if you can do this or not we understand

the protecting whistleblowers and

granting asylum as a matter of Human

Rights and you could do this if you want

to but if you protect this man if you

let this guy out of Russia there will be

consequences we're not gonna say what

they're what they're gonna be but there

will be a response I continue to this

day to say look if the United States

government if these countries are

willing to open the door that is not a

hostile act that is the act of the front

of a friend

if anything if the United States

government is so concerned about Russia

right shouldn't they be happy for me to

leave and yet we see they're trying so

hard to prevent me from leaving I would

ask you why is that

I'm guessing Joe Biden is not your

candidate for 2020 actually I don't take

a position on the 2020 race look it's a

difficult position being in the

executive branch it's a difficult

position being in power and you have to

make unpopular decisions I would like to

think having seen now in 2019 that all

of the allegations against me did not

come true national security was not

harmed as a result of these disclosures

but they did win the Pulitzer Prize for

public service journalism the laws were

changed as a result the courts said

these programs were unconstitutional we

live in a safer and more secure world

because the Internet is safer and more

secure as a result of understanding

these common vulnerabilities which not

just US intelligence agencies we're

exploiting but our adversaries were

exploiting one

close these holes we do not become more

vulnerable we become more secure in 2013

it's fair to say some of these officials

some of these candidates grow well the

intelligence services are saying this

guy's dangerous they're saying this is a

risk they're saying this shouldn't have

happened in 2019 we can see that no

evidence has ever been presented that

the public understanding mass

surveillance is real has caused any kind

of harm whatsoever no one has died no

terrorist attacks have succeeded because

we knew about this stuff these programs

work regardless of whether or not you

know about them but we have seen the

public benefits substantiated year after

year after year and so I'd like to think

these people would reevaluate their

position you know there are government

officials who would push back very

strong on your assertion that national

security was not harmed you do you chose

not to stop with your revelations at

what was being done to Americans and you

got into America and its allies and

perceived enemies when we're looking at

the reports that were published in 2013

it's important to understand I never

published a single story the number of

documents that I revealed is zero what I

did was I collected an archive of

material showing criminality or

unethical or unconstitutional behavior

on the part of the United States

government I provided this archive to

journalists who were required as a

condition of access to this material not

to publish any story because it's

interesting they could publish no story

simply because it's newsworthy they were

only allowed as so far as the agreement

went to publish stories that they were

willing to stand up and say we're in the

public interest to know and this is not

some crazy fly-by-night organization

these are newspapers like the Washington

Post like the New York Times like the

Guardian and in every case this process

was followed now as an extraordinary

check

on top of this in case I went too far in

case I collected a document that was too

hot or I misunderstood things or the

jernt the journalists misunderstood

things the journalists were further

required to go to the government in

advance of publication and they were

required to do this at my request and

warned the government this is the story

that we're gonna run this is what it's

about

this is what we're gonna say so the

government could argue against it to

create an adversarial check on what the

journalists and I were trying to do to

reconstruct the system of checks and

balances in the United States that hid

itself failed in the government you know

because that process was followed so

scrupulously that's why I am so

confident that no harm happened no harm

occurred now if there are those in the

government that say harm took place if

there are those in the government who

say people have died I ask you this why

haven't they proved it you know better

than anyone Brian that these government

officials are more than happy to pick up

a phone and make a leak to the New York

Times every day of the week I

if they had some evidence that somebody

was hurt if they had evidence that a

terrorist attack got through because of

this journalism it would be in the front

page of every newspaper in the world and

despite six years of history that's

never happened describe your life today

what is every day like how are you

supporting yourself and and as a simple

equation if the Russians have reached so

effectively into our lives and our

electoral systems they must be all over

your life so that was several different

questions but yeah I'm sure the Russian

government is trying to spy on me I'm

sure the United States government is

trying to spy on me everyone's trying to

spy on me

the thing is I don't cooperate with them

my allegiance is to my country my

allegiance is to my Constitution now in

my terms of my daily life it's actually

pretty ordinary Oh which is to say it's

not so interesting

I've always been something of an indoor

cat

right among nightclubs and partying my

life since I was a child has always been

mediated by a screen that's my choice so

not much actually changes in my

day-to-day whether I'm living in New

York or Berlin or Moscow in terms of my

work which a lot of people are curious

about this I think is a polite way of

people asking do you work for the

Russian government do you accept money

from the Russian government you know are

you living in Russian government housing

are you in a bunker are there guards and

of course the answer to all of these is

no no I'm not what I do for a living is

speak professionally and now I'm

actually an author I have a speaker's

bureau it's called the American program

Bureau and you can call them and you can

book a public event I speak at

universities I speak at corporate events

I speak at cybersecurity conferences to

talk to people about what is happening

on the internet what is the future of

surveillance and how can we protect

ourselves I'm very fortunate to have had

that opportunity and it's meant that

I've had a quite comfortable life and in

quite a difficult position the former

White House aide HR Haldeman left us

with an expression for the ages and when

he said you can't put the toothpaste

back in the tube for Americans who feel

that that this is just a behemoth that

they could there's no way they could

have any control over it for Americans

who long ago decided we're just going to

have to live with this surveillance how

could it possibly be receded or

rescinded or stopped we can stop a

program we can thwart an attack we can

make a device more secure but as you

imply the system is still better the

institutions and agencies and companies

that produced these attacks that are

creating new methods of spying every day

will still be there the fundamental

change

not just in the United States but around

the world that has to happen is we have

to stop thinking about the limitations

on how data is used as data protection

regulations right now when we talk about

what Google and Facebook are doing right

now when we talk about what the NSA is

doing right now when we talk about what

rival governments are doing what the

Russians are doing what the Chinese are

doing what the North Koreans and the

Iranians are doing we're constantly

thinking about all right this data has

been collected and these companies have

it how do we regulate their use

regulating the use is a mistake we

should do that but that's the wrong

focus it is the collection of data that

is a problem when you start trying to

regulate use you're going to the

collection has already happened the

collection was already legal one of the

fundamental flaws in u.s. privacy

legislation is the fact that we are one

of the only advanced democracies in the

world that does not have any basic

privacy law whatsoever we have the

Fourth Amendment of the Constitution

which is the reason that I came forward

but that restricts what the federal

government can do that restricts what

the state governments can do it doesn't

restrict what companies can do and as

you know as everybody knows these

companies are playing a bigger and

bigger part in the world today we have

to say all of these records that they're

creating about all of us all this

control that they're developing from

these surveillance programs whether

they're saying they're doing it for

targeting advertisements or whether

they're doing it for targeting killings

these records belong to the people that

they are about not to the companies and

this is a fundamental change that we

have never discussed in a meaningful way

broadly and publicly but we have to

because all of these governments have

said you know the the mass surveillance

system why do we have it why is it

useful they say because of terrorism

they say it's saving lives they save its

oppressive anting attacks but no less

than Barack Obama

and the response to the 2013 revelations

created two independent Commission's to

investigate exactly the answer to that

question were these programs effective

in stopping terrorist attacks did these

revelations cause harm to national

security it was called the privacy and

civil liberties oversight board and the

president's review group on intelligence

and communications technologies and

despite having an enormous budget

despite having complete access to

classified information despite the fact

that they interviewed the heads of the

FBI the NSA the CIA you know the full

alphabet soup they found in the

government's own words the kind of mass

surveillance that's represented by this

bulk collection program where the NSA

was secretly collecting the phone

records of every American and everybody

else around the world every day under an

authority provided by a secret court

order that nobody even knew existed that

program had never made their own words a

concrete difference in a single

counterterrorism investigation think

about that more than 10 years of

operation and secret never made a single

concrete difference these programs mass

surveillance is not about public safety

it is not about terrorism it is about

power

it is about economic espionage it is

about diplomatic manipulation and it is

about social influence it is about

understanding the actions of everyone in

the world as carefully as they can no

matter who they are no matter how

innocent their life final question has

to do with the Fourth Amendment we have

it today because mr. Adams and others

wanted to keep the British out of their

homes and their horse carriages what

would mr. Adams and the founders make of

the reach of the government in your view

into our lives given its humble

beginnings

I think if any of the founders of this

country looked around today they would

be shocked by the kind of rhetoric they

hear and they would be shocked by the

kind of activities of government they

see if you read the Bill of Rights

something that struck me when I was

writing about it and in this book was

that fully half of the first ten

amendments are explicitly making the

work of government harder they're making

life for law enforcement officials

harder and all of the founding fathers

thought that was a good idea because

they recognized the more efficient a

government is the more dangerous it is

we want a government always that is not

too efficient we want a government

always that is just efficient enough

because government holds extraordinary

power in our lives we want government

always to be using their powers in a way

that is only necessary and proportionate

to the threat presented by whoever it is

that they're investigating when the

government is getting by by the skin of

their teeth the people are free right

the government should be afraid of the

people people shouldn't be afraid of the

government one of the ironies about the

founding fathers for those who are

skeptical of me which is fair again I

don't want you to trust me and I want

you to doubt me I want you to question

me but I want you to look at the facts I

want you to look beyond how you feel in

the moment how we all feel in the moment

and see what these stories said in 2013

see that the courts of the United States

where I'm being charged as a criminal

said that the government itself was

engaged in criminal activity look at

these things and then remember the

people who founded this country were

called traitors the signing the writing

of the Declaration of Independence was

an outrageous act of treason it was

criminal but it was also right the

question whether or not I broke the law

is less difficult

and less interesting than whether you

think what I did was right or wrong what

is legal is not always the same as what

is more final prediction then we'll let

you go nightclubbing

and that is do you predict do you

predict you will at some point live out

your life and die in the United States I

think I will return when we look at the

kind of things that we're being said

about me in 2013 the kind of hostility I

face the kind of accusations I faced

from the most senior officials in

government and we look at the world

today yes there are many still who don't

like me but far far fewer because we

have seen that all the harms that they

alleged over the course of these years

never came to pass

they were never substantiated because

they don't exist but the benefits are

becoming more clear with each passing

year the question that I think people

have to answer whether you like me as

person or not right whether you agree

with how I did what I did whether you

agree with the work of the journalists

who decided what the public should know

in order to cast their votes today you

know the government broke the law today

you know the United States government

had broken that violated the

Constitution and the rights of people in

this country and around the world would

you rather not know thank you and

Snowden thank you very much good luck
