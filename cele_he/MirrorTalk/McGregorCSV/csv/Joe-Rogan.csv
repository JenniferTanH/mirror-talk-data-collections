Interviewer,"Conor, the fight obviously stopped in a horrible way. Give us your thoughts on how it was going."
McGregor,"I was boxing the bleedin' head off him and kicking the bleedin' leg off him. Usual shite,  dived to close the distance. THIS IS NOT OVER! If I have to take this outside with him, it's on outside. I don't give a bollocks."
Interviewer,He said that he believes that one of the kicks he checked broke your leg.
McGregor,"There was NO CHECK! There was not one of them was checked. Your wife is in my DMs! Hey baby, hit me back up. I'll chat to you later on! I'll be at your after-party. The Wynn nightclub. You look in bits, ya little ho! F*** him!"
Interviewer,"Conor, you missed with a punch and stepped back. Tell us what you felt. Tell us what you thought was going on?"
McGregor,"Just, the thing had separated and I bleedin' landed on the wonky leg, like Anderson Silva that time. Something similar to that. It's a fucking mad old business. F*** sake!"
Interviewer,"Listen, it was a wild fight, for as long as it lasted. I'm sure you'll be back and I'm sure you're going to want Dustin again. And I'm sure he'll oblige you."
Interviewer,What do you think about Jake Paul and the boxing match? Who do you got?
McGregor,"I don't really care, to be honest."
