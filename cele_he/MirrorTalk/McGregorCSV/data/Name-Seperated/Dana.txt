Dana White: What’s up Los Angeles! Ladies and gentlemen, the reigning and defending 155lb champion of the UFC, ‘The Notorious’ Conor McGregor.

Conor McGregor: Baby, we did it. I couldn’t hear anything those motherf***ers said, thank f***. This boxing press conference is a completely different set up to what we’re used to, but 20,000 people, it’s mind-blowing. I’m absolutely honoured to be here before you, to give you this great spectacle. And somebody’s 0 has got to go!
