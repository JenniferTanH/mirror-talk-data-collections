Interviewer,You look focused and pretty happy. Have you calmed down?
Eminem,"I'm on probation now, so I don't have a choice. But I probably would've done it anyways, perhaps it was a blessing in disguise. I'm growing up, and I figure there's a certain level of maturity that comes with that.  Hailie is better at this than I am. You know, when you build a booger castle with your daughter, that's quality time. It's actually what we live in now, and we built it ourselves."
Interviewer,"You wrote this album during an insane year, lawsuits, divorce, the threat of jail time. Tell me about the early stages of the album."
Eminem,"""Sing for the Moment"" was the first song I wrote for the album; ""Cleanin Out My Closet"" was the second. I had the line in ""Cleanin Out My Closet"", ""I'd like to welcome y'all out to The Eminem Show"", and it was just a line, but I sat back and I was like, ""My life is really like a fucking show."" I have songs on the album that I wrote when I was in that shit last year, with a possible jail sentence hangin' over my head and all the emotions going through the divorce. I went through a lot of shit last year that I resolved at the same time, all in the same year. And, yeah, that's when half of the album was wrote."
Interviewer,"""Dream On"" was a desperate, hopeful song when Aerosmith wrote it. Is that why you used it?"
Eminem,"Yeah. I was in that shit, and I didn't know what was going to happen to me, I thought I was goin' to jail. But the scariest thought was, ""How am I going to tell this to Hailie?"" What am I going to say, ""Daddy's goin' away and he's bad, and you have to come visit him in jail""? I never told her anything, because if there was a slim chance that I'd get off, then I didn't want to put her through that emotionally, being scared. She hates when I go away, anytime. ""Sing for the Moment"" is that frustration and all that shit. There I was, in the fucking precinct getting booked, and the cops were asking me for autographs while they were fucking booking me, and I'm doing it, I'm giving them the autographs. But I'm like, ""My life is in fucking shambles right now, and you look at me like I am not a fucking person. I am a walking spectacle."" I signed it. ""They're the police, and I'm sure that if Marshall is a good guy, word will get around, so OK, fuck it, lemme do it.""."
Interviewer,"OK, yeah, I'm a criminal and I did a couple of things that I shouldn'a did, but I'm still a human, and people make mistakes. I didn't do anything different than any other person would have done that night . Some people would have done more than me, but I don't know of a man on this fuckin' earth that would have done less, not to say exactly what I did."
Eminem,"You always talk about your daughter, Hailie Jade, in your songs, but on this album, ""Hailie's Song"" is a much more personal message. Plus, you sing, that is certainly putting yourself out there."
Interviewer,"That song was stress off my chest. That's how it is with every song I do; it's therapy and it's releasing everything onto a record instead of doing any of it. I really dumped my feelings out in that song. I love my little girl enough to sing to her, for one, and two, it wasn't easy what I went through last year. Divorce is the hardest thing that I've ever worked through, not that I'm bitter or anything like that. I'm a better person because I went through it, but it was hard at first. I've known this chick all my life, she's the first true girlfriend that I ever had. You grow up with this person, and then they want to leave you. And at first you don't know what to do. You know, I put the blame on everything. I put the blame on myself, I put the blame on my career. But as I got through it, I stepped back and looked at the whole picture. I realized it wasn't my fault and there's nothing I could have done. It was inevitable. It's cool, me and Kim are on speaking terms, we can communicate, no hard feelings, fuck it. Didn't work, you know, after eleven years."
Eminem,You've produced more tracks than ever on this album. Was that a result of having a home studio?
Interviewer,"Yeah. I actually know how to program a drum machine now. It used to be so simple, just writing lyrics and raps, laying vocals and leaving the studio was great. But now that I'm so into producing, it's a fucking job."
Eminem,"What comes first for you, the rhythm or the rhymes?"
Interviewer,"It's both. Sometimes I get a couple lines in my head, and the way they're going, I go downstairs and make a beat to that rhythm. That's why a lot of my drum patterns are crazy, offbeat patterns, because of the rhyme. Now more than ever I try to make my rap go right with the beat. I listen to my older shit, and I can't stand it, because I fell behind the beat too much. Like ""My Name Is"", I fucking hate that song anyways."
Eminem,You wouldn't be here without it.
Interviewer,"Yeah, I didn't hate that song when I first made it. But the shit that I really, really like, that I put my heart and soul into, I don't get recognized for, like ""The Way I Am."" There's a difference between me being funny and me being real. I feel like I don't get recognized for my best shit, the shit that's my real, true feelings and emotions."
Eminem,Those songs definitely scare the people who love the humor in your big singles.
Interviewer,"I was talking to Steven Tyler the other day. He was saying that if he has to make songs that appeal to everybody to get people to listen to his realer songs, that's what he'll do. My theory is the same. You gotta play the fucking game, man. One day I want people to look back on me, when my time is over, and say, ""He knew what the fuck he was doing."" If they say that now, too, that would be great. The ultimate thing is to be recognized for quality shit."
Eminem,"By now, do you know when you make a record that will sell well?"
Interviewer,"Failure has always been the biggest motivation to me, the fear of losing and somebody getting the last laugh on me. I've felt since my first day of rapping that my time is ticking. That's how I've based my whole career, that this may never happen again. The truth is, this could end tomorrow. I've seen so many albums get slept on. Pharcyde's first album should have been huge, that shit should have sold 6, 7, 8 million. Fans are so fickle and so quick to turn on you, too. Suddenly, you're not cool no more, you're like the Kris Kross jeans or something, even if at first you're the greatest thing since sliced cunt."
Eminem,"Now that you have joint custody of Hailie, you're spending more quality time with her. What's a typical day like?"
Interviewer,"When I'm home, I wake her up in the morning, I feed her some cereal, watch a little TV, take her to school and pick her up. Lately, I've been taking her to the studio, because that's where I spend most of my time. She has fun there, there's video games for her and stuff. Coloring books and crayons, thank God for those. We watch a lot of movies, just typical shit. She's real into The Powerpuff Girls and Hey Arnold! and Dora the Explorer, ever seen that one? It's the same episode all week long because it teaches kids numbers and how to speak Spanish. By Friday, you know it by heart. I watch that with her, then I go listen to my songs over and over. I'm gonna fucking jump off a bridge."
Eminem,"I try to keep Hailie sheltered from most of the bullshit. When September 11th happened, I didn't tell her that morning. I just didn't know how to explain it to her. I switched on the TV and saw the second plane hit. She was still sleeping. I got her up and took her to school, and within a couple of days she heard about it there. Those are things that I have trouble with, explaining to her all the fucked-up shit in the world. I try not to drive myself crazy with what to say if she asks me certain things. There's a few things that are going to be tough to deal with."
Interviewer,Some of your lyrics about her mother?
Eminem,"No. Kim is pregnant. I have no idea who the father is. I just know she's due any day. So Hailie is going to have a baby sister. It's going to be tough the day she asks me why her baby sister can't come over. I've tried to keep her sheltered from those issues. Of course, she's going to find out shit as she goes through life, but I really don't want her to learn all the fucked-up shit on my shift."
Interviewer,"But, you know, Hailie listens to my music, and I go back and forth with myself a lot about it. When I was six, music flew by my head. But I caught it if there was a swear word. If I have a song that has a lot of swear words in a row, I make her clean versions and play those in the car. I don't cuss around my daughter. If someone else is around and they say the f-word, she's heard it before; I don't say, ""Hey, watch your mouth around my daughter."" That would be ridiculous. After all, I'm Eminem, Mr. Potty-Mouth King. I try to be a liberal parent and be open about things. If somebody is smoking a joint in a movie and she asks, ""Daddy?"" I say it's a cigarette, a big cigarette if it's a Cheech and Chong movie. She doesn't know about drugs yet, and she's not old enough for me to explain that they're doing drugs and those are bad."
Eminem,Do you want more kids?
Interviewer,"Oh, no. No more kids for me. I'm cool. I'm chilling now. And no more marriage. I would rather fucking be on a coach flight with 'NSync at the back of the plane in the last row in them seats that don't go back, just stuck there with the bathroom out of order. I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again. I can't take what I went through last year. I don't ever want to experience that again."
Eminem,"You've said 8 Mile is not a film of your life, but there are many similarities."
Interviewer,"I don't play me in the movie. There are similarities because I sat down with Scott Silver, the script writer, and told him instances from my life that were used in the movie, some exactly the way they happened, some a little bit different. I play a guy named Jimmy who grows up in Detroit and tries to make it as a rapper. It's pre-Tupac's and Biggie's deaths; it's supposed to be '95. Now, it's a lot more acceptable for white people to do black music, black people to do white music. The barriers are more broken down."
Eminem,"On this album, you speak openly about being more successful because you are white."
Interviewer,"Oh, definitely. It's obvious to me that I sold double the records because I'm white. In my heart I truly believe I have a talent, but at the same time I'm not stupid. I know, when I first came out especially, being produced by Dre made it cool and acceptable for white kids to like me. In the suburbs, the white kids have to see black people liking you or they won't like you. You need that foundation of legitimacy. The Beastie Boys, they had respect from the hip-hop community, and that's what made them."
Eminem,Are you expecting as much criticism from the PTAs of the U.S.A. for this album?
Interviewer,"You put your shit out there for the world to see and to judge, and whoever agrees with you agrees with you. Even my most die-hard fans don't agree with everything I say. These are my views, this is how I see it. You may have your own opinion, but you may not get to project it to the world like I do. The fact of the matter is that kids ain't supposed to get it. It's got a parental-advisory sticker. Yes, of course, kids are gonna get the album. But it's cool. When I was thirteen, I got music I wasn't supposed to have, and look at me, I turned out fine!"
Eminem,Do you regret any of your past controversial statements?
Interviewer,"Sometimes you say things that sound really good at the time. And that's what ends up in the big print in the magazine. For example, ""I blow elephant cock"", that's bold letters on the front cover. EMINEM: I BLOW ELEPHANT COCK. And I do, just in everyday life, it's my routine in the morning."
Eminem,That will put a twist on all of the homophobia controversy tailing you. How did you feel about that then and now?
Interviewer,"I was ready for it. I knew there was something comin', I didn't know exactly what it was, but Dre was like, ""You better get ready, some shit is about to happen."" He went through it with N.W.A."
Eminem,What do you think of psychotherapy? A lot of people out there think you need it.
Interviewer,"I think it's bullshit. I don't need no shrink. My music is my shrink, you know? What are you gonna do, you gonna pay a guy to sit there and listen to your problems, and dump your heart out? Let the world do that. The world is my fuckin' therapist. I tell the world my problems, and that's it."
Eminem,What would have happened if you didn't get the chance to tell the world your problems?
Interviewer,"I would be either still workin' at that restaurant, Gilbert's Lodge, or I would have gone postal at Gilbert's Lodge."
Eminem,"Do you think society and fans are taking rap too seriously? You suggest that on a few of the new songs, ""Business,"" ""White America.""."
Interviewer,"Hip-hop as a whole is bigger than ever, and it just keeps getting bigger, just when you think it can't, kinda like my dick. I seen an interview with Tupac once, he was a huge influence on my life, where he said if you see a rose growing in concrete, you'll stop and look at it. It could be the most incredible thing you've ever seen, and instead of wondering how this rose grows from concrete, all you want to talk about is how the stem leans to the side and the petals are dried up. The fact that the rose is growing from concrete isn't enough to amaze you, you want to pick out all of the things that are wrong with it."
Eminem,"That's the truest statement in the world. Take this music for what it is. It's got some fucking cuss words in it. If you don't want to listen to it because of that, then don't. Live your happy fucking life, do whatever. Half of the shit I say and other rappers say, they might have done it, but they're not telling you to go out and do it. When Jay-Z said he used to push weight back in '88, he's not necessarily glamorizing it and telling you to do it. He's telling you that's what he did and that he turned his life into something positive."
Interviewer,So rappers aren't free to tell their stories without being blamed for glamorizing them.
Eminem,"All I'm saying is, if I say the word faggot on my album, it's taken as if I'm speaking directly to gay people and I'm homophobic and a bad influence on kids. But if you watch American Pie, the same word is in there, and that's cool with everyone. Why is it all right for them to say it, but if I say it on a record it's not OK?"
Interviewer,What haven't you done that you want to do professionally?
Eminem,"What's-her-name from American Pie, Shannon Elizabeth. Besides that? Take a break. I haven't had more than a two-day break. Even if I take a break, I'll start writing, and I can't control the thoughts. I wanna take a break, and then I get so fucking antsy. And I get frustrated if I get writer's block. That's my worst fear, that I'll wake up tomorrow and won't be able to write. That if there's not drama and negativity in my life, all my songs will be really wack and boring or something."
Interviewer,"You call out Moby on ""Without Me."" He loves media attention so much, I'm sure he's rejoicing that you noticed him."
Eminem,"Yeah. Last year at the Grammys, he was running his fucking mouth. He doesn't know me, so he should shut the fuck up. Nobody likes you, Moby, shut the fuck up. It got to the point last year where every TV show I saw, someone was asking his opinion of me. Who is this fucking guy to give his fucking opinion of me in the first place? What the fuck do you do? You now how people know you? You did a song with Gwen Stefani. You think people wanted to see you in the fucking video? No. I never would have said anything about that dude, but he was such an expert on me last year. He's never met me, so he should shut up. ""Wait, here's my theory, it's very important and you should care."" Um, I don't care. ""Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway, here goes, wake up.""."
Interviewer,"Since your divorce, you've been linked to a few famous ladies. I'm going to name names; just say true or false. First up, Kim Basinger, who plays your mom in 8 Mile."
Eminem,"No. I know how rumors start. If people see me out and with a celebrity of the female species, I'm fucking 'em. Lemme tell you, I wish I was fucking as many as the media have me fucking. I have a lot of respect for Kim Basinger, and I think that she's a really nice lady and she's beautiful, and that's all I'm gonna say. As far as us being together, it's untrue, not that I wouldn't."
Interviewer,"Next, Mariah Carey. You two were almost boyfriend-girlfriend, weren't you?"
Eminem,"There's truth to that. I don't want to say anything disrespectful because I respect her as a singer, but on the whole personal level, I'm not really feeling it. I just don't like her as a person. I gotta be honest; I learned a lesson from it: Don't believe the hype. I have respect for her, but she doesn't really have it all together. I'll just say that and that she's a beautiful woman."
Interviewer,"Last up, Baby Spice, Emma Bunton."
Eminem,"That's a known fact! Nah. I've only met one of the Spice Girls, Scary Spice, about three years ago. The funny thing is how off the media is about the women I've been with in the business. The people I do get with completely slip by them. But I'll never tell. I gotta be low-key. My white ass is on display quite a bit, so I gotta keep some shit personal."
Interviewer,So where are you the most honest?
Eminem,"In the songs. If you listen to them and don't take the words out of context, they'll tell you why I'm saying this or that. Why do I have to sit here and explain myself? Just listen to the fucking songs. They will tell you everything."
Interviewer,Dean guy slinger walks up to me said Gillman you got one of those CDs yeah and I kind of just tossed it to him.
Eminem,Right didn't think nothing of it i didn't know that Dean worked with Jimmy Iovine so he gave it to Jimmy.
Interviewer,Jimmy gave it to dre and not getting the call my buddy welcome to and on the  road hotboxing I'm Evan Britain and I'm Mike.
Eminem,Tyson and we got  eminem in the house shady in the house yeah you you got you got Marshall right now.
Interviewer,Jd's like this on yeah uh-huh yeah okay I'm so excited man if I start getting weird just stop me it's all good.
Eminem,We did good of the show okay yeah we get a little weird okay okay yeah no I I know we met at Kimmel and I didn't get a.
Interviewer,Chance to like really we can get a chance to talk you know I'm such a  huge fan I can't even like thank.
Eminem,You I can't even like I feel like a kid right now man like this is crazy I'm.
Interviewer,Emma i listen to your first album and i heard you talk about cus oh yeah yeah yeah man I've seen like pretty much.
Eminem,Every documentary every  every fight I've seen like everything that's available you know I'm saying like I'm.
Interviewer,Humbled right now i feel like i feel like a kid again why do you why did you become who you were why did I become who.
Eminem,I was um well i wanna do this you know um I just loved hip-hop growing up as a kid I just you know it was like like it.
Interviewer,Just it spoke to me more than any other music I had ever heard before you know from early like ice-t to.
Eminem,Fat boys and then ll cool j run dmc Beastie Boys and it just like I don't know it was like I did I didn't I didn't.
Interviewer,First first i was a fan of the music you know I'm saying before I even thought about rapping.
Eminem,Hello cool j was the one who made me like first start writing rhymes and I was like 12 13 maybe and it sucked you.
Interviewer,Know i wasn't good but like i had to keep practicing and practicing pressed I gave it up for a little while then I.
Eminem,Started again back when i was like 15 and started being able to kind of put songs together and then I just was like.
Interviewer,I'm starting to i was never really good at much else you know so I just I don't know once I found out I was decent it's.
Eminem,Something i just kind of focused and just you know went for it I was in the juvenile detention center and we heard.
Interviewer,The i'm not a rapper still i was it what the  was that yeah we heard on the streets in our.
Eminem,Neighborhood but we never thought it'd be on the radio yeah and it was on the radio we like what the hell with that we.
Interviewer,Just all blown away yeah music was being played on the radio yeah you know how about the fact that rapper's delight'.
Eminem,Was like a 7 7 some odd minute song yeah who had a radio pleaded they played it from top to bottom like it was so.
Interviewer,Popular off the hook mm-hmm and the nucleus jam on it yeah don't don't yeah I was like yeah I never really I.
Eminem,Never really like got into rock and roll or R&B or blues or anything like that I just like I you know I've listened to.
Interviewer,Songs on the radio or whatever my mom was listening to in the car but once hip-hop came along I just felt like man.
Eminem,This is like i don't know i just was all in yeah hip-hop was can't even imagine me he.
Interviewer,Gave you cried yeah but being like but the prototype of hip-hop at the beginning of it it gave us cried another.
Eminem,Our music people talk to it we talk with being on television being in the radio yeah yeah private yeah and it's a it's.
Interviewer,Also like it's just such a if you think about like how hip-hop from the start of it well I was there yeah and then it.
Eminem,Just like oh you thought in the front of every hip-hop club you got the  the hope of New York police station out.
Interviewer,In front of the club yeah it was just it was just and if you went to a hip-hop Club and you're marked it was hell yes.
Eminem,Even your neighbor you hardcore bebop hip-hop and that's what the  like that's.
Interviewer,What they said you  for but those those are.
Eminem,People all the criminals are thieves we all listen to hip-hop the money makers and everything the crew know the killer.
Interviewer,The robbers know all the  street urchins we all listen to that that's all we listen to and soon as we listen to we.
Eminem,Enjoy it but we're spot where we are surveying everything we're looking at the people with the jury to coach the.
Interviewer,Clothes and look and then we're getting ready to get them after the club is over that's just what hip I was about all the.
Eminem,While all the thieves were coming there they enjoy the music but afterwards oh but we gonna rob yeah that's the hip I.
Interviewer,Was about yeah once break-in came out the movie breaking and then Krush groove and beat Street man it was like yeah I.
Eminem,Just put it put the hole it put the whole culture of hip-hop on the map in an in an it in a place where you could.
Interviewer,See with the music and i'm saying you had the visual and you had UG you know graffiti like that's you must say this.
Eminem,Is my way out when you saw that i didn't get good you must say this is my way out when I started yeah when I started being.
Interviewer,Able to put songs together and i started like you know figuring out like well I might be almost as good as that rapper.
Eminem,You know i'm saying so i'm gonna keep going and then I start you know just I learned so much like I asked.
Interviewer,How old were you when that started hip-hop the first time I heard anything my uncle Ronnie brought over a tape of.
Eminem,Breaking the breaking soundtrack in a hat reckless on it from ice-t once upon a time a DJ's task was just a play what.
Interviewer,More could you ask and i was no couth cousin yeah yeah yeah colors was hard yeah my uncle Ronnie.
Eminem,Started liking rap before i did and then he kind of introduced me to it and right around that time I think yeah the movie.
Interviewer,Had just come out and i saw the movie and I was like yo this is I love it mmm and they just I don't know they just.
Eminem,Spoke to me and the way that no other music had spoke to me before understand hold Ryu and he first started putting it.
Interviewer,Out there like started rapping or doing rap battles well I had a weird trajectory like I I was afraid like I.
Eminem,Was afraid early on like 15 16 years old I was afraid that to go into any clubs or anything like that to say my raps.
Interviewer,Because i felt like i wasn't good enough yet so I had to get to a certain spot and then I was trying to like I was just.
Eminem,Making songs and uh one day i got a call from my boy proof and he was like yo you need to come up to the hip-hop shop and.
Interviewer,I was like what what is the hip-hop shop and he's like yo just come to the hip-hop shop write something come up.
Eminem,Here and proof like i'm a proofing ani here he ranch it in Detroit wewe like me and him came up together and we came up.
Interviewer,Together but he would kind of go do his own thing and then I I'd be working like a factories and stuff like that and.
Eminem,Proof was out there like on the grind and he started making connections and then he met J Dilla slum yeah slum.
Interviewer,Village and a lot of the early detroit hip-hop that was like exploding onto the scene like proof was.
Eminem,Such a part of that and i got a chance to when I went to the hip-hop shop I was like what the  he was like you know.
Interviewer,I'll clear everybody out i'll have like ten people right and you rap in front of them and if they don't like you you know.
Eminem,They're gonna tell you they don't like you if they if they do like you and they  with you in it you know so I went.
Interviewer,There i said to rap i got some people jumping around and  and I was like okay this might be it for me and then.
Eminem,That's when we start having battles at the hip-hop shop hmm we was having like a battle every couple months or.
Interviewer,Something yeah every every yeah two or three months but every Saturday I would make sure that I didn't have to work.

Interviewer,Well you're not chopped liver yourself I'm just saying what I'm saying no but I'm just saying man like like I I don't.
Eminem,Know it takes a lot to be the champion like it takes a lot and and you know I remember seeing the first like the first.
Interviewer,Couple fights when i was when i was younger when you were first like starting to really pop I had heard about.
Eminem,Yo you were seen this guy mike tyson man he's knocking  out in ten seconds late and the first fight I saw.
Interviewer,Was uh which was the first fighter so i think it was Trevor Burbank man you knocked him down three times with one.
Eminem,Punch like like what the  and ever since then it was like it was like when you fight somebody's getting knocked out.
Interviewer,It's just a matter of what round you know I'm saying it like they come from humble beginnings you know I have to had.
Eminem,In order to be the champ i'll have to add to get beaten a couple of times yeah learn yeah yeah boxing is hard man it's.
Interviewer,Hard like i've been boxing for like 13 years just sparring just messing around I mess around with Emanuel Steward.

Eminem,Everything all it is is a stage and you just walk out on that stage and say your words to him.
Interviewer, hip-hop hasn't really been around long enough to know how long somebody can.
Eminem,Actually go for  .
Interviewer,When the album first came out music to be murdered by and I was like okay sometimes I like to trip off people's.
Eminem,Reactions and and i didn't get the young ma line when she was like you can lead this earth I'm in rake mode.
Interviewer,Why is it richer than you leave this earth rake mode and it just flew over my head and I was like damn I didn't even get that mm-hmm and.
Eminem, like you reversal I will when you said that I got the John Wilkes this who I'm in the booth like a bruh I go ham for.
Interviewer, dead presidents I got the ham from a bruh ham like I got the a bruh but I didn't get a bruh like a bruh like I.
Eminem, missed that no I was like how did I miss that goddamn yeah I mean that's what happens.
Interviewer, like that Ohio scheme you did that was crazy and it took me like two listens to get to Cincinnati.
Eminem, yeah you know what I'm saying lying I was like wait a minute since then since anadi.
Interviewer, yeah oh sure this thing for address yeah I saw I saw some people got there and I was like kind of sometimes I don't know.
Eminem, if you ever be sitting around writing some in your life man nobody's gonna get this yeah and then you're.
Interviewer, like oh well let me just try it and see if anybody does like but that's that's the like that's kind of a beauty of.
Eminem, wordplay was like sometimes people ain't gonna get it the first list and they'll get it the second third fourth fifth.
Interviewer, listen it's gonna take a lot of lessons for the new one that you just drop music to be murdered by the line it's so many.
Eminem, lines in your phone what's up y'all sure man can crook it I'm live and dr. Dre's lab right now you.
Interviewer, know what I'm saying and um I could spend the whole episode giving you know props to the man across the road for me.
Eminem, you know his achievements are just incredible you know I mean um what are you doing worse he's oh you thought my.
Interviewer, meat yeah you're saying I got the homie in the house one of the greatest of all times Marshall Mathers thank you thank.
Eminem, you thank you for being here brah absolutely appreciate your time man um let's jump into it man let's talk about.
Interviewer, music to be murdered by Islam inspired by the 1958 release from Alfred Hitchcock with the same title what made.
Eminem, you do that well it was actually Dre had the sample like years ago right and he made a beat to it and one day just.
Interviewer, popped in my head I can't remember why so I hit him and I was like yo what did whatever happened to that beat and he.
Eminem, was like I was still around so but the beat was the beat was different I just updated a little bit with some drums and.
Interviewer, right but like that was but it was based off that that I started thinking like you know the whole concept is crazy.
Eminem,Like music to be murdered by like i wonder if I could play off this whole Alfred Hitchcock thing and and then Dre.
Interviewer,Started hitting me with ideas it was like yo you need to listen to this album that he has so he sent me a link to that.
Eminem,And i started listening you know i was like yo okay I could face this whole album off of that Wow there was actually.
Interviewer,Some stuff that didn't make it on there that I was trying to get on there but we couldn't really work it out with the.
Eminem,Sample clearing but i had it even more intertwine and it was and we wanted you know pick and choose the best pieces to.
Interviewer,Put on there just first sampling issues and but uh samples Yeah right.
Eminem,When i was stuck in traffic for like three hours listening to it over and over and over and I caught something new.
Interviewer,Every single time and it's like this is gonna it's gonna take you know to about twenty twenty-one or some for.
Eminem,Everybody really gets all of and i'm talking about avid fans yeah you know then like when you write in that type of.
Interviewer,On that level you know like you said you say you just put it in anyway even knowing that it could slip by people's.
Eminem,Radar yeah i feel like i feel like you know there's a certain there's a certain kind of fan it will get that and there's.
Interviewer,A certain kind of fan it might just be the average listener who doesn't you know they like hip-hop and and it sounds.
Eminem,Good something sounds good to them right but they might not understand exactly what we're doing how dope it is yeah but.
Interviewer,Well but but that's what's dope about those reaction videos and also the the people who break down the lyrics and.
Eminem,They show you like okay he was hitting these syllable schemes right here every single syllable there's five syllables.
Interviewer,There in hor seven right and he was hitting these right here and he started a new syllable scheme rhyme with that.
Eminem,Syllable scheme and then came back at the end and Ryan with the you know I'm saying I think that that helps people.
Interviewer,Like really understand the genius yeah it's only enough for one joint stopping the limo hop in the window shopping the.
Eminem,Demo gunpoint yeah the outer rhymes are two syllables the inner rhymes of five syllables yeah.
Interviewer,That's in my opinion what makes you want to do this a long time yeah but that's to me my opinion back to you because.
Eminem,When we did the what the was it my house like this is this mean Royce chuggabug this all the time we're.
Interviewer,Like crooks to me on the song alright but uh but we joke about that all the time cuz it's like you and him to me make verses that even if you.
Eminem, laid them first they're unstoppable so it's like I can only hope to tie mmm at best that's.
Interviewer, because we must be a compliment from you dying bro when you did in my house the lights out or utility.
Eminem, in the facility physical life out to wipeout I forgot the next scene but it would utilities in different like he was.
Interviewer, rhyming all that right like that was like and and and and being able to keep it going like that's what I think a.
Eminem, lot of a lot of the average listener sometimes might not understand that we did this you know because some people.
Interviewer, don't catch the syllables they think that were you know rhyming you know my house the lights out utilities in the.
Eminem, facility like house rhymes and out rhymes right they're not catching the full scheme yeah yeah they're not.
Interviewer, catching them my house lights out digital life spouts wipeouts like there's two there but then there's.
Eminem, utilities and the same thing it's like that's the that's the beauty to me of the craft of M scene is that that's.
Interviewer, important to you oh yeah yeah because it's it's and I know it's important to you because it's what makes rap fun.
Eminem, right right so sometimes we might not we might not have a we might we might be in the mood to like not even not to write a.
Interviewer, song that might not have a message to it why not really be saying anything that's important right but it's more about the.
Eminem, craft and we're just trying to go as hard as we can go you know and I think that that to me is what makes it fun.
Interviewer, right it's being able to you you know when you thought of it hey bruh I'll go ham for deaf prisoners.
Eminem, like you feel something right when you think of that your little that's come okay yeah yeah alright let me let.
Interviewer, me figure this out let's go down with this scheme and figure it out but that's that's to me man is beauty of uh of this.
Eminem, culture um younger make a lab come about I was very surprised to hear her on there you know me she's been doing.
Interviewer, damage yeah all around well he put out ooh yo she's dope that kind of started.
Eminem, following a little bit and then it was like I started watching every video she put out why and I was more so like.
Interviewer, intrigued by her persona like how like she just carries herself like a star right right like she's just like.
Eminem, charisma right right but she also had the bars and I was like man like this is like like she's really got bars like I.
Interviewer, was so then I I just went down the wormhole of like to eat freestyle she did right and then she did flex and how.
Eminem, she was just calm murdering it on flex right but she barely even raised her voice yeah like she was just calmly.
Interviewer, killing it I was like oh my gosh she's so I just reached out I was like you know I want to I want to put on an album.
Eminem, in like I'm gonna do something with her and hit her up and I was like yo I want I said I got just intro to the album and.
Interviewer, then I want you to be the first thing that people hear after that you know I'm saying like gave it up Ali oh yeah crazy.
Eminem, yes she just went in yes he murdered it is that what you do you go down a rabbit hole with different artists when you.
Interviewer, when you start liking them and you go down to Wormold kinda it's funny because I usually spend I mean this has been.
Eminem, this way for a while I usually spend like an entire Saturday if I'm not at work I'm not at studio I spend like an.
Interviewer, entire Saturday going through everything this out you know I'm saying like checking out.
Eminem, everything Wow yeah I hear that on Saturday so y'all better bring you our best never know who listening.

Eminem, I'm saying um how do L did that happen well I had been wanting to do something with him.
Interviewer, and I just never found the album or the song that I felt like would be good to get him on it was worth you know I'm.
Eminem, saying like this might be right up his leg jinan made the beat right so Royce put a verse on it and then q-tip had to.
Interviewer, hook and when I heard the hook I was like my my and I was like me him accounting from.
Eminem, the same era you know saying so this might work right so I just hit him up to Royce asked if he could send him the.
Interviewer, track right and he says help me magic yeah I'm a magic that was a collab that hip-hop has been waiting on for long yo.
Eminem, his Funk Flex freestyle was just like oh my god I'm in here for 10 minutes yeah crazy crazy.
Interviewer, would but again is what we love about this music right is because especially as a competitive rapper right we're apt.
Eminem, to be we're competitive rappers right we're not just like we're in it we do this this is what we do and it's like.
Interviewer, inspiring to hear that but it also like kind of gets you like yeah yeah like gives you anxiety right but.
Eminem, it's like but at the same time you kind of get pumped up about it and be like oh every time something new comes out.
Interviewer,Like that you're always like like my mindset is like you know I gotta try and top that right right right you know Sam.
Eminem,And then you go do it um first of all congratulations man ten number ones on Billboard 200 that's.
Interviewer,Already booked you know i'm saying i gotta put that out there man highlight how does that feel don't like you know.
Eminem,I'm saying did you ever imagine that you have ten number ones ever ever in the history of my life like I could never.

Eminem, like your love for the culture I mean is that like you know after a huge amount of success you know it would be easy for.
Interviewer, you to be a different type of person you know saying like what keeps you grounded I just think I mean I I'm so I'm so in.
Eminem, love with this artform right and I'm so passionate about it because it's really the only thing that I ever was good at.

Eminem,Didn't i think of that or you know damn I said something kind of like that but I don't say it like that and then it's.
Interviewer,Like okay i can't say that now because he already just said it you know what upset yeah that's always crazy man ah.
Eminem,It's a new era man like i always wanted to know like what's your perspective on people with longevity such just self.
Interviewer,Adjusting to the new era of hip-hop you know I'm saying yeah that's that's you know that's another one of the things.
Eminem,That make it fun too is like being able to watch like Cole and Kendrick come up and seeing how how great they were right.

Interviewer,Gonna get what what style what you don't I'm saying I don't know I can't predict right.
Eminem,A flow pattern i can't never do anything it's the same thing if I get on us getting on the track with Kendrick I can.
Interviewer,Never tell what the he's gonna do right cuz he is such a chameleon of styles and he can do any pretty.
Eminem,Much anything right any any so proficient at it he's so good at it and you don't know what you're gonna get.
Interviewer,That to me is like a top-tier lyricist because it's like you don't you can get your ass kicked any day you know I'm.
Eminem,Saying like certain rappers get on a certain song and it's like it just depends on ya just like you I mean you.
Interviewer,Probably inspire countless you know stupid bars when people know okay I got to get on a song with em you know I'm.
Eminem,Sayin i mean they just know you know i'm very surprised if you ever have done a song with every time I listen to a song.
Interviewer,That you've done with another artist it's always one of their best verses you see what I'm saying it's like you.
Eminem,Inspired them to push their pin like that you know I mean and that's got to be something to walk in the room and.
Interviewer,Just change the energy absolutely absolutely I mean but it's you know it's it's a.
Eminem,Craft that you know we've i don't know if I've mastered it yet but it's but I'm still trying to figure out like as.
Interviewer,Long as i've been in the game i'm always trying to figure out new flow patterns and you know I'm saying like new cadence.
Eminem,Isn't we're trying to still trying to always get it right you know cuz it's like I up make an album I don't always.
Interviewer,Get it right i don't get it always get every song right I don't always get every delivery right you know those one.
Eminem,Of the things i'm just always trying to improve you your toughest critic absolutely I mean you're probably yours.

Interviewer,Right i never said i wasn't a guest right like I'm absolutely a guest like I never said I wasn't right and I never.
Eminem,Said i was king of anything right like i had a song called Kings never die but it wasn't me saying that was one of the.
Interviewer,Beats that khalil sent me with the hook on it that was the concept but a song and I'm like I can't say I'm the king of.
Eminem,Hip-hop right right let's say so i threw Run DMC in there J and Master J you know saying like life and was trying to like.
Interviewer,Because i never want to be like i don't even for the king of hip-hop who the is.
Eminem,The king of hip-hop yeah like is there a king of hip-hop like I don't know like I feel you on that.
Interviewer,People would say people would say just because you sell the most records doesn't mean you're the best just.
Eminem,Because you can rap 40 million syllables doesn't mean you're the best like I care more about rhyming the.
Interviewer,Syllables mmm you know i'm saying like like I more about the craft than any of the other and then that shows you know.
Eminem,Sound like and it goes back to those who know you know I mean if you know you know and I just don't I don't get it.
Interviewer,Sometimes you know i mean i watch these rap media so-called critics and some music journalists and so many of your.
Eminem,Bars and your messages goes over their heads and you know they like even with the content conversation I mean you've.
Interviewer,Been having contests that's day one you got songs to prove it it's like sometimes I'm late what what is content.
Eminem,What are you wanting to talk about think about the first time you heard Rock him right so when people make these lists.
Interviewer,And he's always on the list mm-hmm but he's also always on my list because to me greatness is not only how well you do.
Eminem,Something but if you were the first to do it Rakim was the first person that I heard.
Interviewer,That started taking using like inside rhyme schemes right and coming back at the end and hitting that you know saying.
Eminem,So he did something that hadn't even been thought of yet original yeah it was like and he.
Interviewer,Single-handedly pushed the genre forward to be more complex lyrically and and then and birth Kane and G rap.
Eminem,Right right and man like I like those two will always be on my list too because like.
Interviewer,Kane was doing confused and lose abused and bruised the crews who choose to use my name wrong will pay dues oh man come.
Eminem,On nobody was doing that nobody that was every single word.
Interviewer,He said grind and he just made a sentence with it that made sense you know what I'm saying every person who's.
Eminem,A fan of hip hop might feel like hip hop is about something different hmm right it ain't about lyrics it's about how.
Interviewer,Good you you you flow in your cadence right right or it ain't like but it's it's or or it's just about the beat is.
Eminem,Dope and just having a message over it that could be what your opinion of what hip-hop is about my opinion is hip-hop.
Interviewer,Is about lyricism and the greats who we put up on the pedestal right that's what they were about and that was the the.
Eminem,Beauty of us being able to learn how to do it and learn from them right yeah do you ever agree with any of the top 50.
Interviewer,List they circulate on the internet have you seen one that you'd like oh yeah that's accurate I've seen a couple of.
Eminem,Them why feel like okay that's kind of accurate I'll never want to come off as preachy or be like you know you don't.
Interviewer,Understand what we do we're so much smarter than you no it's not about that but we do the craft and we do rap at a.
Eminem,Certain level where we know late game recognize game right right like you can appreciate Jordan because Jordan was.
Interviewer,Like a spectacle to see right it was just like holy right but I don't even know yes what he was doing.
Eminem,Just like mechanics if i hire somebody to fix my car I'm not gonna hire a painter my iron mechanic I'm Akay knows.
Interviewer,What he's doing under the hood yeah you know what I'm saying and I can't explain what he's doing and you can be like yo.
Eminem,That's the best mechanic i've ever seen right like I saw I saw what does it call my extra expert opinion with math Hoffa.
Interviewer,Right right right right and it was the episode where they were talking about the verse that I did on.
Eminem,The fat joke thing and i was like these are the guys these are the guys who if I was coming up like as a rapper or just a.
Interviewer,Fan of rap or whatever i would want to hear from them because they do this too right you know I'm saying so it's like.
Eminem,Game recognize game like like i don't know if if this guy is the best mechanic in the world oh you know what.
Interviewer,I'm saying it's not my thing but someone who is a mechanic might be like y'all this guy is he's the.
Eminem,Goat yeah exactly changing your muffler then we come and argue with that guy yeah no he's not.
Interviewer,Yeah go yeah again it's like you don't want to sound too preachy and be like you just oh you know we're so much.
Eminem,Smarter than you you don't understand what we're doing like it's not about it's not about that but it but at some.
Interviewer,Point it's just like i can't take your list seriously if they don't have you want it they don't have rice on it I.
Eminem,Can't take it serious i can't take it serious because it's like you don't you don't know really know what you're.
Interviewer,Talking about so i can't even get mad at I can't get mad at you I think that a lot of times when people make these.
Eminem,Lists they're mistaken the greatest rappers for their favorite rappers so what they mean to say is these are my.
Interviewer,Favorite rappers these are my personal favorites right right Jay nas they're always gonna be on that list.
Eminem,Right right you always gonna be on it on some peoples all right doc I've never seen a list without you on it well I.
Interviewer,Mean yeah yeah well you might not be where you deserve to be that's it that's in my opinion that's how I feel when.
Eminem,People don't put you and royce there because the longevity how good you guys have consistently been to be able to.
Interviewer,Keep it up to this level you know what I'm saying and like we're not youngins in this game you know I'm saying so it's.
Eminem,Like we've we put our time in but still even even to this day when I hear a new song by you or a new rhyme scheme I feel.
Interviewer,Like he's still he's still figuring this out like in other words you're you're trying you're trying to figure out a way.
Eminem,To make this verse better than anything you just did prior to it right one each verse is like that's how I feel when I listen to you I'm like oh he's.
Interviewer, still with different flow patterns you know I'm saying like look and cares about it and cares about it in.
Eminem, the pockets and like I don't never I don't ever know where your rhymes gonna fall out and I don't know how many.
Interviewer, syllables you're gonna hit but but that's the other thing is like when people are like we don't care about the.
Eminem, Super Bowls know that you know you need to because that's the craft of doing it yeah a CMC yeah it's up to.
Interviewer, you it's up to you like how you know whatever you whatever you feel you know but like I think that people are just.
Eminem, sometimes mistaken best emcees for their favorite rappers speaking of favorite rappers Trench stretch trench.
Interviewer, I don't see on a lot of lists either yeah that is infuriating to me because I think that again we was.
Eminem, talking about like Rock Emma did something that never been done and can't get something Angie rap did something.
Interviewer, had never been done Treach did do to me I think I think what happened with Treach and this is just in.
Eminem, my circle of friends that we talk about one of the common things said is well he did OPP and he did hip-hop a.
Interviewer,Rake right right but he was still rhyming his ass off on those songs right right but he also did something to me in.
Eminem,My opinion that like his there was a time period probably between 91 and about 95 where every damn near.
Interviewer,Every rapper in the game was true was following him right and trying to do what he was doing absolutely dressing.
Eminem,Like him you know you know i'm saying the whole the whole moving like him exactly.
Interviewer,And he was getting on songs and smoking everybody and it was like yo when I heard yoke the joke of my.
Eminem,Heart sank my heart saying cuz i was like I'm never gonna be this good wow I might as well quit I didn't write a.
Interviewer,Rhyme for the entire summer i said this on the ice-t documentary but this is real I didn't write for an entire.
Eminem,Summer and proof was like proof was like yo man he's good but you gotta keep yeah like you know what I'm saying right I.
Interviewer,Was just like but i'll never be that good by the time he got to wickedest man alive mmm I was like I quit I don't want.
Eminem,To do this anymore you got a favorite treasures I got a lot of fish my my when I heard him dude it when I heard him.
Interviewer,Yoked the joker when he was like oh fuzzy dirty dizzy does he get the fixing these women by blistery you ain't ready.
Eminem,For the freddie your rap he can't kill me I step into your dreams you feel me slicing your life away just like my mic.
Interviewer,Today i eat you the cycle where i'm ripping right away man he was kidding reg I there are there.
Eminem,Are some in this genre that have not even caught up to that all this time is past and and those verses are so.
Interviewer,Timeless to me right like you got people what we do talk to the bunny Sonny he's the man bugs the dog with the money.
Eminem,Funny that you should mention that's my family they're covered what's up to my cousins and my sisters.
Interviewer,That my warner brothers birds of a feather flock to fail to be together no matter what your whatever and never.
Eminem,Found who's better you mean he see them him those are others he's gifted us with one pluck initiate the trouble those who.
Interviewer,Disagree or maybe feel the need in front it show me your whole entire crew cashews and I'm a running on it maybe yo.
Eminem,Yeah i was just like goddamn yeah he was what he did was he did wordplay he did compound syllables multi-syllable.
Interviewer,Rhyming and he did it in different styles right he never had to listening to go back and listen that first album.
Eminem,He never did the same style twice hey i loved his image I loved what he was about he look cool you know I'm saying.
Interviewer,And you you he you believed him right he was believing he looked apart he acted the part he was the part right so that's.
Eminem,Why i think a lot of rappers just kind of started going and I did like with my writing in shape but it's time the.
Interviewer,Second album came out i sounded just like him mmm someone just like trench I sound like.
Eminem,Kuji rat like there's so many errors that I sounded like other rappers you know saying but like it that's what we.
Interviewer,Do more kids yeah we get if we get influenced you know I mean and we're inspired what you think about Royce.
Eminem,That's a producer man is that weird it's really weird it's really I told him yo years ago years ago when we first.
Interviewer,Met i was like yo i was like you should I said because the way he was picking his beats and like his ear form I was.
Eminem,Like yo why don't you just make beats cuz when I first started making beats and learn how to do it you can control.
Interviewer,What you make right so it's like making the song like lose yourself and sitting there from like the beginning of the.
Eminem,Like down to the end of a the completed song right like can make that trajectory go wherever you want it to go right both.
Interviewer,Of us were kind of so far still focused on rap right but he was like think he rather put his time into the pin but.
Eminem,Kept telling him like even years later like yo man I'm telling you you'd be good at it and he started doing this and then I didn't hear from him for.
Interviewer, a couple months and then he started like hitting me off with beats and I was like yo this is crazy.
Eminem, that's crazy did you go and learn one yeah and then I was like what the like bro huh how did you get this good.
Interviewer, this quick man but I you know amen yeah yeah uh same thing with me man I went over there he like I'm making Beast.

Interviewer, dope I went outside to smoke a cigar and I started thinking of a 16-bar rap yeah and I said I'm thinking of a rap to a.
Eminem, Royce beat yeah and I went back in there like yo I'm doing the new album with my little brother's family business you.
Interviewer, want to UM produce the whole thing he was like you think I'm ready for something like that I was like yeah I.
Eminem, think you ready let's get it you know understand and that's what we came over and played you yeah man oh man you just.
Interviewer, said lose yourself I went down the wormhole myself looking at your producer credits hmm you know I'm saying and I.
Eminem, talked to hip-hop fans every single day on Twitter you know that's one of the things I do I engage what am I asking.
Interviewer, questions rap questions do you feel like cuz I don't so do you feel like your name is mentioned enough in the.
Eminem, producers conversation no I don't know I'm kidding III don't I mean I don't know I I I love.
Interviewer, to make beats right and over the years I had learned how to produce and probably made some of my biggest songs right and.
Eminem, was just doing what felt right and I'm saying but but I'm more so like I it's fun for me to make beats but it's not as.
Interviewer, fun as rap is right right and I'm saying like so it's like but yeah I don't know I mean I I mean because people like.
Eminem, y'all rappers who make beats top five and I'm like yo you got to put him in there you know I'm saying and then some.
Interviewer, of them don't even realize how many songs that you have produced you know I mean and that they they know and love.
Eminem, the song they just didn't know that you produced it that's crazy to me I'm saying like that's crazy to me um I.
Interviewer, don't even understand how that even happens you know I mean like I think you rap so well that it kind of just sucks.
Eminem, all the oxygen out of the conversation hmm I mean it's it's it's interesting like the first album you know like I was.
Interviewer, sitting there with the bass Brothers and Jeff vast like played instruments right like he played the guitar he played the.
Eminem, bass he played the keyboards and all that I knew this music better than they did as far as like what did she.
Interviewer, sound like right I'm saying right so I would just sit in there on the drum machine and I had to have somebody show.
Eminem, me how to work it keep the metronome going and and uh what started coming out of those sessions and I've.
Interviewer, sometimes I'd be like like yo okay what was that chord okay try it what if he tried that now go up with it right and.
Eminem, then I hung them cuz I don't know how to play instruments so I'll be like I would just hum a lot of well you know and.
Interviewer, that's how I started making the beats and Dre was like yo you're producing that's producing.
Eminem, who knows like it is oh okay cool you know the saying like and just fell into you know yeah like it's funny like I was.
Interviewer, thinking the other day cleaning out my closet that's that beat was actually a beat I.
Eminem, was making for Bazaar really yeah and then I don't remember what happened but I ended up taking the beat and I was.
Interviewer, just like cuz sometimes if someone's there yeah like as I'm making the beat and they start wanting to write to it I.
Eminem, usually just give it to him and and I don't remember what happened with that but uh and they're just became the.
Interviewer, stadium mover yeah I'm saying like that's one of my favorite songs to watch you perform.
Eminem, really yeah I'm saying some of my early early was really rough like was really rough late but it was like a lot.
Interviewer, of times late and I in this from coming up in Detroit like proof had to connects right so proof used to know J Dilla.
Eminem, proof used to know everybody who was anybody right so and I don't remember that phase where like rap was going.
Interviewer, through a phase well I mean it still does it but just there was kind of a phase in like the mid late 90s where.
Eminem, like if you could get a chick to sing on your song right and you know I'm saying like an actual singer chick and proof.
Interviewer, would come over with new music and mandilars making the beats and he's got chicks all over his hooks and right.
Eminem, I'm like what the there's like so I would start like thinking of like hooks like that you know I'm saying and being.
Interviewer, like well someone else could sing this and I'll just lay it for right now for right now and then it ended up becoming.
Eminem, a thing where I was just like it I'll just leave it no I did good decision guardzilla man I gotta tell you.
Interviewer, that's one of my favorites right now I'm saying my favorites always changed when I listen to albums right now I'm.
Eminem, with Godzilla heavy every day all day you know that is crazy I mean the the.
Interviewer, cadences and all that like absolute murder the beat who did that beat da I said is crazy man oh all right Peter.
Eminem, juice world you know I mean that kid was amazing yeah you know on that when that joint favorites change it was out the.
Interviewer, juice to man like y'all he that kid was so talented man he like his freestyle he'd you know westward we're at for our.
Eminem, look what though funk and I mean he was like like I he might have been written mixing a little bit of written in there.
Interviewer, with but the way he was free stood like that's the that's the that we used to try to do at the hip hop shop was.
Eminem, like try to work on our free Styles right but be able to slip in and out of written when you need to you know I'm.
Interviewer, saying if you've got a certain punch line you want to get to to take her take out this dude right so it to be so young.
Eminem, he like mastered that so quickly yeah it's really sad man that like his potential was so off the charts very I.
Interviewer, tweeted one time you know I like this juice world kid and you know I got some real hardcore boom bap type hip-hop.
Eminem, lyricist fans that follow me to an airline juice whirl he uses auto-tune and I'm like yo I dropped a link to that.
Interviewer, Westwood freestyle like y'all don't even talk to me just watch this right you know I'm saying he definitely had it man.
Eminem, um it's crazy that some of these kids out here I think that inspired by you know you you know um J you know I'm.
Interviewer, saying and they want to really get that pan moving oh yeah I was gonna ask you do you have a favorite you have any.
Eminem, favors on a new joint oh my oh oh joy Oh every single one it's like ya know every single no I mean you know I.
Interviewer, it's funny when like you know when you're making an album and it's like you know sometimes you got ideas already.
Eminem, sometimes you feel like I don't know if you ever feel like this but it's like sometimes I just feel like I don't feel.
Interviewer, like having a message in this one you know I just want to go is hardly as I can you know and then sometimes.
Eminem, like you know I'll get in a certain mood and be like okay like if there's something that I'm passionate about like.
Interviewer, this is making me either angry or excited or whatever it is right you know I might get the idea to do a song about.
Eminem, it like darkness song like when I want to say something when I feel like I really has something to say I'm gonna do.
Interviewer, it the darkness joint did you ever feel like you might get some kind of backlash.
Eminem, from all this gun politics um you know the right side saying they want to take your guns left side saying you know we.
Interviewer, need more gun control did you feel like you would get any backlash from you know I mean I figured I would get some but.
Eminem, it's kind of like you gotta just I'm more so care about what I believe in right and whoever else gets.
Interviewer, pissed off people like that's this is this is my view on it and this is my take it might not be your take so what.
Eminem, about the person who is stockpiling his house with a hundred and fifty guns.
Interviewer, right like what whatever war they're waiting for I don't know what were you waiting for it you need that kind of.
Eminem, Arsenal I think there's also something to be said I know there's avid gun collectors and like that but.
Interviewer, there's something to be said about somebody who's buying that many guns I just don't have a record of it or.
Eminem, you know like there's I'm not on record as having a you know where I'm able to get flagged right so it's like the the.
Interviewer, whole message of that song was saying what about the person that it's the that hasn't you know I'm saying is the first.
Eminem, is gonna be the first time they flip out in the Arsenal to do it with yeah what about that guy yeah there's no stopping.
Interviewer, that guy right and that's what is when it's like okay when you when you start calling for like background checks and.
Eminem, like that instead of the actual problem right you know we got to do something with the gun laws yeah people.
Interviewer,Start to get like no you can't take our guns you can't take our guns I'm not saying that so when you talk about.
Eminem,Things like that i would say that that's content I probably would say that your critics would say that you just rap.
Interviewer,About rapid hmm i just put words together they just run that's what I do unless it is crazy man but to me again.
Eminem,Yeah you got damn right that's what i do like a competitive rap like and sometimes I just want to have fun with.
Interviewer,It sometimes i just want to make a song that might not be about right but for those who can respect how hard I.
Eminem,Push the pen right like you know you get pillows so what you do you can you can wrap that mini you can say that many.
Interviewer,Words that fast you're not saying anything you're not saying yeah it want me to say it takes a skill level to do.
Eminem,That and i feel like they're not respecting that part of the game you know what I'm saying it takes a it takes.
Interviewer,A phenomenal skill level to rap at the speeds that you wrap at syllables within those you know I'm saying it's not like.
Eminem,You like then i'm over here then i'm over there then I'm over here then I'm over there you know some people fool.
Interviewer,People yeah i mean they're just gonna flow in that I'm gonna buzz it down then I'm gonna buddy's like oh you're.
Eminem,Saying like you actually are putting you know syllables punchlines metaphors within that you know cadence.
Interviewer,And people are i just think a lot of times when a rapper says oh he's just rapping about rapping or he's too rapid.
Eminem,E-wrap it usually comes from a rapper who can't rap that well a lot of people diss what they can't do.
Interviewer,Hmm so it's like if i can't do that i'm gonna just I'm just gonna sit on it yeah I'm gonna sit on it and make it like it.
Eminem,Ain't that good anyways right and then people buy the narrative yeah yep and then you know it might maybe it makes.
Interviewer,The person feel good with whatever is going on inside them I saw some dude I don't remember where I even seen this.
Eminem,What show it wasn't like what site it was on or whatever some dude was trying to trash Jake Jake oh about middle child.
Interviewer,And was saying oh i just fell off at the end it was like and I'm like what the are you talking about like I can't take you serious you could take that.
Eminem, right right and then it's like sometimes you'll be like yo would you listen to that and.
Interviewer, then you say this is trash like that that I I can't respect your opinion I can't yeah they're probably the ones.
Eminem, responsible for these top 50 list that go around like people like that we all know saying yeah I mean I mean I know.
Interviewer, it's your opinion but your opinions wrong for sure yeah 100 speaking of top list dog is your top.
Eminem, nine that you named on till I collapse still the same yes and no yes because well what's happened since then is like.
Interviewer, you know I'm saying it's coming from a place of experience we know what it takes basically like you just said um.
Eminem, then why didn't I think of that every time yeah I'm saying like the rapper that makes you go fall ah yeah well you.
Interviewer, know it was right there damn yes like sometimes it could be an easy line and you'd like that line is it it seems easy.
Eminem, to think of but it wasn't the arms in and it was like why did it that this is what I do for a living how come.
Interviewer, I missed that line you know they're saying like I hear that a lot yo you know what I want to mention.
Eminem, too I just thought about this when I got this is funny pun intended when I got for the your booty is.
Interviewer,Heavy-duty like diarrhea yeah a lot of for that line right pun intended but it's like wait Oh manage its trash yours Trish I'm just being stupid like.
Eminem, it's sometimes you ever think of a punchline is like it's just supposed to be stupid right that's supposed to be.
Interviewer, it's a stupid line and sometimes I throw those in there too just like just to get a reaction out of people to.
Eminem, get a laugh whatever it is you know I'm saying it ain't that serious but it's like oh man he sucks cuz he said like.
Interviewer, yeah they pick out one thing oh yeah because and that just let you know how good you are because they'll go through.

Interviewer, sometimes you do things in the end it's like it fits in the rhyme scheme so you're like right like we was talking.
Eminem, about people who push the boundaries and like like red man to me like you're not like when it seemed like it was a time.
Interviewer, in hip-hop where and this was like to me it was like the late 80s early 90s where every time a rapper came out with a new.
Eminem, album they would have best rapper for a minute I'm saying like like Boogie Down.
Interviewer, Productions when by all means necessary love criminal minded but by all means necessary he was like the pinnacle of.
Eminem, like rap at that point in time was like what the like and Redman came out was so good right and then like when NAS.
Interviewer, drop right maduk it was like this is as good as it gets right like this you can't get any better.
Eminem, like that was incredible and then Biggie and then to me Redman when he made Muddy Waters I was like yelling at that that.
Interviewer, that was like that was like when he in my opinion just pulled ahead of everybody he just shot ahead like he was.
Eminem, like like the way he man the way he was I can't even think of him yeah he absolutely smashed that even when I.
Interviewer,First heard him on when i first heard him to do the headbangers first the headbangers what the headbangers and I.
Eminem,Was like yo just doing here yeah it's fire who was this guy you know saying oh yeah what the album is so classic to me so classic to me because.
Interviewer, not only was he rapping so good but it was like his beats and everything he's making good songs right right like that.
Eminem, first album he just came out the gate making great songs and again in the image everything you know I'm saying.
Interviewer, like it was cool to be read man like to want to be read man like it was like that's read.
Eminem, man is just cool you don't say like that man was the oh it still is you can still go and that's what I.
Interviewer, like I love you when when the guys from that era still just they just never lose it yeah because you can tell.
Eminem, he loves it that's what it takes hello yep yo let me ask you man were you ever a fan of Kobe absolutely I mean who.
Interviewer, wasn't like I don't know how you could not be I can't even like that it makes me sick man it makes me really like sick.
Eminem, to my stomach to even try to grasp what happened like yeah me too million nine people man nine people many people that.
Interviewer, really shook the world you know I'm saying and I read and I asked you that too because I feel like great people.
Eminem, have a lot in common I feel like you have you know what he had that killer instinct when you going.
Interviewer, to booth that work ethic if he's showing up two hours before everybody else working on a shot I've seen you in a.
Eminem, studio you know working on a hook that you know getting it down to the last molecule in that.
Interviewer, you know what i'm saying like just making sure that that is right man your work ethic is incredible thank you.
Eminem,Is that something that you developed over the years I did mike is that something like hanging around working.
Interviewer,With dr. dre like when did you develop this this work ethic that's just like robotic almost I mean that was before I.
Eminem,Even got son was that you know i'm saying like like me you know me and Dan I knew cuz denial was like me and me and.
Interviewer,Him were so close like got really close really quick right just because of the things that we had in common and.
Eminem,Everything right so we kind of just felt like we don't have nothing you know I'm saying like it's it.
Interviewer,Was a do-or-die situation like because i there was nothing else I knew how to do I'm saying so it was like a lot of times.
Eminem,Like we used to have to we used to go to this place called mo masters I'm just gonna mow master studio and it would be.
Interviewer,Like you know ten dollars an hour something like that and so we'd have an hour basically what to get so so then I.
Eminem,Make like we made sure we had to beat I had the lyrics written and I already knew this on my heart go in.
Interviewer,There you know saying but but it's like once I got a chance to once Dre you know gave me that shot look I was like I.
Eminem,Can't there's no turning back like i can't you know I'm saying like right all I needed was like that and yeah man.
Interviewer,And plus i watched dre do it like that dude like still to this day is constantly lives in the studio cuz he.
Eminem,Loves it right right that's why we do it because one of it I like to before I close I like to give some sort of gym.
Interviewer,Get the guest to give some sort of gym to like a up-and-coming artist s that's trying to make it like you know I'm.
Eminem,Saying you just described a picture of you having to memorize your raps before you go to the studio looking at the.
Interviewer,Clock on the wall no i only have so much time in there I gotta get it all out yeah I mean it's a real grind I.
Eminem,Think sometimes the other coming artists look at people's results and they don't understand the work that it took to get.
Interviewer,There yeah what would you say man to kind of inspire some young artists like what do they what do they need to do in.
Eminem,Your opinion well i mean times are different right so we got like the kids you can make a studio quality.
Interviewer,Album on your laptop basically you know I'm saying so based off that it's like what I would say to the up-and-coming.
Eminem,Like you know any new up-and-coming rapper I would say that it is hard to get it.
Interviewer,And it's even harder to maintain hmm right so it's like his hardest I worked back then you know when you've made.
Eminem,Thousands of songs and you're like what the am I gonna rap about that I haven't already you know I'm saying like.
Interviewer,And you start once you like you you start out with a blank canvas and then you painted everywhere on that.
Eminem,There ain't no you know i'm saying like so I that's it's one of the things that I do it because I love it.
Interviewer,So i put in overtime i don't it doesn't bother me you know saying like it's fun for me to do that so I would say that if.
Eminem,This is something you're passionate about just give it everything give it everything you know I'm saying like you.
Interviewer,Have nothing else there's nothing else you if this is what you want it's got to be what you want more than anything else.
Eminem,In this world right whether it's whatever it is like if it's a sport if it's a you know this sport you.
Interviewer,Know it's jewelry time that's what i say every time uh man dog I like to thank you man for giving me so many time a lot.
Eminem,Of your time actually man absolutely but yo I watch Chris corner I watch it all the time it's dope to me.
Interviewer,Because like i a rapper of your caliber to do something like this is just a it's such a good concept because you're an.
Eminem,Expert in this field you know i'm saying I appreciate and I think that everyone needs to know that who doesn't already.
Interviewer,You know you shame that brought so many as hard as you go with the pain men like I'm telling you this is top-notch top-tier lyricist you Royce man it's.
Eminem, like like it's it's it's a I feel like it's great that I know you guys man cuz it's it's also like it's it's kept me.
Interviewer, over the years to push my pen in to keep going right cuz it's like likewise my brother music to murder to be murdered.
Eminem, by out now everybody go get it three or four times yeah I'm saying streaming the out.
Interviewer, that you know me and I'm on track 19 get you a rap media host that could do both yeah thank you.
Eminem, guys I really appreciate you man absolutely much more success to you my brother absolute core nur we out of here.
Interviewer,  .
Interviewer,"Welcome back to Radio One, Maida Vale studio 4 here we are. Part of the reason we're here obviously because its the BBC but also because we have Studio 3 around the corner and you've got the band set up and going to perform some songs as well."
Eminem,"It's super exciting to be here. I was trying to figure out how I was going to top the publicity of yours and Kanye's interview so I decided I was going to walk in here, pee on the floor, and leave. I'm peeing right now. Alright see you guys later!"
Interviewer,"Seeing you with the band, and seeing you perform the other night at the awards show and seeing you on the mic, it was, I don't think I've ever seen you more alive on the mic. It was full of energy and in the moment. What I noticed was as well was spitting live with the band behind you seemed to free you up a lot more. Are you feeling that way?"
Eminem,"I think performing has gotten a lot different, it's gotten better with the band because there's just more elements to it and being it is a live show, there's more places you can go with it. There's things you can do with your hands, it's really cool, it's different. I think it's better."
Interviewer,Spitting Rap God that just puts everything into perspective I think for everybody else. When you wrote that and you got that one down and recorded it...
Eminem,"I didn't write that, I freestyled it, off the dome, 1 take."
Interviewer,"Absolutely ridiculous. I mean, the song is ridiculous it doesn't make any sense whatsoever."
Eminem,Thank you.
Interviewer,"When you get to perform that live that must be, I saw at the end once you finished that, that's a challenge for anybody. At the end you must feel like 'Wow'. That's a lot of rhymes to get through, it's like 5 or 6 minutes non-stop."
Eminem,"Um, Yeah the other night I don't think we did the whole song. We did kind of a Deadly Medley."
Interviewer,I don't even know how you would cut that up and make a shorter version of that because it's such a stream of consciousness through the whole track.
Eminem,"Yeah I don't know. I wouldn't even want to begin to think of that, because I think it is a... stream of consciousness. Nice stream of consciousness, running down my leg."
Interviewer,"The album itself has been so well received by everyone including fans across the world. Because in my opinion listening to it now it's kinda the perfect combination of the venom and the danger that existed on the 1st record but also what you've been through and what you've learnt over the past 5 or 6 years. It's kind of like the combination of the two. Is that fair do you think? The first album that feels like it's slightly grown up, but also going back to some of those subject matters and dealing with that stuff."
Eminem,"It's grown up and down. I mean some of the themes and topics and things like that are revisited on this album, but at the same time I feel like its kind of a 2013 version. All my albums I think, for the most part, pretty much tell where I'm at, you know at each one at that time period, whatever. So this is kinda like, there's a lot of reflecting and things like that back on everything that was happening during that time, you know. And it's kinda like me reflecting on it and getting to the point where I am now with it."
Interviewer,"Settling some scores as well, and burying the hatchets and dealing with stuff once and for all. Do you feel like this album has allowed you to do that?"
Eminem,"I mean some stuff, yeah. But for the most part I just felt like it might be fun to just revisit that, the overall vibe of that album. Just because it started to go there in the recording process."
Interviewer,So when did that begin like you were going down that road?
Eminem,"I had started making a few records for it, and it just sounded like the tonality of it, the tones of the records kinda were heading towards that way. And I figured out what direction it should go in, kinda started gearing everything that way. And alotta times, making an album, I dont always have the direction or concept early on. Sometimes it doesn't come until the middle/towards the end of a record to figure out where I'm actually going with that... that's just a culmination of songs, and depending on what the vibe is. Sometimes I do a songs that is so left field one or two of them its like Oh Shit where am I going to put these songs and now what am I going to call it because its not going to make sense to go, let's say Recovery or whatever. But with this one I feel like I kinda got an earlier idea for a concept."
Interviewer,"That must be nice actually to be able to sit down and carve it out as it was going and have that end result in mind, to piece it together that way."
Eminem,"It was, but it wasn't, in the sense of I had to record a lot of songs for it because I felt like if I'm going to call it that, I want it to make sense."
Interviewer,"And the stakes are high as well. I was talking to someone about this before and they were saying, Eminem would never consider one of his albums to be a classic he's not that way inclined. But you know how people feel about the Marshall Mathers LP, it speaks volumes. And then the critics, every layer of it, it is considered a modern day classic album. Did you consider the expectation of calling it that and what it would mean to the record overall?"
Eminem,"Yeah, I had kinda known that going in. Once I kinda knew what direction I was going, I knew that I needed certain songs to be able to call it that, and like I said to be able to make sense. But, I just wanted to make sure that I had the right ones, and in other words, I knew that, obviously Stan off the first Mathers LP was a big topic. And I had heard a lot of chatter around the time doing the Recovery record that I should do Stan 2 and why doesn't he do Stan 2, and all I kept thinking was Stan's dead. You know what I'm saying, he died in the story. So in the back of my mind I kinda had an idea of who could be left from the story, but I needed to get the right beat and be able to..."
Interviewer,As soon as it starts as well. Did you know immediately this would be the beat for this concept?
Eminem,"Yeah, as soon as I heard the words to the chorus... I got this beat, this beat was sent to me and had those words on it. And sometimes for me it's like- I like making my own choruses and its also fun for me to take someone else's words and interpret them my own way."
Interviewer,"For sure, when you hear that chorus I'm sure initially... it's a 1st person scenario or self hatred scenario, but its tied into- there's layers to that. Being bad is good I hate to be it but here I am and I'm back again. And then you got to deal with the story, and at the end it's taking everyone to the end when you couldn't be facing down any more of the criticism both self and by others that you faced throughout your career. I mean it's the ultimate type of acknowledgement isn't it?"
Eminem,"It's kinda like saying, if you're going to go down this road, then you're going to call it this, and this is going to be the title, and this is all of these things coming back on me."
Interviewer,"It's an amazing opening to the record and it's really ambitious as well. So you set the bar really really high and from here we go to Rhyme or Reason, and I love that beat and love the big samples and first time you reference Rick Rubin as a producer on the record. When did you first have the idea of working with Rick?"
Eminem,"I've always been a fan of Rick's, and my manager Paul had been talking to him and Rick had expressed that he had interest in working with me. And when Paul brought it to my attention I was like super excited, honored at the fact that he was even thinking about it. I had my reservations just because I felt like I'm a super fan of Rick, and I'd probably be a little nervous and wouldn't know what the vibe would be because I would be wanting to impress him. It was very much the feeling that I got early on with Dre."
Interviewer,Had you met Rick before?
Eminem,"Nah, I'd never met him. So I was like nervous to meet him and you know, even more nervous to work with him."
Interviewer,"Same thing with Dre, all the way back, same kind of experience when you walked in the studio and saw Dre that time.."
Eminem,"Yeah I'm still always trying to impress Dre too to this day at the same time. But I just kept thinking if I got in the studio with Rick, what if we're not able to come up with anything. I had all these things in my head, and then when I met him, the guy's so laid back, it made it easy. And his vibe in the studio is very much like... Try whatever, don't be afraid to try whatever, even if the idea in the beginning is stupid. Because a lot of ideas in the beginning stages, not mine of course, mine are just insane from the moment I think of them- but sometimes ideas are not always the greatest."
Interviewer,"Don't be afraid to fail to get somewhere else, to get on the journey."
Eminem,"So if you say one thing that's going to spark another thing to lead to a better thought, that's kinda how it went. We started going through old break beats and I was trying to tell him I kinda had the idea, I kinda had a notion that I was going to call it the Marshall Mathers LP 2, but I didn't want to say anything yet to him because I wasn't 100 percent sure- and I wanted to make sure that I had enough songs to even play for him that would make sense. I love the sound that Rick gets when he does hip hop. Even from early on, Beastie Boys- it's incredible. And that's what I was kinda hoping to get."
Interviewer,"The first time I saw Berzerk as well, I was so happy to see the way that you came through, and the video the way the colors were so reverse Beastie Boy style- it was fan boy stuff for me. To be able to go out in a beanie like the Ad-Rock thing and it was cool, I love that."
Interviewer,"From listening to your album, you get the impression that your childhood was pretty much a living hell. What was it really like?"
Eminem,"I was born in Kansas City, and my dad left when I was five or six months old. Then when I was five we moved to a real bad part of Detroit. I was getting beat up a lot, so we moved back to K.C., then back to Detroit again when I was 11. My mother couldn't afford to raise me, but then she had my little brother, so when we moved back to Michigan, we were just staying wherever we could, with my grandmother or whatever family would put us up. I know my mother tried to do the best she could, but I was bounced around so muchit seemed like we moved every two or three months. I'd go to, like, six different schools in one year. We were on welfare, and my mom never ever worked. I'm not trying to give some sob story, like, Oh, I've been broke all my life, but people who know me know it's true. There were times when friends had to buy me fuckin' shoes! I was poor white trash, no glitter, no glamour, but I'm not ashamed of anything."
Interviewer,These were mostly African-American neighborhoods where you grew up?
Eminem,"Yeah, near 8 Mile Road in Detroit, which separates the suburbs from the city. Almost all the blacks are on one side, and almost all the whites are on the other, but all the families nearby are low-income. We lived on the black side. Most of the time it was relatively cool, but I would get beat up sometimes when I'd walk around the neighborhood and kids didn't know me. One day I got jumped by, like, six dudes for no reason. I also got shot at, and ended up running out of my shoes, crying. I was 15 years old and I didn't know how to handle that shit."
Interviewer,Were most of your friends black?
Eminem,"When you're a little kid, you don't see color, and the fact that my friends were black never crossed my mind. It never became an issue until I was a teenager and started trying to rap. Then I'd notice that a lot of motherfuckers always had my back, but somebody always had to say to them, Why you have to stick up for the white boy?"
Interviewer,When did you first get into hip-hop?
Eminem,"The first hip-hop shit I ever heard was that song Reckless from the Breakin' soundtrack; my cousin played me the tape when I was, like, nine. There was this mixed school I went to in fifth grade, one with lots of Asian and black kids and everybody was into break dancing. They always had the latest rap tapes-the Fat Boys, L.L. Cool J's Radio-and I thought it was the most incredible shit I'd ever heard."
Interviewer,What'd you think when you first heard the Beastie Boys?
Eminem,"That's what really did it for me. I was like, This shit is so dope! That's when I decided I wanted to rap. I'd hang out on the corner where kids would be rhyming, and when I tried to get in there, I'd get dissed. A little color issue developed, and as I got old enough to hit the clubs, it got really bad. I wasn't that dope yet, but I knew I could rhyme, so I'd get on the open mics and shit, and a couple of times I was booed off the stage."
Interviewer,Your single (My Name Is) is getting played on both Modern Rock and Urban radio. Are you surprised at how quickly you're being accepted?
Eminem,"Thing is, I'm not really a commercial rapper. My whole market, my whole steez, is through the underground; if those hip-hop heads love it, I'll rise above. It's like, you hardly ever hear a Wu-Tang song on the radio, but they rose from the underground on word of mouth."
Interviewer,Has being white really affected the way you see yourself as a rapper?
Eminem,"In the beginning, the majority of my shows were for all-black crowds, and people would always say, You're dope for a white boy, and I'd take it as a compliment. Then, as I got older, I started to think, What the fuck does that mean? Nobody asks to be born, nobody has a choice of what color they'll be, or whether they'll be fat, skinny, anything. I had to work up to a certain level before people would even look past my color; a lot of motherfuckers would just sit with their arms folded and be like, All right, what is this? But as time went on, I started to get respect. The best thing a motherfucker ever said about me was after an open mic in Detroit about five years ago. He was like, I don't give a fuck if he's green, I don't give a fuck if he's orange, this motherfucker is dope! Nobody has the right to tell me what kind of music to listen to or how to dress or how to act or how to talk; if people want to make jokes, well fuck 'em. I lived this shit, you know what I'm sayin'? And if you hear an Eminem record, you're gonna know the minute that it comes on that this ain't no fluke."
Interviewer,Did you ever come close to quitting?
Eminem,"About three or so years ago, not that long after my daughter  was born. I was staying in this house on 7 Mile Road, and little kids used to walk down the street going, Look at the white baby! Everything was white this, white that. We'd be sitting on our porch, and if you were real quiet, you'd hear, Mumble, mumble, white, mumble, mumble, white. Then I caught some dude breaking into my house for, like, the fifth time, and I was like, Yo, fuck this! It's not worth it. I'm outta here. That day, I wanted to quit rap and get a house in the fucking suburbs. I was arguing with my girl, like, Can't you see they don't want us here? I went through so many changes; I actually stopped writing for about five or six months and I was about to give everything up. I just couldn't, though. I'd keep going to the clubs and taking the abuse. But I'd come home and put a fist through the wall. If you listen to a Slim Shady record, you're going to hear all that frustration coming out."
Interviewer,Could you see why some black people might be not be so enthusiastic about a white kid trying to be a rapper?
Eminem,"Yeah, I did see where the people dissing me were coming from. But, it's like, anything that happened in the past between black and white, I can't really speak on it, because I wasn't there. I don't feel like me being born the color I am makes me any less of a person."
Interviewer,Did you ever wish you were black?
Eminem,"There was a while when I was feeling like, Damn, if I'd just been born black, I would not have to go through all this shit. But I'm not ignorant-I know how it must be when a black person goes to get a regular job in society. Music, in general, is supposed to be universal; people can listen to whatever they want and get something out of it. Personally, I just think rap music is the best thing out there, period. If you look at my deck in my car radio, you're always going to find a hip-hop tape; that's all I buy, that's all I live, that's all I listen to, that's all I love."
Interviewer,How do you feel about other white rap fans?
Eminem,"Say there's a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platterfor him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what that's saying is that he's living a fantasy life of rebellion. He wants to be hard; he wants to smack motherfuckers for no reason except that the world is fucked-up; he doesn't know what to rebel against. Kids like that are just fascinated by the culture. They hear songs about people going through hard times and want to know what that feels like. But the same thing goes for a black person who lived in the suburbs and was catered to all his life"
Interviewer,"Should suburban white kids, who don't have any firsthand experience of the way black people live, really be identifying so closely with hip-hop?"
Eminem,"Well, whether a white kid goes through as much shit as I did, or didn't go through any trouble at all, if they love the music, who's to tell them what they should be listening to? Let's say I'm a white 16-year-old and I stand in front of the mirror and lip-synch every day like I'm Krayzie Bone-who's to say that because I'm a certain color I shouldn't be doing that? And if I've got a right to buy his music and make him rich, who's to say that I then don't have the right to rap myself?"
Interviewer,Do you think that hip-hop culture can open up their minds at all?
Eminem,"I don't know, man. Sometimes I feel like rap music is almost the key to stopping racism. If anything is at least going to lessen it, it's gonna be rap. I would love it if, even for one day, you could walk through a neighborhood and see an Asian guy sitting on his stoop, then you look across the street and see a black guy and a white guy sitting on their porches, and a Mexican dude walking by. If we could truly be multicultural, racism could be so past the point of anybody giving a fuck; but I don't think you or me are going to see it in our lifetimes."
Interviewer,What do you think will happen if your album blows up and becomes a huge hit?
Eminem,"I imagine I'll go through a lot of this same racial shit, but that'll just make my second album better-because I'll have even more to rap about."
Interviewer,"What's up, y'all, It's your man, KXNG Crooked. I'm live in Dr. Dre's lab right now. And I could spend the whole episode giving props to the man across the room from me. You know, his achievements are just incredible. What are you doing, Marshall?"
Eminem,You were talking about me?
Interviewer,"Yeah, I'm talking about you. I got the homie in the house, one of the greatest of all times, Marshall Mathers. Thank you."
Eminem,Thank you.
Interviewer,"Thank you for being here, bro. I really appreciate that."
Eminem,"Absolutely, absolutely."
Interviewer,"Appreciate your time, man. Let's jump into to it, man. Let's talk about ""Music to be Murdered By."" It's inspired by the 1958 release from Alfred Hitchcock with the same title. What made you do that?"
Eminem,"Well, it was actually, Dre had this sample, years ago, right, and he made a beat to it, and one day it just popped in my head. I can't remember why, so I hit him and I was like, ""Yo, whatever happened to that beat?"" And he was like, ""Oh, it's still around."" But the beat was different. I just updated it a little bit with some drums and shit, right. But, it was based off that. Then I started thinking like, ""Yo, that whole concept is crazy, ""Music to be Murdered By."" I wonder if I can play off this whole Alfred Hitchcock thing"". And then Dre started hitting me with ideas. He was like, ""Yo, you need to listen to this album that he has"". So, he sent me the link to that, and I started listening and I was like, ""Yo, I could base this whole album off that."" There was actually some stuff that didn't make it on there that I was trying to get on there, but we couldn't really work it out with the sample claim. But I had it even more intertwined than it was, and we had to, you know, pick and choose the best pieces to put on there, just for sampling issues and shit, but...."
Interviewer,Fucking samples.
Eminem,"Yeah, right?"
Interviewer,"Man, I was stuck in traffic for like three hours listening to it over and over and over, and I caught something new every single time, and it's like, ""This is gonna take, you know, 'til about 2021 or some shit, before everybody really gets all of it."" And I'm talking about avid fans. You know what I'm saying? When you write on that level, you know, like you said, you say you just put it in anyway, knowing that it could slip by people's radar."
Eminem,"Yeah, I feel like there's a certain kind of fan that will get that, and there's a certain kind of fan that might just be the average listener who doesn't... You know, they like hip-hop and it sounds good, something sounds good to them, right? But they might not understand exactly what we're doing."
Interviewer,How dope it is.
Eminem,"But that's what's dope about those reaction videos, and also the people who break down the lyrics, and they show you like, ""Okay, he was hitting these syllable schemes right here, every single syllable, there's five syllables there or seven, and he was hitting these right here. Then he started a new syllable scheme, rhymed with that syllable scheme, and then came back at the end and rhymed with the first."" You know what I'm saying? And I think that that helps people really...."
Interviewer,To understand the genius.
Eminem,"Yeah, to understand...."
Interviewer,"The outer rhymes are two syllables. The inner rhymes are five syllables. That's, in my opinion, what makes you one of the greatest of all time."
Eminem,"Yeah, but that's, to me, my opinion back to you, because when we did, what the fuck was it, ""My House"", me and Royce joked about this shit all the time. We were like, ""Fuck, Crook did me on the song. All right."" But we joked about that shit all the time cause it's like you and him, to me, make verses that, even if you laid them first, they're un-toppable. So, it's like I can only hope to tie, at best. 'Cause when you did your...."
Interviewer,"That's a big compliment from you, dawg."
Eminem,"I forgot the next scheme, but utilities, like it was rhyming all that, and being able to keep it going, that's what I think a lot of the average listeners sometimes might not understand. 'Cause some people don't catch the syllables. They think that we're rhyming ""my house"" to ""lights out,"" ""Utilities in the facility,"" house rhymes and out rhymes, you know what I'm saying?"
Interviewer,"Right, they're not catching the full scheme."
Eminem,"Yeah, they're not catching the ""My house, lights out,"" ""Life's about to wipe out."" There's two there, but then there's ""Utilities in the facility,"" same thing. It's like that's the beauty to me of the craft of MCing, you know what I'm saying, it's that."
Interviewer,That's important to you?
Eminem,"Hell yeah. Yeah, and I know it's important to you because it's what makes rap fun, right? So, sometimes we might be in the mood to write a song that might not have a message to it. You might not really be saying anything that's important. But it's more about the craft, and we're just trying to go as hard as we can go, you know? I think that that, to me, is what makes it fun. Is being able, you know when you thought of the, ""Ay, bruh, I'll go ham for dead presidents"". You feel something, right? When you think of that you're like, ""Shit""."
Interviewer,"Yeah, like, shit, that's got me ill."
Eminem,"Yeah, ""All right, let me figure this out, let me sit down with this scheme and figure it out"". But that to me, man, is the beauty of this culture I guess."
Interviewer,"When did the Young M.A collab come about, I was very surprised to hear her on there, you know, I mean, she'd been doing damage all around. How'd that come about?"
Eminem,"Well, when she put out ""OOOUUU,"" I was like, ""yo, she's dope"". And I kind of started following her a little bit, and then I started watching every video she put out. And I was more so intrigued by her persona, how she just carries herself like a star, right? She's just like, charisma, right? But she also had the bars, and I was like, ""Man, she's really got bars"". So then I just went down the wormhole of the ""Eat"" freestyle she did. And then she did ""Flex"", and how she was just calm, murdering it on ""Flex"", but she barely even raised her voice. Like, she was just calmly killing it, and I was like, ""Oh my God"", so I just reached out. I was like, ""Yo, I want to put on an album, man, I want to do something with her"". And hit her up, and I said, ""I got this intro to the album, and then I want you to be the first thing that people hear after that"", you know what I'm saying?"
Interviewer,"Gave her the alley-oop, crazy."
Eminem,"Yeah, and she just went in."
Interviewer,"And she murdered it. Is that what you do, you go down the rabbit hole with different artists when you start liking them, and you go down a wormhole, kind of?"
Eminem,"It's funny because this has been this way for a while, I usually spend an entire Saturday, if I'm not at work, if I'm not at the studio, I spend an entire Saturday going through everything that's out, you know what I'm saying? Checking out everything."
Interviewer,"Wow, y'all hear that? On Saturdays, so y'all better bring your best shit, you never know who's listening, you know what I'm saying? For real, man, Black Thought, I feel like you guys finally gave us what we wanted, a collab. How the hell did that happen?"
Eminem,"Well, I had been wanting to do something with him, and I just never found the album or the song that I felt would be good to get him on. It was worth, you know what I'm saying, like, ""This might be right up his lane"". Denaun made the beat, right, so, Royce put a verse on it, and then Q Tip had the hook. And when I heard the hook, I was like, ""My era, my era"", and I was like, ""Me and him are kind of from the same era"", you know what I'm saying? So, this might work. So, I just hit him up through Royce, asked Royce if he could send him the track."
Interviewer,"Right, and y'all made magic, y'all made magic. That was a collab that hip-hop has been waiting on for a long time."
Eminem,"Yo, his fucking ""Funk Flex Freestyle"" was just like, ""Oh my God""."
Interviewer,That man went in for 10 minutes.
Eminem,"Fucking crazy. But again, it's what we love about this music, right, especially as a competitive rapper, right, we're competitive rappers. We're in there, we do this, this is what we do. And it's inspiring to hear that shit, but it also kind of gets you, like gives you anxiety, right? But at the same time, you kind of get pumped up about it, and be like, ""Oh, shit"". Every time something new comes out like that, my mindset is like, ""Yo, I gotta try to top that lyric"", you know what I'm saying?"
Interviewer,"Right, and then you go do it."
Eminem,"First of all, congratulations, man. 10 Number Ones on ""Billboard 200"", that's incredible."
Interviewer,Thank you.
Eminem,"You know what I'm saying? I gotta put that out there, man, how does that feel, though? Did you ever imagine that you'd have 10 Number Ones?"
Interviewer,"Ever, never in the history of my life. I could never imagine. For me, what's crazier about it, to me is being able to meet my childhood idols. Being able to sit down with LL Cool J, right? One of my favourite rappers of all time, ever. When I made the ""Relapse"" album, he sat in the car, in the truck, and we drove around, and he listened to the whole album. And I was sitting there thinking to myself, ""I don't even know what to say, 'cause I don't want to play myself"". But before we got out of the truck, I was like, ""Yo, man, I just want to say what you mean to me, man"", and I was trying to not make it come off sappy, but I was like, ""Yo, man, I'm a stan of you"", you know what I'm saying? But just to sit there and be like, ""All right, 15, 16-year-old Marshall, thinking that that could actually happen one day? That I'm gonna be sitting in the car, LL's gonna be sitting around in the car with me, and he's listening to my album"". Fuck out of here, that to me like meeting Dre, was just like, ""Holy shit""."
Eminem,"Is that what kind of keeps you grounded? Your love for the culture? I mean, after a huge amount of success it would be easy for you to be a different type of person. What keeps you grounded?"
Interviewer,"I just think I am so in love with this art form and I'm so passionate about it, because it's really the only thing that I ever was good at. Aside from basketball, I'm amazing at that. But that's a whole other...."
Eminem,You getting buckets?
Interviewer,Yeah.
Eminem,Okay.
Interviewer,"But no, you know, I just love it, I love to watch, like, you know, the YBN Cordae comes up and you're like, ""Oh shit, he's gonna be the next!"" It's the same shit why, when I listen to one of your songs, I don't really want to, because I get anxiety, but I have to, I mean, not that I don't want to, but... It's fucking nerve-wracking, every time with you and Royce, and I think because of that we're also in this circle together, kind of, but it's like, y'all are the rappers, you and he are the rappers that I get anxiety being on a song with. Because I'm like, ""Man, I gotta push the pen"". Rappers like TechN9ne, right? He's so fucking proficient. I don't know another word to say it, you know what I'm saying? Man, he crafts out every syllable. Every single one. Every fucking rhyme scheme, it's just like you're hearing 20 different things that rhyme with each other in succession. Yeah, and I'm sure you hate this, too, to be like, ""Well, yo, you don't understand what we're doing"", but sometimes, some people really don't understand what we're doing."
Eminem,"They don't understand it, I mean, and I get it, sometimes if I listen to something that you made, I'll be like, ""Damn"", either, ""Why didn't I think of that"", or, you know, ""Damn, I said something kind of like that, but I didn't say it like that"" and then it's like, ""Okay, I can't say that now because he already just said it"". You know what I'm saying? That's always crazy, man. It's a new era, man. I always wanted to know, what's your perspective on people with longevity, such as yourself, adjusting to the new era of hip-hop?"
Interviewer,"Yeah, you know, that's another one of the things that make it fun, too, is being able to watch Cole and Kendrick come up, and seeing how great they were right off the bat. And I mean, aside from them, I pay attention to everything that's going on, all the new shit I try to stay up on, you know, who's doing what, flow patterns, that kind of shit, because it's always interesting to me. like DaBaby, I never know where his rhymes are gonna end, you know what I'm saying? And that shit is so interesting to me because he does it so well. It's the same thing with you and Royce. It's like, I don't really know where this is gonna go, and when I get on a song with you or him, I know what I'm gonna get in the sense of the bar it's gonna be, but I don't know what I'm gonna get. What style, you know what I'm saying? I don't know, I can't predict our flow pattern, I can't never predict anything, it's the same thing getting on a track with Kendrick. I can never tell what the fuck he's gonna do. Cause he is such a chameleon of styles, and he can fucking do pretty much anything, right, and he's so proficient at it, he's so good at it, and you don't know what you're gonna get. That, to me, is like a top-tier lyricist, because it's like, you can get your ass kicked any day. Certain rappers get on a certain song, and it just depends on...."
Eminem,"Yeah, just like you, I mean, you've probably inspired countless stupid bars, when people knew, ""Okay, I gotta get on a song with him"". I'm very surprised, every time I listen to a song that you've done with another artist, it's always one of their best verses. You see what I'm saying? It's like you inspired them and pushed their pen like that. And that's got to be something, to walk in the room and just change the energy."
Interviewer,"Absolutely, absolutely, I mean, but it's a craft that I don't know if I've mastered it yet, but I'm still trying to figure shit out. As long as I've been in the game, I'm always trying to figure out new flow patterns, new cadences and shit, and still trying to always get it right, you know? Cause it's like making an album, I don't always get it right, I don't always get every song right, I don't always get every delivery right, you know, so it's one of the things I'm just always trying to improve."
Eminem,Are you your toughest critic?
Interviewer,"Absolutely. I mean, you're probably yours, right? Because you know that you can't sit down with a pen and just rhyme the last word of every line."
Eminem,"Like you said, that's not fun. And it's like, ""All right, cool"", you know what I mean?"
Interviewer,"And your love for hip-hop is just evident, you know what I'm saying? Even the T-shirts you choose to wear sometimes, I sit back and I see a picture of you, I think you had, like, Lakim Shabazz on your T-shirt. And a lot of people don't even know, they call themselves hip-hop heads, might not even know who that is on your shirt, is that something you do on purpose?"
Eminem,"It is something I do because I love it, cause it's fun for me, like it makes me feel like a kid again, it's like, ""Oh shit, I got this album cover on!"" When I think of iconic album covers, NWA's first album cover, Audio Two's first album cover, the colour scheme of that... How they was wearing the airbrushed shirts and shit. Having that on a shirt, it's dope to me, but it's also like, ""Maybe if I'm doing a show, and some of the younger fans don't know who this is, they'll go back and look at...."
Interviewer,"Go back and say, ""Who is that on that shirt?"" And get educated."
Eminem,"And go back and be like, ""Oh, shit"", 'cause Lakim Shabazz was fucking nice."
Interviewer,"Man, and being that much of a, you know, a part of the culture, history books are gonna definitely put you as one of the greatest of all time. How do you feel about the concept of white rappers being a guest in the house of hip-hop?"
Eminem,"Well, I mean, that's the funny thing, I don't know if I've got a chance to say this yet, but the funny shit is, with the whole beef of a certain person, I never said I wasn't a guest. I'm absolutely a guest. I never said I wasn't! And I never said I was king of anything, right? I had a song called ""Kings Never Die"", but it wasn't me saying. That was one of the beats that Khalil sent me with the hook on it, that was the concept of the song, and I'm like, ""I can't say I'm the King of Hip-Hop"". So I threw Rondee MC in there, and Jam Master J, you know what I'm saying? I don't want to be the ""King of Hip-Hop"", who the fuck is the ""King of Hip-Hop""? Is there a ""King of Hip-Hop""? People would say, just because you sell the most records doesn't mean you're the best. Just because you can rap 40 million syllables doesn't mean you're the best. I care more about rhyming the syllables. I care more about the craft than any of the other shit."
Interviewer,"And that shows, you know what I'm saying? And it goes back to those who know it, you know what I mean? If you know, you know, and I don't get it sometimes, you know what I mean, I watch these rap media so-called critics and some music journalists and so many of your bars and your messages goes over their heads, like, even with the content conversation, I mean, you've been having content since day one, you got songs that prove it, you know what I mean?"
Eminem,"Sometimes I'm like, ""What is content? What are you talking about? What do you want me to talk about?"" Think about the first time you hear Rakim, right? So when people make these lists, and he's always on the list, but he's also always on my list, because to me, greatness is not only how well you do something, but if you were the first to do it. Rakim was the first person that I heard that started using inside rhyme schemes, and coming back at the end and hitting it, you know what I'm saying? So, he did something that hadn't even been thought of yet. He single-handedly pushed the genre forward to be more complex, lyrically. And then birthed fucking Kane and G-Rap, right? And, man, those two will always be on my list, too.Man, come on, nobody was doing that! That was every single fucking word he said rhymed, and he just made a sentence with it. Every person who's a fan of hip-hop might feel like hip-hop is about something different, right? ""It ain't about lyrics, it's about how good your flow, and your cadence"", right? Or it's just about, ""The beat is dope"" and just having a message over it. That could be your opinion of what hip-hop was about. My opinion is hip-hop is about lyricism and the greats who we put up on the pedestal. That's what they were about, and that was the beauty of us being able to learn how to do it, and learn from them, right?"
Interviewer,"Yeah, do you ever agree with any of the top 50 lists that circulate on the internet, have you seen one that you was like, ""Oh, yeah, that's accurate""."
Eminem,"I've seen a couple of them where I feel like, ""Okay, that's kind of accurate"". I'll never want to come off as preachy, or be like, you, know, ""people don't understand what we do, we're so much smarter than you"", no, it's not about that, but we do the craft, and we do rap at a certain level, like, ""Game recognises game"", right? You can appreciate Jordan, because Jordan was like a spectacle to see, right? It was just like, ""Holy shit"". But, I don't even know half the shit he was doing."
Interviewer,"Just like, if I hire somebody to fix my car, I'm not gonna hire a painter, I'm gonna hire a mechanic. A mechanic knows what he's doing under the hood. You know what I'm saying? And I can't explain what he's doing."
Eminem,"And you can't be like, ""Yo, that's the best mechanic I've ever seen"". I saw, what is it called, ""My Expert Opinion"" with Math Hoffa, right? And it was the episode where they were talking about the verse that I did on the Fat Joe thing. And I was like, ""These are the guys who, if I was coming up as a rapper or just a fan of rap or whatever, I would want to hear from them, because they do this, too"". You know what I'm saying? So, it's like, ""Game recognises game"". Like, I don't know if this guy's the best mechanic in the fucking world, I don't, you know what I'm saying? It's not my thing, but someone who is a mechanic might be like, ""Yo, this guy, he's the fucking GOAT of changing your muffler"", you know what I'm saying?"
Interviewer,"And then we come and argue with that guy, you know, ""He's not the GOAT"", and I'm not a fucking mechanic."
Eminem,"But then again, it's like, you don't wanna sound too preachy and be like, ""We're so much smarter than you, you don't understand what we're doing"". It's not about that, but at some point, it's just like, I can't take your list seriously if they don't have you on it, if they don't have Royce on it, I can't take it serious. I can't take it serious, because it's like, you don't really know what you're talking about. So I can't even get mad at you, I can't get mad at you. I think that a lot of times, when people make these lists, they're mistaking the greatest rappers for their favourite rappers. So what they mean to say is, ""These are my favourite rappers, these are my personal favourites"". Jay, Nas, they're always gonna be on that list, right?"
Interviewer,"Right, you're always gonna be on there."
Eminem,"On some people's, but...."
Interviewer,"Dawg, I've never seen a list without you on it. You might not be where you deserve to be. You know what I'm saying?"
Eminem,"That's, in my opinion, that's how I feel when people don't put you and Royce there, because the longevity, how good you guys have consistently been, to be able to keep it up to this level, you know what I'm saying? We're not young ones in this game. So it's like, we've put our time in, but still, even to this day, when I hear a new song by you or a new rhyme scheme, I feel like, ""He's still figuring this out"". In other words, you're trying to figure out a way to make this verse better than anything you just did prior to it. That's how I feel when I listen to you, I'm like, ""Oh, he's still fucking with different flow patterns. And cares about it"". And the pockets!.. I don't ever know where your rhyme's gonna fall at. And I don't know how many syllables you're gonna fucking hit, but that's the other thing, is when people are like, ""Well, I don't care about the syllables and all that shit"", yo, you need to, because that's the craft of doing it. I think that people are just sometimes mistaking best emcees for their favourite rappers."
Interviewer,"Speaking of favourite rappers, Treach."
Eminem,"Treach? Treach, I don't see on a lot of lists, either. And that shit is infuriating to me, because I think that, again, when you're talking about, like, Rakim had did something that'd never been done, and Kane did something, then G Rap did something that'd never been done. I think what happened with Treach, and this is just in my circle of friends that we talk about shit, one of the common things said is, ""Well, he did 'O.P.P.' and he did 'Hip Hop Hooray'"". But he was still rhyming his ass off on those songs, but he also did something to me, in my opinion. There was a time period, probably between '91 and about '95 where damn near every rapper in the game was following him and trying to do what he was doing. Dressing like him, you know what I'm saying? The whole shit, moving like him. And he was getting on fucking songs and smoking everybody, and it was like, ""Yo!"" When I heard ""Yoke the Joke"", and my fucking heart sank. My heart sank, because I was like, ""I'm never gonna be this good. I might as well quit"", I didn't write a rhyme for the entire summer, I said this on the Ice T documentary. But this is real shit, I didn't write for an entire summer, and Proof was like, ""Yo, man, he's good, but you gotta keep"". And I was just like, ""But I'll never be that good"". By the time it got to ""Wickedest Man Alive"" I was like, ""I quit. I don't want to do this anymore""."
Interviewer,You got a favourite Treach verse?
Eminem,"I got a lot of favourite Treach verses.Yo, I was just like, ""God damn!"" No one had did that yet. What he did was, he did wordplay, he did compound syllables, multi-syllable rhyming, and he did it in different styles. Go back and listen to that first album, he never did the same style twice. I loved his image, I loved what he was about. He looked cool and you believed him. He looked the part, he acted the part, he was the part, right? So that's why I think a lot of rappers just kind of started going, and I did. Like with my writing and shit, by the time the second album came out, I sounded just like him. I sounded just like Treach. I sounded like Cool G Rap, there are so many eras that I sounded like other rappers, you know what I'm saying? But it's what we do when we're kids, right?"
Interviewer,What do you think about Royce as a producer? Is it weird?
Eminem,"It's really fucking weird. I told him years ago, years ago when we first met, I said, yo, you should... 'Cause the way he was picking his beats and his ear for them!.. I was like, ""Yo, why don't you just make beats?"" 'Cause I first started making beats and learned how to do it, you can control what you make. So it's like. Making the song, ""Lose Yourself"" and sitting there from the beginning down to the end of the completed song, make this trajectory go wherever you want it to go... Right? Both of us were still focused on rap but I think he would rather have pushed his time into the pen. But kept telling him even years later, like, ""Yo, man, I'm telling you, you'd be good at it"". And he started doing the shit and then I didn't hear from him for a couple of months, and then he started hitting me off with beats and I was like, ""yo, this shit is crazy!"" ""You Gon' Learn"" one?"
Interviewer,"Yeah, this shit was hard."
Eminem,"Man, I was like, ""What the fuck? Like, man, how did you get this good this quick?""."
Interviewer,"Yeah, same with me, man. I went over there, he like, ""I'm making beats now, Crook"". I said: ""For real?"". He started making a beat, I was like, ""Man, this shit kinda dope"". I went outside to smoke a cigar and I started thinking a 16 bar rap, and I said: ""I'm thinking of a rap to a Royce beat"". And I went back and I'm like, ""Yo, I'm doing a new album with my little brothers Family Business, do you wanna produce the whole thing?"" And he was like, ""You think I'm ready for something like that?"" And I'm like, ""Yeah, I think you're ready, let's get it"". That's when we came over and played you the stuff over there.Man, you just said, ""Lose yourself""... I went down a wormhole myself, looking at your producer credits. And I talk to hip-hop fans every single day on Twitter. You know, that's one of the things I do, I engage with them, I ask them questions, rap questions. Do you feel like, cause I don't, so, do you feel like your name is mentioned enough in the producers' conversation?"
Eminem,"I don't know. No, I don't. No, I'm kidding, I mean, I don't know, I love to make beats, right, and over the years, I had learned how to produce. And probably made some of my biggest songs. And was just doing what felt right, you know what I'm saying? It's fun for me to make beats, but it's not as fun as rap is, you know what I'm saying? But yeah, I don't know."
Interviewer,"I mean because people are like, ""Yo, rappers who make beats, top five"". And I'm like, ""Yo, you gotta put in Eminem"", you know what I'm saying? And then some of them don't even realize how many songs that you have produced, you know what I mean, and that they know and love the song, they just didn't know that you produced it. That's crazy to me, you know what I'm saying? I don't even understand how that even happens, you know what I mean, I think you rap so well that it kind of just sucks all the oxygen out of the conversation."
Eminem,"It's interesting, like the first album, you know, I would sit in there with the Bass Brothers, and Jeff Bass played instruments, right? He played the guitar, he played the bass, he played the keyboards and all that shit. I knew this music better than they did, as far as what it should sound like, you know what I'm saying? So, I would just sit in there on the drum machine and I had to have somebody show me how to work it, you know, keep the metronome going and shit, and what started coming out of those sessions, and sometimes I'll be like, ""Yo, okay, what was that chord? Okay, what if you tried that, now go up with it"", right? And then I'd hum because I don't know how to play instruments. So I would just hum a lot of shit, you know? And that's how I started making."
Interviewer,"the beats, and Dre was like, ""Yo, you're producing, that's producing"". And I was like, ""It is?? Okay, cool"". Yeah, it's funny, like, I was thinking the other."
Eminem,"day, ""Cleanin' out my closet"", that beat was actually a beat I was making for Bizarre. Yeah, and then I don't remember what happened, but I ended up taking the beat, cause sometimes, if someone's there as I'm making the beat, and they start wanting to write to it, I usually give it to them, and I don't remember what happened with that, but...."
Interviewer,And it just became the stadium mover. That's one of my favourite songs to watch you perform.
Eminem,"That's the other thing, too, I'm not a singer, so I remember some of my early, early shit was really rough, like, was really rough. But it was like, a lot of times, from coming up in Detroit, Proof had the connects, right? So Proof used to know J Dilla, Proof used to know everybody who was anybody, right? So, and I don't know if you remember when rap was going through a phase, well, I mean, it still does it, but there was kind of a phase in the mid, late nineties where if you could get a chick to sing on your song, you know what I'm saying? An actual singer chick, and Proof would come over with new music and man, Dilla's making the beats, and he's got chicks all over his hooks and shit, and I'm like, ""What the fuck, man?"" So, I would start thinking of hooks like that, you know what I'm saying, and being like, ""Well, someone else could sing this, and I'll just lay it for right now""."
Interviewer,"And then it ended up becoming a thing where I was just like, ""Fuck it, I'll just leave it"", you know."
Eminem,"""Godzilla"", man, I got to tell you. That's one of my favourites right now, you know what I'm saying? My favourites always change when I listen to albums. Right now, I'm fucking with ""Godzilla"" heavy, every day, all day, you know what I'm saying? That shit is crazy, I mean, the cadences and all that, absolute murder. The beat, who did that beat?"
Interviewer,DA.
Eminem,"That shit is crazy, man, RIP to Juice WRLD, that kid was amazing, you know, on that joint. Favourites change."
Interviewer,"Yeah, shout out to Juice, too, man. That kid was so talented, man. His freestyle he did on Westwood where he rapped for an hour, what the fuck. And I mean, he might have been mixing a little bit of written in there, but the way he was free, that's the shit that we used to try to do at the Hip-Hop Shop, was try to work on our freestyles, right, but to be able to slip in and out of written when you need to. If you've got a certain punchline you want to get to to take out this dude, right? So, to be so young, he mastered that so fucking quickly. It's really sad, man, his potential was so off the charts."
Eminem,"Very, I tweeted one time, you know, ""I like this Juice WRLD kid"", and you know, I got some real hardcore boom-back type hip-hop lyricist fans that follow me, too, and they're like, ""Juice WRLD, he uses autotune"", I'm like, ""Yo"". I dropped the link to that Westwood freestyle, like, ""Yo, don't even talk to me, just watch this"". He definitely had it, man. It's crazy that some of these kids out here, I think they're inspired by Jay, you know what I'm saying? And they want to really get their pen moving."
Interviewer,"About ""Darkness"" and gun control."
Eminem,"Yeah, I was gonna ask you, do you have a favourite? You have any favourites on the new joint?"
Interviewer,On my album?
Eminem,"Yeah, with your joint."
Interviewer,"Every single one. No, I mean, you know, it's funny when you're making an album and sometimes you got ideas already, sometimes you like ""I don't feel like having a message in this one"", you know what I'm saying? I just want to go as hard, lyrically, as I can, you know, and then sometimes, you know, I'll get in a certain mood and be like, ""Okay"", if there's something that I'm passionate about, like, this is making me either angry or excited or whatever it is, I might get the idea to do a song about it. Like the ""Darkness"" song, when I want to say something, when I feel like I really have something to say, I'm gonna do it."
Eminem,"The ""Darkness"" joint, did you ever feel like you might get some kind of backlash from all this gun politics, you know, the right side saying, ""They want to take your guns"", the left side saying, ""We need more gun control"", did you feel like you would get any backlash from creating that type of song?"
Interviewer,"I mean, I figured I would get some, but, it's kind of like, I more so care about what I believe in. And whoever else gets fucking pissed off, I don't give a fuck, this is my view on it, and this is my take, it might not be your take, so what about the person who is stockpiling his house with 150 fucking guns, right? Whatever war they're waiting for, I don't know what war you're waiting for that you need that kind of arsenal. I think there's also something to be said, I know there's avid gun collectors and shit like that, but there's something to be said about somebody who's buying that many fucking guns. I just don't have a record of it, for, you know, I'm not on record as having a, you know. Where I'm able to get flagged. So it's like the whole message of that song was saying what about the person that hasn't, you know what I'm saying? There's a first time for everything."
Eminem,This is gonna be the first time they flip out and they have an arsenal to do it with. What about that guy? There's no stopping that guy.
Interviewer,"Right, and that's when it's like, ""Okay, when you start calling for background checks and shit like that instead of the actual problem, you know, we gotta do something with the gun laws. People start to get like, ""No, you can't take our guns, you can't take our guns"". I'm not saying that."
Eminem,"So when you talk about things like that, I would say that that's content."
Interviewer,I probably would say that.
Eminem,But your critics will say that you just rap about rapping.
Interviewer,"I just put words together that just rhyme. That's what I do. I competitive rap. And sometimes, I just want to have fun with it, sometimes I just want to make a song that might not be about shit, but for those who can respect how hard I pushed the pen, right? You know, you get people, ""So what, you can say that many words that fast, you're not saying anything"", what do you want me to say?"
Eminem,"Yeah, it takes a skill level to do that. And I feel like they're not respecting that part of the game, you know what I'm saying? It takes a phenomenal skill level to rap at the speeds that you rap at, syllables within those, you know what I'm saying, it's not like you're like, ""Then I'm over here then I'm over there, then I'm over here then I'm over there"", you know, some people fool people, you know what I mean? You actually are putting fucking syllables, punchlines, metaphors within that cadence. I just think, a lot of times, when a rapper says, ""He's just rapping about rapping"" or ""He's too rappity-rap"", it usually comes from a rapper who can't rap that well."
Interviewer,"A lot of people diss what they can't do. So it's like if I can't do that, I'm gonna just...."
Eminem,I'm gonna shit on it.
Interviewer,"Yeah, I'm gonna shit on it, and make it like it ain't that good anyways. And then...."
Eminem,And then people buy that narrative.
Interviewer,"Yeah, yep, and then, you know, maybe it makes the person feel good with whatever is going on inside them. I saw some dude, I don't remember where I even seen this, what show it was on, what site it was on or whatever, some dude was trying to trash J Cole about ""Middle Child"" and was saying, ""It just fell off at the end"", and I'm like, ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" I can't take you serious, you critique that? And then it's like, sometimes you'll be like, ""Yo, but you listen to that and then you say this is trash?"" I can't respect your opinion, I can't."
Eminem,"Yeah, they're probably the ones responsible for these top 50 lists that go around, people like that."
Interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, and I know it's your opinion, but your opinion's wrong."
Eminem,"For sure, 100. Speaking of top lists, dawg, is your top nine that you named on ""Till I Collapse"" still the same?"
Interviewer,"Yes and no. Yes, because, well, what's happened since then is like 20 years of rapping. So it's like, as rap evolves, you gotta put Cole and Kendrick on that list, man, and Joiner, because those are guys who really care about the craft, and if you want to know why that sounds so good to you, and you're not really sure, then we're telling you that these people are so good at what they do. When we're telling you that, it's coming from somewhere where we know what it takes to put that into the print."
Eminem,"Absolutely. It's coming from a place of experience, we know what it takes, basically, like you just said."
Interviewer,"The ""why didn't I think of that?"" Every time, you know what I'm saying? The rapper that makes you go, ""Fuck!""."
Eminem,"Yeah, and it was right there. Sometimes it could be an easy line, and you're like, ""That line, it seems easy to think of, but it wasn't"".And it was like, ""Why the fuck, this is what I do for a living, how come I missed that fucking line?"" I hear that shit a lot."
Interviewer,"Yo, you know what I wanna mention, too, I just thought about this. When I got shit, this is funny, pun intended, when I got shit for the ""your booty is heavy duty like diarrhoea""? I got a lot of shit for that line. Pun intended. But it's like, ""Man, that shit's trash, it's trash"". I'm just being stupid, like sometimes, you ever think of a punchline that's like, it's just supposed to be stupid. It's not supposed to be hard and all that. It's not supposed to make you go, ""SHIT, YOUR BOOTY IS HEAVY DUTY!!!"" It's a fucking stupid line, and sometimes I throw those in there just to get a reaction out of people, to get a laugh. It ain't that serious. But it's like, ""Man, he sucks, cause he said... ""."
Eminem,"Yeah, they pick out one thing, and that just lets you know how good you are because they'll go through, okay, you just said fucking a hundred dope ass fucking lines, and then they'll pick one and say, ""But hey, he said this right here"", and you just know that that person is a hater."
Interviewer,"I never was like, play a couple of lines and be like, ""I don't like that, I don't like what they said right there"", and then next line would go by, ""I like that, though, that's dope"". I never hated a song because of one bar, you know what I'm saying?"
Eminem,"Never, because now, if I go back and listen to all the classic music that I loved growing up, I'm sure I could find that bar, you know what I'm saying? But that wasn't the point. It's just crazy now that we have the internet and all that shit, everybody has an opinion."
Interviewer,"Well, everybody's an expert, that's the thing that it's like, you know."
Eminem,"Yeah, that's why we listen to the fans, man, the fans get you. Your fans, listen, dawg. I engage with your fans every single day. You know what I'm saying, they hit me every day."
Interviewer,Sorry about that.
Eminem,"No, it's all good, man, some of them leave me paragraphs in the DM, like, ""Hey man, if you see Marshall, can you tell him... "", you know, so I'm just like, you know, ""Hey man"", whatever. And they're really passionate about supporting you. I think any artist would want to have fans like you have."
Interviewer,"I'm very grateful for that, absolutely."
Eminem,Do you ever read any of their comments online that they leave?
Interviewer,"Well, I went through a phase of that, for sure."
Eminem,You did?
Interviewer,"Yeah, and then I had to kind of stop and put it all in perspective and be like, ""Listen, man"". You know, just reading comments, period. It just makes it like, ""Okay, you realize you're not gonna please everybody"". You just can't."
Eminem,"Right, can't do it."
Interviewer,"You know what I'm saying, you do this over here, and someone doesn't like it and they want you to do the opposite, then you do the opposite and you please that person, or you don't, then this person hates it."
Eminem,"It's very tough, but no, I agree with that. It's kind of like, you know, quarterbacks reading the Sports column after games."
Interviewer,Monday morning quarterback?
Eminem,"Yeah, exactly, so. But like I said, man, these fans that you have that hit me every single day, they asked me if I could ask you a couple questions. What's your favourite food? Taco Bandino?"
Interviewer,Beats.
Eminem,"Beets? So you got good-ass blood pressure. Oh, you were talking about this kind of beats? I'm like ""Damn, your blood pressure is excellent around this motherfucker"". Beats, no."
Interviewer,"I don't know, I don't know what my favourite food is, I don't really have a favourite food."
Eminem,"Okay, let's see, favourite TV series? Right now, currently."
Interviewer,"""Power""."
Eminem,"""Power""?"
Interviewer,"Yeah, you like it?"
Eminem,"Yeah, I watch ""Power"", ""Power"" is ill."
Interviewer,Incredible.
Eminem,"You put me up on ""Walking Dead"". I was watching ""Boardwalk Empire"" all the time,and we were at the Lamb one time, and you were like, ""Yo, you gotta check out 'Walking Dead'"" and you said it was some zombie shit. I was like, ""I don't know if I could do the zombie shit"",and you was like, ""No, you gotta watch it"", then I got fucking hooked on that shit. That shit was a great fucking series right there."
Interviewer,"""The Wire"", I mean, I've said that many times, but man, that's like, cream of the crop. Like those shows that like, I don't know, there'll never be another one of those. Like those kind, like ""Breaking Bad"", incredible."
Eminem,"Yeah man, ""Breaking Bad"" was the shit."
Interviewer,"""Power"" is my shit, though, now, for sure."
Eminem,Shout out to Fifty!
Interviewer,"Yeah, man."
Eminem,"Do you have any pets, they want to know that."
Interviewer,"Nope, I do not."
Eminem,"No pets. Are you happy, that's the most, number one asked question that I got on Twitter is, ""Can you please ask him if he's happy?""."
Interviewer,I'm never happy.
Eminem,Never? Are you happy when you're angry? You said something like that.
Interviewer,"I'm happy when I'm angry, that's for sure."
Eminem,"So, when he gets angry, he'll be happy, so you guys get that."
Interviewer,That's why I bitch so much. I try to stay happy.
Eminem,"Now, we was talking about, like, I want to mention this, too, man, cause I'm sitting here like, we was talking about the list, and has it changed. I feel like all the rappers that I said on that list will never change. I don't know about the order, I don't even know if I should have put it in the order like that, you know what I'm saying? But sometimes you do things, and it fits in the rhyme scheme. Like we was talking about people who push the boundaries. Like Redman to me. You know when it seems like it was a time in hip-hop where, and this was, to me, was like the late eighties to early nineties where every time a rapper came out with a new album, they were the best rapper for a minute. Like Boogie Down Productions, when, by all means necessary, love ""Criminal Minded"". But, by all means necessary, it was like the pinnacle of rap at that point in time was like, ""What the fuck?"" And Redman came out, so good, right? And then, when Nas dropped, right? Nomadic, it was like, ""This is as good as it gets. You can't get any better"". That was incredible, and then Biggie, and then, to me, Redman. When he made ""Muddy Waters"", I was like, ""Yo"". That was when he, in my opinion, just pulled ahead of everybody. He just shot ahead. Like, man, the way he was fucking...."
Interviewer,"Yeah, he absolutely smashed that. Even when I first heard him on, when I first heard him do The Headbangers verse, I was like, ""This dude right here is fucking fire, who is this guy?""."
Eminem,"Yeah, ""Whut? Thee Album"" is so classic to me. So classic to me. Because not only was he rapping so good, but it was like his beats and everything, he was making good songs, right? Like that first album, he just came out the gate making great songs, and again, the image, everything, it was cool to be Redman, to want to be Redman. It was like, Redman is just fucking cool."
Interviewer,"Yeah, Redman was the shit."
Eminem,"And still is, still is, he can still go."
Interviewer,"And that's what I like, I love it when guys from that era still just fucking, they just never lose it."
Eminem,"Yeah, cause you can tell he loves it."
Interviewer,"And that's what it takes, the love."
Eminem,"Yo, let me ask you, man, were you ever a fan of Kobe?"
Interviewer,"Absolutely, I mean, who wasn't? I don't know how you could not be. I can't even, it makes me sick, man. It makes me really sick to my stomach to even try to grasp what happened."
Eminem,"Yeah, me too, man."
Interviewer,"Nine people, man."
Eminem,"Nine people, nine people, that really shook the world, you know what I'm saying, and I ask you that, too, because I feel like great people have a lot in common. I feel like you have, you know, what he had, that killer instinct, when you go in the booth. That work ethic. If he's showing up two hours before everybody else, working on his shot, I've seen you in the studio, you know, working on a hook, and you know, getting it down to the fucking last fucking molecule in that bitch. Just making sure that that shit is right, man, your work ethic is incredible. Is that something that you've developed over the years, or is that something, like hanging around, working with Dr. Dre, when did you develop this work ethic that's just, like, robotic almost?"
Interviewer,"I mean, that was before I even got signed, me and Denaun knew, me and him were so close, got really close really quick. Just because of the things that we had in common and everything, so we kind of just felt like, ""We don't have nothing"". It was a do or die situation because there was nothing else I knew how to do, so it was like, we used to go to this place called ""Mo Masters,"" we'd just go to ""Mo Masters Studio"", and it would be like ten dollars an hour, something like that, and so we'd have an hour. Basically, we made sure we had the beat, I had the lyrics written, and I already knew the song by heart, go in there. Once I got a chance to, once Dre gave me that shot, I was like, ""I can't, there's no turning back, I can't"". All I needed was that, and yeah, man. And plus I watched Dre do it. That dude, still to this day, lives in the studio. Because he loves it. That's why we do it, cause we love it."
Eminem,"I'd like to, before I close, I'd like you to give some sort of jam, get the guest to give some sort of jam to, like, an up and coming artist that's trying to make it. You just described a picture of you having to memorise your raps before you go to the studio, looking at the clock on the wall and shit, ""I only have so much time in there, I gotta get it all out"". I mean, it's a real grind, and I think sometimes, the up and coming artists look at people's results, and they don't understand that...."
Interviewer,The work that it took to get there.
Eminem,"Yeah, what would you say, man, to inspire some young artist? What do they need to do in your opinion?"
Interviewer,"Well, I mean, times are different, right? You can make a fucking studio quality album on your laptop, basically. So based off that, what I would say to the up and coming, any new up and coming rapper, I would say that it is hard to get it, and it's even harder to maintain. As hard as I worked back then, you know, when you've made thousands of songs, and you're like, ""What the fuck am I gonna rap about that I haven't already?"" When you start out with a blank canvas, and then you've painted everywhere on that bitch. So, it's one of the things that, I do it because I love it, so I put in the overtime, it doesn't bother me. It's fun for me to do that. So I would say that, if this is something you're passionate about, just give it everything, give it everything. You have nothing else. If this is what you want, it's gotta be what you want more than anything else in this world. Whatever it is."
Eminem,"I'd like to thank you, man, for giving me some of your time, a lot of your time, actually, man."
Interviewer,"Absolutely, but yo, I watch ""Crook's Corner"", I watch it all the time, it's fucking dope to me because a rapper of your calibre, to do something like this, it's such a good concept, because you're an expert in this field."
Eminem,"I appreciate that, man."
Interviewer,And I think that everyone needs to know that who doesn't already.
Eminem,"I appreciate that bro, I appreciate it really."
Interviewer,"And as hard are you go with the pen, man, like, fuck, I'm telling you, this is top notch. Top tier lyricist, you, Royce, man, I feel like it's great that I know you guys. Because it's kept me, over the years, to push my pen and to keep going."
Eminem,"Likewise, my brother. ""Music to Be Murdered By"" out now, everybody go get it, three or four times, stream the fuck out that bitch, you know what I mean? And I'm on track 19. Get you a rap media host that can do both. Marshall Mathers in this motherfucker. Thank you, man."
Interviewer,"The last time you talked with us in 2010, you had just released Recovery, and you were actually in recovery: You'd come to terms with an addiction problem and gotten through an overdose. And so the first and most important thing is, how is your health?"
Eminem,"I hope it's good. I wish I had a better answer than that. I exercise regularly, I run, I try to lift weights as much as I can and eat the right things. So, yeah, I think I'm good."
Interviewer,"There's a lot on Revival that I want to talk about, but let's start with the cover art: It's a kind of translucent American flag with what appears to be a man holding his head in his hand, kind of like a posture of grief. Why this image for the album cover, and why the title?"
Eminem,"Well, the title just kind of made sense with everything that the album was about, and as the songs started coming together, it started making more and more sense to call it that. The cover is me with my head down, because as much as I love our country, we got shit that we gotta work on. We got shit that we gotta get better at. It's kinda like, I love our country; I'm upset with it right now."
Interviewer,"Was this an epiphany moment for you, or is this something that's been building for a while?"
Eminem,It's something that's been building for a while. Watching the Trump thing has been ... frustrating.
Interviewer,What part of it has been frustrating?
Eminem,"All of it! What part's not been frustrating? I think I made it pretty clear on the album how I feel about him, so I don't want to go off on a tangent because I'll never stop. But I think that, just watching how this unfolds and watching what happened with Obama and watching all the steps we took forward ... it feels like we've taken just as many steps backwards as we had forward and we're right back to where the fuck we were."
Interviewer,"In case anyone isn't sure of how you feel, before the new record came out you performed a freestyle on the BET Hip Hop Awards aimed at the president, which got a lot of attention. Was that something you had planned?"
Eminem,"Well, we had been in talks with some people at BET. The original plan was to go there and perform it live, as it was happening,  the question was brought up about people in the crowds with cell phones, would it leak out before anything was in its proper context or whatever. I kinda knew what I wanted to say, but then the plan got switched around once everyone was worried about that, so we filmed here in Detroit. The whole concept of the video, the way it was shot, was kind of a take on Public Enemy's You're Gonna Get Yours, the single cover. But to me, that was one element of what I have to say about him. It was more to get his attention, to see if he would say something back, and then I got some ideas."
Interviewer,Do you feel you got there?
Eminem,I hope.
Interviewer,Do you feel you're helping people see it who didn't see it before? Or is it more about you wanting to be clear about where you stand?
Eminem,"Well, both, but it's more about hopefully being able to open people's eyes with it. Between this song and, I feel like, Joyner Lucas' song, I'm Not Racist, actually, that's a funny story because I got the heads-up that that song was coming. I don't know Joyner personally, but we have a mutual friend, and he actually ended up calling my friend Royce da 5'9, and telling him he wanted me to see this video. And when it came out, it was really, really good and it was super powerful. And I felt like, you know what? Hopefully between his song and mine we can open some eyes and maybe keep the movement going, and the conversation."
Interviewer,"There are lots of stories in the news right now about women being abused, or not being happy with how they've been treated, in the workplace. You know for a fact that throughout your career people have listened to your lyrics and wondered about your attitude toward women. Now that you're at this stage of your career, do you look back on anything differently? Is there anything you wish you had said differently? Does this current discussion touch anything in you that makes you rethink some of the things you've said?"
Eminem,"Well, for one I think that it's cool that these women took a stand, for sure. Because I know that that shit goes on and if women are put in a position where somebody in a position of power is telling them, If you wanna move up the ladder this is what you're going to have to do, it's messed up."
Interviewer,"Kids are our harshest critics. Now that yours are old enough to listen to your music, do any of them have opinions they want to share with you?"
Eminem,"Not really, because they know that dad is just dad. ... This is what happens: When I'm writing, sometimes an idea or a line will pop in my head, and I'll be like, Yo, that thought is messed up. And I either laugh to myself or I say, You know what? That might be just going too far. So, have I ever took it too far? I probably have, who knows. There's times where sometimes I don't think I took it far enough. Depends on what it is."
Interviewer,"You say in the song Castle that you're done, and we hope that's not true. How would you describe this point in your career?"
Eminem,"I don't know. I'm at a funny place, you know? Hip-hop has been around for a long time but I don't know if it's really been around long enough to see how long someone could actually go for. You've still got guys like me and Jay-Z. Redman still has it, to me. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next, but I'm still passionate about music, and hip-hop."
Interviewer,Why don't you smile?
Eminem,ain't shit funny.

Interviewer, you know at the top of their game at whatever they do whether it's athletics or anything.
Eminem, has to put the time and have the work ethic you you don't get to be that without it.
Interviewer, yeah yeah man it's the same thing for rap it's like it's you know it takes a certain amount of.
Eminem, talent but it also takes it's probably three four times the work ethic.
Interviewer, versus the talent or or it's probably you know i mean in some cases it might be equal but it's but you.
Eminem, you don't get one without the other yeah yeah that's true you got to work hard paul.

Eminem,And it was cricket and he was like i don't remember exactly what he said but i i think he just kind of.
Interviewer,Was like like laughing yeah and i remember getting off the phone.
Eminem,Going oh my god i think i might have just blew it because it was to me in my head it was a.
Interviewer,Complete it was a total joke right it's like you know it's it's it's so ridiculous for me to think that i.
Eminem,I could dunk on jordan right so in my head it's you know one of those things that.
Interviewer,You think is going to be funnier in your head than when you actually say it.
Eminem,So i don't know what happened after that but paul did i call you i i can't remember.
Interviewer,Who i called right after that but it might have been paul i don't know i think you you felt kind.
Eminem,Of mortified by it and and um i think i was pretty sure that.
Interviewer,That mike knew you were joking and um you know you guys have continued to do business.
Eminem,With with one another in a few ways since then so i'm sure it's all good.
Interviewer,Man it was like it was one of those things like it was one of those things that in my.
Eminem,Head just would be so ridiculous he has to know i'm joking but when i got off the phone i remember.
Interviewer,Thinking i don't think he knew i knew i was joking because you know he's very.
Eminem,I mean watching this documentary like he's very competitive right yeah so it's like.
Interviewer, i like like i don't know if he would have if he if he would have um.
Eminem,Said when are you you know when are we gonna battle i don't know what i would have said but.
Interviewer,I would i probably would have uh probably would have laughed the same way he did it been like.
Eminem,You know but i feel like i would have known he was joking yeah mike mike might have some bars though.
Interviewer,You don't know but yeah that's that's what i mean that's the other thing like he might.
Eminem,Have actually heard about my game in basketball right and he might be like yeah yeah this.
Interviewer,Actually might be possible you think he heard about your game though i'm pretty sure he did.
Eminem,Yeah it brings girls i mean you've heard of it you've heard about it haven't you yeah yeah we played once and yeah i.
Interviewer,Remember you got a nice game to be quite honest with you i not mike jordan nice though bro.
Eminem,Yeah i'm like i'm like one step down yeah one step yeah from from georgia oh boy.
Interviewer,Yeah speaking of i'm gonna tell watching him in in his work ethic like.
Eminem,It's just so incredible just to know like he wasn't he was born with talent.
Interviewer,Obviously right like he had the talent but he had to hone his craft and watching it and and watching the.
Eminem,Talent go with the work ethic like it's it's incredible man it's it's like.
Interviewer,I don't know i that's what make the greatest degree i know yeah like it sounds like.
Eminem,Like you in terms of the rap game it's guys like you and jay or e40 or snoop these you know.
Interviewer,Guys have been around y'all y'all just didn't happen to hang around like it's that work ethic.
Eminem,And then even him not even responding to you duncan is that competitiveness like that's the favorite thing i got out of.
Interviewer,The dark too is how competitive he is yeah you don't you don't see that in yourself like you you spent your like.
Eminem,Let's say the last two albums responding to people who called you out whether it's.
Interviewer,Talk show host podcast host or or mcs you don't have to do it but you still calling out mcs.
Eminem,That call you out and i feel like that's that competitiveness in you no matter where you reach in your career what.
Interviewer,Would that person say right yeah no no no it's it's definitely there's definitely some some truth to that and.
Eminem,There's some elements of that that they go into what i do but man just watching that guy like.
Interviewer,In midair like switch the shot you know what i'm saying like yeah and and have that extra little.
Eminem,Thing where he can hang in the air that long and do something different you know like.
Interviewer,If he sees the defenders coming up a certain way and he goes around him or behind the basket like it's .
Eminem,Incredible man it's just uh  it's a it's he is a uh phenomenon no pun intended uh paul rosenberg and.
Interviewer, eminem are on the line um em let me ask you about this some of the things you've been doing bro i think.
Eminem, um we've been talking about them on the air you know i told all our listeners to.
Interviewer, citizens that that i would call and and to see if you could kind of elaborate on some of.
Eminem, the things you're doing uh first of all i notice uh marshall mathers.
Interviewer, foundation has been doing a lot with you know providing food and providing meals to um.
Eminem, health care workers at the hospitals and um you guys are providing hundreds of meals.
Interviewer, even at the uh can you talk about that um providing these spaghetti lunches for.
Eminem, people and some of the healthcare workers how did that happen man what made you.
Interviewer, want to do that well me and me and paul me and paul have actually just been talking about.
Eminem, you know what what what are some of the ways that we can do our part and and try to help.
Interviewer, out and mom spaghetti was one of the things that came up so we had talked about doing that.
Eminem, um and we talked about the uh the dj the dj thing that paul could probably.
Interviewer, elaborate on a little better than me but basically what we're trying to do is is.
Eminem, paul you want to go ahead yeah no i was just going to say that there was a time um you know when this.
Interviewer, all started happening where marshall called me and said you know what okay what are we gonna do how can we how.
Eminem, can we do um you know what we do to help help people out.
Interviewer, um and then one of the things that that i noticed was that there was um a lack of uh attention.
Eminem, focused on you know making the front line healthcare workers feel good and positive just put.
Interviewer, a smile on their face so we reached out to um the guys that at union joints which is a uh.
Eminem, group in michigan that we've done some work with before we did the mom spaghetti pop-up with us.
Interviewer, back in detroit and um when we put out the revival album and um we did some.
Eminem, some mom spaghetti pop-ups on the road in 2018. of various festivals etc so we reached out to them and said hey.
Interviewer, could we do um you know what we did on the road for for some of the frontline healthcare workers.
Eminem, and they sprung into action and said absolutely um so we went and visited some hospitals.
Interviewer, on monday uh and we're going to continue to do that throughout the next few weeks um.
Eminem, just you know anything to to pitch in and um you know make these make these men.
Interviewer, and women feel good about themselves for a minute uh so that's that's one of the things.
Eminem, we've done and then the other one was um you know a lot of people were talking about how djs.
Interviewer, have been affected um by the fact that they can't go out and earn a living and you've got guys who you know play.
Eminem, clubs and um you know or or parties or you know strip clubs or.
Interviewer, what wherever they play uh uh and earn their living they just can't all of a sudden can't do it.
Eminem, so um we thought about like maybe we can create some sort of program to give them you know some.
Interviewer, some small release and and again uh put a smile on their face so uh we have this this program that we're launching.
Eminem, um now and it's called love your dj and we basically are offering michigan you.
Interviewer, got to be a michigan resident because we can't offer it to everybody so we're going to start with michigan and the.
Eminem, first 500 people uh who submit a mix via soundcloud are going to be eligible for 313 dollar.
Interviewer, cash payment for 313 for the area code and the mix just has to you know fall within a certain set of guidelines which.
Eminem, which is all going to be available um online and then we're going to select the best of that group of of dj mixes.
Interviewer, and we're going to program and love your dj mix weekend uh starting may 2nd.
Eminem, where the entire weekend is going to be programmed by these mixed submissions um and that'll be sort of a you know for.
Interviewer, lack of a better description of grand prize oh  so 500 the first 500 djs in.
Eminem, michigan are eligible for 313 dollars and right uh which is incredible uh because.
Interviewer, djs really don't have a way of getting money right now uh why why was it important for um.
Eminem, to like help out the dj's well that was one of the things that we were talking about.
Interviewer, that you know i i mean obviously our our field that we work in is music right yeah so that was one of the first things.
Eminem, that came up when me and paul were talking like you know how are dj's going to make.
Interviewer, their money you know right they're the backbone of what we do.
Eminem, right and so this was a way to just kind of um just like get just i mean how long.
Interviewer, like how many times would y'all be well i know you probably haven't thought this far out but this is kind of incredible.
Eminem, uh how long will you be willing to do it like it's a time limit we'll see how this one goes there's.
Interviewer, i think they have um i can't remember how many days it's all it's all in the rules but they.
Eminem, have a certain amount of time to submit the mix um and then we're gonna do this first.
Interviewer, weekend and we'll see how it goes you know i mean uh hopefully we'll get all 500 um slots.
Eminem, filled up quick and then we can move from there and maybe maybe open it to a broader.
Interviewer, audience but you know a little bit of a test run so we'll see we'll see how this one fly.
Eminem, and then the best ones the incentive too right paul is the best ones that that we get we'll actually put on the.
Interviewer, air you know i'll say 4-5 so the contest begins today and it ends wednesday april.
Eminem, 29th at noon so djs that are tuned in if you're in the state of michigan.
Interviewer, uh you got to go sign up so you could qualify to have your mix played on the station.
Eminem, and you could win some money 313 dollars uh and then people can go to siriusxm.com.
Interviewer, forward slash stream free paul yep okay uh man that's  dope man um what i'ma do is send my mix in i'ma.
Eminem, mail it to somebody in michigan and then have them mail that in to y'all probably won't get it though will we.
Interviewer, paul like well he'll have to have his people call our people and then you know what.
Eminem, we'll hook you up if it's uh you know if it's good enough like okay well you know i've been i've been.
Interviewer, working on it uh now this is really dope man i love what you're doing and i say it all the time.
Eminem, anybody who's in a position to help out others right now and taking that initiative which you don't have to.
Interviewer, i commend so even with the mom spaghetti um initiative and passing out you know food to health care workers these people.
Eminem, aren't paid enough as it is and they sacrifice and they putting themselves at risk every day.
Interviewer, and then even giving back to the community the hip-hop community because djs can appreciate it.
Eminem, and then also giving them an opportunity to be on the station i think that's dope um and then man are.
Interviewer, you doing a playlist or something a quarantine playlist that that people could tune.
Eminem, into yeah which i'm still i'm still kind of working on so i.
Interviewer, paul i sent you some stuff yesterday but uh i got a few more things that i want to.
Eminem, add to it but uh yeah it's basically you know what um how would i describe it.
Interviewer, well it's called music to be quarantined by right yeah so it's like what what what uh you know.
Eminem, what i want to what what i want to hear basically so i recommend people listen to as well.
Interviewer, right uh hey em let me ask you bro cause you know i've known you a long time man.
Eminem, and quarantined for most of the country seemed like something new but because of your fame and the status.
Interviewer, you've had it feels like and i could be mistaken i could be ignorant.
Eminem, but this kind of seemed like you've been there was a time in your life where you were already self-quarantined.
Interviewer, because of the fame because of the you know the public fanfare is that fair to say.
Eminem, yeah i mean for for sure there's there's something there's there's something to be said about that.
Interviewer, like it's you know it's uh but it but it's not the same it's not the same when you can't do.
Eminem, a lot of your regular routines and  and and you know going to the studio is like my my.
Interviewer, outlet you know and it's it's you know i can't we we can't really get in right now and do much so.
Eminem, i've just been writing you know but yeah the to to a certain extent yeah you know famous definitely over the.
Interviewer, years kind of already had me quarantined but it's the fact of knowing that you can't.
Eminem, go really go out and you can't like we can't move like how we how we normally move and.
Interviewer, you know there's so it's it's not just the same it's not just the same thing for me yeah.
Eminem, every day you know what i'm saying that it always is there's something to be said about.
Interviewer, knowing that you can't go out and do certain things like because the truth is if i wanted to go out.
Eminem, i can do certain things right there's certain things that i'm able to do regardless of the fame or not that i.
Interviewer, still can't do and like i said it you know we were talking about.
Eminem, what what to do right now and it's like the fact that that when you're home and you can't even.
Interviewer, there's not you can't even watch sports like you know there's no boxing there's no.
Eminem,  there's no baseball there's no nothing right so it's just like you can watch.
Interviewer, the news or you can bury yourself in netflix you know.
Eminem, but uh i just been burying myself in the pad you know because and and like i said we.
Interviewer, started reading rock kim's book i saw the crook the crooks corner interview and if if if.
Eminem, people ain't seen that you need to go watch it the rock cam interview.
Interviewer, that that king crook did on crooks corner is incredible and especially especially.
Eminem, if you know and understand rock kim like and have studied them like i have like it's incredible for me to watch.
Interviewer, something like that and just you know he he's he drops a lot of jewels in that man.
Eminem, you know i saw and i saw what king crook did with you too um.
Interviewer,And i thought it was good because i know you guys got a different kind of relationship.
Eminem,Being family i was listening to the i will track off the album that had king crook royce.
Interviewer,And joelle and you on it then um verses that you guys all spit you know what track i'm talking about.
Eminem,Yep okay um did how does that work was those pre-recorded verses so that was just.
Interviewer,Because it feel like every time y'all get together y'all make great songs but you mention boxing it's like a.
Eminem,Boxing match yeah you know you know how was that bringing that song together.
Interviewer,Well it was i mean it's it's kind of just like we we just we do what we do right like like.
Eminem,Us getting on a song like especially like in the in the when we were when we were doing.
Interviewer,The slaughterhouse albums it was the same thing it was like getting on us getting on a song with.
Eminem,With anybody from slaughterhouse was a problem right and and.
Interviewer, rappers like king crook and joel ortiz man they're a  problem yeah right so.
Eminem, if you're gonna get on a song with them you gotta you need to  bring it and.
Interviewer, that's one of the things that that that to me is you know it's it's it's so dope that.
Eminem, that you know crook is doing crooks corner right now too but people who might not know about crook.
Interviewer, need to look up some of his music because he's a  problem he's one of those dudes that it's.
Eminem, nerve-wracking to get on a song with him royce too same thing yeah that uh.
Interviewer, the allegory was uh  uh that's that that one might that's royce's bible.
Eminem, album you know like just listening to like i i still listen when i'm listening to that.
Interviewer, album man i'm i feel like i'm i'm halfway in a lecture hall but also i'm in euphoria for a dude who just loved.
Eminem, lyricists yeah you know i i wonder too like i when i know we ain't talking a minute.
Interviewer, but there's certain things i was curious about because i'm a big fan of don toliver.
Eminem, and i was a big fan of um juice world both of which you put on this project and i didn't even realize you knew those.
Interviewer, dudes you know um speak on juice world you put them on a godzilla joint.
Eminem, um man what was that experience like with that kid well it's it's crazy because the the.
Interviewer, whole way that that came about like um you know i've it we're talking about the crooked interview like i was.
Eminem, explaining you know explaining to crook like because i'm sure that he does the same thing.
Interviewer, like you know us us being in the game for a certain amount of time it helps us i think that.
Eminem, as as as artists and just as hip-hop connoisseurs to pay attention to what's.
Interviewer, out right and pay attention to all the new  that's coming out because.
Eminem, you know a lot of these kids coming up man they've they've they've studied the greats and you can.
Interviewer, tell and and just watching them is is is incredible because you know you you.
Eminem, you might get to push back on certain sides of the argument about hip-hop like okay.
Interviewer, uh nobody's really saying lyrics anymore and this but but that's  because a lot of.
Eminem, these kids coming up and i i i you know i i mentioned kendrick and cole a lot i know they're.
Interviewer, not kids coming up anymore but but they came before or after us right but they've studied all.
Eminem, the greats and you can tell because it goes into their pen and uh you know i just i me personally i just i.
Interviewer, don t oliver's dope as  uh juice world man it's like like his his freestyle that he did.
Eminem, like um when he went on tim westwood and rap for like an hour straight.
Interviewer,Was incredible especially for coming off the top of the dome you know what i'm saying because a lot of.
Eminem,People just can't do that and they don't know that there's a or they might not know.
Interviewer,That there's an art to that like to be able to be able to do that so you know i keep my finger on the.
Eminem,Pulse of everything that's out because i don't want to get you know swept away with the tide.
Interviewer,Because if you don't keep up with the times like like we were talking about the work ethic like it's.
Eminem,I swear to you it might be harder to maintain it than it actually was to get it.
Interviewer,So like getting to the place where i was in the very beginning of my career right.
Eminem,I know how hard i worked to get there but i i swear i feel like it i worked just as hard and if not harder.
Interviewer,Just to be able to maintain a skill set you know yeah you you always like i i find it.
Eminem,Having known you so long i i i really i keep asking you this because i find it fascinating how you respond.
Interviewer,Like you're still ready to battle anybody you know and it don't matter who it is that critique.
Eminem,You do do you do you find enjoyment in that like oh okay this is oh  that's my.
Interviewer,Motivation right yeah i'm not gonna lie i i that that's the kind of  that i kind of.
Eminem,Live for is is that not saying that i live for conflict but.
Interviewer,My competitiveness you know is is uh you know i don't know how to say it i'm i'm i'm.
Eminem,I'm not looking for it but i'm always ready for it you know when when you're a kid we were.
Interviewer,Kids growing up on hip-hop like me in detroit i didn't know the stories behind certain things.
Eminem,Right so this new beastie boys documentary is coming out so i got a chance to watch it yesterday.
Interviewer,And they you know they had sent it over uh which was super cool of them to do and just hearing old stories like that.
Eminem,Man it's just like and just like how you know i think about when we saw run dmc on tv like like.
Interviewer,Seeing them like even even when they show like old clips of when they first were coming out right.
Eminem,When it when run dmc was first coming up it was like man they're so cool right like like run swag and just.
Interviewer,D like how they're doing it right now you know when i see clips from back then i feel like.
Eminem,This  still looks cool today like you get the story you get the context but yeah but knowing the story of how.
Interviewer,The  originated to me is just it's so intriguing to me like i love.
Eminem,Stories like that i remember i i remember one day one day i uh i hit red man because.
Interviewer,I was like i asked him i i was listening to you know i collect tapes and just trying to get the you know in.
Eminem,First nostalgia purposes but i also play the tapes right because it's just something that.
Interviewer,You know reminds you of a kid and whatever so i'm playing the tape and i remember.
Eminem,Uh on the illegal album uh jamal said uh jamal said uh what the  did he.
Interviewer,Say uh something about uh got a quote from my man read.
Eminem,It says tonight's the night or whatever and it was an ad-lib on there so i was like i just asked him i checked.
Interviewer,I hit him up i was like yo red did you say uh was that you on the ad lib there because.
Eminem,And he was explaining the story and i'm like yo that's why i love old stories like that because it'd be.
Interviewer,It'll be the  that i always wondered as a kid but now it's like i know a lot of these.
Eminem,Guys so i want to you know i try not to fan out too much but.
Interviewer,But sometimes like i just love little jewels like that did you ever see the uh unsung epmd.
Eminem,Yeah bro oh my god yeah like this like headbanger yeah like how that song was made and like what happened at the.
Interviewer,Video shoot and the you know the tension it was on it because him and.
Eminem,Like eric and paris were going through some things but it was like but uh just knowing those stories.
Interviewer,Because when when when we're kids man we just see it on tv we just see the actual finished product product we don't.
Eminem,See we don't know what the story was behind any of the  at that time right so.
Interviewer,When you grow up and you learn oh that's what was going on during that time oh that  is crazy.
Eminem,Like that to me is the the the best  yeah bro uh man next time we talk man i wanna i'm gonna ask you about a bunch of.
Interviewer,Songs that in your repertoire that that you produce and you can give me some of the backstory on that i love to.
Eminem,Do that okay you down with that yeah paul you down paul.
Interviewer,Like like four flat tires sway you know that the way i am the real quick story i will tell you.
Eminem,About that is that that i i remember being on a plane i got on a.
Interviewer,Plane and i was thinking it is this this flow in my head.
Eminem,And then all of a sudden the piano started coming to me then and then and then and then.
Interviewer,And then and then and i just kept repeating the the the melody so i didn't forget it.
Eminem,And i kind of wrote the song on the plane and then had to make the beat afterwards.
Interviewer,So and and i remember i i didn't know how to like i had to ask dre how to do it because at.
Eminem,That point in time like i was still learning how to produce right so i needed to make the idea come.
Interviewer,To life so i remember and i was actually on the way out to la.
Eminem,Um at that time to record with dre so that was one of the things that i brought to him and i was telling him the.
Interviewer,Idea so we just had to keep the keyboard player play to play the melody.
Eminem,And then he had a bunch of drum sounds up on his uh on the drum machine and i just started.
Interviewer,Tapping and and uh that's kind of how that came about.
Eminem,Oh  uh man i know we got to go but dre man um just even having that access.
Interviewer,If i'm trying to think nobody is done with drake has done what dre.
Eminem,Has done but who's a producer that you really like put on a pedestal maybe not like dre.
Interviewer,But if anybody could do a versus with dre who you think it could be like could it be diddy could it be jermaine.
Eminem,Dupri could it could it be molly mall who you think it could be to just go song a song with.
Interviewer,Dre i know bro you know i mean you know i'm gonna be a little biased anyways but.
Eminem,No there are some amazing producers though man that could could uh definitely.
Interviewer,Definitely uh be on his level you know close to that level mm-hmm who you think i don't even know how.
Eminem,How to say it you know i'm trying to be politically correct but i think that uh you know dre is in in in.
Interviewer,His own class as far as there's only one direct man he's in the class by himself yeah.
Eminem,But but you know but molly mom man that dude has a lot of  hits a lot of hits and uh he's done a lot of.
Interviewer,Classic  as well as dre has you know yeah think about like the symphony.
Eminem,You know um all the ll records he produced man that that dude has done so much marley mall would be great man.
Interviewer,And then i think the other thing people get to know who he is that don't know that should know.
Eminem,How important that dude have been a hip-hop you know from rakim eric b roxanne juice crew all of that all of.
Interviewer,That stuff uh yo um congratulations on uh well i don't even know if congratulations is.
Eminem,The right way to say it but i commend you on what the marshall mathers foundation is doing with.

Interviewer,15 best entries into the program um and play them on the air i don't want it to be seen as a contest because it's not.
Eminem,Meant to be that yeah it's more of a program people can enter into.

Interviewer, was of my life put it this way rappers let's say 100 percent of rappers come on 90 percent of them say the same thing.
Eminem, what is it about you there's a million of CSI what is it about you that made jaws make your pitches so vivid maybe.
Interviewer, like what I went to write just growing up and what I'm what I'm still going through and maybe like not maybe I feel.
Eminem, like I went through a lot of things  abnormal situations and have known.
Interviewer,Behaviors like a lot of rappers and Rapids haven't gone through you know I really feel like that I really feel like.
Eminem,Like a lot of muster my stuff is like reality and on it's like put a twist on it that's all alright I just got me.
Interviewer,Another tattoo man eminem's about to be out yeah how you feel right now it's like your name's on everybody's tongue.

Interviewer, joint show you right I don't believe this it's just saying you know what the drama before you little let you do your.
Eminem, thing oh yeah what's your favorite scary movie remember this guy named dr. Dre.
Interviewer, that's why day .
Interviewer,You're recording your new album with Dr Dre in Los Angeles. Don't you get distracted easily when you're in such a lively city?
Eminem,"No, I'm focused when I'm recording. When I record I slip into the zone. I don't like to talk a lot. I like to stick to myself and get my thoughts together, think how I'm gonna map out each song. Each song is fairly easy to write. I record vocals on one day and take the tape home to listen to them overnight. Then I do more vocals the next day. I always do my vocals twice. I might have the skeleton down, the vocals and the beat, for two months before I think of the finishing touches to put on it, like sound effects or if I want the beat to drop out here or something. I take my time on my shit that way."
Interviewer,You recorded a song with Limp Bizkit but it wasn't included on their album 'Significant Other'. Were you pissed off?
Eminem,I wasn't pissed. It just didn't come out the way we wanted. I plan on having them on my next album. It's still up in the air. We'll see what happens.
Interviewer,"When you were growing up, which rapper was your biggest hero?"
Eminem,"I wanted to be LL Cool J, I wanted to be Run, Ad-Rock, Big Daddy Kane, a lot of people. Me and my friends used to stand in front of the mirror and perform. The kids from the neighbourhood would come around to watch. We knew all the words."
Interviewer,Is 2-Pac's 'Me Against The World' your favourite record?
Eminem,"It's one of them. 2-Pac was at one time my favourite rapper. 2-Pac was more of a feel emcee, a feel rapper. That's what I'm trying to do with my new shit."
Interviewer,You never met your father but it was reported that he was trying to get in touch with you following your success. Did you speak to him?
Eminem,"No, I was on tour. I had a brother and sister from his side of the family. I don't even know if he's remarried, but they knew how to reach me all this time, they knew about me. I didn't know about them. I don't know them so I can't say if they're trying to cash in on my success, but I would say that since this success, I feel like that is the reason that they're trying to get in touch with me."
Interviewer,Are you a millionaire yet?
Eminem,"I could safely say that I'm well off, but I'm not a millionaire. People see me on TV and mistake me for having more money that I actually have. I got money now, more money than I've ever had in my entire life, but I still don't feel like my future is set, I still feel like I gotta work extra hard to get where I really wanna go. Shit, I still got a second album to work, possibly an acting career."
Interviewer,"When you were still a kid, did you really beat a man with a baseball bat when he attacked your mother?"
Eminem,"No, he hit me with a baseball bat. Some lady was talking shit to my mom, she came out and pointed a finger in her face, and I said, 'you ain't gonna touch my mother', so some dude comes out with a bat, hit me in the stomach with it, then ran from me, and I ended up chasing him. While I was fighting him I had him down on the ground when the cops caught me. They didn't arrest me. I told 'em that the dude hit me first and I had witnesses and that was it. That was a long time ago."
Interviewer,Did you get involved in a lot of fights when you were a boy?
Eminem,"I used to get beat up a lot. Fights are fights. I used to walk home by myself, go to my girl's and see my friends, and when I walked back I got fucked with. It happened a lot. Nine times out of ten I would be walking by myself. Where I was growing up, everybody tried to test you."
Interviewer,Were you ever shot?
Eminem,"I been shot at, never hit. I was 16. These gang dudes were shooting at me."
Interviewer,Is it still hard for a white rapper to gain respect in the hip-hop community?
Eminem,"People overall respect the lyrics and they know that I know what I'm doing. They can look past the whole white rapper thing. I'm not the first and I'm not gonna be the last, but hip-hop music is always gonna be predominantly black. Everybody loves hip-hop but not everybody can do it. Black people started rock'n'roll, so how can anyone say that black people can't do rock'n'roll now? The world is fucked up, it's fucking stupid, man. Whether you're latino, white, black, Asian, it don't matter. I'm tired of hearing about the white thing. If somebody says something about it now it's funny. I laugh it off."
Interviewer,"Could you live in LA or will Detroit always be your home?I love it out here. I love it 'cos I don't live here. It's a fun place to visit but I don't think I could ever leave Detroit, man, I got too much history there, too many roots, and plus, that's what makes it so cool about coming out here. LA is my little getaway to record my shit and then jet back home. I also got a studio in Detroit that I can go to if it's the middle of the night and I want to lay some shit down."
Eminem,"I can't really help when the ideas come. Most of this shit comes either when I'm laying in bed waiting to sleep, or if people are talking. If they say something, a lot of the time it'll be the way people put words together, and they'll be talking to me and I won't even be listening to them because the last thing they said gave me an idea. I sit there with a blank stare and people think I'm on drugs constantly. I do that to my girl a lot. She'll be talking to me and I'll be like, 'uh-huh, uh-huh'. I'll be looking off and she'll say, 'You're not even listening!' 'Yeah I am!' 'Repeat what I said!' 'You said, er, I don't know what the fuck you said!'."
Interviewer,You're launching your own label now.
Eminem,"Yeah, Shady Records. I just started it with Interscope. The first signing is D12, a rap group that I'm in. There's six emcees and we each have two identities, like Eminem and Slim Shady. It's not really similar to my shit. It is as far as the hard-edged rhyming goes, but if anything, it's a little grittier. I don't want to say it's underground because people associate that with shit that doesn't blow up, and I think D12's got what it takes to blow. It's just gritty. My shit is kind of sarcastic and political and Dirty Dozen shit is on some criminal type shit, you know what I'm sayin'? They're on some more gun-bustin' and shootin' and stabbin' shit, a little more so than I am, if you can believe that."
Interviewer,You've revealed a lot of your personal life in your songs. Do you regret anything you've said?
Eminem,"No, I don't regret any of it. I really believe in that shit, man. I don't believe in talking behind nobody's back or being fake. It's fun for me to do that. When I write something I don't hold back, there's no holds barred. And whatever the consequences may be, if I offend anyone or whatever, I'm saying it so I'm willing to deal with it. I don't know if anybody does it like me, saying whatever they want to say. If I'm feeling it, then I'm gonna say it. Flat out. I'm not mad. I leave my anger in the studio. I get all my shit out on the mic, I say what the fuck I gotta say, and then I'm done. I can go home and sleep I got it all off my chest. I put it out. Music is a form of expression."
Interviewer,What do your fans think of you when they meet you?
Eminem,"There's kids who meet me who say they were scared to meet me, they thought I was gonna bite their head off. I'm like, Who the fuck am I? All I do is make music, and I'm doing the same thing I been doing since I was 16 years old. I ain't changed shit, and all these fans and shit is kinda crazy to me."
Interviewer,"What do you think of all the white rock guys acting like black rappers, people like Kid Rock and Korn?"
Eminem,"I like it. I don't listen to it every day. I like Bob, Kid Rock. He was a friend of mine. I respect what he's doing, he's being himself."
Interviewer,Is Dre producing all of the new album?
Eminem,"He's doing a lot more than he was. He did three tracks on the last album. He's got at least seven on this one and we ain't even finished the work we're doing. Dre has been so busy with his own album. He's been mixing it down and shit, but as soon as he's finished, we're gonna start getting in there and knocking shit out like we did the last one. We got in there a couple of times and knocked out a couple of songs. I had the songs written, we just did the beats in the studio."
Interviewer,"I get a lot of sporadic shit - shit will just hit me. I can never sit down and search for rhymes. I mean, I can, but I don't really like to do that. It comes out better when I let it hit me instead of trying to search. I would definitely say that the tracks I've done are killing this first album. That's the way I feel. If you don't upstep the game every time you come out, if you don't make your album better than your last one, then you shouldn't even be in the game. I definitely feel that this album is topping the last one."
Eminem,"You see it all the time, especially in hip-hop. Somebody will make a good first album and then the next album will be shit. I feel like lyrically, I'm too smart to fall into that trap. Ideas come to me constantly. I'm not somebody who's limited, who put all his ideas on one album. I constantly keep runnin'."
Interviewer,How do you feel now about your first album?
Eminem,"The 'Infinite' album? I realise it's there, I did it, but I wasn't really experienced enough to know what to do in the studio. There was only 1,000 tapes pressed up of that shit. I think you can look it up on the internet and get it, and if you do, it'll be a bootleg."
Interviewer,Your uncle Ronnie committed suicide. Have your ever felt so low that you wanted to end it all?
Eminem,"That's always been something that's been in the back of my mind, but I don't think I have the balls to do it. There was this one time when I really felt like I wanted to do something to change my life, whether it would be doing something I regretted, or with rap or whatever. I was recording the song 'Rock Bottom'. We had just found out we were supposed to be getting this deal from some record label, I'm not gonna say which, and we found out that this guy who was saying he was gonna get us the deal was working in the mail room and he was nobody. A bunch of other personal shit was happening in my life right about then, and I just thought I wasn't gonna get a deal no matter what, and I just took a fucking bunch of pills. I puked the shit up. I didn't have to go to hospital but my fucking stomach hurt so bad. I had a little problem and I just took too many. I don't know if I was necessarily trying to kill myself, I was just really depressed and I kept thinking, more pills, more pills, I just kept taking 'em. I bet I took 20 pills in the course of two hours, Tylenol 3s. That's why I like going back and listening to my album and thinking of what I was feeling back then."
Interviewer,Is 'Rock Bottom' your most personal song?
Eminem,"That and 'If I Have', but I got songs on this next album that are even more personal and go even deeper into that shit. I'm going a little bit more of a serious route now. My shit was real political but people didn't see it like that, they thought I was just being an asshole. I look at the way I came up and the things I was around and the places I was raised and shit, and I figure, that shit made me what I am. So if people perceive me to be an asshole, the way I live made me an asshole, what I been through has made me an asshole."
Interviewer,"There was a rumour that you had recorded a song with Marilyn Manson, a prequel to the controversial track '97 Bonnie & Clyde'..."
Eminem,"With Marilyn Manson? Nah, rumours, rumours. But yeah, the track is done. I don't want to give it away, I'll just say it's like some movie shit. I got a lot of songs on this album that are like movie plots, twisted stories."
Interviewer,Your little girl Hailie Jade is four this Christmas. Do you still speak to her every day?
Eminem,"I just got off the phone with her a little bit ago. She's talking up a storm, man, she talks a lot. I want to try to get her into some kind of acting or something, she got this little personality that's incredible. She loves to talk. She'll say shit out of the blue, big words that I didn't even know she knew. She'll look at it as a joke."
Interviewer,Are you still writing songs on Ecstasy?
Eminem,"A couple of the songs on the new record were written on X. It exaggerates shit. Somebody will be just looking at me wrong and I'll just flip a table over, like, what the fuck are you staring at?! If you're in a good mood you love everybody, but if you're in a bad mood and you got shit on your mind, you're gonna break down and shit. The hardest shit that I've fucked with is X and 'shrooms."
Interviewer,A music industry commentator once claimed that you were making money exploiting the world's misery. Isn't it more accurate to say that you're making money exploiting your own misery?
Eminem,"That woulda been a better choice of words, but looking at him, I don't think he was able to come up with a good choice of words. Looking at his picture I expected him to say that about me. If people don't like my shit it's not my problem. If you don't like it don't listen to it. Nobody's fucking forcing you to listen to it. Nobody bought you the album, threw it in your CD, tied you up and made you listen."
Interviewer,Are you feeling good about the album at this point?
Eminem,"Um, that's a tough question, man. For the most part, yeah. But I don't know if I ever feel totally great about a record when I put it out. With every record that I put out, someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when I listen to my own music, I just hear flaws in it. Like I hear 'Oh ! I could have done this better or that better!' And I'll work it to death. Obviously if I wasn't comfortable with it, I wouldn't put it out. But from the beginning, ever since my career started, I don't know if I've ever been totally like, this is completely it."
Interviewer,"In this last crunch, what have you been working on?"
Eminem,"I guess you would say last minute jitters of ! Are the vocals loud enough? Can you hear what I'm saying on this part? Is the beat right? Are the vocals too loud?' If I could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that I rapped over and put them out, I would do that. 'Cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it."
Interviewer,But you're not changing lyrics or anything like that? It's just all mix and sound stuff?
Eminem,"It's just sonic  that needs to be worked out for the most part, because when I decide to keep a song, that's pretty much it. Like, if it doesn't work, I pretty much know right away, right when I get it in the car and take it home."
Interviewer,So why did you dye your hair blonde again?
Eminem,"Um, I'll say that one was  it."
Interviewer,Did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording?
Eminem,"Not really, honestly. Because I already had most of the songs. And I don't know if I'm gonna keep it like this or how long I'm gonna keep it. But for right now it is what it is. And I feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record."
Interviewer,"For Recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff. You recorded 100 songs or something, or at least you had 100 beats. So was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around?"
Eminem,"I feel like right now I'm probably working harder than I've ever worked in my life. And I've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during The Eminem Show, which is a little hazy 'cause just so much  was going on at that time. Just being so busy with The Eminem Show and doing the 8 Mile movie, and the soundtrack and the score to the movie. This is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly."
Interviewer,That's crazy.
Eminem,"Once I had the direction that I wanted to go, and you know calling it The Marshall Mathers LP 2, obviously I knew that there might be certain expectations. Like, I wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that. So I wanted to make sure that I had the right songs to be able to call it that. So, a lot of recording. A lot of songs that people probably will never hear. We hit a couple of road blocks. There were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever. And just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like,  man! I feel like it needs this or this to paint the whole picture."
Interviewer,"A lot of people, maybe even you, think the original is your best album."
Eminem,"It's probably my favorite. I think some of them are my favorites for different reasons. Hate to even say that about my own record, but I mean the first three records, I think they may have captured a time period. And then I think I pretty much probably have publicly said, you know, Encore and Relapse wasn't it was just a different time."
Interviewer,"You've been hard on Relapse, but Tyler, the Creator says that it's his favorite hip-hop record in years. He loves that record."
Eminem,"Yeah, he tells me that every time I see him. I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like Ha ha this is funny! You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and ! I can think straight again! So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the ground. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it."
Interviewer,"On Recovery, obviously the world came to you on that one. How do you feel now about that record?"
Eminem,"I feel like that record I finally got back to where I was at maybe during The Eminem Show. Like, creatively and songwriting, I guess. I mean obviously Recovery was the first time I had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp. Aside from working with Dre, it was like I always wanted to produce my own records, because producing is fun to me too. One of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had choruses on them. It's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words. Because my own hooks, I already know what I mean when I write them. The way that I do music is, like, regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have, I always want to try to go as hard lyrically as I can. So regardless if the beat feels like Wow maybe this could be played on the radio, I'm not like, Maybe radio would play this so I'll just wing it. Like, I always have looked at it like I want to approach every record from an MCs' aspect."
Interviewer,So how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP? How did you decide to make your life miserable like that?
Eminem,Well here's what it is: It's not necessarily a sequel.
Interviewer,Okay.
Eminem,"As much as it is a revisitation like this is a different time period in my life. So there's not gonna be like, continuations of every song or anything like that. To me, it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia. One of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new, older breakbeats and sounds and , and try to make it current, like bring it up to date."
Interviewer,So did seeking out Rick Rubin come from that direction? You were like Why don't I go back to the source?
Eminem,"Paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and I was like,  man. Another thing with this record is that I kind of got back into producing more. On Recovery, I wanted to focus more on writing, and not have to worry about making the beats. On Relapse I think it was mostly all Dre. So I kind of started producing again a little bit. I was kind of in the middle of that when Paul had mentioned that, and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and I don't know if that's what made Paul reach out to Rick or if Rick reached out to him. But as soon as I heard he was interested I was like, Yo, just let me finish this up and let's go see him."
Interviewer,You've called Rick Yoda was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career?
Eminem,"Learning I did. Um, yeah, I mean the best part about Rick's vibe is he's very Zen-like in the sense of just Let it happen. The weird thing about it is nine times out 10, we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right, you know. He's almost like a coach."
Interviewer,"He's very psychological, right?"
Eminem,"Yeah the guy's got his shoes off. , it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it. Not that it's off-time or anything like that, but it's just like it's fucking weird. I don't even know how to explain it. You just know that he scratched it. I don't know if that even makes sense or not. It's like a simple scratch, like a basic kind of thing, but it's so fucking dope when you hear it. It's just, it's vintage him. And plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit."
Interviewer,Did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio?
Eminem,"Oh, he's got some  in the stash. Yeah. Definitely."
Interviewer,So much has changed in hip-hop since you started producing did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff?
Eminem,"Um, not necessarily, because like I feel like I just do whatever feels right. Obviously I pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse. But I don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing. That's no offense to anyone else."
Interviewer,"Basically, if there are outside influences that are current, you let that come in from the other producers, but your ."
Eminem,"Yeah. That's exactly it. More current-sounding shit I leave to them. And not that I don't feel like my  sounds current, but it's not the exact same thing. And I think I've updated as well."
Interviewer,On the new song Legacy you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid. What does it take to get back in that mindset at your age?
Eminem,"I always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said, He ain't  or bullied or whatever. It felt like one of them self-empowerment songs. Everybody, I believe, wants to show the world that, One day I'm gonna be this. One day I'm gonna be that. Everybody has goals, aspirations or whatever, and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them. Like, if you haven't been kicked or whatever, if you never went through. . ."
Interviewer,Tribulations.
Eminem,"Tribulations and fucking like that, then you're perfect and fuck you anyways. So everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted. Like, You don't matter. Oh yeah? I'm gonna show you. So it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy into what I leave behind when I'm gone. And I always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me. There's many, many songs that got me through a lot of shit."
Interviewer,I just love that you rhyme Onyx with comics on that song.
Eminem,"I don't know if anyone will get this, like this is super-nerdy, but the rhyming words in that song never change. And that's just one of the things that I do to try to challenge myself. I wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed."
Interviewer,"You've praised the Beastie Boys' evolution, but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a the disrespect for women has got to be through moment."
Eminem,"I mean, listen, my sense of humor has certainly not gone away. I realize that I'm an adult, a grown-ass man, and I don't know what I'll be doing a year from now, 10 years from now, but I don't think that my tongue-in-cheekness will ever go away. I guess it's just a part of my personality. I always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well. If one song is darker or talking about a sad subject, I don't want to make a whole album of that, of being a downer. I don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity. You gotta try and find that right balance, and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting. In other words, recording till I get it. And if I record 100 fucking songs and I don't have what I feel like I need yet to make the body of work, then I'm gonna keep going and keep recording."
Interviewer,"You've written a bunch of your own hooks, and even sing some of them. Where does your sense of melody come from?"
Eminem,"That's a good question. I would want to say that it's stemming from early hip-hop. Rappers used to  Hey young world those kind of things. Maybe I took it somewhere different at times, I don't know."
Interviewer,Maybe it's just pure instinct.
Eminem,"Honestly, that's probably what it is. I don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but I just don't know where I get that sense from, you know what I'm saying? I'm not a singer singer. I just know what's in key and what's not."
Interviewer,"Having Kendrick Lamar on your album, did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you?"
Eminem,"I completely respect what Kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp, that he's on Aftermath, only made sense to me. He came to Detroit, we kicked it for a few minutes, you know, and I felt the vibe of what he's like and everything, and you know, he's a super cool and super humble dude. When we did that record, I think that was actually a week or two before he did the verse to Control."
Interviewer,Is there advice you would give him at this point?
Eminem,"I don't know if he needs advice. He seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders, man. He's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one. He's like a hip-hop head, man, he just loves hip-hop. And obviously the way that he did the Control verse, it was almost like if you get mad at him, then you might look foolish. He set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that  he said because it was what every other MC is already thinking. Or you should be thinking."
Interviewer,"Fundamentally, do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog?"
Eminem,"I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole Rap God record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that's why Kendrick's verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking, If you don't want to be the best, then why are you rapping?"
Interviewer,"I was only able to listen the new album once before talking to you, and I gotta say, hearing tracks like ""Untouchable"" and ""Like Home,"" where you're rapping about systemic racism and politics-."
Eminem,I know where you're going.
Interviewer,Where am I going?
Eminem,You want to know how I can rap about that stuff and also rap about fucking ridiculous shit.
Interviewer,"Yeah, though maybe I'd use a different word than ridiculous. There's some dissonance hearing you, in the space of a couple tracks, go from trying to be good-faith woke about race and politics to being rough about women. Do those poles just coexist more peacefully for you than they do for me?"
Eminem,"They do, and how you think those things go together depends on what kind of fan of my music you are. Sometimes I'm trying to appease people who think, Man, I miss when Eminem was raw. But I'm not killing KimKim Scott, Eminem's ex-wife (the couple were twice-married and twice-divorced) and the mother of his daughter, Hailie, makes frequent cameos in his lyrics as a kind of negative muse. After the release of Eminem's ""Kim"" in 2000, she sued him for defamation. on songs anymore, we're good now, and she's the mother of my daughter. The truth is that going from one subject to a completely different one is a balancing act and I'm trying to give something to everyone. And as far as the attitude I have about those different subjects, I feel like I did when first I started out."
Interviewer,Meaning what?
Eminem,"Meaning I'm the same person. That's not to say I haven't matured, I've grown and sometimes I want to reflect that, but when I'm writing, a line will pop in my head that's so fucking ridiculous that it's funny, and depending on the punch lines I need and the rhyme schemes in the song maybe I'll use it. Those are the things I'm thinking about with some lyrics, almost before the actual meaning. There's a song on the new album, ""Nowhere Fast,"" and I say, ""I must have got you / In somewhat of a debacle / Because some stuff that's awful / Really don't mean nothing. There's a lot of shit I say in jest / That is tough to swallow."" You know, there's a book called Truly Tasteless Jokes; it's all fucked up shit; it makes me laugh, and that kind of stuff is where my brain goes. I'm not saying I've never gone too far, but people shouldn't be looking to me for political correctness."
Interviewer,"Except when you want them to, right? They involve politics more than political correctness but there are tracks on Revival where it sure seems like you're asking people to take you seriously."
Eminem,"Okay, it does depend on the song. People who know my music can tell when I'm joking around and when I'm being honest about a subject."
Interviewer,A subject like Trump?
Eminem,"He makes my blood boil. I can't even watch the news anymore because it makes me too stressed out. All jokes aside, all punch lines aside, I'm trying to get a message out there about him. I want our country to be great too, I want it to be the best it can be, but it's not going to be that with him in charge. I remember when he was first sniffing around politics, I thought, We've tried everything else, why not him? Then, and I was watching it live, he had that speech where he said Mexico is sending us rapists and criminals. I got this feeling of what the fuck? From that point on, I knew it was going to be bad with him. What he's doing putting people against each other is scary fucking shit. His election was such a disappointment to me about the state of the country."
Interviewer,"When you were talking about Trump on the Shade 45 radio show, you sounded almost annoyed that he didn't respond to your freestyleFor the BET Hip Hop Awards in October, Eminem released a freestyle titled ""The Storm,"" a four-minute, odd-metered roast of President Trump, and his supporters: ""Any fan of mine who's a supporter of his / I'm drawing in the sand, a line / You're either for or against."" The performance has been viewed more than 41 million times on YouTube. about him. What do you want him to hear you say?"
Eminem,"It's not so much about him hearing something I have to say, because there's nothing I'm saying about him on Revival that he doesn't already know about himself. It's more that I want him to answer me because I got ideas for all kinds of shit to say back to him if he does."
Interviewer,You've got the tweets pre-written?
Eminem,"I'm not going to give any away now, but I've got lines ready if he says something about me. I get almost flustered thinking about him, that's how angry he makes me. The people that support him are the people he cares about the least and they don't even realize it. At what point do you, a working-class citizen, someone who's trying to make shit better for you and your family, think this guy who's never known struggle his entire fucking life, who avoided the military because of bone spurs, who says he's a billionaire, is really looking out for you? He's got people brainwashed."
Interviewer,How do you hope the Trump presidency plays out in 2018?
Eminem,I hope he gets impeached. I'd be there for that.
Interviewer,Your music is popular in some of the same parts of the country where Trump's support is strongest. How do you reconcile your feelings about Trump with the likelihood that a lot of your fans like him too?
Eminem,"How do I account for that? He's very good at smoke screens. He's very good at flipping narratives. I just want people to think about things: What has he really done for you in the year since he's been in office? The tax cut is not going to help the middle class. It's going to help Donald Trump. That people don't see that is so discouraging. You know, there was even a time when I was mad at what was going on."
Interviewer,Mad that people were supporting Trump?
Eminem,"Yeah, Trump had me so mad with all his bullshit that I was thinking, I hope everybody who voted for him gets fucked and learns a lesson. But that was wrong. I don't want any voters to get fucked; everyone's trying to improve their lives. I just feel mad that Trump's sold people a dream that's never coming true. I want the division in this country to stop. And like I said, I most want people to take a second and think about what I'm saying."
Interviewer,"Seventeen or eighteen years ago, when you were first breaking through in a big way, you were being held up as this scary embodiment of white-working-class alienation. People said you were tapping into the same feelings that Trump is now tapping into, and speaking for the same."
Eminem,"I was speaking for everybody: white, black, whatever nationality."
Interviewer,The way you looked probably made a difference as to who was identifying with you most strongly.
Eminem,That's fair. That's true.
Interviewer,"So given your position, do you feel like you have any unique insights on Trumpism?"
Eminem,"I did have a feeling early that he could win. Pretty much everyone I knew was like, ""No, he can't get elected"" and I was watching those rallies going, ""Yo, man, this shit is real."" But I don't know if that has anything to do with any parallels between me and him. I took the fact I was poor white trash and I owned it. So I could understand why people who grew up in similar situations would relate to what I was saying. But I don't know, man, the differences between me and him are bigger than any parallels. He's made the racists come out. He's made it acceptable for the white man to feel oppressed. I'm just calling bullshit bullshit: I actually don't know if I can see why people who relate to me feel like they can relate to him. This is a guy who was born rich, who says he got a small loan from his father of a million dollars. Where I come from, a small loan is five fucking bucks."
Interviewer,"Considering the apparent overlap between your supporters and Trump's supporters, I do think it took some courage for you to be so explicit about your political feelings, it's easy enough to go online and see that you did alienate fans. But what about artists who aren't willing to take that risk? I'm thinking of someone like Taylor Swift, who is so good about speaking to certain issues that seem antithetical to Trump's worldview, but then won't take the next step and speak out about him. Do musicians with a massive platform, and a bipartisan audience, have a moral responsibility to engage with politics?"
Eminem,"I don't know anything about Taylor Swift's situation. I can only speak for me, not her. I do feel like when you have a platform, it's important to use your voice. You can loudly call bullshit on things that not everyone can. I don't know if anyone has a responsibility to do that. That's something they'd have to look inside themselves and figure out. That's what I did, and I decided I needed to speak out."
Interviewer,"What do you think of Kid RockA fellow Michigander and a stalwart Trump supporter, the rap-rocker (born Robert Ritchie), seemingly teased a Senate run earlier this year. Also earlier this year: Fans at a Detroit Pistons home game booed Kid Rock and cheered Eminem when the two were shown, separately, on a video screen during a break in play.'s politics?"
Eminem,"You mean him running for Senate? Me and Bob have been friends since way back in the day, but I haven't spoken to him in a while. The last time I did was when the thing happened to his assistant. I reached out and told him I was here for him. As far as the politics, I'm not up on what he's doing. I couldn't tell if he really wanted to run for senator or was just fucking around."
Interviewer,"This interview will run after the album's been out for a few days. In all likelihood, Revival will sell wellEminem is the highest-selling rapper of all time, with over 130 million units sold since 1996. All his albums since The Marshall Mathers LP have debuted on top of the Billboard 200. and have a pretty mixed critical reaction."
Eminem,That's what happens every album with me.
Interviewer,"Okay, so if we know that's going to happen, what other signs are you looking for that will make you feel encouraged or discouraged by the album's reception?"
Eminem,"I don't know, I've always felt in touch with the people who listen to my music. I make it for them. Anybody else, fuck 'em. It's fine if critics or whoever keep thinking I'm not as good as I was. So what I'm looking for, whatever the response or the sales, is things I did right or things I could've improved musically. I'm critical of myself and I'm always trying to figure out how to do better. I certainly have not had a perfect career. I've put out bad albums."
Interviewer,Which ones are you thinking of?
Eminem,"EncoreThe 2004 album Encore doesn't carry any of Eminem's career highlights, but it still managed to sell over 1.5 million units in its first week. It's his only major-label album to date that didn't win a Grammy for Best Rap Album. Tracks like the virulently anti-George W. Bush ""Mosh,"" though, presaged the political content on Revival. was mediocre, and with RelapseThe 2009 album Relapse ended a five-year recording hiatus and reintroduced the Slim Shady alter ego, along with a host of other voices. The album is generally thought of as, at least in part, a tribute to horrorcore rap, which accounts for its often violent, gory tone., it was the best I could do at that point in time.  was a funny album for me because I was just starting back rapping after coming out of addiction. I was so scatterbrained that the people around me thought that I might have given myself brain damage. I was in this weird fog for months. Like, literally I wasn't making sense; it had been so long since I'd done vocals without a ton of Valium and VicodinAround 2002, Eminem began using Ambien, Valium, and extra-strength Vicodin. After the death of his friend the rapper Proof in a club shooting in 2006, he was consuming ""40 to 60 Valium"" and ""maybe 20, 30"" Vicodin a day. In December of 2007, after introducing methadone to the habit, he overdosed and missed Christmas with his children, prompting his path toward sobriety.. I almost had to relearn how to rap."
Interviewer,Is that where all the weird accents on that album came from?
Eminem,"I recorded at least 50 to 60 songs for that album and on each one I would get a little more drastic with the accents, trying to bend the words and make them rhyme in ways they wouldn't if you just said them regular. It was this gradual thing and I didn't even realize how accent-heavy the album got. PaulPaul Rosenberg has managed Eminem since the recording of The Marshall Mathers LP, and co-founded Shady Records with the rapper in 1999. He's also a recurring character on Eminem's inter-song skits, playing the straitlaced lawyer asking him to ""tone it down a little bit."" Rosenberg was recently named CEO of the iconic hip-hop record label Def Jam, a position he's expected to assume in early 2018.  didn't realize it either until he went and played the music for somebody at Interscope and they were like, ""Why is he doing all those accents?"" So yeah, I don't know how much replay value that album has."
Interviewer,What was the issue with Encore?
Eminem,"I'm cool with probably half that album. I recorded that towards the height of my addiction. I remember four songs leaked and I had to go to L.A. and get DreSince first hearing Eminem's '97 Slim Shady EP, NWA member, producer, Aftermath founder, and Beats Electronics CEO Dr. Dre has had an influential hand in Eminem's career, co-producing all of his albums. and record new ones. I was in a room by myself writing songs in 25, 30 minutes because we had to get it done, and what came out was so goofy. That's how I ended up making songs like ""Rain Man"" and ""Big Weenie."" They're pretty out there. If those other songs hadn't leaked, Encore would've been a different album."
Interviewer,How are you feeling about Revival?
Eminem,I don't know. I feel good enough to put it out. I guess we'll have to see what the reaction is.
Interviewer,"One of things that was so compelling about you back in the day was how you'd take shots at pop stars, which is something you don't really do anymore. Why not? Isn't Ed Sheeran, who's on the new album, exactly the kind of musician you would've had fun with in the early 2000s?"
Eminem,"I don't think so. He's not a boy band, he's an artist whose craft I respect. The reason that I went at pop stars back then is because people were calling me a pop rapper. What's bugged out to me is that, I don't know if everybody understands this, if everybody could do what I did, they'd just do it wouldn't they? I'm not this manufactured pop thing and I never was. A way people used to dismiss me was to call me pop. I got mad about that, and I lashed out."
Interviewer,How has your experience of fame changed over your career?
Eminem,"I've learned to deal with it better. A lot of the problems I had with fame early on were because I was in very heavy addiction and didn't realize it. By the time I did realize it, it was too late, I was so far gone. I had a hair-trigger temper, too, and the littlest things could trigger it. That's definitely better now. I used to get in fights over road rage and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that I've settled in with myself and with fame. I'm growing, man. I'm getting more mature and I'm okay with that."
Interviewer,Does maturity explain the beard?
Eminem,"No, no. The beard spawned from looking at myself in a picture that was taken when I was 23 and I had this little patchy goatee. I saw that and wanted to see if I could grow a beard now."
Interviewer,I think the jury's still out.
Eminem, The beard is the best I can do at this point in time.
Interviewer,"I was looking at your streaming numbers the other day and ""Lose YourselfA laboratory-perfect pump-up song, the lead single from the 8 Mile soundtrack has been streamed almost half-a-billion times on Spotify. ""Lose Yourself"" won Best Original Song at the 2003 Oscars, won two Grammys in 2004, and inspired the ""Mom's spaghetti"" meme."" is by far your most popular track. What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about that song?"
Eminem,"I remember I was on the set of 8 Mile. I had a day off and I was going through CDs at home. I used to have guys come in and play music with me and I'd try and come up with stuff and then record it and put on CD. Later I'd listen back and see if there was anything I could use. For some reason I popped in one of those CDs and it had the  on it. I just kept hearing that loop in my head. I don't know if a lot of people know this, but I made a whole song to that beat and didn't like it. Then I revamped it and wound up with ""Lose Yourself."" The other thing about that song that I remember is that I was so in-character as Jimmy Smith Jr.In 8 Mile, Eminem played Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith Jr., an autoworker and aspiring rapper who embarrasses himself at Detroit's blue-ribbon freestyle challenge, then comes back to win it à la Rocky Balboa. The vaguely autobiographical 2002 drama was a hit, earning over $240 million at the box office. when I was working that on it, that's where the desperation come from."
Interviewer,Why didn't you star in another movie after 8 Mile? You must've gotten a bunch of offers.
Eminem,I had a few.
Interviewer,9 Mile?
Eminem,"I used to say that exact same joke. Nothing's come my way that's been worth putting aside the music for. For me to take a year again, like I did with 8 Mile, is not something I really want to do."
Interviewer,Where does Eminem fit into the rap landscape now?
Eminem,I don't know what my place is. I just try to make the best songs that I can.
Interviewer,"But isn't ""Walk on Water"" all about the insecurity you feel about your place in music?"
Eminem,"Yeah, look, obviously everybody wants to be relevant but it's hard to tell if you are or not. I can't sit on the Internet all day and read comments trying to figure it out. Rick RubinThe hip-hop architect, superstar producer, and Def Jam co-founder first worked with Eminem on the 2013 single (and Beastie Boys throwback) ""Berzerk."" Eminem recently appeared on the inaugural episode of Rubin and Malcolm Gladwell's podcast Broken Record, and in the past, Rubin has called Eminem ""a real, unbelievable student of hip-hop."" recently told me something that was profound. He said, ""I don't really consider myself smart enough to know what everyone's going to think, so I just do what feels right to me."" That is super deep, and that's what I try and do."
Interviewer,"I totally get that, but I'm still eager to hear you wrestle a little more with the question: Where is the 45-year-old Eminem's place in rap today?"
Eminem,"As far as relevance, rap is definitely evolving, the flow patterns and beats. There's a lot of trap beats that are half time and things like that that are new. Some of it I really like and some I don't particularly care for but I can see why people like it. I'm probably more in tune with the state of hip-hop than a lot of people think, because listening to what's great right now pumps me up to do my own thing. I think people look at me and believe I might be out of touch."
Interviewer,"I don't know exactly who's looking at you and thinking you're out of touch, but if that person is, say, a 17-year-old, shouldn't they be thinking that? Isn't that how music is supposed to work?"
Eminem,"I get the part about not liking what your parents like, but we're also in this weird place where 40-somethings can listen to music with their kids who might be 20-somethings and they can all like the same thing. This is making me think about Jay-Z. What I love about him is that he's figured out a way to stay relevant without conforming. He's so good at what he does that he makes people follow him, which is super interesting because one of the things that's great about hip-hop is that it hasn't been around so long that we know what a full career is supposed to look like."
Interviewer,"There are plenty of models for what middle-aged rock stardom looks like, but not so much for rap."
Eminem,"Yeah, rap is still very youth driven, and it has this rebellious edge."
Interviewer,It's hard to be rebellious when you're 45.
Eminem,"I think it's more about passion for me now than rebellion. Passion is what you need to still do music. It's cool that a younger generation can look to me and Jay and say, ""Holy shit, a career doesn't have to be a five-year run."" I know I look at Jay to see what he's passionate about. I'm right there when he puts out something new. I want to see where he's at, then I use it to see where I'm at."
Interviewer,"What'd you take away from 4:44On his 13th album, 4:44, Jay-Z sorts out his feelings on middle-age issues like marriage, infidelity, and the big-picture thoughts that come with a billion-dollar, his-and-hers net worth.?"
Eminem,"For me, it's super nerdy because I just look for the funny punch lines, Jay's always got those, and the feel of the beats he's rapping over. His music also let me know that it's okay to talk about the doubts you have about yourself and your material. That's really what ""Walk on Water"" is about."
Interviewer,"Can you talk more about the nerdy aspect of rapping? The way you rap, which is so much about technical proficiency, is not what's currently in style. Does that affect how you think about what you do? You have to know that your music is hitting the ears of younger listeners differently than it's hitting your own."
Eminem,"It's something I think about, and on the album I move in and out of flows to show that not everything I do is about being technical. But on a technical level, I've been rapping for so long that, I'm not going to say it's easy, but I can just think of more shit to rhyme with other shit. One of my regrets on the last album was putting out verses that were too long because I couldn't get the rhymes to stop. I kept thinking of rhymes that kept the scheme going. That ability is something that makes a difference for me, and it's why on a technical level I'm doing intricate stuff. It's just easier for me to rhyme than when I first started."
Interviewer,Which younger rappers have technical skills that you admire?
Eminem,"Joyner Lucas, Kendrick, J. Cole, Big Sean, they're super complex but also digestible. One of the things that's so interesting to me about Kendrick is the way he approaches a beat and the pockets he chooses. Tech N9ne is great at that too. They'll both hit these weird fucking pockets."
Interviewer,Do you find it hard to balance technique and content?
Eminem,"Yeah, that's difficult. That's how I ended up throwing out a lot of songs I recorded for this album. Sometimes I'll realize when a song is done that it's just words, it's not saying anything. There's no message, no concept. I'll record a song and play it in the car and be like, ""This ain't about nothing."" That obviously means it's not good enough."
Interviewer,"Looking back at your career as a celebrity, not as a musician, is there a moment that stands out being especially weird or surreal?"
Eminem,As far as what?
Interviewer,"Where you're like, ""I can't believe that was a thing?""."
Eminem,"That's a hard question. ""I can't believe that was a thing?"" Let me think."
Interviewer,How about having a feud with a puppet dog?
Eminem,"Yeah, the fight with TriumphA character created by Saturday Night Live alum Robert Smigel, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is a puppet Rottweiler who smokes cigars and insults random people and celebrities, a kind of canine Don Rickles. At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, Triumph tried to kid Eminem during the telecast, but Eminem angrily shoved the puppet dog out of his face. Two years later, on the track ""Ass Like That,"" Eminem rapped three verses of oversexed parody in the voice of Triumph. the insult dog was definitely a weird one. At that point in my career I still wasn't that far removed from the way I grew up, and the way I grew up was that it's not cool for somebody to put their hand in your face. So in that moment I didn't look at it like, This is a puppet. I looked at it as, A grown man is putting his hand in my face and being annoying. So that's why I flipped out."
Interviewer,"When you're not making music, what do you do for fun?"
Eminem,"Aside from writing? Mostly I love writing, especially when it's not pressure-writing for a release date or something. Yeah, writing is something I really enjoy. I'll just start to think of rhymes and get lost doing that."
Interviewer,I think writing lyrics counts as making music. Tell me something else.
Eminem,"I used to watch the news, before it made me crazy. I don't know, I see movies."
Interviewer,What'd you see lately that you liked?
Eminem,"The Tupac movieNamed after the last Tupac album to be released while he was alive, All Eyez on Me is a straight-ahead biopic starring Demetrius Shipp Jr. in his acting debut as Shakur. Vulture's Emily Yoshida wrote that the movie was ""rarely more than a faithful adaptation of the rapper's Wikipedia entry."". I saw it twice."
Interviewer,No one bothers you at the theater?
Eminem,I rent out the theater.
Interviewer,"Oh, of course."
Eminem,I've tried to go like normal and it hasn't worked out too well.
Interviewer,What about TV and books?
Eminem,"I don't know about books, I can't process things I read except for my own writing. I have to go back and read the same pages over again all the time. As far as TV shows, Power is one of my favorites. Westworld. Breaking Bad. Sons of Anarchy. Godless. Have you seen that? Fucking incredible."
Interviewer,Do you date?
Eminem,It's tough. Since my divorce I've had a few dates and nothing's panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public. Dating's just not where I'm at lately.
Interviewer,"When you were dating, how'd you meet people? Tinder?"
Eminem,"I mean, yeah."
Interviewer,Are you being serious?
Eminem,"Yeah, Tinder."
Interviewer,Really?
Eminem, And Grindr. I also used to go to strip clubs.
Interviewer,I think a lot of long-term relationships start in strip clubs.
Eminem,What can I say? Going to strip clubs is how I was meeting some chicks. It was an interesting time for me.
Interviewer,Is fame lonely for you?
Eminem,"Am I lonely? No, I'm good. Thanks for asking though."
Interviewer,"When you were watching the news, what news were you watching?"
Eminem,"A lot of CNN and a little bit of Fox, but that shit was making me want to jump through the TV and choke somebody. The way they'd talk about NFL protests: ""These athletes are making how much money?"" You fucking idiot! The Fox right-wing guys criticize Black Lives Matter for not being peaceful and then when a football player peacefully takes a knee they criticize that too. They say this shit about, ""We just want football. We don't want to hear about your political problems."" To me, what they're really saying is, ""Shut up, N-word."" It's bullshit."
Interviewer,"From where you're sitting, does the country seem any further along on race than when you started rapping?"
Eminem,"Well, one of the greatest things that I get to do is play shows. And when I look out in the crowd and it's a sea of different kinds of people, that's one of the most gratifying feelings I get. Nothing brings people together like music and if we, white fans and black fans, can realize we all like the same things, we should be able to realize we're not so different. That belief is always encouraging for me. The discouraging thing, I remember when I was a kid, I didn't really believe that cops could be planting evidence or shooting unarmed black people, then to see all the evidence of it from the past few years has been sickening. The Michael Brown shootingOn August 9, 2014, white police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old African-American. Brown's death prompted civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, and acted as a tipping point, sparking the Black Lives Matter movement. In March of 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice cleared Wilson of civil-rights violations in the shooting, though a DOJ investigation found that the Ferguson Police Department at large engaged in a ""pattern or practice of unlawful conduct"" that violates ""the 1st, 4th, and 14th Amendments."", disgusting. Walter Scott, where the video looks like Michael SlagerOn April 4, 2015, the white police officer Michael Slager shot and killed Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, after a routine traffic stop in North Charleston, South Carolina. Slager claimed that Scott had grabbed at his Taser, though video of the shooting shows Slager firing at Scott as he was running away, then seeming to plant an object, presumably the Taser, near his body. In December of 2017, Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison for second-degree murder. is trying to place the Taser beside his body, you look at that shit and it's a gut punch. I thought we were farther along than we are."
Interviewer,"I know this is a clunky segue, but you've always been careful not to offend on the subject of race. Yet on the subjects of women or gay people, there's the Ken KaniffOriginally created by the Detroit rapper Aristotle, Ken Kaniff is a recurring character in Eminem's skits who sings homophobic parodies of Eminem songs and makes phone-sex calls to the rapper. character you used to have on your albums, you clearly weren't concerned at all about being offensive. How do you calibrate who you're okay with risking offending?"
Eminem,"I've always said that what I do was created by black people. I understand that everyone listens to rap, but I consider it to be black music and I respect that. The other shit you're talking about got so blown out of proportion. The first time I got a taste of being called anti-gay was on ""My Name Is"" when I said, ""My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high / The only problem was my English teacher was a guy."" All I was saying was I don't swing that way. So when I started getting flack for it, I thought, Alright, you people think I'm homophobicEminem has long been accused of homophobia and misogyny in his music. Though the rapper has said he supports gay marriage and has ""no issues with"" gay or transgender people, he was using anti-gay epithets in his lyrics as recently as 2014. Toward women, there's often a lens of irony or parody between Eminem and his  music, but extreme sexual aggression and violent fantasies about women are lyrical wells from which he frequently draws.? Watch this. Hence the Ken Kaniff character and all that stuff. I was trying to push the buttons of people who were calling me something that I wasn't. The honest-to-God truth is that none of that matters to me: I have no issue with someone's sexuality, religion, race, none of that. Anyone who's followed my music knows I'm against bullies, that's why I hate that fucking bully Trump, and I hate the idea that a kid who's gay might get shit for it."
Interviewer,"Is the criticism of your music as misogynistic off base, too?"
Eminem,"I think it is, because I've had my share of experiences with women where I've felt a certain way and been mad enough to make songs about those feelings. All the bullshit around that, I'm not making an excuse, but the mentality that I've had since I was rapping at open mics was that you better have shit that's going to get a reaction or you will not be accepted when you're on the mic. Your first, second, third, and fourth line better grab attention or you're done. That attitude morphed into my music. A lot of times I'm saying stuff just to get that reaction. Maybe I took it too far sometimes."
Interviewer,"I've heard comedians talk about the ""mouth full of blood"" laugh, which is when you make a joke and the audience laughs for the wrong reasons. Have you ever been concerned about your fans misunderstanding your material like that?"
Eminem,"Yeah, I'm sure people have misunderstood what I was doing. Again, I'm not a perfect human being and I'm sure that I've said things that went a little too hard, but I think my actual life shows, I mean, meeting Elton JohnDuring the peak of homophobia accusations against him, Eminem asked Elton John to perform ""Stan"" with him at the 2001 Grammys. In Rolling Stone, John later wrote that if the gay community ""didn't have the intelligence to see his intelligence, that was their problem."" The pair have remained friends, and Eminem has frequently cited John as instrumental in his sobriety. and being as good friends with him as I am, that's not me saying, ""Hey, I've got a gay friend."" It's me saying Elton John has my back. He'll stick up for me."
Interviewer,"Speaking of Elton, I just read something where he said you gave him diamond-encrusted cock rings as a wedding present. Just out of curiosity, where does one get diamond-encrusted cock rings?"
Eminem,"I don't know, I put people on it and they made it happen. Actually, I had some diamond-encrusted cock rings, too. Right in my bedroom."
Interviewer,You could've saved some money and sent him those.
Eminem,"And just left a note: ""Please wash off before using.""."
Interviewer,Have your feelings about making music changed over time? The conventional critical wisdom about your stuff is that it's gotten emotionally and sonically harder and heavier at the expense of lightness and playfulness. Does that ring true?
Eminem,"It's interesting you say that because one of the common themes I've noticed over the past few years is people saying they miss the old Eminem. So I'll see something like that and I'll give them the old Eminem. Then when I do, they say, ""He's too old to be rapping about that kind of shit. He needs to mature with his content."" Then I'll mature with my content and they go, ""Oh, man, I miss the old Eminem."" So what do you do? In the context of Revival, I tried to make something for people on both sides of that argument."
Interviewer,"Just to go back to the question, though: Are the emotions you feel making music different than they were 20 years ago?"
Eminem,"They're the same. The passion is the same, and when that changes, and eventually it will, is probably when it's time to call it quits. I'm still at the place where I want to lock myself in the house for two days straight and just write. I don't know when that'll change. I remember I had a conversation with Busta Rhymes when he came to Detroit and we did ""Calm DownBoth known for their near-impossible word-per-minute rapping, Eminem and Busta Rhymes collaborated on ""Calm Down"" in 2014. From Eminem's dense verse: ""Son of God, I'm the S.O.G / Like a wet log, pores never get clogged / 'cause I'm so full of self-esteem that I sweat fog."""" together. He and I were talking about what you do when you get to a certain age, which maybe people never expected you to get to, and you still feel like you've got it. What do you do? I think you just keep going."
Interviewer,"How close to the peak of your capabilities do you think you are right now? I think I remember reading something Bob Dylan said about how in the mid-'60s the music flowed from him in a way it never really did after. He could still find inspiration, but not quite like in those days. I know this is a corny way of putting it, but do you feel like you're as close to the fire as you've always been?"
Eminem,"In some ways yes and in some ways no. I will say this: I am forever chasing The Marshall Mathers LP Released in 2000, Eminem's third album is home to some of his most aggressive, creative, violent, popular, controversial, and best work. It's the album that prompted Lynne Cheney to condemn him on the Senate floor, and has sold more than 11 million copies. In 2013, Eminem released a sequel album, The Marshall Mathers LP. That was the height of what I could do. I just don't have the rage I did back then. If I did, the music would be the same, and I hope it's changed. And if I still had that rage it would mean I wouldn't have grown as an artist or a human being. Technically I feel like I'm better at rhyming than I've ever been. I have more shit in my arsenal. I'll go back and listen to old songs and be like, ""I could have kept that rhyme scheme going for another 62 bars."" I don't know, man. I'm not the person I was at 28. The passion is still there but the rage mostly isn't."
Interviewer,Mostly?
Eminem,Unless we're talking about Trump.
Interviewer,My next guest is a local Michigander who is making a name for himself in the competitive world of music.
Eminem,(singing) Against the Wind. Running against the wind.
Interviewer,I gave that away because it's in the title. How about Like a Rock?
Eminem,"Yes, they are. You're going really fast, though."
Interviewer,I thought you were a rapper. Don't rappers talk fast? Are you one of those slow talking rappers or one of the fast talking rappers?
Eminem,I can be both I guess.
Interviewer,"What kind of rap do you do? Are you like, sing some and rap some like Bone Thugs n-Harmony or are you more street like Will Smith?"
Eminem,Middle.
Interviewer,Are you more political or more booty rhymes?
Eminem,In the middle.
Interviewer,Right in the middle of the booty.
Eminem,"Right in the crack, probably."
Interviewer,It's a steamy place to have your career.
Eminem,It's both.
Interviewer,Do you have a fallback position? Is there something else you know how to do like carpentry or HVAC? We're always going to need HVAC?
Eminem,Carpentry sounds like it could be good.
Interviewer,"You need to think 10 years down the line am I going to have a retirement account. You just have to make plans when the dream dies. You know, dreams die. It happens. Fun is fun."
Eminem,I'm so confused right now. I'm trying to figure out if you're serious.
Interviewer,"I'm very serious, if you don't have a retirement account when you're 50, you're dead in the water. You're a greeter at Walmart at that point. I am Marshall, children's toys are that way."
Eminem,"You really don't know? I mean, I've put out quite a few albums."
Interviewer,I'm sure that feels good. It doesn't pay the rent.
Eminem,It sorta does pay the rent.
Interviewer,Good. What have you done?
Eminem,Are you serious right now?
Interviewer,I'd like to apologize. If you're a bigger deal than I know about... this is on my research people... I wanna know who you are. I just don't know who you are.
Eminem,I think I just look angry.
Interviewer,That's good. That works for rap.
Eminem,I'm not sure what to do here.
Interviewer,"I understand that 'Southpaw' comes out July 24th. Will it only be playing in Monroe, or all across Michigan?"
Eminem,It should be playing all across Michigan and hopefully beyond.
Interviewer,Congratulations... that is (singing) phenomenal.
Eminem,Am I performing next?
Interviewer,"That would be great, but we are kinda tight on time. Come back in August because I think I'm hosting again."
Eminem,"See, you know it. Can I perform now?"
Interviewer,"No, we don't have time. Let's take a peak at Monroe's community calendar. Marshall, would you like to help me out with this?"
Eminem,"Well, it says on the teleprompter that I'm supposed to say I'd love to Stephen."
Interviewer,"That's great, thanks."
Interviewer,"So how does it feel to be rich, famous and the idol of countless teenagers?"
Eminem,"I always wished for this, but it's almost turning into more of a nightmare than a dream. I mean, everybody wants to ride on my fuckin' coat tails. Everybody's trying to hang on to, wants a piece of my ass. You gotta be careful what you wish for; you just might get it."
Interviewer,What's so bad about being a star?
Eminem,"I can't go out anymore and play basketball, because everybody knows my fuckin' face. All I really wanted was to have a career in hip hop and now I got to deal with so much shit! There are people coming to my house, knocking on the door. Either they want autographs or they wanna fight. It's fuckin' crazy!"
Interviewer,"Not to be smart, but I think you're getting quite an ample compensation for it. Okay, the loss of privacy is hard, but certainly you knew what was coming?"
Eminem,"Nobody really understands the pressures put on me. I'm under so much fuckin' pressure, pressure to always be good, pressure to always be on point. There are so many pressures that go with my job right now. It's crazy. Sometimes I think I do a lot of fuckin' crazy shit but then I don't know what the fuck is normal. My life certainly isn't. Maybe it never was...."
Interviewer,What was your life like before you became famous?
Eminem,"Before I was famous, when I was just working in Gilbert's Lodge, everything was moving in slow motion. Now it seems like somebody has pressed the fuckin' fast forward button and my life just seems to be rushing by. It sometimes feels like a strange movie, you know, it's all so weird that sometimes I wonder if it is really happening. But I tell you the fuckin' shit feels a lot more real than the good things. That's fuckin' strange!"
Interviewer,There has been much controversy over your liberal use of the word faggot and what people perceive as gay bashing. It's put you right in the line of fire from gay and lesbian groups the world over...
Eminem,"I'm not gay bashing. People just don't understand where I come from. Faggot to me doesn't necessarily mean gay people. Faggot to me just means... taking away your manhood. You're a sissy. You're a coward. Just like you might sit around in your living room and say, Dude, stop, you're being a fag, dude."
Interviewer,But you can see how it would insult homosexuals?
Eminem,"Yeah, but it does not necessarily mean you're being a gay person. It just means you're being a fag. You're being an asshole or whatever. That's the way that the word was always taught to me. That's how I learned the word. Battling with somebody, you do anything you can to strip their manhood away."
Interviewer,Sometimes it seems that you enjoy creating a bit of ruckus. I wonder if faggot is really necessary ...
Eminem,"I come from Detroit where it's rough and I'm not a smooth talker. I am who I am and I say what I think. I'm not putting a face on for the record. When I started saying faggot on record, I started getting people going, You have something against gay people, and I thought it was funny. Because I don't; I really don't. I have something against assholes, but I'm not into gay bashing. A lot of people are too stupid to understand it."
Interviewer,"Your mouth got you in quite a lot of trouble. Would it be easier to bite back some remarks, to stop the misunderstandings? It might keep people from coming to your door and trying to fight you..."
Eminem,"I don't think it would stop them. They'd think I'm a sissy and would really want to kick my ass. My thing is this; if I'm sick enough to think it, then I'm sick enough to say it. Why are these thoughts in my head? A lot of people think a lot worse shit than I do. They just don't say it. If I'm crazy enough to think it, then I'm crazy enough to say it. So who's worse? Come on, I mean somebody who thinks really weird fuckin' shit, shit I really don't want to think about. But I got nailed for saying just mildly sick shit. That's how I base my whole shit. I think there's a reason why I think this way. I don't think I say the things I say for no reason. I write it down and say it. You know, I call it being honest, but some sick asshole who does sick things on the sly and doesn't talk about it is cool?"
Interviewer,I guess you're not aiming for a career in diplomatic service...
Eminem,"Fuck no! I say what I want to say and do what I want to do. There's no in between. People will either love you for it or hate you for it. That's what I've found just on a street level fans, and people on the street. They either can't stand me or love me for telling the truth and saying what's on my mind."
Interviewer,You're a father; you have a little daughter. There has been mention in the media of lawsuits. I just want to know about your plans. Being a parent seems like a big responsibility...
Eminem,"I know and I want to be there for my daughter, whenever she needs me. I want to be with her on every step of the way, ya know. She's the best thing that happened to me. Fuck all the fame and shit, Hailie is far more important. She keeps me from being too extreme. I realize that no matter how crazy I act onstage or how wild I may get, there's got to be a limit. I can't step out of a certain boundary. I have to be here for her. Her father has to remain alive. I have to maintain. She really helps me when I'm about to do something too stupid. All I have to do is think about Hailie. She keeps me in check, definitely. What can I say? I love her and a lot of shit has happened to me, but Hailie makes up for everything. In a way, she also makes up for all the fuckin' pressure and all the shit. My daughter's not gonna need anything the rest of her life and that makes me feel real good. Fuckin' good!"
Interviewer,"On the album cover, you seem a little disappointed in the country. Is that an accurate portrayal?"
Eminem,"I would say that's probably an accurate portrayal, but I do feel like we live in the greatest country in the world, but I know that we've got a lot of shit to work on."
Interviewer,"What are some things that, in general, bother you about America right now?"
Eminem,Obviously Trump. I'm not sure how to answer. This is what happens when I start talking about Trump
Interviewer,The songs that you created about Trump and about race relations in this country; are you concerned with how they're received by the public?
Eminem,"In a sense I am. I definitely want to reach people and hopefully be able to make people think. I feel like between the song by Joyner Lucas and the ""Untouchable"" song, maybe we could get some ears and get people's attention and make them think, the ones who are not woke yet, I guess, to what the fuck is going on."
Interviewer,There are two sides in this country that are very polarized and they ....
Eminem,"We can talk about the division that  got our country in. Part of me feels like it's almost single-handedly what he's done and to the extent that he knows he's doing it. He obviously sees the division that he's got our country in. You're on one side or you're on the other side. His side is growing smaller and smaller, I feel like by the day, because I do believe people are waking up to what the fuck is going on, which is basically that he's done nothing... Damn, I forgot what the hell I was saying. What the fuck was I just saying?"
Interviewer,That people are waking up to what Trump's done....
Eminem,"Yeah, his core is shrinking and it's interesting. I'll probably  10 times if we're talking about Trump, because there's too much I want to say, but it's almost like... It's so bizarre watching him play to his base that thinks that he cares about them and it's actually the people that he cares about the fucking least. If you're talking about his core being a majority white middle class people, what I don't understand is how in the fuck do you feel like you relate to a billionaire who has never known struggle his entire fucking life? Who dodged the draft because he had bone spurs in his fucking foot? You feel like this is the guy that's gonna fight for you? He's already proven with the tax break that he's not. That's not benefiting the middle class. I will say this, he talks a good one."
Interviewer,"Let's talk about ""Walk on Water."" One of the things that stood out to me when I heard the song was the way your voice sounded when you recorded it. It sounded very intimate and very clear. Could you speak about how you recorded it?"
Eminem,"Well, I think one of the things that makes the vocals come out so clear is it's a pretty bare track. It's just piano, really, and Skylar  and then we had discussed it. We were both like, ""Nah, we should just leave it like this so you can understand, hear everything and maybe hopefully get it the first time you hear it.""."
Interviewer,"Also on that record, you're talking about grappling with the criticism that gets levied your way both from fans and peers. Where do you get most of the criticism? How do you receive it? On Twitter? On YouTube?"
Eminem,"I see things. I don't have time to sit on Twitter all day, or read everything, but I do see things and I see enough. I'm probably a lot more in tune than people actually might want to think I am, but I see enough. I don't know, that song was more about just self-doubt, insecurities, that kind of shit. I've never really seen myself as, how can I say... The way I've seen some fans act towards me. Even to this day, I've been in this game a long time and it's still weird to me, because I just rap and I certainly haven't had a perfect career. I've put out some not-so-great albums and I realize that. Part of me feels like, I've felt this way since I did it, but part of me feels like I'm forever chasing The Marshall Mathers LP, because I do feel like probably the majority of people who listen to my music probably feel like that's my best album."
Interviewer,Is it strange to get criticism from rappers publicly; like Vince Staples for example....
Eminem,"The reason I don't trip off that is because I feel like regardless of whether you rap or you don't, or you're in the game or you're not, I feel like everybody's entitled to their opinion. I don't really trip off people critiquing what I do. In some cases, I feel like there are peers that don't really listen to my music anyways and they're not fans, so I'm not making my music for them. I'm making my music for me first, obviously, so I can be happy with something. At the same time, try to give the people that do appreciate my music, give them something to listen to basically and try to meet whatever expectations are placed. I figured it out a long time ago. It doesn't matter what I do, what I say, what album I come with, it just doesn't matter because...."
Interviewer,At what point did you figure that out?
Eminem,"Daily, I've come to that realization, pretty much, right? I figured it out a long time ago. It's not that it doesn't bother me, because sometimes it's like, really? Really? I hear somebody critique something that I do, that probably doesn't understand what I do. It would have to be a certain song, I'd have to give you an example, but I think that there's still a lot of people that don't understand compound syllable rhyming and being able to take entire sentences and make them rhyme and stuff like that. They might not hear that, so they're not gonna be able to appreciate that, because they hear what they hear and then, Ah, man. That shit is wack. Okay, but maybe you don't understand what I'm doing."
Interviewer,"Well, it's a skill you've been honing for decades upon decades."
Eminem,"Yeah, I've been doing this for a long time, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the songs are better."
Interviewer,Congratulations on your success with Recovery. Has it surprised you at all?
Eminem,"I'm a little surprised. I was certainly more confident in this album than the last one. It feels good to have your work respected again. Winning awards is cool, but at this point, I'm in it for the sport."
Interviewer,What's been the highlight so far?
Eminem,"The shows with Jay-Z. Just being onstage in front of that many people, being able to command the crowd but not having to fall back on old crutches like drugs and drinking. You do get nervous anybody who says they don't is lying. But hitting that stage now, I want to feel those nerves. To look out and actually see girls crying and shit, it's overwhelming. But not like it used to be, where I felt like I needed to ."
Interviewer,Does fame feel different this time?
Eminem,"It feels like I have a better grasp on it. A lot of the problems I had with fame I was bringing on myself. A lot of self-loathing, a lot of woe-is-me. Now I'm learning to see the positive side of things, instead of, like, ""I can't go to Kmart. I can't take my kids to the haunted house.""."
Interviewer,Your past few albums were produced mainly by you and Dr. Dre. On this one you worked with several new producers.
Eminem,"It was just time for fresh blood. There's so many talented producers I always wanted to work with, but I was never sure if it would gel. I think it was a fear of failure. Like, ""What if I bring these guys out, and I don't come up with anything?"" So I just stayed in my element, where I was comfortable. But I was talking to my boy Denaun  one day, and he said, ""Yo, man you gotta get off your island."" I don't mean to keep going back to it, but when I got clean, I started doing things I wouldn't otherwise have done."
Interviewer,Your music also seems more serious now.
Eminem,"Around the tail end of , there was a turning point lyrically. I was sitting in the car listening to these older songs of mine, trying to figure out, ""Why doesn't the new stuff hit me like it used to?"" That's when I started to get away from the funny shit and do songs that had some emotion and aggression to them again."
Interviewer,What are you working on now?
Eminem,"Right now me and Dre are busy with Detox. It's really close I want to say we're halfway done. I'm lending an ear, helping him write, laying hooks whatever I can do. As for my stuff, I'm just doing guest verses for other people's records. I try to stay recording, because if I don't, I get rusty. I'm very paranoid about writer's block I had it for four years, and it drove me fucking crazy. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't think of shit. The pills had a lot to do with it. Just wiping out brain cells. I don't know if it sounds like I'm making excuses, but the absolute truth is a lot of my memory is gone. I don't know if you've ever taken Ambien, but it's kind of a memory-eraser. That shit wiped out five years of my life. People will tell me stories, and it's like, ""I did that?"" I saw myself doing this thing on BET recently, and I was like, ""When was that?""."
Interviewer,Did you save much of your writing from that time?
Eminem,Yeah. It fucking creeps me out. Letters all down the page it was like my hand weighed 400 pounds. I have all that shit in a box in my closet. As a reminder that I don't ever want to go back.
Interviewer,When did you first get into drugs?
Eminem,"It didn't really start until my career took off. I was probably in my early 20s before I even kicked back my first beer. But the bigger the shows got, the bigger the after-parties; drugs were always around. In the beginning it was recreational. I could come off tour and be able to shut it off. I'd spend time with the kids, and I'd be OK."
Interviewer,"It probably started to become a problem around the 8 Mile movie. We were doing 16 hours on the set, and you had a certain window where you had to sleep. One day somebody gave me an Ambien, and it knocked me the fuck out. I was like, ""I need this all the time."" So I got a prescription. After four or five months, your tolerance starts building. You start breaking off another piece of the pill that's supposed to be for tomorrow. Then, when I got off probation for my felonies , I was fucked up every night."
Eminem,How bad did it get?
Interviewer,"I was taking so many pills that I wasn't even taking them to get high anymore. I was taking them to feel normal. Not that I didn't get high. I just had to take a ridiculous amount. I want to say in a day I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium. And Vicodin... maybe 20, 30? I don't know. I was taking a lot of shit."
Eminem,"My everyday regimen would be, wake up in the morning and take an extra-strength Vicodin. I could never take more than one and a half, because it tore up my stomach lining. So I'd take the one and a half, and it'd kind of be Vicodin throughout the day. Then, as the evening crept up, around 5:00 or 6:00, I'd start with a Valium or two, or three, or four. And every hour on the hour, I'd pop four or five more. The Ambien would put me over the top to go to sleep."
Interviewer,"Toward the end, I don't think the shit ever put me to sleep for more than two hours. It's very similar to what I've read about Michael . I don't know exactly what he was doing, but I read that he kept getting up in the middle of the night, asking for more. That's what I was doing two, three times a night, I would get up and take more."
Eminem,Where were you getting it? Did you have a dealer?
Interviewer,"When you're an addict, you find ways. In the beginning, there were doctors who gave me prescriptions even after I got out of rehab."
Eminem,Any idea how much money you spent?
Interviewer,Nope. And I don't want to know. A lot.
Eminem,"Then, in 2006, Proof was killed. Can you talk a bit about what he meant to you?"
Interviewer, It hit me pretty hard.
Eminem,How much do you think his death had to do with your spiral?
Interviewer,"It had a lot to do with it. I remember days I spent just taking fucking pills and crying. One day, I couldn't get out of bed. I didn't even want to get up to use the bathroom. I wasn't the only person grieving he left a wife and kids. But I was very much in my own grief. I was so high at his funeral. It disgusts me to say it, but I felt like it was about me. I hate myself for even thinking that. It was selfish."
Eminem,What was happening to you physically?
Interviewer,"I got up to between 220 and 230, about 80 pounds heavier than I am now. I was going to McDonald's and Taco Bell every day. The kids behind the counter knew me it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad. I got so heavy that people started to not recognize me. I remember being somewhere and overhearing these kids talking. One of them said, ""That's Eminem,"" and the other said, ""No it's not, man Eminem ain't fat."" I was like, ""Motherfucker."" That's when I knew I was getting heavy."
Eminem,"It creeps me out sometimes to think of the person I was. I was a terrible person. I was mean to people. I treated people around me shitty. Obviously I was hiding something. I was fucked up inside, and people with those kinds of problems tend to put up this false bravado let me attack everyone else, so the focus is off me. But of course everybody knew. There were whispers, murmurs."
Interviewer,"Did anyone ever say to you, ""Em, you need help""?"
Eminem,"They'd say it behind my back. They didn't say it to my face, because I would fucking flip out. If I even sniffed the scent of somebody thinking they knew what I was doing, they were out of here. You'd never see them again."
Interviewer,"And it peaked in December of 2007, when you were rushed to the hospital after overdosing on methadone. Can you walk me through that night?"
Eminem,"I can try. There are certain parts I have to leave out because they have to do with my kids. But I remember I got the methadone from somebody I'd gone to looking for Vicodin. This person said, ""These are just like Vicodin, and they're easier on your liver."" I thought, ""It looks like Vicodin, it's shaped like Vicodin fuck it."" I remember taking one in the car on the way home, and thinking, ""Oh, this is great."" Just that rush. I went through them in a couple of days, then went back and got more. But I got a lot more."
Interviewer,"My whole month of December leading up to , I don't remember shit. All I remember is I was not able to get out of bed. At some point I don't know if it was the middle of the day, I don't know if it was nighttime I got up to use the bathroom. I was standing there, trying to take a piss, and I fell. I hit the floor hard. I got back up, tried again and boom, I fell again. And that time I couldn't get up."
Eminem,"I've never really talked about it with anyone in detail, because I don't want to know. They say I made it back to the bed somehow. I don't remember that. All I remember was hitting the bathroom floor and waking up in the hospital."
Interviewer,What happened when you woke up?
Eminem,"The first thing I remember is trying to move, and I couldn't. It's like I was paralyzed tubes in me and shit. I couldn't speak. The doctors told me I'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin. They said I was about two hours from dying."
Interviewer,"I think I'd been out for two days, and when I woke up, I didn't realize it was Christmas. So the first thing I wanted to do was call my kids. I wanted to get home, and show them that Dad's OK."
Eminem,So you missed Christmas morning? That must have been hard.
Interviewer,"Definitely. Being a father, wanting to be there with your kids. It's not a fun thing to deal with."
Eminem,And they didn't come visit? You didn't get to see them at all?
Interviewer,No.  I was in the hospital.
Eminem,What happened next?
Interviewer,"I checked myself out I think I had been there a week but I went home too soon. I wasn't fully detoxed. It had zapped all my strength I couldn't lift the fucking salt-and-pepper shaker. I remember lying on the couch, falling asleep for literally 10 minutes, and when I woke up, my knee was out of place. I'd somehow torn my meniscus. I'm just coming off Vicodin, my senses are coming back, and it's hurting 10 million times worse than it had to. I had surgery a couple of days later, came home... and had a seizure. Because I wasn't detoxed. Boom, ambulance, right back to the hospital."
Eminem,"I knew I had to change my life. But addiction is a fucking tricky thing. I think I relapsed within... three weeks? And within a month it had ramped right back to where it was before. That's what really freaked me out. That's when I knew: I either get help, or I am going to die."
Interviewer,"As a father, I want to be here for things. I don't want to miss anything else."
Eminem,How did you get clean? Did you go to meetings?
Interviewer,"I tried some meetings a couple of churches and things. It tended to not do me much good. People tried to be cool, but I got asked for autographs a couple of times. It made me shut down. Instead, I called a rehab counselor who'd helped me the first time. Now I see him once a week."
Eminem,"I also started running like a fucking maniac. Seventeen miles a day, every day. Just replacing one addiction with another. I had days where I could hardly walk. In my mind I was trying to get down to what's his name, in The Machinist? Christian Bale. Which was really fucking stupid. But I'd get a number of calories in my head I needed to burn, and no matter what, I would do it."
Interviewer,"I have a slight bit of OCD, I think. I'm not walking around flipping light switches. But when I say I'm going to do something, I have to do it."
Eminem,Who else do you talk to?
Interviewer,"I speak to Elton . He's like my sponsor. He usually calls me once a week to check on me, just to make sure I'm on the up-and-up. He was actually one of the first people I called when I wanted to get clean. He was hipping me to things, like, ""You're going to see nature that you never noticed before."" Shit you'd normally think was corny but that you haven't seen in so long that you just go, ""Wow! Look at that fucking rainbow!"" Or even little things trees, the color of leaves. I fucking love leaves now, man. I feel like I've been neglecting leaves for a long time."
Eminem,Are you ever tempted to use again?
Interviewer,"Honestly, no. For one thing, I try not to be in a position where I could be tempted. I've performed in a few clubs where there is drinking and shit, but I think even if I'd never had a drug problem, at the age I'm at, I wouldn't want to  anyway. I feel like this is the time in your life where you stop doing that stuff. Time to grow up."
Eminem,What's your sober date?
Interviewer,4/20. Ironically.
Eminem,Let's talk about rapping some. Do you remember your first rhyme?
Interviewer,"Shit, I think I do. I was at my great-aunt Edna's house in St. Joseph, Missouri. I was 12, maybe 13 at the most, and I wrote a rhyme that sounded exactly like LL Cool J. Something like, ""... da da da da, 'cause before you can blink/I'll have a hundred million rhymes and like a ship you will sink!""."
Eminem,Not bad!
Interviewer,"I was proud of it. And I didn't think it sounded like LL at all. In my head, it was me lol. It's weird, man. There's certain little landmarks in your life that you just don't forget. I remember walking back and forth between my little room there and the kitchen, just like I do today. I even remember the kind of paper I wrote it on. It was small, like from a notepad, and beige. And it had blue writing at the top."
Eminem,"And you still write on a notepad now no laptop, no BlackBerry...."
Interviewer,"I've seen a lot of rappers stack their ideas in BlackBerries, but it wouldn't work for me. I'd have to, you know scroll, scroll, scroll. If it's on the pad, I can look at everything at once."
Eminem,Do you still write in the bathroom?
Interviewer,Sometimes. I think we do most of our best thinking on the shitter. What else do you have to do in there besides think?
Eminem,How do you go about putting together a verse?
Interviewer,"Even as a kid, I always wanted the most words to rhyme. Say I saw a word like ""transcendalistic tendencies."" I would write it out on a piece of paper trans-cend-a-lis-tic ten-den-cies and underneath, I'd line a word up with each syllable: and bend all mystic sentence trees. Even if it didn't make sense, that's the kind of drill I would do to practice. To this day, I still want as many words as possible in a sentence to rhyme."
Eminem,Can you give another example? Maybe write a few bars about this interview?
Interviewer,About this interview? How much money you got?  I can spit a hot 16 real quick!
Eminem,I don't think I can afford you.
Interviewer,"Yeah, probably not hahaha. Let me think about it. [At our meeting the next day, Eminem flips open his notebook to a page near the back. ""I wrote it right after you left,"" he says. ""Just some dumb shit."" I ask to read it, and he says he'd rather rap it."
Eminem,"Every line rhymes with the word ""interview"" some twice, and one even three times. I ask him how long it took to write. ""About two minutes,"" he says.]."
Interviewer,Where do you think you get your love of words from? Are you a big reader?
Eminem,"The only book I ever read from front to back was LL's . I just never really got into books. My great-aunt Edna, she would read to me sometimes, like The Little Engine That Could. And I was into comic books heavy. But as far as book-books? Nah. I think it's just listening, being a sponge. I suck at math. I'm terrible at social studies. But I've always been good at English, and I always had a lot of words in my vocabulary. Even now, I might not know what a word means, but if I hear you say it and it's an interesting word, I'll go look it up."
Interviewer,What's a typical day like for Marshall Mathers these days?
Eminem,"I'll get up around 7:30 or 8:00 and work out. I was working with a boxing trainer for a while, but now I just run, bike, hit the heavy bag. I eat breakfast low-fat waffles with sugar-free syrup and a Red Bull and then just get to the studio as early as I can, try to put in a full day's work so I can get home early enough to see the kids."
Interviewer,And in the evenings?
Eminem,"I watch a lot of TV. The First 48 that show is incredible. South Park. Tosh.0 is a funny dude. Intervention, Celebrity Rehab those are good because I can relate to what they're going through. And sports the NFL Channel and SportsCenter are on in my house 24/7. Football is my main shit I like the Lions and the Cowboys. And I play fantasy football with some friends. I'm in third place right now, out of eight or nine teams. Not bad."
Interviewer,Who do you hang out with?
Eminem,"I've got a few close friends. The guys in D12. Royce Da 5'9"". 50 . Basically I work five days a week, and then weekends and as many evenings as I can with the kids."
Interviewer,"In your song ""Going Through Changes,"" you talk about living ""like a recluse."" Do you feel disconnected from the world sometimes?"
Eminem,"Well, that song is about my addiction, and my mind frame at the time. I don't feel like a recluse now. I do go out and do things it's just hard. You've got to take an entourage. It's a pain in the ass. When I didn't have a record out for four or five years, I was taking little trips down to see my great-aunt Edna, before she passed. I knew it was getting close she was in her 90s and I wanted to spend as much time with her as I could. Not having a record out, I could stop at a gas station, go places and not get recognized. That was actually a pretty good feeling."
Interviewer,"It might sound weird, given that I'm always trying to get people's attention with my music, but I'm not an attention-seeker. When I'm not Eminem, and I'm just Marshall it's hard."
Eminem,What about your love life? Do you date?
Interviewer,"Not really. As far as going out, like dinner and a movie I just can't. Going out in public is just too crazy. I mean, I'd like to be in a relationship again someday. Who doesn't? It's just hard to meet new people, in my position."
Eminem,You mean being famous?
Interviewer,"No, I mean being gay lol. Kidding."
Eminem,I wonder how much your problems with your mom and ex-wife have to do with it. Do you think it's hard for you to trust women?
Interviewer,"I have trust issues. With women, friends, whatever. You always wonder what their real motives are. I've got a small circle of friends, and it's a lot of the same friends I've known forever. Right now, that works for me. I came out of some difficult things these past couple of years. I kind of feel like I'm just now finding my footing. So I want to make sure that's secure before I go out and do anything else. I need to keep working on myself for a while."
Eminem,Has your dad ever tried to get in touch with you?
Interviewer,"No. Well... I heard there was one instance. He had a baby book of mine, and he wanted to give it back. He was around until I was about six months old, so I guess he had pictures from then. But I didn't even know what my father looked like until I was 18 or 19, and my mother showed me a picture. I remember being a little kid, coloring in front of the TV at my aunt and uncle's house, and he would call on the phone. I would say, ""Was that my dad?"" And my aunt would change the subject. He had to know I was there. But I never even got so much as a ""Brucie, your dad says hi.""."
Eminem,Did that hurt?
Interviewer,"I don't know if it hurt back then. But the older you get, you start to realize, ""Fuck. I would never do that to my kids."" You start getting a chip on your shoulder, getting bitter. At this point look, I'm a grown man. I'm not gonna sit here and bicker about it. But at the end of the day, it's fucked up."
Eminem,And now you have kids. What does being a good father mean to you?
Interviewer,"Just being there. Not missing things. If there's anything important going on, regardless of what it is, I'm there. Helping them with homework when you can. At the grades my older ones are in, it's hard lol. I never even passed ninth grade. They're already way smarter than me."
Eminem,Why do you think you've never left Detroit?
Interviewer,"A lot of it might have to do with moving around so much as a kid, never having stability. My kids are comfortable here I want them to have the stability I didn't. And it's also nostalgic. Being a few miles from where I grew up, being used to the people, the mentality. I'm a creature of habit. I know one way to get downtown. I still get lost driving places and shit."
Eminem,You've made your comeback. Where do you go from here?
Interviewer,"If you'd asked me 10 years ago, I would have said I'd probably quit rapping by 30. Now I think I'll keep doing it as long as I have the spark. But I do worry about when the time comes that I need to do something else. Because it's going to be hard. What else do I know? Hip-hop is the only thing I was ever good at. What am I going to do?"
Eminem,More acting? Maybe go back to school?
Interviewer,"Well, I did go back and get my GED. I don't know if that counts, but I'm proud of it."
Eminem,"I've never really had a plan. When I was younger, I just wanted to be a rapper. If I didn't make it, I had no plan B. Now that I am a rapper, I don't know. I'd like to refocus on rebuilding our label. Maybe doing a little producing. Other than that, I'm not sure."
Interviewer,"Do you think about aging? In your song ""Without Me"" the one where you called Moby a fag and told him to blow you you also said he was ""too old"" and to ""let go, it's over."" He was 36 at the time. You're about to turn 38."
Eminem,"At the time that I wrote that, it seemed so far away. I do feel like I've grown up a lot. There's always going to be that part of me that reverts back to immaturity, but I think that's just my warped sense of humor."
Interviewer,"""Not Afraid"" has a positive message for people trying to overcome obstacles. Are you more comfortable now with the idea of being a role model?"
Eminem,"Whatever I can be to people is fine. Some people may look up to me. Some people may consider me a fucking menace. But I'm grateful for every fan letter I get, and for every person who says I helped save them. I don't know, man. I feel like I took a lot of time off. Not doing shit for those four or five years, how lazy I got it's time to get back to doing what I love. I feel like I've got a lot of gas in the tank. I just want to make up for letting people down."
Interviewer,Jay-Z has a new album coming out where he says fame is both a gift and a curse. Do you agree with Jigga's assessment?
Eminem,"You gotta take the ups and downs with it. Fame has got its pros and cons. The pros would be you don't have to ride one of these  to getting to where somebody like me or Jay-Z is, you have a whole new slew of problems, like lawsuits and other things I never knew could exist."
Interviewer,"The tour is going well and you've sold millions of records, but you're one of the few rappers that we never hear talking about ice or cars or your bank account. What do you do with your money? Better yet, what's the first big-ticket item you bought?"
Eminem,"The first big-ticket item that I bought was a house. When I first started seeing money, I treated that like it was the only house I would ever buy and the only royalty check that I would ever get. That's how I treat every . The truth is, you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. This is a crazy ride and nothing is guaranteed. I could wake up tomorrow and this could all be over. You have to invest."
Interviewer,What was it like owning your first home?
Eminem,"At the time I bought it, I had no idea how famous I really was. It was across the street from a trailer park and we had kids coming across all day knocking on the door. We had a pool in the backyard, kids were jumping in the pool. It was crazy. The house was on a main road so we had people whipping in my driveway like, Em, what up? I literally couldn't go outside my house. So we deaded that real quick, sold the house, lost money and bought a new house. That's probably the best investment I've made, my new house."
Interviewer,You say you weren't aware of your fame when you first started blowing up. When did you start sensing how popular you were becoming?
Eminem,"The first time I really sensed it was flipping through channels and seeing my face on every channel. You kind of get sick of yourself. The first time I experienced it was probably walking through a mall or something and not realizing how many people really know who you are. I probably got the most unmistakable nose and chin in the business. Sometimes I'll go out and cover up , it's crazy."
Interviewer,"Your daughter Hailie is obviously a huge inspiration in your life and music, and the two of you have even recorded a song together. But does she know the depths of her daddy's fame yet?"
Eminem,"Yeah, she knows. She's six and she's getting the grasp of that whole thing. She's starting to realize. She goes to school like, 'My dad's on TV,' and these other kids, their dads aren't on TV."
Interviewer,Hailie is becoming a mini celeb in her own right. She seemed really comfortable recording My Dad's Gone Crazy. Do you see her following in your footsteps and making music when she gets older?
Eminem,"When she's 25, maybe she can. She's gotta grow up first. She scares me a little bit 'cause she's got that little star quality."
Interviewer,So will Hailie be getting any siblings anytime soon? Maybe you could spearhead a hip-hop Partridge family.
Eminem,"No more kids. I'm good with Hailie. I'll spoil her and give her everything I never had. I have other family members that I take care of and want to take care of, but as far as kids, I'm cool. No more, one is enough."
Interviewer,"As you approach the big 3-0, are you getting this whole parenting thing down pat? How would you rate yourself as a father?"
Eminem,"I do the best I can right now. I truly believe I'm doing the right thing and I do a good job. I'm a father before anything. I'm a father before I pick up the mic. I'm a father before I'm Eminem. Of course I'm not the perfect parent. There may be things I'm doing wrong and I'll find out in 10, 15 years, but right now I'm doing the best job I can and that's all I can do."
Interviewer,"As much as she depends on you, in Say Goodbye Hollywood you liken Hailie to sort of your lifeline, saying I gotta get up, thank God/ I got a little girl/ And I'm a responsible father/ So not a lot of good I'd be to my daughter/ Layin' in the bottom of the mud ... Do you think that your daughter has saved your life?"
Eminem,"I think that in a roundabout way she did save my life. I always had drive coming up and I always wanted to make it as a rapper. That was my dream. But when she was born, it was the reality of I have to do this. I had nothing else. I had no high school education. I want her to be able to grow up and look back on this and be like, whether people agree with it or not, My dad put me on a song. My dad wrote songs for me, my dad said my name all over the place. I want her to be able to look back in magazines and everything and just know. I don't ever wanna be like my father was to me."
Interviewer,"In the video for Cleaning Out My Closet, you talk a lot about your mother, but some of the most mind-searing images portray your recollection of how your father treated you and your mother. Have you ever tried to reach out to him?"
Eminem,"I have never spoke to my father and I never will. I'm cool. It's not a void in my life,  missing or anything. I'm happy and I've got who I need in my life and I think I've found a peace, an inner peace. I don't feel like I ever need to meet him one day and be like, Oh my life is complete. I don't want to know him."
Interviewer,"You've been feuding with your mother for quite some time, you've dissed her numerous times in songs and even took a couple of shots at her during the Anger Management Tour. What type of toll, if any, has your estrangement taken on Hailie's relationship with her grandmother?"
Eminem,"That's a difficult situation because my little brother lives with me now so my mother occasionally has to come there. I know that I can't imagine what goes on in a six-year-old's head. I know there's probably part of  does come to the house, I try to occupy Hailie. When she's old enough and she wants to know her grandmother, she can make that decision on her own. But as of right now, I'm not gonna subject my daughter to any of that."
Interviewer,You have a first-hand perspective of what it's like to come from a home where the parents are not together. How much of an effect do you think your divorce from Kim will have on Hailie?
Eminem,"I think that it's good that this happened while Hailie was real young and didn't get so used to seeing her mother and father together all the time. I think it's better we did it early because sh was rocky for a while ... I don't wanna subject my seed to that type of turmoil, 'cause it was turmoil a couple years ago. I think that right now when I look at it, she's a happy little girl. To me she doesn't show any signs that something's bothering her or anything like that. Maybe when she gets older she could tell me, maybe it was something I didn't know."
Interviewer,"So now that you're single once again, are you going the Puffy route and looking for a new girl to ride, ride, ride?"
Eminem,"No. I'm not looking for a new woman. I'm cool being single, not to say I don't get down (laughing). But as far as a relationship or getting married again, I'm cool, man. I learned my lesson and I've seen what it is and what it can and can't be and I feel like I've learned enough from my first mistake. Let that be the last one and keep moving forward. Relationships? No."
Interviewer,What is Em's favorite Mexican food?
Eminem,Tacos bitch.
Interviewer,How does Em keep a straight face while incorporating so many awesome puns in his lyrics?
Eminem,"I laugh enough when I am recording them, that's why I never smile."
Interviewer,What's Em's favorite place to masterbate outside of home?
Eminem,McDonald's bathroom.
Interviewer,Does Em clean at home?
Eminem,I wipe my own ass.
Interviewer,"Can Em mix his own music, using recording functions like compression and EQ?"
Eminem,Pretty damn close.
Interviewer,Did Em stroke Rick Rubin's beard for ideas when they got in the studio?
Eminem,"No, we only sampled The Stroke. He's of course referring to the Billy Squier song The Stroke that Eminem sampled for Berzerk."
Interviewer,What does Em wear to bed?
Eminem,Socks.
Interviewer,What annoys Em the most?
Eminem,When people keep asking me if I am retiring.
Interviewer,"If Em could change one thing about the Marshal Mathers LP 2, what would it be?"
Eminem,"I would have added Don't Front' on to the deluxe bonus disc but we didn't clear the sample in time. That song, which is built off of a Black Moon sample leaked this week."
Interviewer,Was Dido ever considered for an appearance on MMLP2?
Eminem,"Yes, was considering her for Bad Guy' but thought it might give it away. Bad Guy is a sort of sequel to Stan, the track Dido sang on on the first Marshall Mathers LP in 2000."
Interviewer,"Hi, Marshall."
Eminem,"How are you doing, cunt?"
Interviewer,"I'm very well, you old bastard. Are you in Detroit?"
Eminem,lol Yeah.
Interviewer,You must be pretty excited to have a new album coming out. Tell me about it.
Eminem,"I've been working on it for over a year. You know how it is,you make songs, and as you make the new ones, the old ones get old and you throw them out. The album is called Revival. It's a reflection of where I'm at right now, but also I feel like what I tried to do was diversify. I've tried to make a little something for everyone."
Interviewer,"You're very good on collaborations. We first met through the Grammys, when you asked me to do ""Stan."" It was an amazing event for me that I'll never forget."
Eminem,"I'll never forget it either,and I was on drugs."
Interviewer,You were on drugs?
Eminem,"Oh, I was for sure on drugs when we met."
Interviewer,"I couldn't tell. I was just mesmerized by you and your performance; it made the hairs on the back of my arms stand up. It was like seeing Mick Jagger for the first time. I hadn't really been exposed to that kind of rap in live performance before, and it was electrifying. And when that shit was thrown at you,about you being homophobic,I just thought, ""I'm not standing for this. It's nonsense."" I had to stand up and defend you. That Grammy performance was the start of a lovely friendship and I'm grateful for that."
Eminem,"Likewise. That was a crazy time for me. I don't know if I was actually on drugs when we met, but that was right around the start of my using."
Interviewer,You've been clean for a long time now.
Eminem,"Yeah, nine years."
Interviewer,"Your sobriety day is in my diary. I'm so proud of you. I'm 27 years clean, and when you get clean, you see things in a different way. It makes your life so much more manageable. It seems to have made all the difference,I can tell when I speak to you."
Eminem,"Getting clean made me grow up. I feel like all the years that I was using, I wasn't growing as a person."
Interviewer,"Me, too. If I had to go through that to get where I am now, then I'm very, very grateful. But I just can't believe I did some of that shit. Anyway, tell me about your life now. Every artist these days is on Instagram or Facebook, is taking selfies, is in the paper all the time, but you're not like that. You live a pretty simple life. You're not a lavish person. People think they know everything about you, but they really know nothing about you."
Eminem,"I studied Dre a lot. I don't know if you'd call it a mantra or what, but he believed that if you never go away, it's hard for someone to miss you. And I realize that some people see going away as, ""Oh, he's irrelevant now,"" but I feel like if I don't go away, I get sick of myself. It's never been my thing to be in the spotlight all the time."
Interviewer,"People think of you as aggressive because of how you come across when you rap, but under that I think you're quite a shy person. Let's go back to the beginning, to The Slim Shady LP. Who were your big influences at that time?"
Eminem,"It had to be Dre. I remember one of the first times I went out to L.A. I met Dre and Jimmy  at Interscope, and it felt so ridiculous and so far-fetched that this was happening. When Dre walked in, it was like an out-of-body experience. Nothing in my life had been going right for me, but he put me up in the Oakwood apartments and paid my rent so I could record with him. There was a period when I stayed up writing for 48 hours straight and ended up crashing at, like, six in the morning. I wanted to be prepared for Dre because I thought, ""If I'm not ready for every aspect of this, this could be it for me.""."
Interviewer,"That validation and encouragement from him must have meant the world to you. It's so important for a young artist to feel that from someone. It spurred you that extra mile, didn't it?"
Eminem,"Absolutely. That first time in the studio we did three or four songs in, like, six hours, and with any beat he threw on, I either had to rhyme to it or write something right there. From that day forward, he started showing me things that I didn't know I could do with my voice. We did a song called ""Role Model,"" and it went, ""Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?"" And he just kept going ""Nah, do it again. Do it again."" So I would do it again and again until finally I'm screaming, and he goes, ""Yeah, there you go. That's it.""."
Interviewer,"You two are still close, right?"
Eminem,Yes.
Interviewer,"You don't forget people like that. Sometimes it's kismet,like how I met Bernie  completely by accident. Going back to what you said earlier about disappearing, it's like what Prince did. It's like what Springsteen does or Dylan does. They never really go away. People are always interested in what they do."
Eminem,"For sure. There are ups and downs. I haven't had a perfect career. I've put some albums out that, looking back, I'm not super proud of, but there's also a lot of stuff that I am very proud of."
Interviewer,"That's just a part of being an artist; you can't write great stuff all the time, because if you did, then you'd be inhuman. The human side of people is that sometimes they fail."
Eminem,"You're not going to hit it every single time, and that's why, when I record an album, I do probably close to 50 songs. Each song I record has to get better. If it's not better than the last song that I made, it'll usually linger for a couple of months, and then it'll be put on the backburner, and then there'll be another song that I do, and then it often doesn't make it on the album."
Interviewer,"I always say to people, ""If you don't understand hip-hop, you just have to see it being recorded."" When you're in the studio,and I've seen you record, I've been on Kanye West and A Tribe Called Quest records,it's a completely different ballgame. I get upset when people knock it, because I can absolutely see the musicality in it. These days, when I'm listening to records by hip-hop artists, I hear the production. It's just astounding how great the productions have become."
Eminem,"With every song, all the elements have to work. First, the beat has to be great,you start there. You start with the music, and then the ideas follow. Then you start thinking of rhymes, and then you record it, and sometimes,this happens to me a lot,it doesn't come out as good as it did in my head when I first wrote it."
Interviewer,It's so frustrating when that happens. I fucking hate it!
Eminem,"Yeah, because I get excited, and then I get it in there and hear it, and I'm like, ""Oh my god, this is fucking terrible.""."
Interviewer,Do you listen to a lot of current hip-hop?
Eminem,I listen to pretty much everything that comes out.
Interviewer,Who do you think is doing great stuff at the moment?
Eminem,"J. Cole. Travis Scott. Kendrick is great. My friend Royce da 5'9"" is incredible. Joyner Lucas is really good. Tech N9ne, too."
Interviewer,"I love his stuff, too. Let's talk about ""The Storm,"" which is an example of someone actually getting off their ass and saying something, and it reverberating through the world. What you said was pretty much what most musicians, I assume,apart from some country artists,are probably thinking themselves. You seemed to have needed to get that out of your system."
Eminem,"It's something that I'm definitely very passionate about. If I'm not passionate about it, I can't write it. I can't fake it."
Interviewer,"Let me ask you, was that totally off the cuff or did you write all that down and memorize it?"
Eminem,"I wrote it. The original idea was for me to go to the BET Awards and do it acapella onstage. I went home that same day and wrote it all, but then at the last minute, plans got switched around and we filmed it in Detroit."
Interviewer,I think it worked out better that way.
Eminem,"One of the things we were trying to mimic was Public Enemy's ""You're Gonna Get Yours"" cover. I don't know if anybody got that, but that's kind of the feel that we were going for. My main concern was trying to get the message out and also memorize all the words. I have a hard time memorizing stuff. I'm always in the process of writing a new song, so trying to learn a new one takes a minute."
Interviewer,"The people on set with you, had they heard it before you started filming?"
Eminem,"Nah, nobody had heard it."
Interviewer,"It needed to be said. I've been coming to America since 1970, and it's like my second home, but I've never felt such a divided country, ever. I didn't think it would get to this point, and it breaks my heart."
Eminem,"It was about having the right to stand up to oppression. I mean, that's exactly what the people in the military and the people who have given their lives for this country have fought for,for everybody to have a voice and to protest injustices and speak out against shit that's wrong. We're not trying to disrespect the military, we're not trying to disrespect the flag, we're not trying to disrespect our country. But shit is going on that we want to make you aware of. We have a president who does not care about everybody in our country; he is not the president for all of us, he is the president for some of us. He knows what he's doing."
Interviewer,Everything that he does is deliberate.
Eminem,"As long as he's got his base, he does not give a fuck about anybody else in America. But guess what? There's more of us than there are of them. I still feel like America is the greatest country to live in. This is my opinion. But we have issues that we need to work on and we need to do better."
Interviewer,I know you've done some festivals this year. Are you going to go out to tour this album next year?
Eminem,I'm not sure. We usually do mini tours.
Interviewer,Do you like touring?
Eminem,"It used to be hard. Early on in my career when I was more in grind mode, I was doing two or three shows a day. It was tough because you start feeling like you have no life. That being said, I do enjoy actually doing the shows."
Interviewer,It's the traveling that's the worst bit. And being away from home.
Eminem,"Yeah. That's tough, too."
Interviewer,"What's the best piece of advice you ever got, and who was it from?"
Eminem,"I would have to say Dre again. Actually, he gave me a couple of pieces of advice. When I first got signed to Aftermath, we had many discussions about how I wanted to bring in my group D12 and put them on right away. Dre said, ""You've gotta build your house before you can let your friends come in,"" and it made so much sense to me. In hindsight, waiting was probably better because eventually we got Shady Records and were able to sign them to it. He also used to say, ""It can be in bad taste as long as it don't taste bad.""."
Interviewer,"I don't know Dre,I've met him once or twice, but he's a bit like Obi-Wan Kenobi, am I right?"
Eminem,"Yes! I also just remembered some advice that Rick Rubin gave me. We were talking about a song or something, and he said, ""I don't really consider myself smart enough to know what everybody's going to think, so I just do what feels right to me.""."
Interviewer,"Releasing a song is like giving birth to a child. And when people suggest something in that song that maybe I don't agree with, like changing the chorus or putting the chorus somewhere else, I get so pissed off. But then I think about it, because there's no point in having another member of the band there unless you listen to them. And it's so infuriating, but they're usually fucking right, you know?"
Eminem,"Oh, that's definitely Paul."
Interviewer,Paul Rosenberg?
Eminem,"Yeah, my manager. He and I go at it during the making of every album, and sometimes we're on the same page and sometimes we're not. He's usually right about it, though. It's just hard when you've spent so much time on something, writing and recording, laying the vocals, getting the hook right, getting the beat right, making everything sound right,you spent a freaking week trying to make it sound perfect, and someone comes along and shoots it down."
Interviewer,"You're so lucky to have someone like that, though."
Eminem,"Absolutely,because, like I said, he usually ends up being right. When I played him ""Not Afraid"" for the first time, he wasn't too fond of it. Then we had a conversation a few days later, and he was like, ""Do you think it needs a bridge?"" And I was like, ""I knew you were going to say that.""."
Interviewer,"A great editor is the most valuable thing you can have as an artist because, as you said, sometimes you get too close to something. I think, apart from your talent, that's why you have the career you have,because you have great people behind you."
Eminem,Absolutely.
Interviewer,"When this album comes out, people are going to want to hear it. It's a tribute to your longevity as an artist, your intelligence, your musical and lyrical brilliance. I'm so happy you exist in the world, and I'm just so proud of you. You've worked so hard on yourself, and no one deserves this more than you, Marshall, and I love you from a long way away, okay?"
Eminem,"Thank you, Elton. I love you, too."
Interviewer,You already be history all right there we go we're out of here all right go that's it sway so before we get started.
Eminem,Will you please sign this damn baby bro craziness our teenage years I didn't know I had bars once once upon a time.
Interviewer,Huh let me say marshall you want me to say yes please okay that's em pay rs80 mmm-hmm and I signed a vinyl for him.
Eminem,Yeah look at that man look at incredible yo yeah man your signatures so much better than mine thanks man yeah no.
Interviewer,Problem man oh man you threw me off with that up your whole not really this.
Eminem,Impressed that you dug that deep in the creeks man I didn't know you I'm always digging the crates uh that's good to.
Interviewer,Know man that's good to know do you want to use any lyrics from any of those songs on that vinyl but I doubt what I.
Eminem,Was gonna ask you where where cameras are off there's a couple bars and I wish I could have yeah that's cool man go.
Interviewer,Ahead man what's mine is yours man if it make your tighter you know to speak on Barstow and we are kamikaze came out you.
Eminem, know you shocked the world the way you did it what made you do it I mean a revival came out December 2017 I wasn't.
Interviewer, there long ago it's less than a year what made you just drop it on the world the way you did because I feel like I.
Eminem, feel like the way the climate is right now if you give people if you give people enough time to I got an I'm.
Interviewer, coming out in two months you give people time to say man you better have a song like this all right with it if.
Eminem, you don't have a song like this I ain't with it yeah he better not be rapping like this he better not be.
Interviewer,Rapping about this or i'm not gonna with it and when you go into an album you're going to anything with the.
Eminem,Mindset of this is gonna suck and then even if even if you kind of don't feel that way you're already kind of formed.
Interviewer,Your opinion in front of all your friends and you know I'm saying late so I feel like I feel like giving them.
Eminem,No warning was the best thing to do just because it doesn't give people enough time to you know when the revival.
Interviewer,Tractors came down the pipe yeah i remember that it was like overwhelmingly this is gonna be trash yeah.
Eminem,And that was me nobody really wanted to be wrong about it yeah they had already formed I'm not saying everybody but a.
Interviewer,Lot of people had already you know form their opinions so yeah that was interesting like revival really got ran.
Eminem,Through the wringer so to speak before it even got off the ground but you know it this is that day and age you know oh.
Interviewer,Yeah you know how but you just it to that like before which is what I find interesting about you before you spent.
Eminem,Your whole career being critiqued and criticized by organizations like LGBTQ community or college campuses or police.
Interviewer,Departments you know but hip-hop always stood by you so that was you know that's what you found your refuge but now it.
Eminem,Came from inside of hip-hop you know how did that affect you me sitting back and seeing things that I saw it was kind of.
Interviewer,Like i felt like i felt a bunch of different ways I felt like okay maybe because it doesn't sound like everything.
Eminem,Else in there in and what what most people are doing mm-hmm maybe that was what tainted their here because I.
Interviewer,Remember a time in hip-hop where you had to be so different from the next person or you were trash there's a shift.
Eminem,Somewhere that happened that if it doesn't sound like everything else then it's trash automatically yeah and I just.
Interviewer,Said back like okay all right i can take that it's not like I can't take constructive criticism but I feel like.
Eminem,It kind of went beyond constructive criticism so I had to go back to it and look.
Interviewer,I have made albums that definitely probably would not be my the top of my list.
Eminem,Mm-hmm what encore okay relapse which i believe encores are better album and relapse relapse is something that I.
Interviewer,Looked at a couple of years went back to and cringed at oh Jesus Christ I even realized I was doing that many accidents.
Eminem,I don't i just studied for whatever reason I just got into it and was just like started on this weird serial killer.
Interviewer,Vibe kind of thing and started wanting to talk crazy and start bending words more than only way you could bend them.
Eminem,Bend them is with this accent trying to use this one like and a couple years later I you know in making recovery and.
Interviewer,Slipping out of that getting out of the accents and Beyond it made recovery yeah and I always say that if it wasn't for.
Eminem,Relapse i wouldn't have been able to make recovery and if it wasn't with if it wasn't for revival.
Interviewer,I wouldn't been able to make this out so I'm good with it it just you know some people more than others went a little.
Eminem,Weird little far with it a little far what I want to get into that too and I almost you know when I listen to.
Interviewer,Kamikaze and i hear some people say man that's the vintage em we want it you know we want it shady back right and.
Eminem,When i listen to it man i have to admit man I hear something in you on this album that kind of made me rejoice.
Interviewer,Anyway i've done in the past i like the fact that you're not running from the criticism I like the fact that in this.
Eminem,Digital age you're not you know cowering and in reforming to what people think you should sound like how people think.
Interviewer,You should act and you're calling it out and I actually like some of these review shows that you see on YouTube and they.
Eminem,Take people's music and they have fun with it I look at these kids and I and I see us when we were young myself when I.
Interviewer,Was younger i've seen you too but we'll go to a G Rap Album and oh this was dope that was dope farside album this was.
Eminem,Dope yeah they just kind of doing that right and you dress them so you're that in tuned like.
Interviewer,In the beginning a ring ring when you talk about if you could teach fatigue me you know you can make millions if I.
Eminem,Could teach you there's nothing i would be yeah it gets into the territory where it's like it's like you got okay so.
Interviewer,Since the internet has become what the Internet's be coming here since YouTube and all that you've got so many how can.
Eminem,I say this it's it's almost like not enough Indians too many chiefs so it's like somebody everybody on the internet.
Interviewer,And in hip-hop especially is it seemed like either a rapper DJ a writer producer does something has something to.
Eminem,Do with it and it's in and i love the fact I love the fact that so many people now have been able to get on easier than.
Interviewer,It was for me or you back in the day cuz we didn't have that we didn't have this platform so I appreciate the platform.
Eminem,It's just that now you've got now you've got people that not only are doing the same thing and they can do it better but.
Interviewer,You've got people who don't do anything and are just critiquing it so I sat back and I'm like okay that's fine people can.
Eminem,Talk crazy about me that's fine they should they should express themselves and they have a right to but I also get.
Interviewer,To say whatever the i want about you know mmm I'm like I said I'm good with revival it.
Eminem,Mm-hmm because i couldn't have made this album without that yeah and there is something I'm not gonna lie there is.
Interviewer,Something inside me that is a little more happy when I'm angry it's like as much as I as bad as it feels you know to.
Eminem,Be there there's also something about it there's a rush of it that I like because it inspires me to say something back.
Interviewer,You getting that weird area to where it's like oh it's just he doesn't care about what anybody thinks about him but.
Eminem,Now he cares about what everybody thinks about him no he's just saying he don't care he'll.
Interviewer,Say anything he wants about you if you say about him because he doesn't care like there's so many different levels to.
Eminem,Not caring about you know i'm saying but it was interesting it was definitely interesting because I'm like.
Interviewer,How off his mic here yeah jesus Christ like and then and then it was interesting to watch the reaction of the.
Eminem,Chloraseptic remix verse that i did you know with 2 Chainz and get out in January you kind of you touched on you.
Interviewer,Guys form to opinion just from a track that's where I was at yeah at that point in time that is definitely where I was.
Eminem,At but i watch people going oh why wasn't this only viable honestly I probably what if I said it was on.
Interviewer,Revival you won't know because you didn't listen probably yeah but I kind of felt like okay I guess this is what.
Eminem,People might want cuz i'm always stuck in that what the do people want like like you were saying that the OM is.
Interviewer,Back and he's too old to be dough and he can't do like no matter what when Isaac I should have zagged no matter what you.
Eminem,Got half and half every single time you kind of say that you allude to it and one of the songs well you said.
Interviewer,You set the bar so high that you know at this point you know everything is considered a failure like you almost.
Eminem,Competing with yourself that you touch on it a lot in every song well not every song but majority of songs you touch on.
Interviewer,It i appreciate but i have to like the Joe Button thing is it's a really interesting because that along with MGK.
Eminem,Of course it's making a lot of noise out there and it throws a lot of folks off when Joe first started commenting it was.
Interviewer,Mixed reaction some people said it was disloyal some people said man he's entitled to his opinion well I would.
Eminem,Assume that obviously it got under your skin considering relationship you've had with him with slaughterhouse.
Interviewer,Yes how do you how did how do you describe your relationship with Joe but how do you describe.
Eminem,Shop with joe button i mean listen me and Joe button aren't you know we're not friends like that we're not like we.
Interviewer,Didn't go to the same high school or something I'm saying so I get that part but when I'm out here flying.
Eminem,Around to different places and doing interviews and trying to use my platform to pump up slaughterhouse every chance I.
Interviewer,Get and you're using your platform to trash me and I'm one of the things that keeps this ship moving do you know I'm saying so you're doing.
Eminem, something you've got a voice in hip-hop so you actually could be affecting this ship a little bit you know saying.
Interviewer, because you don't owe me nothing but I've never gotten a interview and been like Joe Budden is.
Eminem, trash that last album he put out is trash so that's that's kind of the attitude I took to this whole album.
Interviewer,Kamikaze is like alright what if i give everybody my opinion about them but I want to talk about slaughterhouse.
Eminem,Because there's a lot of including myself people that really feel like this slaughterhouse saga was unfinished you.
Interviewer,Know i know there's a glass house album that was pretty much completed but never release right.
Eminem,Where we had left it about two years ago was everybody came in and different some of some of the guys in the group picked.
Interviewer,Certain beats so many guys didn't feel those beats are they like the other beats and there was like there was.
Eminem,Definitely enough songs to put an album out but for the most part it wasn't a complete picture because everybody.
Interviewer,Wasn't on the same page of what their favorite songs were so I thought they were gonna go back go back home regroup.
Eminem,And try to make a few more songs i didn't hear anything from that and then at that point I started getting really.
Interviewer,Deep into revival you know i was recording every day so a couple months go by and from what I understand it to.
Eminem,Be what i was told I didn't hear this firsthand like Joe said slaughterhouse ain't hot right now.
Interviewer,We don't have a buzz we need to put out next table from that point everybody started branching out Royce went and did.
Eminem,His album crime like everybody started doing their own kind of song oh so I thought they were just happy with.
Interviewer,That you know i'm saying like they just wanted to maybe work on their own projects for a while and we would come.
Eminem,Back and visit this or whatever when we made the first other house album the welcome to our welcome to our house that.
Interviewer,Was another album that i felt like holy people who literally just trashed this they trashed this out and there was a huge backlash of oh man you.
Eminem, say what we want to hear it sounds too polished and elicits like you're not listen you're critiquing these guys who.
Interviewer, are wordsmiths jr. I'm saying like so you're there's look there's a certain type of person that man I like I.
Eminem, only like two beats a certain type of person that would lean towards lyrics mortars certain type of person that was.
Interviewer, leaning towards a voice more they like better you know I'm saying like everybody leans towards towards their.
Eminem, own thing but I was just like holy cuz to me the beats were crazy on that album and only thing I did was added my.
Interviewer, little touch of like sprinkle in music in these tracks and mixing them to try to bring out you know the production a.
Eminem, little bit which I don't even know if I did any actual beats on there on the first album but but all I heard was the.
Interviewer, backlash that it was too polished yeah so we said okay let's do another album and then you guys do what you want to do.
Eminem, with it which is kind of we left the ball in their Court kind of thing so I didn't want to touch.
Interviewer, it in a sense of like other than give my opinions on songs I didn't want to touch it I didn't with my production because I.
Eminem, felt like if what if that is the reason yeah that they didn't sell albums I don't want to hinder that you know.
Interviewer, saying so we gave him another album and next thing I know I hear Joe talking about who got that money who got what.
Eminem, money mm-hmm like he did say I saw a clip that he put up interview with him a crooked.
Interviewer, that he felt like that maybe perhaps like he alluded there you and Paul got joy the money there but but the album I.
Eminem, hate to say this because I think the guys are super talented but the album didn't do much to even recoup the.
Interviewer, first budget then we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the second album that never came out what money.
Eminem, didn't you get I don't know if I made a dime off slaughterhouse I don't care if I made nothing I believed in.
Interviewer,Them so i you know i wanted them to i wanted them to be huge man I really did I wanted a group that lyrical to.
Eminem,Just must do everything you know i'm saying and it definitely hurt my feelings a lot when the album didn't do.
Interviewer,Good the first album it was just like man like when we got ceiling on the hook of the my life song I was like yo this is this might be out of here what.
Eminem, was the meaning behind the line when you said the last hit you I'm paraphrasing the last hit you got was what your ex.
Interviewer, chicken that was what that was was that that was a tap just a tap it was a tap but he was also saying that his his.
Eminem, alleged domestic abuse things or whatever which I'm not gonna get into butt but I feel like I feel like the.
Interviewer, reason I had to do that is because like I said there's a there's a there's a fine line between saying you know what.
Eminem, this guy's really been cool to me he's helped me out and tried to help out on many occasion so I'm not gonna go in on.
Interviewer, untouchable like that I'm gonna say it ain't for me not crazy about it whatever whatever but to be the worst song you've.
Eminem, ever heard in your life have you listened to your own do you not listen back cuz if that's the worst.
Interviewer, song you've ever heard in your life I don't know yes it's interesting so we'll never see.
Eminem,That glass house album probably as far as you know I don't know III don't have the answer to that I uh I I want to just.
Interviewer,Make it clear though that aside from the drill I think that slaughterhouse is one of the best rap groups ever to.
Eminem,Ever happen but that being said i i wish their first album would have connected yeah two more people that I did I don't.
Interviewer,To this day i still don't mean paul it was like haha what the happened you know I'm saying like but look man.
Eminem,Everybody's not gonna like everything you put out all the time so that was a dream team of emcees though and I think.
Interviewer,A lot to what you're saying in regards to why aren't people reacting to these words Smith is that's how we came up you.
Eminem,Know and honestly what people may not realize is that's what really separated hip-hop from R&B rock and roll and other.
Interviewer,Genres was our ability to bend words to create patterns I made it unique to our genre specifically which it seems like.
Eminem,It's something that doesn't get any credibility or people don't put a hole not everybody put a whole lot into that.
Interviewer,Now they don't give a lot of credence to that you know which is probably slaughterhouse could have been a victim.
Eminem,Of that that kind of ideology you also in this album you went in on MGK you guys had a discrepancy he mentioned it.
Interviewer,In his response song rap devil you know that let's call sway and ask him why I can't.
Eminem,Get on shade four or five that was in response so I've seen him on the street once and I didn't know he couldn't come.
Interviewer,Up to shade at that time four or five and I said man come on up man and then I had to see him again and say hey man I.
Eminem,Don't know what the is yeah but until that gets cleared up there's no way I can have you on there.
Interviewer,Yeah what's the with that what happened whoa the is just for the record the the thing that was going on.
Eminem,And he was saying about my daughter i didn't even know about that and so like literally like a year and a.
Interviewer,Half later I wasn't it just it never hit my radar and then one day you know you'd go down.
Eminem,The wormhole the youtube and whatever right so I see Machine Gun Kelly talks about Eminem's daughter.
Interviewer,Whatever right so the click on it like yo why is he then he starts doing a press run basically about Haley I'm like.
Eminem,What the yo my man better yeah chill right so that's not why I dis them the reason that distant is actually a.
Interviewer,Lot more petty than that okay the reason that our distant is because he got on first he said first at first when he.
Eminem,Said i'm the greatest rapper alive since my favorite rapper ban me from shade 45 or whatever he said right like I'm.
Interviewer,Trying to hinder his career cycle about your career you think I actually think about you you know how many rappers that are are better.
Eminem, than you you're not even in the conversation I don't care if you blower if you don't blow doesn't matter.
Interviewer, to me but then when you get on tech minds album and you start sending shots and people start hitting me up yo.
Eminem, machine gun just Yui just dissed you reduced you I'm like I listen to it I'm like did he really diss me no I keep.
Interviewer, listening to it y'all just rap you're not gods and then somebody sends me a screenshot of his Twitter and it says.
Eminem, had some to get off my chest you just rapped you not God some like that and I was like a reference for.
Interviewer, the rap god phone yeah so I'm like on the song he said y'all just rap you not gods and on Twitter he said you just rap.
Eminem, you not God had some to get off my chest and I'm seen and by the way this was on the heels of the freestyle here.
Interviewer, just did about shade 45s like shut the up shut the up now now I mean this weird thing because I'm.
Eminem,Like i gotta answer this and every time I do that it makes that person is as irrelevant as.
Interviewer,People say i am em in hip-hop i make them bigger by getting into this thing where i'm like i want to destroy him but.
Eminem,I also don't want to make him bigger do you know what I'm saying because now you're a enemy so I'll leave it.
Interviewer,At that i'm not sure exactly what i'm gonna do at this point right now because I'm still kind of waiting to see what.
Eminem,You haven't heard his rap devil response not heard it what are you thinking it's it's not bad for him.
Interviewer,Mm-hmm he has some good lines in it did John really call Interscope to try to shell this no I I had never made a cop.
Eminem, we made a call to Diddy really I got did his number just hit him up yo did he went up never happened it.
Interviewer, didn't feel like a distant me it just felt like pitiful mmm oh my god now I'm feeling bad for so I might even have.
Eminem, to do with so that's how that happened so he made it reply to my reply so regardless of what the he wants to.
Interviewer, say who was from six years ago shut the up shut the up wait I'm telling you.
Eminem,The reason that dis do now yeah i'm telling you and I'm gonna sit back and I'm gonna wait for a second just to see.
Interviewer,It because if people start firing off and not trying to answer every body that I diss them kamikaze or had.
Eminem,Words about i'm gonna be going the next five years make it this song after dis song you know I'm saying so.
Interviewer,Yeah like you're gonna get hit though Jesse Reyes is featured on this project mm-hmm young up-and-coming star she's on.
Eminem,Two songs how did you find jesse reyes i was coming home I got home one night from a video shoot actually and she was.
Interviewer,On tv was a seth meyers show mm-hmm and she was doing that song gatekeeper that was like.
Eminem,Is this cuz her voice to me was so crazy so I rewound it I was like oh I gotta check her out so I went down the.
Interviewer,Wormhole of looking up and i was like oh I really want to with this chick cuz she right now I'm my personal.
Eminem,Opinion i think she's gonna really blow up mm-hmm that's my personal opinion I've seen people very talented people.
Interviewer,Not do that but i think that i would put my money on her that she will absolutely be huge but I don't even know if like it.
Eminem,Necessarily in the pop world or anything like that I don't feel like she does pop music I feel like she she just cuz she.
Interviewer,Comes from a real place and she writes her own first time I got in a studio with her I played her a couple.
Eminem,Beats and she just started right into one right there laid a hook good guy I was like oh.
Interviewer,So she runs away to a good guy a good guy yeah the one she's singing at the end yeah.
Eminem,There's a nice guy good guy and the reason that that happened is because oddly enough she had already had a song.
Interviewer,Called nice guy she had that song right so I think that was the last day I was in LA I came back.
Eminem,Home and wrote sat at one and then i was like I'm gonna write - the other one - but they're both saying nice guy good.
Interviewer,Guy i was like i'll make it like his kind of one song Dre's all over this project Trey's input was all over it for.
Eminem,Sure he felt like me and him had a couple discussions about the last album and one of the things that he said to me.
Interviewer,Was like he was like he he hit me up on Dave's like yo I don't like how are talking about your album and he had heard revival right.
Eminem, yeah him and Jimmy Iovine has sat in there and listened to most of the songs I had done at Rick Rubin studio and.
Interviewer, based off that reaction I think Dre was a little confused too when that happen probably not more so.
Eminem, than me but but we had a conversation earlier in the year and I think I had only had one song by that time it this.
Interviewer, was like January yeah I had the one song and was thinking about releasing it and then another song got when I got back to.
Eminem, Detroit recorded it like okay now I got two songs I might as well do a album and that's kind of how that came.
Interviewer, about but Drake also there's a couple songs that he kind of dated him just because he didn't have a good reaction.
Eminem, to him and he also felt like one of them's going a little far what does that mean like how far did it go it's it it.
Interviewer, definitely went too far when you say go too far I feel like kamikaze was the place where if you were ever gonna go so.
Eminem, called too far this is where it would be you did the B et verse for the rap cypher and in it you covered a lot of.
Interviewer, content that was relevant to the world we live in today that some folks want to sweep under the rug and this is my own.
Eminem, personal opinion conversations we have every day on che for five months weigh in the morning we talked about you know.
Interviewer, then justice policies prejudice we talked about discrimination all of these different things whether or not we're in.
Eminem, the middle of a race war that is trying to be perpetrated by people in power not a war in a sense where people don't pick.
Interviewer, up guns and shoot it well maybe Brad but in terms of psychologically the whole nine so when you did that verse on.
Eminem, the BT cipher what I thought why it was necessary King crooked had a song called I can't breathe.
Interviewer, where he talks about man we can't just beat only one sameness white rappers shouldn't stay quiet white rappers.
Eminem, shouldn't stay quiet I can't tell you how hard that one hit me it was to the point where I'm like this is how strong.
Interviewer, I feel about something I gotta put it in the right words you know and I saw where it was like oh.
Eminem, these are these are not new subjects they're new to M&M and you know that kind of.
Interviewer, how did you respond to that reaction you did you got back last for that you know I got backlash for the Trump cypher and.
Eminem, and yeah you know it is what it is at least at least when this is all said and done maybe I can just be on the.
Interviewer, right side of history but you got people dissecting the bars and going all the is trash it's not even that good.
Eminem,And that's not what it's about you're missing the whole point do you know I'm saying I'm trying to like I'm.
Interviewer,Trying to say this also to my fanbase who might have voted for him a lot of people in my family did and at the time.
Eminem,I did the cypher i realized after it was all said and done that maybe maybe I should have just attacked him when you.
Interviewer,Said a drunk he drew a line and a sane man should have not done that you should have reworded it and showed empathy -.
Eminem,Well that's what i realized after i was done that's kind of how I felt because it's like okay this is this is like this.
Interviewer,Is backfiring on me and i don't care i don't give a if if that's what happened and hurt my sales I don't care.
Eminem,About that yeah i care about the message I'm trying to convey why you felt a need to stand up though what was that for you.
Interviewer,Have marshall what majors because because I was just watching it every single day I watched a lot of news right.
Eminem,Yeah the thing that pissed me off the most that really set me off to when I started going crazy with the pen because.
Interviewer,I'm like the kapernick thing and when that happen and how he kept changing the narrative and kept changing.
Eminem,The narrative you ah i i can't i can't um I'm gonna get into this whole trunk anymore but whoa you mentioned at.
Interviewer,The end of the wringer asian orange sending a secret service to your house that the Secret Service really come to.
Eminem,Your house after that they came to my studio yeah and they asked they had they were just.
Interviewer,Basically asking me questions about my lyrics to see if what the intent was behind him and if I was making a actual.
Eminem,Threat or just expressing myself so so that really happened wow that's crazy right now what we're seeing too cuz.
Interviewer,Colin kapernick was named the face of Nikes 30th anniversary let's do it you saw that right and then you got a whole.
Eminem,Slew of people that are now burning nike shoes and Nike I saw that product it's infuriating yeah when you think yeah.
Interviewer,Like really dude nike supports people who need for the anthem at this point come on seriously seriously you.
Eminem,Got to be a to think that that's just what it's about and it's that cut and dry.
Interviewer,Yeah you know what i'm saying like there's a meaning behind this and there's real pain behind this and.
Eminem,You're burning a pair of shoes when you go about your day and you got your job and you're doing.
Interviewer,Thinking about all this other that's what really bothers you people ain't gonna stop watching.
Eminem,Football they're just not yeah football to me is the best sport there is.
Interviewer,And what draws you to the game should not be if that's how you feel about your country and you feel like you should.
Eminem,Stand for the anthem stand for the anthem that's fine but you also need to realize.
Interviewer,That this is america and people have died for these rights to be able to protest and to be able to take a knee.
Eminem,Stop making it personal about yourself you have nothing to do with this I agree we got to get back to Tyler.
Interviewer,To create a man i'm a i'm a big fan of Tyler's you know and I recently saw him perform I know that Tyler was a big fan.
Eminem,Of yours growing up right and then uh i recall you even reading about you saying some good things about our future are.
Interviewer,They pushing boundaries years ago yeah for sure and you said some great things about them about them as a talent.
Eminem,And pushing boundaries as a group future as a whole yeah what happened what she died you.
Interviewer,Know i really did like him i i thought like I thought their movement was really cool too.
Eminem,Good job make music we didn't make music but you know I just felt like okay there's a mutual expect you respect you.
Interviewer,Know and a lot of this did that ended up happening after that like the Tweety put out with talking about shady.
Eminem,15 and why can't people a little close to him tell him that his sucks and it's trash and like okay listen man you.
Interviewer,Don't have to like it and it could really suck but being that somebody really was cool to you you would expect.
Eminem,Some kind of reciprocation and just don't we go public with it and publicly express your opinion and how much my is trash okay so I talk I chalk it.
Interviewer, up to them being young and just kids you know I'm saying so it was like all right I've been there when I'm saying like I.
Eminem, was dick when I first came out I'm saying like yeah man it worked I don't yeah I feel bad about it I'm.
Interviewer, sorry if I ever was a dick to you but I don't think I ever was was I you know one time man but hey oh yeah yeah that's.
Eminem, true all talk about that okay so I liked them in and then Earl Sweatshirt gets in an interview after after Tyler trashes.
Interviewer, me and then Earl Sweatshirt everybody listens everything's drinking too much Mountain Dew and I'm just like.
Eminem, really like what the like you know I'm saying like you guys were just on tour with us we hung out like we kicked.
Interviewer, it make jokes like you know I'm saying like so the last straw like look I know a lot of this.
Eminem, I could I I could come across being very petty yeah but at a certain point in time someone has their breaking point.
Interviewer, you know I'm saying so when Tyler tweeted out the thing about walk on water this song is.
Eminem, horrible I was like all right I need to say something now because this is.
Interviewer, stupid mm-hmm you know but at the same time I'm not gonna let everybody just keep.
Eminem, I'm not gonna be America's punching bag and just won't think is cool and safe just say whatever the.
Interviewer, they want about me thinking shocks people um because for all your career you was the I just don't give a.
Eminem, that can work both ways how so because you don't give a you will fire back at somebody who says something about you.
Interviewer, I picked and chose who to that I wanted to say my piece with yeah because a lot of those things were personal but then.
Eminem, there's a lot of things that aren't personal and kamikaze you know it's just the game in competition you know.
Interviewer, training spirit of m3 spirit of an MC yeah but um you know with the Tyler the Creator thing and I I realized now and I.
Eminem, realized when I when I when I said it but I wasn't like in the mind frame of I was angry when I said the about.
Interviewer, Tyler the fact of like every time I saw this kid like I'm always so cool you know I'm saying like I I I loved his.
Eminem, energy like everything you know saying like he was a funny dude like he's super charismatic and but I'm sitting.
Interviewer, back like man at what point at what point do I have to say something just to defend myself and.
Eminem, I think that the word that I called him on the album was on that song was one of the things where I felt like this might.
Interviewer, be too far because it might in my the homophobe in my quest yeah in my quest to hurt him I realized that I was.
Eminem, hurting a lot of other people by saying and at the time I was so mad it was just whatever look.
Interviewer, in the midst of everything else that was going on on this album and the things that it took to pull this album together.
Eminem, and all that kind of it was one of the things that I kept going back to going I don't feel right with this.
Interviewer, before the album came out I had the conversation with Paul and we spun the word back.
Eminem, but now I realize people can hear what I'm saying anyways in the case of this man I feel like just man I wish you and.
Interviewer, Tyler could sit down and hash that one out now that to fire Joe shot back and he said what he said because I think.
Eminem, that's a special young man and he could probably use your mentorship and you could probably feed off of what he has.
Interviewer, to offer as well I could tell this different from Joe or some of the other yeah it's definitely different it's not.
Eminem, it's not it is it's not as personal it's one of them things like I do you-you-you you deserve a tap now.
Interviewer, because I think you thought it was cool too just because you slid with the other things and I didn't say because.
Eminem, like I said I was talking it up to them being young and just kids man I'm like but at the same time at what point do I.
Interviewer, just got to switch topics because something I see I keep hearing this reoccurring theme about how important.
Eminem, writing is you know one of my favorite tracks on the album is featuring an up-and-coming star that I think he along.
Interviewer, with others that you mentioned on the album like shine or trigger Jay Cole yeah.
Eminem, joining of Lucas powerful real powerful artist I like y'all together on this track you know I think it's a good mesh.
Interviewer, between a veteran and somebody who's on the rise he's so good - what is it about him that you like the first time my song.
Eminem, was like five years ago with the it wanted to be et Cypress and I peeped how he was like he was saying a lot of lines.
Interviewer, that I saw some of me and that but at the same time I it was different because it was like early on in my career.
Eminem, whenever I get to do a BT cypher I want to try to right til my stands out you know.
Interviewer, I'm saying and he stood out so much to me I was like yo easy which was talking about Miley Cyrus and I'm not mistaken.
Eminem, I'm pretty sure it was something like that but he was talking about pop stars and he was doing this kind of thing but.
Interviewer, I'm like yo people are gonna remember that I remembered it and then I kind of started when he made it the Ross.
Eminem, capiccioni yeah the way he did it from the two perspectives it was genius and it was like stood out wasn't it out so.
Interviewer, much to me like not only that though like the rhymes become listening to the rhondettes.
Eminem, when I'm listening to a rapper I'm listening to what you bringing to the table as far as a skill set right that's.
Interviewer, the first thing I'm a honing on but the fact that like I said like he's not compromising bars to tell his story he.
Eminem, still got complexity in there ya know Sam and he he but he's the water I went like he's taking you on his journey and.
Interviewer, I never snapped out of that journey till he was over you know saying like I was like yo this kid is incredible.
Eminem, y'all got a summer and I'm paraphrasing I can't remember the lyrics exactly but you come in with a verse where you say I.
Interviewer, got a couple of mansions but I still don't have any manners you got a couple of golf writers but to.
Eminem, these kids that don't actually matter what the happened the hip-hop was going on with hip-hop people took that.
Interviewer, line and thought you were indirectly talking about Drake no see here's the thing I saw and I saw that too yeah.
Eminem, Drake is always gonna be in my good graces because he did something for for one of my daughters that I will never.
Interviewer, forget and he will always be in my graces with that and I like Drake what I'm telling you with these lines is I.
Eminem, don't know what's real and what's not it at this point you know I'm saying because you hear.
Interviewer, about this rapper that rap or whatever I'm telling you that I don't do it never have and never will if I ever.
Eminem,Need a ghostwriter I need to just put the mic down you know saying huh so that's my.
Interviewer,Personal belief as far as anybody out here too that does use ghostwriters that's fine.
Eminem,That's if that's what you do that's fine but I'm telling you I don't do it hip-hop was the most important thing.
Interviewer,That empowered me as a kid it made me feel I have a line where I say it made me feel tough when I wasn't yeah when I.
Eminem,Was a scrawny little kid growing up on eight mile walking up the block put headphones on and it made me feel.
Interviewer,Powerful hip-hop probably was I I mean it was it was it was like my dad mmm.
Eminem,Hip-hop you know i'm saying and it was the only thing that made me empowered it made me feel good about myself and when.
Interviewer,I started being able to write rhymes and figured out I could do it that's where the feeling comes from to me because the.
Eminem,Excitement is being able to come up with the you know I'm saying it taught me how to throw my first punch gave me.
Interviewer,The confidence okay be able to throw my first punch and to realize not only that the fact that proof used to beat my ass.
Eminem,All the time in the backyard boxing and one time he beat me like literally to the ground.
Interviewer,What and he was just like em let's just stop cuz I kept getting up coming at him but I'm like but I just kept getting.
Eminem,Beat up he was fast man he's very quick and he's but it made me realize like okay taking a punch is nothing you know.
Interviewer,I'm saying like it's not your fear when you're a kid is like oh my God if I get hit what's it gonna work to hit me in.
Eminem,The nose in it jazz my nose in my brain and I died like kind of you think about but nah man hip-hop hip-hop like.
Interviewer,Since its beginning i was always under the impression that every rapper wrote their rhymes and when you heard about ku.
Eminem,Modi battling busy b mm-hmm it was who's bringing the best rhymes to the table you know saying who's gonna be.
Interviewer,Able to say the best who's the cleverest in the wittiest and then years later fast forward you hear eazy-e.
Eminem,Saying ice cube writes the rhymes that i say mmm-hmm and I remember being a kid like hearing.
Interviewer,The line but it never really i i just didn't really care no you know I'm saying it didn't really affect the way I.
Eminem,Felt about eazy-e or the way i felt about in waa I think in all fairness though I think Drake there's a superior.
Interviewer,Writer to be able to sustain the level of success he has yeah I mean he makes great music there's not really even much.
Eminem,You can say about it you know on this kamikaze album I feel like I was pretty directed whoo yeah I was kind of taking.
Interviewer,Shots at going that and who i wasn't you know saying I wouldn't send subliminals to Drake for there'd be no reason for me.
Eminem,To do that but i am expressing to you that regardless of what any of these other dudes do I have never not even a.
Interviewer,Line not even anything i wouldn't be able to have fun with it if I couldn't write it that makes sense you go in.
Eminem,Really hard about the grammys in a way man you kind of you drag the Grammys in the mud and you talk about you have a.
Interviewer,Few grammys but you feel like you had to sell your soul to get on and you didn't know if you wanted it for the.
Eminem,Recognition or the trophies but it was the difference you know and that Grammys pretty much sucked the blood of artists.
Interviewer,And nominate them have them come to the shows and which they do theirs every year yeah and I got I'm just tired of seeing it and for whatever.
Eminem, reason it's like they're always pitching this hint that you might win album of the year which is a used to be a big.
Interviewer, deal I don't think it's a big deal now you know sat at home this year for the Grammys and watched J and Kendrick not.
Eminem, get it and I felt like one of them should have got it I felt like joining the lucra should.
Interviewer, have won a Grammy for I'm not racist you know absolutely should have won a Grammy every year we we we wit it was I.
Eminem, would be up for album of the year and then the winner is Norah Jones who and I I.
Interviewer, don't I'm not even trying to say anything bad about her music I just at that point I had never heard of her yeah.
Eminem, and none of my friends did either you know I'm saying so we okay whatever and then Steely Dan.
Interviewer, okay I know Steely Dan is you know Steely Dan back in the day you know I'm saying but more than the Marshall.
Eminem, Mathers LP impact like okay fine I watched 50 same 50 did not win best you were new artists at the Grammys.
Interviewer, there was nothing bigger than nothing bigger and nobody nobody since maybe like Snoop came out the gate like that.
Eminem, my first album didn't do it I never saw someone's first album and the wave happened like he had and then he doesn't.
Interviewer, get it and then I get up there another year and what was it the Eminem show and it was like whatever I'm fine if I lose.
Eminem, to Kanye or someone that I'm like okay I respect that I know who that is and Kanye has a huge following and.
Interviewer, he's made a massive impact on music fine I'm good with that but don't get us all here to use.
Eminem, your selling point for your show and stiff everybody every single time and I said after that point in time.
Interviewer, I was like don't ever ask me to come here again please do not ask me my answer is no for a hundred million years.
Eminem, never again will I go to the grave well well now you know I know the Jimmy Jam and and and some of the.
Interviewer, members of the board they are reaching out Just Blaze and different folks are now trying to make it better would you.
Eminem, ever consider you know joining the board and maybe you have a vote in it first of all that vote is fake as that's not.
Interviewer, a real vote that's not a real vote they give it to who they want to give it to they give it to their darlings the.
Eminem, oh this got critical acclaim but it sold two records like it ain't no about always what you sell I get that.
Interviewer,Vanilla ice i understand you know i'm saying like but there comes a point where when an overwhelming something.
Eminem,Comes along that has this wave and impact on music and you give it to a lotta Dottie who lot of Dottie.
Interviewer, something Lottie Dottie but you know what I'm saying like it's like man I don't know who won over Kendrick and J.
Eminem, Bruno Mars is incredible Bruno Mars is great but I remember Beyonce they went for the album lemonade yeah.
Interviewer, yeah it's like what the hell you know it's like they're so tone-deaf to what is actually going on but they're.
Eminem, not in a sense of oh we're gonna give B hunter here we're gonna get J here we're gonna get we can say all these names are.
Interviewer, gonna be here we'll make them play I guarantee you I guarantee you that the people from the Grammys was on the phone.
Eminem, with Beyonce's people or jay-z's people saying every year that they're up for something hinting they're gonna win to.
Interviewer, get them to come there nobody guarantee you over there I guess I won't see you at the Grammys this year yeah.
Eminem, probably not I mean I oh yeah what if you nominated first of all I won't be okay because.
Interviewer, they know that I don't like them and if I was I wouldn't win because they know that I don't like one final question I.
Eminem, want to ask you about a song that to me man it was probably one of the most heart wrenching songs on the project was.
Interviewer, stepping stone you know and it you tell the history of d12 how it started you know and what happened through the.
Eminem, duration and at the end of it you said it's over that's it what of members aware of that song they.
Interviewer, were they were they were they got they got a heads up and you know I explained I honestly I have not talked to Swifton.
Eminem, and conniver yet about the song they just knew it was coming down the pike but uh the way I explained it is this.
Interviewer, proof was the glue they binded us all together right he did so much the scenes that I didn't even realize.
Eminem, and did things to keep us a group and then motivate us mentioned that you guys knew all this stuff was happening but.
Interviewer, y'all never talked about it you know you were man you know I'm paraphrasing in the verses but everybody was doing their.
Eminem, solo projects and you know y'all was drifting further apart well that's what ended up happening was everybody was.
Interviewer, kind of doing their solo things made solar projects mixtapes and things like that and did we're doing shows and I.
Eminem, think the conversation now going forward is to see if there's anything we can do to help their solo careers you know and.
Interviewer, we'll always be friends man we always been friends smooth kids yeah I'm saying so we'll.
Eminem, always be good on that aspect you know and I want to help them do whatever whatever it is that their next thing is.
Interviewer, on the agenda you know I'm saying mixtape album shopping whatever it is when I listen to these stories and I've.
Eminem, known you since the 90s and I've known you through these ups and downs and even if I wasn't there on your side I was.
Interviewer, there on your team so to speak you know I'm sitting there thinking man this man must have went through some great.
Eminem, therapy because right now where you out you seem like you're in a comfortable place you know who you are you know what.
Interviewer, you want and even though you got these people coming at you get strong enough to respond in the way that you wouldn't.
Eminem, naturally do it how did you get to this place though the did you do therapy was it no I just my music is therapy you.
Interviewer, know so I just I don't know man I've been coasting through and I feel like I just always I write all the time.
Eminem, mm-hmm whether I use it or not you know I write all the time and that's my best therapy is to be able to get stuff out.
Interviewer, just like the d12 song it was like one of those things were like I know that they have things they want to say to me.
Eminem, and I have things I want to say to them so this is kind of how I wanted to tell them like you know I love you guys like.
Interviewer, forever they come here it's just the one day g12 album just doesn't seem in this climate right now dear I don't.
Eminem, know how that would even work you don't say yeah yeah you're going through enough with this climate right.
Interviewer, so imagine d12 let me ask you this moving forward this will be my final question you have always to the public.
Eminem, seemed like an elusive introverted person that they don't always have access to the less I think that's.
Interviewer, hilarious okay by the way you know I'm not going to clubs anymore I don't do that.
Eminem, you know saying I'm sober I don't but I do a lot more and go a lot more places than people actually think I do I just.
Interviewer, do it under the radar man that's all we don't you know in Detroit we don't have paparazzi like LA or New York you know.
Eminem, saying so I'm out a lot it's just that people don't really see me don't you out and about.
Interviewer, yeah that's interesting to know like I said you're not gonna catch me in a club throwing money or you know I'm.
Eminem,Saying like i've been through all those days and all that like as far as you know I've done the old club scene.
Interviewer,You know i did it for a long time too long now but congratulations man I like the Kamikaze project thank you um I.
Eminem,Think the majority of folks who listen to it cannot deny that you an elite group of lyricist okay and I'm a dude.
Interviewer,Who's been in this for multiple decades and you at the top of my list and I like to see you keep flying for regardless.
Eminem,Sort of you know whatever the critics have to say they've been craving you back critics since your first album you.
Interviewer,Know so that that's what it's gonna be but I think people and appreciate the fact that you fire back.
Eminem,That you ain't gonna stand for it and that you still are making you still making great music so congratulations.
Interviewer,Brother absolutely thank you mhm and listen I'm glad I could sign that vinyl for you man.
Eminem,Oh yeah you know if you want to i like i said I'm gonna take it home check out some bars okay here let me see that.
Interviewer,Children's silver distance you see that's why in text shout out the King tectus my brother partner in crime since.
Eminem,High school since day one still swaying Tecla forever shave for five months nice make sure you tune in okay shame.
Interviewer,For five demi .
Interviewer,We see you starting to release new tracks again. Is there an album or mixtape in the works?
Eminem,"Yeah, I have mixtape with Doo Wop coming in a few weeks. Collabos with Krs-One, Black Rob, Kool G Rap, and more. I ain't playing this time. Over 50 joints in seven months? Dude's hungry."
Interviewer,"For those that don't know, maybe some of our younger readers, let's break this down real quick. Correct me if I mistake anything. You hit the scene on a national level in 1994, and were signed to Capitol Records. You dropped two major singles, ""Wherez Da Party At"" and ""Keep It Real"". After you dropped your debut album, Da Miilkrate, by the way I had the cassette (laughs), you kind of left the game for a while. So, my question is"
Eminem,"With Capital shutting down there urban department, it left a bad taste in my mouth for the industry. People think I fell off ... nah. It wasn't in my control. Then, still being under a management contract, and nothing was getting done, I was locked into nothing. So, I said ""F*** it, settled down, got married and decided to try and be a normal person (laughs)."" Marriage failed after nine years, so I said ""F*** this, I'm going back in."" I really wasn't expecting things to develop so fast, and so much love from all over the world. It's a bigger motivator for me."
Interviewer,"It wasn't until five years later, you popped up again on Suge Knight's Death Row Records compilation, The Chronic 2000 (Still Smokin). So, for starts, how did you get introduced to Suge or link up with Deathrow for that collaboration?"
Eminem,"One of my producers had connects with them. And with Eminem dissing me, it was a perfect opportunity at more exposure."
Interviewer,"On The Chronic 2000 (Still Smokin), you went after Eminem on the track, ""Presenting Miilkbone"". Now a lot of people thought, at the time, you were a bitter that another white rapper grabbed the spotlight and was gaining worldwide recognition. Truth is that Eminem dissed you first, along with MC Serch, Pete Nice, Everlast and Vanilla Ice on the track, ""Just Don't Give A F***,"" where he spit ""I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone / I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone."" It was pretty apparent Suge was trying to capitalize on the moment. So, how did it feel when you heard Eminem dissing you on his debut album?"
Eminem,"When I first heard it, I was definitely impressed at his skills. The boy nice as fuck, but I didn't realize he was gonna take off like he did."
Interviewer,"With the diss aside, how did you feel about Eminem before he dissed you?"
Eminem,"Before he dissed me, I never heard of him at all. I was in Detroit on tour and was chilling with Proof (R.I.P.) and all. He never even mentioned Eminem to me. Who knows if we woulda met, what coulda happened. But, everything happens for a reason."
Interviewer,"How do you feel about some of the new breed of white rappers like Asher Roth, MGK and Mac Miller?"
Eminem,Not to familiar with MGK's or Mac's work. But Asher? Nah bruh. I fuck with Rich Quick and Skrewtape all day though.
Interviewer,"Back to Suge. Do you still have communication with him? And, did you have an actual deal with Death Row or it was just a guest appearance on the compilation?"
Eminem,"Nah, I was just a guest appearance. They paid me for it, but no contracts signed."
Interviewer,How did it feel rocking the stage after 12 years?
Eminem,"I was nervous as hell (laughs), but after it started, it was great."
Interviewer,"To be blunt, after all this time, what is making you want to make a come back?"
Eminem,"Like I said I never wanted to stop. After this long of not writing a single word, I got a lot of sh** bottled up. There were times that if I heard a hot joint on the radio, I would shut it off 'cause I would catch myself thinking of lines and flow patterns."
Interviewer,"The world has changed drastically over the last decade. You hit the scene almost 20 years ago. In your own words, how the rap game changed for the better and for the worst in your eyes?"
Eminem,"Like everything else, it evolves. Hip-hop always returns to its essence though. This whole era of ""trap music"" and down south flows happened because the east coast artists stopped being original. It's just the same type of beats with nothing new being said. Now everybody getting tired of what they're hearing on the radio. Again, it's the same ol' same all over again. Meek's my dude and he's the only one I support of these new MC's."
Interviewer,"In the classic ""Keep It Real"" video, you wear rocking a Naughty by Nature hoodie and repping that Jersey brand strong. The Perth Amboy/ East Orange connection was in full tact. Do you still talk to Vin Rock and Treach these days?"
Eminem,"Not really, but it's about to reconnect. 12 years off of the scene is a long time. But, like I said, we weren't only artists, we were friends also. Never a hardship between us."
Interviewer,"How did it feel that your instrumental from ""Keep It Real"" ended up turning into one of the biggest classic freestyle templates of all time? In other words, what was it like hearing a young Jay-Z and Big L giving there all on your beat?"
Eminem,That was an epic feeling. My chin was held head high.
Interviewer,"Back in your ""Wherez Da Part At"" video, you had cameos from Nas, Bill Bellamy, Sticky Fingaz, Play, Naughty By Nature, DJ Red Alert and more. Do you feel like that East Coast unity that once existed is missing now?"
Eminem,"Absolutely. But if you noticed, most of the east coast artists are smart. They're waiting for the Ferris Wheel to come back around. Not too much can be done successfully, until everybody's on the same east coast hip-hop page again."
Interviewer,"When you dropped ""Wherez Da Party At"" back in 95, you made a dope club record. Do you feel like those elements are missing from club bangers today?"
Eminem,"Yeah, 'cause everybody wants the two-stepping joints. There's no joints to make the girls dance anymore."
Interviewer,It's always interesting to hear how an artist got their big break. How did Miilkbone get his demo into the right hands back in the day?
Eminem,"I used to record mix cassettes with Cool V and Biz Markie in V's basement twice a week. Tapes circulate and ended up in Naughty's hands. Then, the real break was after signing to Capital records. ""Keep it Real"" got into the hands of Angie Martinez on Hot 97. She put it on ""Battle of the Beats"", it went five nights in a row, got retired into the Hall of Fame, and beat every from Bush Babies, Redman, and others that I can't recall. Not only, if Capital had there game right, I may not be sitting here. Hot 97 wanted to add it into rotation, but Capital said not yet 'cause it wasn't going into stores for two weeks. what a bunch of idiots."
Interviewer,"You came in the game the same time Nas, Jay-Z, Wu-Tang and Biggie were. You had to be on point with your spit game. It seems like over the last 10 years the lyrics in hip-hop have diminished. What are your feelings on the current state of hip-hop?"
Eminem,My biggest pet peave is the lack of lyrics.
Interviewer,"After the late 90's, you seemed to have disappeared from the public. What were you doing for the last 13 years?"
Eminem,"I was married, raising my son, working, and getting cheated on (laughs). Told you, I'm honest, open and real."
Interviewer,"How does an emcee survive after the record deal is over, and the music game drastically changed for the worst?"
Eminem,"I'm about to find out (laughs). All I can do is do my music from my heart. If it fails or succeeds, I can only blame or commend myself for staying real to what I feel."
Interviewer,"What are your goals? Are you trying to get another deal? If so, major or indie?"
Eminem,"Since nothing is ever promised, all I want is to be comfortable. I want to be able to provide for my son, while doing something I love to do for a living."
Interviewer,What is up first:a mixtape or album?
Eminem,"First mixtape is Miilk and Doo Wop, which is already in the works. We just dropped my first video for ""Keep it Real, Pt. 2,"" and collabed with another joint called ""We Up Late""."
Interviewer,"Back when you came out, there were no mixtapes for artists to get their buzz going. How do you feel about the over saturation of mixtapes in the game today?"
Eminem,"I don't really have an opinion on that 'cause everything is done online these days, so it's easier for everybody to get heard and have exposure."
Interviewer,It was great kicking it with and we are glad to see you never let your dream die. We heard some of your new music and it's pretty dope. Any last words you want to tell your fans and the Ballerstatus.com viewers.
Eminem,"We back to stay, thanks for the love and support. ""Struggle Enterprise""."
Interviewer,Recently I assume the vast majority of your time has been dedicated to Eminem's new project.
Eminem,Certainly a lot of it. That and I just had a baby three months ago. So it's been pretty rough.
Interviewer,"Congratulations, sounds hectic. What're the other projects on your docket right now?"
Eminem,We co-manage Blink 182 and they're about to go on a European run. We're also putting together the finishing touches on Travis Barker's new album. Then we manage a group called The Knux that's putting out their second album.
Interviewer,Any artists in mind?
Eminem,Yeah there's a group called Slaughterhouse we've talked a lot about. There are four guys in the group and each has his own contractual history but we're trying to get the deal done.
Interviewer,"How do you split your time between New York, Detroit, and L.A.?"
Eminem,"Me personally? I have homes in the New York area and the Detroit area. I spend about half my time in New York, a quarter in Detroit, and a quarter in L.A. or wherever travel needs to take me."
Interviewer,Eminem has been very forthright in the press about his years of addiction. What has that been like for you as both a friend and a business partner?
Eminem,"For the period where things were really bad, I'd lost both. I didn't have much of a business partner and my friend certainly wasn't acting like my friend. So it was a really tough time."
Interviewer,"Had everything basically ground to a halt business-wise, from his career as an artist to the radio station to the record label? How did that work in the really dark period?"
Eminem,"Again, it was a lot of balancing. I think the greatest thing we had going for us is how talented he is. We always believed in that talent and hoped that things would turn around. And that belief in him and that hope are what got us through it."
Interviewer,"Obviously Eminem has a hardcore fan base to rival anyone's, he's bound to sell records. But with Relapse, there was a lukewarm side to the reception as well. What was the atmosphere inside the team when it wasn't an immediate critical smash?"
Eminem,"Well, first of all, we were just happy to have him back as a person. So we wanted to make sure that, when he did decide that he wanted to record again, if that's what he wanted to do, because nobody knew at the time, it would have to be at his own pace and on his own terms. So we gave him space and let him focus on staying sober and doing what he wanted to do. And it turns out that what he wanted to do was be an artist, because that's what he cares about. So it's just a matter of being supportive."
Interviewer,"To us, the public, Forever felt like a line in the sand. Not only a return to form, but the achievement of a whole new form for him artistically. How did that play out from your perspective, from inside the team?"
Eminem,"I'd definitely say that was a turning point. That song coincidentally happened around the time he started recording more stuff for this Recovery album and that was the first thing people heard. So in that sense it represented a milestone. It was less deliberate, really, and more just timing."
Interviewer,How did he end up on the song?
Eminem,"The folks at Interscope approached us and said, We've got this track that Drake's on right now, it's really great, and we want to see if Em wants to get on it. I said, Well, send it over. And they said, It's a big deal for us, it's for this Lebron James soundtrack and Lebron's a big Eminem fan, and he's really excited about the idea of Em doing it. So I sent it over to Marshall and he really liked it. He had become a fan of Drake and he wanted to try it out."
Interviewer,"The Drake juggernaut has been fascinating. What do you think it is about Drake that's made everyone from Em, to Jay, to Kanye, obviously Lil Wayne is another story, want to get behind him?"
Eminem,"I think his aesthetic is rooted in the same thing that Wayne, Em, Kanye, and Jay's aesthetic is rooted in. Which is really about the art of rapping. He's primarily concerned with making sure he's great at that craft, and that's what gets guys like Em and Jay excited. It's not just that he's clever metaphorically and with punch lines, but that he's actually got the technical side of the craft. Those guys get off on that more than they let on. They really are into it."
Interviewer,How did Drake get Eminem to go to Toronto a couple weeks ago just to do one verse?
Eminem,"Em was in Detroit and Toronto's not very far. Drake asked him to do it, and Marshall had the weekend free."
Interviewer,So he just got on the plane?
Eminem,Yeah. He decided to go do it.
Interviewer,"As I already mentioned, Eminem has this extraordinary fan base. And then, as he was recording what became Recovery, you watched him turn an incredible creative corner. Given that set of circumstances, what was your approach to the marketing of that album? The sales are almost at two million, right?"
Eminem,"Yeah. It's almost at two million domestically. I knew this album had pretty big potential specifically because I thought it had some pretty big radio records. So our approach was to really focus on that area. And, for the most part, that's what's allowed the record to connect the way it has."
Interviewer,"So for guys like Em, it still comes down to radio?"
Eminem,"For anybody who wants to sell massive amounts of records, yes. I don't think that's a secret to anyone. Radio is still the biggest seller of music that there is."
Interviewer,What were the first inklings of these baseball stadium shows in Detroit and New York? Did it start as a conversation between you and  John Meneilly?
Eminem,"Yeah, Meneilly and I are friends, and we'd been talking about doing stuff with Jay and Em together for a long time. You know, beyond the small stuff we've done. And the fact that Em had an album coming, and Jay had just come off of the massive success he had with his last album, we figured the time was right to do something big. It's no secret that Em doesn't like touring, but he likes performing. So we wanted to do something that would have maximum impact and allow them to get in front of their fans. We came up with this idea"
Interviewer,"After you and John Meneilly build on this idea of Comerica and Yankee Stadium, where do you go from there? Who gets the next call?"
Eminem,"Well they have their partnership with Live Nation so they went to them and I went to Marshall's agent  Cara Lewis. They connected, put the plan together, and went to the stadiums. I also have a relationship with the family that owns the Tigers, so I also contacted them directly and got some inside scoop on when they'd be willing to do a show. We'd already performed at Comerica Park back in 2005."
Interviewer,"How would you characterize the relationship between Em and Jay, both creatively and as two guys in a room together?"
Eminem,"Well, you know, it's funny. They're such larger than life personalities, so you'd think it'd be this huge storm of ideas and conversation and whatever. But there's so much mutual respect and wanting to be, what's the word to describe it?, just wanting to be around each other in a comfortable way that they both just take it easy."
Interviewer,There's almost a quieting effect instead of there not being enough air in the room?
Eminem,Yeah. Neither wants to look like they're trying to overshadow the other or anything like that.
Interviewer,Did that carry over into the logistics of how the show would work?
Eminem,That was easy. It was always 50-50. There was never a question.
Interviewer,"Both with money, stage time..."
Eminem,Everything.
Interviewer,Can fans expect special guests?
Eminem,"I can't speak for what Jay's going to do because I honestly don't know. But we do know what Jay's done in the past and he loves to bring out his collaborators, especially in New York. So I'm anticipating a lot of that. And in terms of Marshall, we're certainly going to have a lot of surprises."
Interviewer,Does Eminem go into shows in spaces as crazy as baseball stadiums with full confidence that he can hold everyone from the front row to the nosebleeds?
Eminem,"Yeah. There was a time where he hadn't done shows for a while so he was nervous and unsure. Just as he had to learn to create music again sober, performing sober is a whole 'nother set of circumstances. But he's had plenty of practice now and we just did three massive festivals and I think he definitely connected with everyone there. So I don't think he's too worried about it."
