real people real celebrities real talk

join The Breakfast Club morning six to

ten morning everybody is DJ envy Angela

Yee Charlemagne to God we are The

Breakfast Club we got a special guest in

the building this morning and they said

it never would happen that's right I

repeat donkey today offended right

Kanye Kardashian isn't a villain egg

Kanye West is here good morning sir

what's up

first and foremost we got to talk about

your performance and your show that

you've been doing all over New York and

the Barclays at Madison Square Garden

did you enjoy it yeah I didn't go see

the show they offered me tickets

Saturday night for Sunday's show and I

got baby so I couldn't go see the show

but I heard the show was amazing I heard

you have mountains I heard you have snow

I heard it's one of them eight well

everybody's telling me that it's not

your typical hip-hop show did you get

your full money worth that I actually

went to the show last night explain a

little bit I'm gonna tell you certain

things that happen from me and the

audience first of all I think it made me

like the new album a whole lot more than

just listening to it it's a whole

different experience and there was a

little fight in my row at the show oh

wow yeah there was a scuffle because

there was some white guys in the row and

they were getting upset during the part

of the show where you talk and I guess

they didn't like the you know and one of

them actually used the n-word and they

would and then the people in front of

them got upset and everybody started

kind of scuffling and they were like if

you have a problem just leave just get

out of here if you have a problem with

it so is that something that typically

happens do some people get offended oh

yeah I aren't even I've never heard of

that happen in my show before but uh

that's interesting mm-hmm now question

Wow

you know when you did the shoulder of

course the show seems like it costs a

lot of money and I know most most

hip-hop shows is it's usually you know

not that expensive a lot of rappers and

not too much of the I say the hoop line

you had a lot of hoopla I'm hearing so

so why did you want to take so much

pride into the show how long is a

creative or more like a Walt Disney or

something my rap is just a chamber of my

of my thoughts it's something that I

really wanted to express as a modern day

you know poet because you know if I

lived in the past lifestyle maybe I

would have

to play right or something but in this

lifetime to be the most turnt in the

most relevant the most relevant is to be

a rap rock star right you know I'm

saying you can express you know the

highest level and for me I like I came

from art school and everything I would

you know draw out all these ideas and

all these concepts and the the more and

more I get to create the younger and

younger and younger I feel so you know

when I did glow-in-the-dark I felt young

felt like I was 5 years old when I you

know got into a little trouble and stuff

I felt like I had to grow up I did dark

fantasies and I felt like I was 10 then

I like did you know blueprint 3 and was

thrown and cruel summer and then I got

to you know Jesus I just felt frustrated

usually I would start out with like

blood on the leaves I know everybody

would even like the album or if I did

that but I felt so frustrated in the way

I've been marginalized and held back why

do you feel so frustrated say that a lot

like why I remember you from being

outside the studio trying to get people

hear you rap it was a great producer but

nobody believed you as a rapper but and

then it seems like you got to a point

where everybody's loving the way that

you rap now you just seem like you're

more frustrated you like do you not like

the reception Jesus God cuz I that's

what I don't I didn't like the hub at

all and I was a Kanye West fan yeah

Jesus was white to me yeah that's great

that's great so were you saying I was I

was asking about the whole yeezus like

what makes you so frustrated yeah it's

not about yeezus it's about you know

Michael Jackson was told he couldn't

play videos on MTV because he was

considered to be an urban artist right

so some of I started talking about

clothing everybody's been talked about

urban clothing line what I'm trying to

say is like it's 1460 something

billionaires in the world I don't know

exactly because somebody might have

thought of a new tech idea and a

company's value at what to 1470

billionaires there's only seven black

ones and we know some of the most famous

ones of like Oprah whatever so you know

in order to really impact and be in a

position of power at this point you got

to be a billionaire ain't about being

like you know a superstar I don't know

nobody that like sells a lot of like

records and gets a lot of radio spins

that's actually a billionaire either we

get into so so much of like you know

arguing with each other that we're not

looking at the main thing but what I did

with use is I took the

you know the power into my own hand I

wanted to remove you know the hits from

it I want to remove the course is of

course blood on the leaves and bound

it's got of course you know I like

resolved the album and let everybody

know it's all good at the end of it but

it's not all good you know like I said

I'm from Chicago people is dying every

day and everybody think we're gonna do a

benefit concert and help that out but I

need to be put in a position to be able

to apply my thoughts the same thoughts

you know before I came in again rappers

is killing each other

you ain't heard about that number the

first time rappers rapped on a song with

each other

that was a god level all of them with

swagger like us after that all the songs

is like swagger like us the thing is we

not each other's enemies I'm showing us

how we can work together you know but in

fashion or whatever or you know product

design they try to marginalize us and

say we can only have a urban clothing

line or we can only do this and of

course we're gonna have a urban clothing

line we're gonna wear the definite and

it's gone now meanwhile Ralph Lauren

could build his story up you know I'm

saying show his family but you know I'm

showing my family and I think actually I

have a love-hate relationship with the

paparazzi but actually I love him

because they empowering us they

empowering us over you know Graydon

Carter or Vanity Fair that want to say

you know Kate Upton is Marilyn Monroe

Kate Upton ain't Marilyn rope can't

Marilyn Monroe you know that she was

controversial she controversial this is

reality I'm living inside of a dream

world to me don't nothing matter to me

except for the people and the way I can

affect them almost lost my life I lost

my mama I went from like you know jay-z

being my idol sylla's my idol to him

being across the stage on me saw I know

that anything is possible and I know

when they hold me down my BS meter is at

all-time high but would you accomplish

so much what what yeah what like what

what they want to help talk man no none

of it they want this man to

Doulton blows man they waiting for

Charlemagne to tap these gloves go at

your blows this way let's go like to me

it seems like you're such a walking

contradiction because you'll denounce

the corporations but then you'll get on

stage and say you need Nike and Adidas

to back you that makes no sense to me

100% but how can you denounce the

corporation say after corporations that

you feel like a slave but then ask the

companies to back and ain't that I feel

like a slave we are mentally enslaved

we

slave to brands we enslaved to like a

bin symbol we enslaved chains a woman is

enslaved to the concept but diamonds are

girl's best friend like girls in London

don't even wear engagement ring that's

all been programmed at us when we born

we bought we born artists we born free

and then we held down by society's

perception of us we just don't want to

be embarrassed and I took the

opportunity to look as stupid as

possible I'm saying when I was in

Chicago and watch the throne I was going

to change my outfit to some normal

leather pants and stuff and they

tailored it one was too tight then the

next one ripped on me and I felt like

God was like nah man

you can't be scared in Chicago because

it's a bunch of gangsters and that's

where you grew up I want you to wear

that kilt in Chicago I want you to

release that fear I want you to show as

an artist that you could create to the

highest level you know I'm saying so I

got to do with juveniles and

corporations with utilizing corporations

to be in business with you that's what

the contradiction I'm gonna confuse I'm

not denouncing the corporation I'm

denouncing people to have the job at the

corporation at that time because you

know when I wanted to get my deal it was

an arse that don't work that no more

telling me how I needed to work with

another rapper or how I wasn't a rapper

by now it's people that's at the

corporation's they got the ability in

the facilities that if I put my genius

to it that I can affect culture and a

higher way the way I effect it people

when I made them Louise and I affected

people when I made them easy so I ain't

going at Nike as a corporation I'm going

at the people that's running the

corporation and I'm saying I'm gonna hit

you in the chest until you listen to me

because you feel like you ain't got to

take no meeting with me so I'm gonna

turn up and I'm gonna let you I'm gonna

show you what we are we were awards e

we're gonna run over that mountain until

you listen to me because I'm influential

the reason why I'm influenced the same

reason why you want me to come to your

show or you want me to wear your product

is the same reason why you got involved

me and you got to cut me in you know I'm

saying people got fat without me you

cutting me in because we have a

negotiating lines no she went

Nike they said okay cool hey you've been

screaming up and down we gonna give you

a deal for Yeezy finally because it was

marginalizing me let me only design two

shoes of a five year period people talk

about the red October that's the design

for three years ago you got any ideas I

got you know say so they try to

marginalize me and then they say look

we're gonna give you four million

dollars a year

to design this I said what about

royalties they said look you know you

not a professional athlete so you don't

get no royalties I said look Michael I

go to any of these readings and play one

on nobody I'm a performance athlete more

than being an athlete I'm I'm wrong I'm

like Howard Hughes I'm like David Stern

I'm like Steve Jobs if anything that's a

compliment to them I'm like Michelangelo

cuz I'm the new version of that and

anybody that backs me he's gonna be the

Medici family that back Michelangelo

at this point you know I'm saying so

when they told me I couldn't get no

royalties like wasted you want me to

work for Nike for two more years I can't

when I tell my daughter in two years now

I've been working trying to make Nike

still hot and I still ain't don't have

you know the backing to really support

and protect her because she in a

position of a level of royalty like like

the princess and the princess out in

London but they got more paper they got

heritage me and can we on our grind we

had to do what we had to do to get to

this point to be able to support our

family but we ain't there yet we ain't

financially there to the point to make

sure that North is safe at all times and

that's the reason I'm turning it up

right now let me ask you question you

mentioned something about you know when

you came out doing the record and you

said nobody believed in the a nossa

fight Dame was one of those people I

believe yeah and we haven't seen you

ever seen you never but the first thing

people said was when Damon J split why

did you decide to go with J and not dame

since he was the one that had your back

with nobody listened and nobody was that

was really big brother yeah you know

what it was it's because you know last

night I think my what people call a rant

but I call it a visionary

stream-of-consciousness

it was better like right now the more

this morning is better because my voice

is hoarse the problem is when I get too

loud it's just too loud you know I'm

saying it but you know people you know

coming to studio play their music they

play it so loud for you they make you

think you like a beat you don't even

know if you like it now you just like

blew somebody ears out and stuff so when

I'm talking a lot of times it's like I'm

blowing people's ears out my technique

is too harsh I'm beating it up too harsh

and the problem was you know with Dame

pitch truth was more accurate and more

closer to what mine was but his

technique was hard for me as a young kid

and stuff I felt like a little bit more

pressure Damon says he was that and

jay-z's was a nice guy and also I felt

like I had that truth that Dame has in

him we the same like me and kami and Dan

we the same but I wanted to learn this

technique that Jay got of being actually

being likable like when I was doing

watching throwing one a main reason I

did it was to learn you know Jay's

techniques of how you talk to people may

not be talking to people the wrong way

sometime me too I'll be rubbing on the

wrong way yeah yeah you guys really like

the singer then yes so Jay Z know how to

move in a room full of vultures you know

I'm saying and I as his little brother I

needed to learn that technique because I

got something that God want me to give

the world you know I'm only doing five

one percent one small iota of the work

or else he would have killed me in that

car accident that's how when they came

back from Taylor Swift or else I

would've ended up when somebody wanted

me for my money versus somebody who

actually bought me something for my

birthday you know nothing you also said

you don't listen to nobody and these

corporations that's older than you

yeah that made no sense to me because we

all got a birthday so one day you're

gonna get older what if somebody had

that same train of thought to you

I'm saying they gotta listen to me they

gotta choose if they won't listen to me

but one thing an example somebody gave

me they said I'm wiser to you on this on

that outside you ain't cut no check

though if you older and you wise it and

you should have enough money in a

position of power to cut me a check

before I get anything to do it with come

on well I'm saying when I gave Big Sean

any advice I gave him a deal first now

the thing is if Big Sean come up a trap

for me and I give him some advice but

I'll give him a deal at that point I'm

Sonny I'm like take that advice and go

run with no we ain't Jewish we don't got

family that got money like that the

rapper's became a new family damn

created a family at Rockefeller and self

a family footage young boy from the hood

to do a clothing line to do that do that

this whole time he was fighting for Jay

he was up at the label fighting for Jay

and he the one that ended up getting out

stayed out of it right now I'm in a

fashion world fighting for Kim if we

broke up I would be the one that's

looked like as a I would be the

Dame with a situation and she would be

the J the situation right there so it's

a man that's my point to that kind of

with all your artists with Big Sean and

we push your team with all your artists

I mean it's things that I do sometimes

the Charlemagne you don't like are they

that open with you if they say you know

what I didn't like this type of rare

when Big Sean was up here and he said he

didn't he said it wasn't his favorite

out this was at least forgotten you drop

them from good for a little minute now I

never drop them from good mama taste

some what everybody make good music on

good music Drake on good music rocks on

good music if you make good music you

won't good music this ain't about no

wrestling team this ain't no bout a

basketball team just ain't me putting on

a jersey for David Stern and going my

best and having a mandingo fight in

front of the corporation's this ain't

about that this is about us coming

together because we have strength as a

people but it's not just about black

people is about all people you know I'm

saying I just want to give people advice

I inspire Big Sean as much as I spy

Drake you know anything about the the

particular stipulations on my contract

to Universal I don't believe that I

don't believe in you know I don't

believe in none of this Nike present

themselves is such a big corporation

right that you in your mind you think

Nike is big as Apple almost to the hood

Nikes bigs out because it Jordan

cuz and because of me and I see because

we started wearing the retro Jordans

when the soles is falling apart you know

so uh Nikes only twenty six billion

dollar company apples the six hundred

billion dollar company they not the same

level and part of the reason is because

they too busy trying to compete trying

to do the smaller ideas it's only one

Steve Jobs you know I'm saying now it's

only one Kanye West and I'm just like

Steve why do you talk so much about

money nowadays man I used to look at you

as like a real revolutionary you're real

revolutionaries didn't need money to

change the world Malcolm X wasn't rich

Martin Luther King jr. wasn't rich like

I understand why everything is so much

about money and stuff too you know

because you need product you need to own

something to have a voice at this point

cuz I'm telling you I got oh you don't

need to own some have a voice you had a

voice when you got on stage and you then

said George Bush don't care about black

people use using your voice you need my

voice I've used my voice but what

happened if y'all don't buy no of the

album's that voice people gonna say oh

he like Arsenio Hall and he was turning

up too much and now you fired but when

you got money okay nobody fight you know

make me buy your albums the great music

you produce you know makes me not buy

your hours just knew not cystic

egotistical personality you got that's

what turns me off makes me I'm not going

to show I want him right on by his

records exactly but I'm thinking that

your last name is the guy right

absolutely so anybody that's a guy can

recognize the God Jesus correct I mean

Jesus can recognize Jesus I mean you

know young y'all know what it is to

still I've got to keep all the gods on

point to keep me on point brother see

them not only square yo it seem like you

on your square right number I'm 100% on

my script but I ain't saying I couldn't

use no tighten up on that saying I'm

infallible that I'm flawless

I'm saying I got a cause and I'm saying

that people have been look if you were

creative and you design the easy ones

and the easy twos and they said you

can't design nothing else that would be

like if I made Jesus walks in a chair I

couldn't make late registration that

would be like if Drake made his first

single and they say he could make

another single that's how they was

playing it and then the point where the

Yeezys get such an impact and they say

but you can't even have royalties and

we're gonna like but you can't know you

got enough money to do it on your own

like Don seeing his hats done see he

makes his own hats on the side it's not

distributed amongst alone is smaller you

can do the same thing I lift the lever

pan put the stuff that you created

install it people say you could do in

your own but it's industries these

industries have been set up like the

coal industry like the like the music

industry like the newspaper industry

clothing manufacturing electricity it's

something different to the way these

billionaires run the world and we not a

part of that we've only been let in on a

communication level it's a new form of

cotton that we all pick in we are you

communicating radio every day I'm

commuting music every day but when I'm

trying to tell y'all is ain't none of us

free ain't none of us billionaires a

billion that they don't care they do it

everybody never be free a stuck waiting

freedom the money my brother was where

does that mentality come from it come ah

why are you equate and freedom to money

money is not what makes us free as

people man yeah y'all would like to they

would like us to think that we are free

but we completely control we control by

Nike sign we control by peer pressure

we control by the law

for a particular car to set at a high

price water Benz is called so much Zara

H&M came and beat Louis Vuitton ass in a

matter of short time what they do the

reason why we want that so much is

because they take the creatives from st.

Martin's mostly where Riccardo Tisci

Phoebe Philo Alexander McQueen came from

and all those guys have go and work at

Louis Vuitton like Marc Jacobs they work

at Givenchy they work at these different

places and they make that stuff that's

so good that that's what we want the

most so basically the most talented

people are making visuals and making

apparel or putting a luxury box by a

small group of billionaires and made us

wish to desire LV and fight amongst

ourselves and like walk around with a

bag and stuff and what I'm saying is I

learned at this point for being in Paris

well I said I wanted to Mandella the

buildings I wanted to go and Louis

Vuitton store like start ripping stuff

down but what I did is I kept to say I

just made new slaves and I put it on the

side of the buildings and I went from

not only the mental slavery that I've

experienced with clothing because I like

a Balenciaga sneaker because it's

designed better and then it's kids out

there buying a thousand-dollar sneaker

spending a month word for pay because I

wore because it make them feel like

that's what they need to have in the

club and then I went on to talk about

the CCA and hip hop crimes and like you

know drug crimes that are related to

black people having you know more time

related to them so they cannot do legal

modern-day slavery so I took it from

actually mental slavery to actual

slavery that they want to enslave us

that they borderline its companies its

companies that have the same company

that allowed it to be a song that

promotes guns that promotes gunsmoke's

guns would be connected with the exact

same corporation that promotes privately

owned prisons it's actually the same

company it's actually slavery today but

you know know that you do know that

slavery slaves in the 1800 didn't have a

choice you don't have to be in this

industry boy this is my choice but but

see but you got a shot with your own

chains and go work at Walmart nobody

hands we knock on each other how happy

you are when you whit your door then you

with your fiancée that's your freedom

right there you don't need none of that

money you don't need to let me Louis

Vuitton in there that's a freshen you

kids you don't need fashion important

that I said last night

I turnt up I'm turning about and I'm

growing I'm learning cuz I'm still in

shock

I'm still mentally Shay I'm gonna grow

from this interview I've been waiting so

excited I've been waiting for this

interview I don't want you to tell me

everything that I'm doing wrong and

front everybody said I can improve that

all right but let's talk about the

bathroom video let's talk about the

bound to video there that was a terrible

video and you know that yet

you're not gonna see any tell me you

look at the bow to video you had

explained that video to us a little bit

now you talk about that video hey go to

BS industry stuff to label reps like no

wrap it up he said ten minutes but let's

talk about the video book like you don't

talk about bound to video before we

discuss it what was your mind frame of

bound to and what did you want the

people to get out of it what was the

treatment for that video I wanted to

take white trash t-shirts and make it

into a video so you wanted it to look

bad yes I wanted to look as phony as

possible I want the clouds to go one

direction the mountains to go on the

Russian don't want the horses to go over

there because I want to show you that

this is the Hunger Games I want to show

you that this is the type of imagery

that's been presented to all of us and

the only difference is a black dude in

the middle of it you know I'm saying

like you know just edition removes

yourself in that circuit to put Jay

Pharoah in there and have the other

chick that plays Kim on SNL so it looks

like it was a comedy sketch that would

have been dope yeah that could be cool

but I'm like Marina Abramovic this is

like performance art the thing is I

ain't got a problem with looking stupid

I ain't got a prize I know you're really

a G I know your honor what still exists

within you yeah I don't I don't have a

problem with making mistakes in front of

people and the thing is you create stuff

you want the borderlines

you could like it and people could

respond to it people cannot respond to

people can respond to later people will

hate it 8:08 to heartbreak I didn't look

at that's the sound now but you know

it's people that hate it 808 that's the

sound out on site ain't the best version

of itself but it was on a timeline you

know I'm saying all the lights to two

years on site took four months if on

site took two years and I listened to it

more you'd have more when I'm a great

postmodern creative as a futurist I

don't always have the facilities to

create the way I want like when Nike

drops the flatness that's the Futurist

concept that they have the time

to create and put out all the lights is

a futurist song that it started as a

Jeezy record with horns on it then we

put it another bridge and then dream

wrote the hook and then Rihanna sang it

and by the time y'all got it it was to

the level of like the Nike flying into

something like that on-site is literally

and Jesus is literally a listening

session for the world y'all got y'all

got the joints y'all in the car cuz I

feel at this point everybody in the car

with me like if I pulled you down say

your listeners tell me what you think

about it I was just drop it now you're

telling me it was crap don't do the way

you have for don't wreck is bound to

blood on the leaves new slave Laskin is

rest of it I was like what that hey

black scared oh people have my black

skin is I'm like telling me I would save

you went to go see the show you would

feel different about the album is

already heard the audio Sonic and Sonic

Lee it wasn't pleasing to my ears

now let's talk about paparazzi a little

bit now you've been going through with

paparazzi but listen you know you called

all those paparazzi problems you're

soakin nobody can make you angry without

your consent

yeah I'm learning I'm learning how to

balance I mean this this is this is

space that I'm in like this level of

Fame and just being like you know um

just a black man in America in an

interracial relationship with a lot of

creative dreams compressed by the idea

of what celebrities are supposed to do

at all times and getting in trouble all

the time on the media just for being

true you know I'm saying this is this is

like out of space this is like my first

time in space think about this for the

most part when people don't like me it's

because I said the truth so if I can get

in so much trouble for telling the truth

what are you being tale told all the

rest of the time it was an example of

the truth you told Ellen got you in

trouble

George Bush Beyonce had the best video

you ain't even seen the video you want

to talk about how about to man

we in this together we are a group if

Beyonce make adult video we're all a

part of that if Drake make a dope song

we're all a part of that it ain't amount

of me having the best thing at this time

it's a matter of us having the best

things have y'all have a dope interview

I'm a part of that I came to this

radio station for you to attack me

that's what people want no we're gonna

tackle conversation I'll do you got no

more real than you're on your team yeah

and I hear it could I hear the little

people I say to them why did y'all about

to come on new like but we can't tell

you is why you don't need that guy who

do you talk to Kanye if you want to get

an honest opinion on something or you

need some feedback or you need somebody

to check you who do you talk to

um talk to God God tells you to denounce

the first black president in his family

I didn't denounce them what did I

started out announcer when I say it back

when you say things like um that that

you and Kim are on that level not say we

more relevant don't I care about what

Obama where it's not true

every time Michelle where something is

on this on it's in vogue or something

yeah do you care about vogue do you read

that is a different on campuses you get

a regresar I got on cuz I know you you

like me I swear sir I never demographic

yeah no but you did say something like

you would shoot the president of fader

if it seemed like it like you dog from

Chicago - I guess you said something to

the fact that if he mentions my fiance

again I might have to I'm from Chicago

too I might catch him a five

I didn't say see y'all putting work I'm

asking ya say that well that's what I'm

asking what what I'm saying is all I

care about is God and my family I don't

care about what position nobody got and

you either helping me or you hurting me

like dr. King said when we was dealing

with outward race because it still

racism in a corporation there's still

your classism segregation discrimination

people still be a helpful patient's man

like dr. King said he said look just

because you're not committing the race's

act if you see erases act and you turn

your head that's still racist so you

take me as a creative at the end of the

day when I'm a glow-in-the-dark and when

I made graduation that's the point when

I start should I how to deal with Disney

that's the point when I made the first

Yeezys I should have been able to make

the next ones just like that that's the

point

when I should have been given the

opportunity to create more but they want

to box me into a music box music is

fleeting

ain't no 50 year old rock star that you

care about this is a young man support I

got ideas is why

all the way Rockstar still prospering

something like that could still prosper

and I can still make money on stage but

what I want to give y'all is that

feeling of when I was in fourth grade

drawing Jordans that I apply to the

Yeezys that you can't deny that people

lined up for that that you can't deny if

I had a pair of Reggie's for y'all now

y'all with know one thing you do realize

that's not why we love you we love you

because of the music bro you gave us

that feeling with albums like college

dropout graduation late registration we

don't care about your designing sneakers

and clothes and all that means nothing

to us again oh Jesus do mean something

more than you in every state sedated

easy that's what people want to know you

know what Nike told me you know like you

told me when I asked them what's that

we're not sure does they told me I

thought you controller I guess that's my

whole point

all right I get it I got my boy Johnny

they be sunning me they be acting like I

ain't me at the end of day everything

you see over the past ten years and

music that's a piece of me that's I have

influenced all of that that's a piece of

meat and right now my focus like that

I ain't it I ain't not live like like

Drake every week and when I hear a

language I'm like man I love that you

know if you wrote that for me I would

have said it but do I feel that way now

I feel like what I'm saying I'm bound to

I feel like what I'm saying on new

slaves and that may or may not connect

with people on the same level as worse

behavior it's Drake season now it's

happening you seen Jay have a season you

seen Kanye had a season and NAS Drake

season that's the reality but I got a

season in this product

I'm the Tupac a product you gonna see

I'm better than Ralph Lauren you gonna

see I'm gonna be bigger than hmm bigger

than Louis Vuitton that is mine in ten

years and creativity

they say change your job every ten years

you want me to still be the O in the

club talking about oh girl come to my

room is like that really what I yeah

that's what I'm saying when you and I

know knock to r.kelly I'm not even gonna

like verbalize that cuz I know my voice

travels mountains and stuff like that

you're a genius why do you feel the need

to tell everybody why why you just don't

show improved by actions and deeds and

not words and looser because when I

asked Nike when the Yeezys come out they

say we ain't sure yet that's the reason

I'm doing crowdsourcing a public-opinion

to turn up and let y'all understand what

I'm going through how much I came here

to Charlemagne to God to talk directly

to the peoples y'all understand what I'm

dealing with you don't get some clarity

about your rich the problems those are

problems the fact that the fashion

designers won't accept you

Nike won't accept we don't care we just

want you to make great music that's what

yeah he does for the people he gives

those great music that helps us get

through our lives you know and I respect

ya they don't really think I can't

afford but he's gonna make with him

anyway 100 percent I want to make

affordable and I will make a photo but

II got a t-shirt yay I name price the

t-shirt that's what I'm trying to say I

was just trying to design I did not

price a t-shirt I didn't have pricey Z's

I didn't have price to Louie Vuitton but

on my next ventures I will be pricing

them and y'all could say this is what we

want you want we want you to make you

know music to you Ron eyes the age you

can't marginalize me you can't tell me

what creativity I'm supposed to do on

this earth I could tell you right now I

don't want to do no more songs and

that's my prerogative you know say

that's my idea that's what I want to do

you can't control me so you know all

corporations radio stations y'all can't

control me y'all don't understand that

I'm turn all the way I believe in me

just believe in you let me do me you

like it

cool you don't fast forward so fashion

what you say is what you're passionate

about right now and that's what you

really want to make sure it's not even

fashion it's clothing

Eve may Adam either Apple and then it

became illegal to be naked I want to

help you out with y'all opinion of the

law uh what you Eve wait a second Eve

may Adam eat the apple and ever since

then it's been illegal to be naked it's

in the Bible I'm a Christian so you want

a zombie nugget I don't you want to

build me clothes

shut up man yeah but what I'm saying is

I do still love music and you know when

I produce people told me stop don't

start rapping because that would like

mess up your production Oh

telling you once I start producing y'all

gonna get dope albums I would start the

I'll my blood on the leaves if I had the

situation I wanted to but I wanted to

show you the brash I wanted y'all to

feel my pain on site the way a sound

ain't no different than when I did

through the wire and I put that accident

on my face these the way that face the

way that photo look that's what they be

hitting with me Bernard Arnault head of

Louie Vuitton say he didn't understand

why you need to take a meeting with me

okay you don't understand why you need

to take a meeting with Kanye West I'm

gonna show you why you need to take a

meeting with Kanye West everybody in

Atlanta right now at the Louis Vuitton

store if you black don't go to Louis

Vuitton today that's why you need to

take a meeting with Kanye West Bernard

Arnault

when Francois Pino offered me a deal

last year and he took it away then he

signed Alexander went to Balenciaga then

he sported Christopher cane and I think

he did something else like that

I love Alexander Wang I love Christopher

cane but that's only happening one other

time in history

and that's when Jordan was a third-round

pick their draft pick it's only happened

one time my influence I don't see people

lining up in the stores anything I

dropped people lining up and it ain't

one black designer that make a suit

jacket it a one black designer that

makes you the self adjacent man from

brand Joe and he's just left it it ain't

it ain't we don't got it like that when

I tell you only seven black billionaires

look at that marginalization and we feel

like we're happy because me and Rick

Ross got a Maybach I got a sprin outside

are a couple of us or they put a black

president man let me tell you something

about George Bush and oil money and

Obama and no money people want to say

Obama can't make these moves or he's not

executed that's cuz he ain't got those

connections black people don't have the

same level of connections as Jewish

people black people don't have the same

connection as oil people you know we

don't know nobody that got a nice house

you know we don't know nobody with paper

like that we could go to when we down

you know that could just put us back and

put us in a corporation you know we

ain't in a situation can you guarantee

that your daughter could get a job at

this radio station but if you own this

radio station you could guarantee that

that's what I'm talking about

start on the ground level because you

came from nothing and now you became

kanye west so why I start at the top and

start with them start with the

groundskeepers not the gatekeeper I'm

going every level you see me drop that

yeezus pop up tour I mean that pop up to

our store yeah and we we show three

hundred and fifty thousand dollars of

merchandise in two days we got liners

I'm starting at the ground I'm using my

voice I'm in the middle I'm working with

photographers I'm breaking down the

barriers of just the way people perceive

fashion you know I'm saying if you think

about an ad you think about an urbanite

it looked a certain way you think about

a Gucci a it look a certain way it's

difficult to get the photographer that

does that to not work with Gaga and work

with you it took me three years to work

with Nick Knight y'all might not like

that bound video but you like the poster

for yeezus you might not like blacks in

that video but you like the new slaves

campaign everything we do is the

creative is not going to hit and not

gonna connect so like a federal flag too

because people are upset about that I'm

from Columbia cycle-on with a

confederate flag still flies over the

Statehouse lawn I've seen people protest

to take that flag down for years it's

just like the word you can't make that

into a positive a as an artist and in

this world we could do whatever we want

ain't nothing real this station start

losing viewers listeners their turn is

to like our office for like paper so

like that yeah afternoon here I'm saying

ain't nothing real it's all iconography

that we put a mindset on it people gonna

write in the history books about what

I'm doing right now you're gonna look

back at 20 years and look at the George

Bush moment and look at the beyoncé

moment look at a confederate flag moment

and look when I turned up and made a

bigger corporation than H&M and LVMH and

y'all gonna remember that and we gonna

be listening to Drake I've never seen oh

yeah I've never seen no revolution

I do it on a business name the

revolutionary that I like a

revolutionary that connected with the

people we wasn't about corporations man

and I care mr. Smith as a guy that's

been a fan of yours for years and I just

think that you're too materialistic and

too worried about those corporations

nowadays man now it ain't it ain't

materialism at all and I'm glad that you

keep on because I think it's important

for me to simplify repeat so it's

important for you to keep asking this

question because if somebody's sitting

down getting a haircut right now

confused it's somebody I may have to

worry for about a year right now is

somebody that don't understand that's

the reason why I was important for me to

come and for you to ask these questions

so people can really understand and

really get it because it's such a

futuristic way of thinking you know if

you look at an interview for me from ten

years ago everybody says I loved that

interview people didn't love it back

then though because I was speaking to

the future I'm ten years ahead

mentally and I'm trapped in today's time

and every now and then I crack your

smile for 2013 but I'm cracking you a

frown for 2023 and I'm focused on what

it's going to be just mark my words as

I'm Kanye West you seen my execution did

I not become the biggest rock star on

the planet

did I not influence all musicians that I

not go and get the exact girl that I

wanted that I not start my family that I

not ruffle the feathers of two

presidents did I not get a chance to

operate work with my idol that I not

make Louis Vuitton's to people not line

up at the Yeezy store that I not make

the college dropout late registration

graduation 8:08 blueprint one blueprint

three watch the throne cruel summer and

yeezus if you like it or not all right

what are you gonna be in - I just want

to know this what is the end result for

Kanye was what are you looking to be

okay in the movie it would be a

combination of Steve Jobs Walt Disney

Michelangelo that's it that's it I can

ask you one quick question you had an

HBO special that everybody was excited

for what ended up happening with that

cuz I know they said the pilot got

leaked and it seemed like it was gonna

be a great idea he always called little

inappropriate is kind of like uh

in version it's like herb you enthusiasm

you know I'm not no actor you don't say

I can't act this out uh I'm not

professional actor film television star

whatever I'm I'm a professional dreamer

you know just like a dream to me

it was a dream for me to come here to

have this opportunity to talk to y'all

it was a dream to meet to be on the

radio I'm still jump dreaming as much as

when I first heard through the wire

played on the radio I'm dreaming like

that you know and I either way people

turn onto blood leaves I hear y'all I'm

gonna make some adjustments you know

saying I also got my deal though you

know I also got my deal I also got my

girl I also got my family so things are

set before you really get everything you

want sometimes you gotta just you know

shake that cage because they ain't just

gonna give it to you as you see then go

and did you get you gonna say when when

the red Octobers come out they go talk

about some we ain't sure yeah all right

you know I thought I was gonna leave

here with some type of understand and

I'm walking from this Kanye there's a

lot of obstacles in his way that he

feels like he has to it seems like you

have something to prove

yeah definitely and I think it's cool

for you to be confused if anybody's

confused cuz you should keep questioning

until it's proven it would be I don't

watch it Jim sitting here today okay I

don't want to do that you know what I

don't care I love it it brings relevance

I might not have the song today but I

got the donkey day whatever I'm saying

they don't matter to me hate and love

are very similar emotion the opposite of

love is you don't care let it bother you

when people feel body when I call you

Kayne Kardashian man man I'm gonna tell

you something at night time when I go to

bed with my girl I would change my last

name okay ladies and gentlemen that's

things I'm gonna do that's not gonna

next one because of what we did right

now has to be born in USA I couldn't

even just give y'all just the normal

hits I had to go so ank's and so anti

cuz people trying to classify me as like

a new David Beckham of something I had

to show y'all my artistic credibility is

at the highest level a level of goo

Goo's Ian you know Jeff Koons

who uh Claudio Silvestri and I went to

whoever is the highest level of

communication or respect Graydon Carter

that's the level Kanye West is at y'all

got it because the thing is when I was

giving y'all which I wanted we click I

was getting commercialized a little bit

too click is a hit but sound a little

bit commercial tried to pull it all the

way back hit in the chest right quick

and then then I'm just like I release

we're bound towards the end or I gave

y'all blood only so then I had to put

that pressure on y'all so y'all will

understand which I'll dealing with

long as I'm wrapping because of what I'm
