hello there and welcome to this

SportsCenter special one-on-one with

Conor McGregor I'm Ariel Helwani as you

probably know Conor McGregor is one of

the most famous athletes in the world

today he is without a doubt the most

famous mixed martial artists in the

history of the sport he has not done an

interview with a media outlet since

October of last year of course that was

the last time we saw him inside the cage

when he fought khabib nurmagomedov at

UFC 229 this past year has been an

interesting one for Conor McGregor

making headlines for things outside of

the cage and tonight he will break his

silence for the first time in

approximately 10 months on everything

that has been going on in his life and

his fighting future and so without

further ado let us say hello now to the

notorious Conor McGregor who was kind

enough to join us from Dublin Ireland

Conor thank you so much for doing this

how are you I'm good I'll tell you thank

you so much for there for having me on

it's an honor it's been a long time so

it's good to chat to you again

absolutely and we really appreciate the

time we know a lot is going on your life

these days so let's get right into it

let's get to the the news first if you

will just last week

TMZ posted a video of an incident that

occurred back in April of this past year

where you appear to get into an

altercation with another man at a bar in

Ireland could you tell us your side of

that story what happened there and I

mean in reality it doesn't matter what

happened there I was in the wrong that

man that man deserve to enjoy his time

in the pool without having having it to

end the way it did and although five

months ago it was and I tried to make

amends and I made amends back then it's

still the fans don't even that does not

even matter I was in the wrong and I

must come here before you and take

accountability and take responsibility

and I owe it to the people that have

been supporting me I don't I owe it to

my mother my father my family and I owe

it

I owe it to the people who trained me in

martial arts that's not that's not who I

am that's not the reason that's not the

reason why I got into martial arts or

study in combat sport the reason I got

into it was to defend against that type

of scenario so to see that

and although although months ago when I

have been making steps and continually

making steps to do better and be better

to see it and it's like a dagger into

into my heart that as a young martial

artists oh I'm just I'm just here to

unload up to that and move on and and

carry on it and and and face what's

coming with it the video is a little

grainy did you in fact punch that man

yeah look in respect to the whole entire

situation I'm just let it play out with

what happens in in in what happens with

it so okay what happened was a little

hazy for me also on and there was many

months ago like I said and I have been

making amends to him to make it not

happen again and to be better to be a

better father to be a better human to be

a better role model to these kids I know

a lot of kids are looking up to me and

sometimes it'll be sometimes are gonna

take me back but I have to realize that

I that that's not that's not that's not

the attitude or the behavior of a leader

of a martial artist of a champion so I

must get my head screwed on and just get

back in the game and fight for

redemption retribution respect the

things that made me the man I am and

that's what I will do could I ask what

sparked that incident I mean we see the

video we don't hear anything

could you tell us your side of the story

from what you recall again what could I

say well what it does not matter what it

I there's no answer to what what what

what was done I was completely in the

wrong so there's no there's no need to

even discuss what what began it what was

going on outside inside any of that oh

it was completely in the wrong it was

unacceptable behavior and I accept that

and and like I said I've made a man's

and I'm continuing to make amends and I

will continue to do so and so right now

with that situation as you mentioned

this happened back in April but the

video gets released last week where do

things stand with it right now I mean

I'm just look he got released a day

after my daughter's christening so we

had such a great time with the phantom

of my family and then you know it's just

I just have to wait and see what happens

and whatever comes my way I will face it

whatever comes on my way

I deserve it you know so I would face

this head-on I will not hide from it I

was in the wrong it was completely

unacceptable behavior for a man in my

position what happens I will face Conor

since this video came out as you

probably know you have been criticized

heavily from the fans to UFC president

Dana White fellow fighters what is it

like for you to read this to hear this

stuff because it does seem like some of

these people who are so loyal to you for

so many years are starting to turn on

you a little bit that they're starting

to lose patience after seeing all these

incidents what is that like for you to

read that stuff in here that stuff well

as far as like my fellow colleagues I

deserve to be called out on it I deserve

to be called out on that behavior it's

just unacceptable there's no there's no

excuse to it I deserve everything that

comes my way with it so and as far as

like the fines and seeing the fans

disappointed in me that hurts me so much

because I am a fine everything I've done

is for the fines on a fine favorite

fight or my whole entire career has been

based for the fans like never planned

I'll never never never turn them down

weights sport rules anything I always

done at all to light the game up for the

fans and to create fanfare and deceit

I'm disappointed in me it hurts me to my

soul more than you'll ever know so like

I said retribution redemption respect I

will come and I will regain all of those

this incident happened just a few weeks

after that incident in Miami where the

fan tried to take a photo of you and you

knocked out the phone out of his hands

and so I'm wondering do you believe that

you have an anger problem is this

something that you need to fix and you

know that wasn't that was another

situation a long time ago I seem to be

getting into getting into great spaces

and great they're like in that Miami

trip I was prepared for I was preparing

for battle I brought my mother out it

was her 60th birthday I brought the

whole family out we went there and then

a situation arose I need to just stop

reacting to debate I've gotta ask like

people are trying to bait me into things

I might a fish or a mother whale I must

I must be calm I must be Zen I must be I

must lead by example this there's so

many people looking up to me what more

how can I react in this way I need I

need to get a hold of this and I'm like

I said I'm working very hard to do this

and I'm taking the necessary steps and I

have been on a great trajectory and even

before the Miami incident I was on a

great trajectory and then I had a little

slip and then I'm back open

I'm just trying my hardest I really I

swear on my life I'm trying my hardest

and it's it's been about five months

since that one and that's it I just I

just have to I just have to take work

homes and move on could you learn from

every single experience in my life and

try and do right for the people that

want me to do right I know you I really

want me to do right my mother wants me

to do right my mother wants me to do

right my father my fan the people that I

want to give them a reason to back me

but how can they back certain situations

so I must understand that and grow as a

man and make amends could you tell us

your side of that story in Miami we

haven't heard you talk about it and

where do things stand now as far as that

incident is concerned that incident has

been completely handled the file if you

want to call you know it does not matter

Ken it does not matter what what what

the person says I held the situation

arose it does not matter I was in the

wrong and that's handle and in the past

and I'm happy now to keep moving forward

and keep striving for them focus on the

positive like you asked me about Miami

and the Heckler and in Miami I would

rather focus on the occasion with my

family that was an unforgettable moment

bringing my mother for a sixtieth

birthday you know I'm trying to focus on

all the good in my life and recognize

that I do make mistakes and learn from

them not to make them again but still

focus on the good and and please lord

allow more of a to happen for me Connor

I know you're you're a historian you're

you're a fight game aficionado and you

have watched it all and you've read it

all about some of the greats in the

history of not just mixed martial arts

but combat sports boxing and you've seen

this story before right you've seen the

guy who you know rises up the ranks

makes a lot of money and then gets

himself in trouble repeatedly I don't

need to share the names with you you

know what I'm talking about are you

worried then the same thing is happening

to you you're still so very young you're

still so very talented you're in your

prime but yeah this year we're seeing a

lot more headlines about the negative

than the positive are you worried that

you are watching this movie that you

have seen before

yeah of course and I'm kind of sometimes

I feel like I feed into it and I give it

I give it fuel but I want like I'm in

such a I'm in a position where I can

make it a position that not many

fighters in a very few can I can make

this generational I can either be rich

and spoiled and blow it all in this

generation and leave it all behind in

ruins or I can get my head together and

build it and make it generational the

children of my children's children so if

I have this opportunity before me if I

don't if I don't execute this and get

this right and make this happen for the

children of my children's children and

all of my successes all of everything

I've achieved will be will be void will

be meaningless to me I must get this

right and I must not go down that path

that the path the written paths the

cliche of the father that has it all and

room you know I need I need to be aware

of of my past of the past of other

individuals and learn from it and grow

and that's when I'm doing and that's

that's what I'm working hard to do every

single day are you worried it's too late

I mean I don't feel look I don't know

what I really just so I'm just gonna

carry on being I Know Who I am as a

human being my people know who I am as a

human being and what kind of father I am

what kind of son I am what kind of

brother I am what kind of friend I am

and that's it I will continue to just be

good as a human being and I'm not

focused on not worrying too much about

that if it is it is but I do not believe

so I will Aaron I will earn it back I'm

eager to complete Ariel I have not spoke

to you on how long

why what if what why not just like I'm

an outlaw from the game or something

like what whatever like the sale I want

and my coach has been online there's

been many interviews me you know I've

studied every single scenario that's

happened to me I've studied every single

scenario that's happened in the game I'm

eager to come back here so we will see

what will happen in the future but I'm

gonna in confidence with a lot of

knowledge gained about myself about my

skill set about my mindset and I look

forward to implementing them and getting

back on track look at Matias last fight

three years ago defeated by me came back

and worn and it was and I was and it was

a motivating experience to me look at

steeping the opiates came back after

knockout loss worn his title back

against the man that knocked him out

there's so many there's so many stories

of this over and over again a mine is

gonna be the greatest one of all and

that's what I am aiming for so even your

I favor a former foe slash friend of

mine he came back forty years of age I

know the game is far from over for me

and I'm very very excited and I had a

little road bump I was preparing for

July in Madison Square Garden

I was in phenomenal condition Ariel

mentally and physically the best I've

ever been I learned so much from the

damage I took in that last camp what not

to do and how to approach this next time

and I gained I was in phenomenal

condition then I little slip up again

and I'm just trying to find that balance

and get motivated again and I'm looking

for inspiration everywhere like I said I

took great motivation from watching

Nathan go out and do his thing and even

looking at Nate and there's many things

that were amazing about that whole

performance for me for Nate but one of

the most important one of the most ones

that stood out for me is the very first

thing he said post-fight was the Nick

Diaz army he gave a shout-out to his

brother and I hope his brother's down

well I hope Nick is doing well a soldier

of the game of the foot of the real

fight game and he gave him respect

straight off the balance where the fans

love Nate that's why looking love and

respect maintenance you know I mean and

even even now with the kind of a strain

that he's coming out with and I hope he

I hope he has his business mind screwed

on because he is in a position now where

he could also make a generational

generational like I have and I hope the

seed Atma and and these are the things

that I'm just looking at taking

motivation from to use in my in my game

and to push me forward

you don't sound Conor like a fighter who

is retired you don't sound like a

fighter who doesn't want to fight

anymore you sound as motivated as ever

but I miss him I don't ask you about

your quote-unquote retirement because

this came just weeks after the incident

in Miami so I'll ask a very simple

question off the bat are you retired a

and B if not why did you tweet that out

you know there's a lot you don't

understand the amount the things that go

on behind the scenes area sometimes I

just needed distance I'm like hold on

I've rushed out you don't know most

understand my foot was a balloon when I

walked into that fight I've got all this

footage backed up from that entire camp

I broke my foot three weeks out from

that for you and my foot was abalone I

went

and I broke I told my I told my leg the

shreds before I'm in that's when someone

for the company back-to-back-to-back

non-stop like I build I built this hoist

can say he built this house I say Lee

I've certainly laid bricks and blocks

down myself to this game and then when

so many things are going on backstage

and between my inner team and then the

outer team and then the business side

but sometimes you just need to think up

like step on you know but retirement I

don't think I would ever retire from

this game I really never in my life I'll

be fighting until the day I go out

there's no doubt about it I mean it's

just the way it is it's in me it's blade

in me and I can I will I will I will

take it with me to the grave how did you

break your hand aspiring we scheduled

the spa I was like I said I was I came

back from Miami I had scheduled a

charity boxing boxing bout in my own

Club homeland Boxing Club many people

couldn't fly to come fly to Vegas you

know come and see me fight so I wanted

to show to the tilaka turned up to my

own Club I wanted to rekindle that

relationship and I met and only when I

got back there as I realized how much of

a grave error I made in the May what I

build up I needed I needed I needed my

coaches that learned me how to box in my

corner so when I went back there I

realized that instantly and I've been

down there dental training sessions and

I put in I had a good exhibition back

with a great fighter a young open coma

fighter Michael McGrane we put on a

great show for the fans and then after

and then that was it was it was for the

fans of her my people around and also to

rekindle relationships but it was also

to begin preparation we don't four

rounds are in the belt so I was

preparing for it was training for me

also like for the future upcoming belt

so I'm then obviously then we had a spar

schedule the following week between

myself and Johnny I'm really myself and

John you know there's been I need to

rekindle my relationship with my coach

and get that back on also on the MMA

side so we scheduled the spar where's

with your another young open coming but

with Ingrid mixed martial arts the

grooves are so small six ounce gloves

this the the the room for our damage and

injury is so hot is so big it's so high

so we need to be we need to come

together and realize that this is not

the way to deal with so we weren't and

we went into the into the spar and

although it was scheduled aspire it was

not a

Spira was another fight on the record it

was crowds in attendance it was a it was

a it was behind closed doors fight and I

caught the guy with a right hand robbed

him when he dropped I went down on him

with an emotional left hand and buying

the left hand off the side of the head

and my whole hand bomb and that's it and

I just you know it's like it's like it's

like I just needed to happen and that's

it I had to go under the knife I had to

get surgery on it it's been a

psychological battle with the left part

of famous left paw but it was the right

hand I put the opponent down on the

fours place my right hand has been doing

great work I've been doing really great

at walk with my right hand and even more

so now that my left hand has been out of

action but I'm back now

I'm back yesterday I met with a surgeon

he said to me originally September to

grapple but I was with him yesterday he

said now I can grab all so I'm gonna go

back into my grapple and I'm already

boxing again of course I haven't stopped

kicking of course I haven't stopped on

my fast a conditioner trane and I have

been on my walk I'm so so let's let's

get it gone now let's see where we go

and that's what that's I'm excited now

so if it wasn't for the hand injury

Conor do you think you will have you

would have already fought this summer

yes yes yes I was preparing for the end

of July at Madison Square Garden I was

eager to get bike I had the game in yeah

I had it I had it figured out and I have

it figured out I was on such a great

trajectory I really like I said I get to

these great sports and then BOOM a

little slip-up and I have to build it up

again and I'm just it's just a life I'm

in right now and I've just got to

recognize it and understand that and

take lessons from and just keep going I

just not let it happen again

but most certainly I would have been

back in July if we get that you know we

were we were getting there in

conversation there was opponents

discussed or he was right or not really

mind the opponent I wanted similarities

to to be able to prepare for that

because he doesn't want to have the

rematch you know and whatever I just

wanted to compete now enough is enough

let's get me back in the mix there it's

a forgetful business era you know that

yourself

I mean sure look Nate was out of the

game and now now he's back and he's on

top it's a it's a crazy business we are

in but make no mistake the skills are

there for me and

no I know what I can bring to the table

and what I will bring to the table and

I'm very very excited to give my fans

something to cheer about again you know

nummy and I do this for my fans for the

people that are supporting me but people

that dare to dream the highest of high

heights so I look forward to my

triumphant return Ariel Connor what is

the state of your relationship with the

UFC brass right now I always have a

great relationship with the UFC I never

you know it's brand over fighter the

rhetoric one of the things that kind of

slowed it down backstages only tried to

make me the co-main event and all of

these type of things but it's just

business I regret we have a great

business relationship with UFC I respect

the UFC very much it's a part of me the

UFC you know that's why I wanted to be a

part of it I wanted to be shown a little

bit you know because I understand I know

every inch of the game on what can bring

it to the next level and I wanted that

respect and that's where I was kind of

going and then they were trying to push

me back and but it's it's all business

and business is not emotional it's I

have a great respect for the people in

the UFC for lorenz that I've built it

for Dana of course and the people that

are involved in announcer there's no

there's no dispute at all we are all

eager to get this back on track you know

there was a stretch mid year where it

seemed like every Saturday night a fight

happens and there you are popping up on

Twitter talking about you know the guy

who just wants someone who's close to

your weight class and again I was

starting to feel like the fans were like

all right you know we'll watch you fight

anyone will watch you fight a broomstick

you sell a million paper used by

yourself yeah but they were like okay

enough already like you keep teasing us

it seems like and I was starting to get

that sense from the vents why were you

doing that why did you keep putting

yourself in those positions and then not

take a photo of the game watch it from

the start to the finish I wants to

prelim to the finish

come on that's why hey can I not can I

not engage in the game why am i outlawed

wait wait I know he's not spoken over a

year yeah you know I mean why is this I

love this game like this is this is my

game I absolutely had I love it look at

it everything that I've been talking

about like even the guy always jumped

and I don't wanted to say things up to

help build their boost people I don't

like it a lot of the things that's been

connected to me the

Holloway fighting they ever think I even

had them party if there's so many things

in the fight game that's been connected

to me that I've I've been speaking on

but even though that things like

watching the belts take place watching

specific rules happen and watching

specific stylistic matchups take place

this is what I love to do and what I

what I what I this is what I live for

that is what I am a fighter forced he

heard of me and I'm an entrepreneur and

I love my aura I love my other game my

games my businesses and my these are my

lows but I'm a fighter for some

farmhouse and I love it dearly

you mentioned 80 years last weekend he

wins he looks very good it sounds like

you were somewhat inspired by his

performance but I thought it was

interesting that afterwards you noticed

the stance he come tight with his hands

up high nice and early yes I know what I

said he had to do that he had to do that

against Anthony Anthony also his land if

you look at Anthony's style look at his

style versus Tony Ferguson he should

have got that win against Tony Ferguson

but he almost blew it he blew it was he

rushed the finish ended up and closed

guard end up tied up and the exerting

his energy this is the things I have

gone through in my career so I'm

watching Anthony closely also any

thought

wonderboy Thompson a lot differently he

kept a lot more patient he wasn't as

reckless with his with his 360 flip

kicks that if you catched him great but

you you must time them perfectly and

Annie was a lot more patient although

although Thompson was winning the

penalty caught him with that shot and

look look what that it was in a

phenomenal finish and then I caught him

the big fight with Nate

but then Nate is just a little bit more

experienced like if you look at Anthony

is kind of laying and that stuff Nate

has they even landed a little bit more

to the belt with me so Nate was just

that bit more experienced in there and

just been able to understand that that

bit more and that's where he came out

with the win that's why I was interested

to see what way the belt would take

place

who would implement this smoother and

sharpen and and I felt mate would and I

was good I was happy to see him do it I

thought it was interesting afterwards

that he didn't mention you he didn't

call you out he called that Jorge Maz

Vidal and Moz Vidal who had been talking

about you seemed very interested in the

fight and I felt like you were almost

being boxed out were you surprised that

no one you know it seemed now that these

guys weren't asking for you that mate

wasn't targeting you next no no I do

make Nate man come on no I already

looked it was he spent almost 50 minutes

in the knock

together the damages own it has been in

it was they were intense bouts REO

you know very very intense bouts but

Nate is a crafty individual he cut he he

opened up the deck he opened up the deck

for him that's what you know nate is a

crafty crafty individual Jorge horizon--

a to fight win streak at them and I

can't against ready forgettable he yet

didn't really have a great one in the

lightweight division and he's on a two

five score streak and he was in it was a

present in the arena Nate's a crafty

individual would and I did not feel I

was being box that I've done hi i box

Nate out in reality so and we'll see

what happens if the belt if the trilogy

but if he does not want the chilis

you've got no problem I don't blame him

I don't blame him look at the dammit

look at the fights look at the damage it

was they were intense belt area

but I thought does not matter like you

said earlier it does not matter now

that's time for me to just get back in

you know I mean I was over at all so I

was I was ready to go against anyone and

I was preparing for the end of July and

this happened and that's it I'm still

with it and accept it and learn from it

and that's what I will do I feel like

it's taking me back to when I throw the

ACL postmen there's our Lobo post that

whole sequence because I had to change

my whole training methods into a much

softer approach much more aware of the

body much less damage taken you want to

see the footage we have aa real you want

to see the cam so I've gone through you

know know me know that people holed up

in hotel rooms waiting for me to call

them to come down have own schedule

belts they weren't training sessions

they were belts they were belts with

crowds and attendance we have them

filmed and this was in preparation for a

belt why am I having belt in preparation

for a belt it makes no sense

so this injury is that the forcing me to

just go back to that with the way I had

to when I had no when I had when I was

on one leg and look what happened there

and I won boat my world titles so that's

the mindset I'm approaching this game

with now and and using that previous

experience as as confidence and and

that's what I will do and and to be

clear Conor for that fight in July did

you have in fact an opponent I'd heard

Pettis I'd heard other names as well but

did you have an opponent waiting for you

or we didn't get to that point yet I

believe it was it was leaning towards

just engaging at that time

but look if the game changes so quick

everyone just comes and goes it's a

forgetful business it is a cruel cruel

business our deal only for the amount of

only for the the amount of history of

may the amount of iconic moments that's

happened in my career they would've

loved him to thrown me away

discard me think of other people that

haven't had what I've had that's that's

gone through the trauma and the van der

battles for the fans watch what we do

before we do over the fans and for our

family and for the P for the people and

then when it's all said and doing they

just discard you when it's a cruel

business but you know that's why that's

why I'm how I was happy to see Nate

bounce back and I was happy to see not

not just not just some parents back to

bounce back with some business on his

mind I know he doesn't want to go into

that I was listening to him talking

about a CBD and he was like I totally

want to get into it out or just to get

into that you need this here to hold

that man wall so inside lane and I

expected a game because the flight game

is short and the gunner game is very

forgetful so I was just happy to see it

and I understand the business I mean I'm

and it's not gonna be here forever all

the whole be here forever I'll be always

I'll be always around our deal you know

that there'll always be something and I

will always be looking for something or

it got to do with this game because I

love a dealer I'll always be invested

into this game my son I'm training my

son in the skills our marshal of all the

martial arts that I've learned over the

years and if he wants to run with that

I'll guide him all the way if he doesn't

know or not you're not I mean I like

this sport is my life this is what gave

gave me this life and God blessed this

life so I'm just I'm just eager to get

back so let's be as clear as possible if

the UFC came to today and said Conor who

do you want what do you want

is it the winner of Habib Poirier which

has been discussed in the past they're

fighting in just a couple of weeks in

Abu Dhabi is that someone else who does

Conor McGregor want in his highly

anticipated return fight in the return

fight you know I want my world title

back I want that Redemption the camp was

incorrect I learned so much on that and

look no one known the commitment I had

in that camp I know the performance I

put on you know I mean he ran away

around that he ran away for that fortune

and I really didn't throw sweet he

didn't throw a punch he shot for the

legs before he threw a punch the fourth

round I should have been talking to herb

he says he was talking to

in the cage there was no whisper out of

him until he ended up in the dominant

position given reason the end up in that

dominant position is like walked around

with disrespect towards him cuz he was

running around the cage I switched off

for that millisecond he got that a lucky

shot

even after he got the lucky shot

although it was a beautiful shot even

after he got the shot like bounce back

up and engage what did he do is shut

again but whatever there's many great

things that I can take from that and and

I can I can come back and avenge that

but I'm not gonna wait around I'm not

without whoever if you're asking me

whoever if it's if this thing goes in

and does a toast and if Nate Nate if you

Jorge horn oh what I don't know what

sighs I don't I don't know what Dana's

talking about about soy's and all that I

don't know what well I don't even know

her he died wealthy ones I've just seen

the last year when I saw I saw the

Iaquinta belton but I mean anyone Tony

Ferguson just engage he Hall away

rematch Aldo rematch there's so many

belts for me Ariel so many and in

reality it does not matter Hugh it's

just about me getting back in I've been

being who I am NOT a shell of myself not

a half committed I was almost if I had

to say what I was I was too committed in

there in the gym and not committed

enough outside of it the training

sessions were too serious and then when

I left the gym it was gone from my mind

I would go off into into the jungle and

and and you cannot do that you cannot be

half in especially in a game like this

and I paid the price for it and that's

it

and although I had reasons and I had

injuries who gives who gives a [ __ ] who

gives a [ __ ] what happened happened I

know what I can do I've done it before

I've done it before when I was doubted

so I'm eager to do it again true or

false you will fight again this year

it's hard to put it III would say true I

would say we can get that done I would

say we can get that thrown like I said

yesterday I spoke to the surgeon about

grappling I'm gonna begin grappling now

I'm already in shape I have not lost my

condition so I'm in shape I just need to

sharpen up the grapple and just feel how

to how to grip feels on the wrist and

things like that but I can punch fully

so I would I would what do we now August

come on I would say so I would look for

that yes for the end of the year and

would it be fair to say that the the the

prime option would be you know Habib

gets by poor

that rivalries still seems very personal

it still seems like there's a lot of

heat there and it still seems like you

think that you could beat hubby

jump right in there no tune-up fight

just go back in there and try to avenge

that loss yeah so even dull even area I

dove in on one foot my foot was up alone

my foot was up alone you want to see it

turn on me and my toes came out of the

socket I got to come into the cage I'm

break their mic in the place the thing

Bellino and i hobbled in there and walk

them down and did not give two shits and

that was with a pod camp that was with a

half committed camp there's no doubt if

that's what's if that's what's there

that's what I'll take but if not I'll

take what I'll take whatever is there

and there's plenty there like I just

named multiple people you have alluded a

couple times to your relationship with

your longtime head coach John Kavanagh

SBG Jim I've seen photos of you guys

together but I've also heard the

whispers that maybe you aren't as close

as you once were when you do return will

it be with him by your side and could

you tell us what's the state of the

relationship there John is there a

genius at the game and having him in my

corner is it is essential you know what

I mean I felt a little bit slow at when

there was some lenders these interviews

Conor Ontario and and it was one of the

things was I hadn't watched a fight back

yeah no go when I hear that I was like I

watch the fight back 888 times before I

even got back to the house from the from

the t-mobile Arena to the house i watch

the fight I get about 800 times and to

hear that he has almost a void Bank I

was a little bit taken aback and then

I've got to ask and I got a I need a why

he has to coach me I just felt a little

bit hang on a minute you're not I me and

maybe I need a way but look it's this is

all I understand I understand that that

my half commitment has led to these

thoughts and these and this type of

things so I'm just in the process I'm

making them right and we'll get there

we'll get there but I need John will be

in my corner no doubt okay and I know

that we are approaching the limit that

we agreed upon

do you mind if I go a little longer do

you have to leave walk away Arielle it's

it's an honor to chat here when I

appreciate your time and it's good to

chat you again it is I feel like we're

just getting warmed up it's like old

times here I love it I know I know well

hey well hey don't bleed and don't lock

me away but are you here

make her mom listen what was that about

I mean either are you serious I felt I

know that I hear you but I feel ago I

don't know I don't notice how much been

going on at me so many teens coming at

me I'm like hang on a minute I feel like

I need to get my voice back out there a

little bit and I just and I was get I

was getting my for I was getting my

fighting back out there and then I got

sidetracked and then but look I'm in a

good spot area this this is this is many

months ago this this everything and I

just want to you know I want to make

sure that I'm apologizing for that

situation it's not that's not a good

look at it's not who I am and I want to

just get Boyd out and get on with this

and show where I am now you're not I

mean and move forward and move forward

with with positive attitude on and a

full commitment to the game

several months ago Connor max Holloway

took a trip to Dublin and it seemed like

he was taking subtle jabs that you'd

seem like he was looking for you what

did you make of those pictures and the

content that he wrote online and is that

a fight that you are interested as well

it's it's certainly a fight I'm

interested in young Holloway I mean you

saw it's not as easy as you think to

move up a division and challenge the

second world title you started with with

young max and I taught him coming over

and doing that was a little cheap

although get get get your money you know

get if you're paid to come over and do

this player brand that's that's afraid

of me and afraid of what I'm doing with

my you're not I mean that's okay but

whatever it is what it is again this

does another moment I'm almost reacting

to the bait and I hold on I need to just

you know need to accept things but the

way they are and that's it and but the

Holloway belt is certainly about I'm

interested in ever a lot of respect for

max I truly did we went to that issue

that kind of just forgot forgotten about

but I you're not I mean of a lot of

respect for max and he's been through

Wars McGann he's been rushed and rushed

and roastin you know he's you know you

know it's just max is definitely up

there topless and you know Wells is

probably it's Frankie Edgar it's also

out there right there at table list

because he has similarities to kabir who

runs on the back foot shoots on the

single leg I want these type of

similarites similar belt and also Franky

has been very respectful Frankie has

always been respect he wanted to say he

wanted to say one thing I want to tell

my grandkids that I thought Conor

McGregor one day and for me to hear I'll

ask Dana for me when I heard that this

was going back many months he said that

I miss

staying straight away and said that's

the flight to make and even though he

lost about the max in it in a closed

belt and I don't care about that wins

and losses in this game don't mean

anything it's the stories we are all on

the journeys we are all on that's what

sometimes when teens got a little bit of

prayers and that doors here huh hit

harder you know I mean but but that's

alright well also when we can see

something going well Luke the Nate

situation it just makes me feel good

animator you know just use it well we're

all in it together at the end of the day

it's a mad mad mad business we are in

and that's it so there are many many

fights for me to have and we look

forward to them and when you talk about

fighting for the belt next and wanting

to jump right back in there I can't help

but think of Tony Ferguson and Tony has

been vocal since returning and since

leaving the management team that you're

represented by thinking that he has been

held back and he feels like he should

have fought for the belt and I'm

wondering if that's a fight that you

feel and again again Tony's in order

warrior Tony is in order warrior I've

got a lot of respect for Tony also I

mean to say that he wasn't Luke Tyson

and I stable he was not even competing

for the world telling we had him on half

a million show money Tony

Tony's wage we had Tony Tony was looked

after and I stable all eyes all our

fighters that would we have a strong

stable of fire so it was wrong of him to

say that it was wrong of him to turn his

back on that and I think you know for

already and the team that worked out

with him constantly and and helped build

him up and fought for him I thought it

was wrong but Tony's also in the mix

we'll see what happens you still want

Jerry you know buddy tony has that 12

fight win streak and they can't even put

a belt and all this stuff

let's just see what happens now in

September Abu Dhabi there's a lot of

things there's a lot of things moving

and shake and let's just see how it pans

out okay just a couple boards you still

want shares in the UFC is that still a

sticking point for you it's not a

sticking point but I'd love I would love

to be brought on I would love to be

brought on what I'd love to be I'd love

to be engaged in the game I'd love to

get look let's see we are in a great

place at the minute and we are having

good good discussions and now that we

know that I can grapple again and we can

work towards our new arrangements I'm

sure I've note that we can get there to

where we were all we are all satisfied

no doubt last month Connor was the

5-year anniversary of your win over

Diego Brandao one of the most magical

nights in the history of this sport in

Dublin and there were a lot of things

written about that videos that were

resurfaced and you're in the midst of

all this and I'm wondering somewhere in

your home wherever you were at the time

were you looking at this stuff and maybe

a little nostalgic for a simpler time

for a time where you were on fire I mean

we could not do anything wrong

how did you react to that and did that

help fuel you in this return as well of

course I mean what I what an iconic

noise for the sport of a sport and for

the sport in Ireland it it made the

sport in Ireland really what we it

catapulted it into the mainstream and it

had nothing but good effects so to be a

part of that and then to think of the

people that I don't know wait and I came

up with of course I was sitting there

nostalgic and again using it as

motivation and even the opponent I went

to I know I'm not sure how many

opponents I went to was supposed to be :

Miller I had a back and forth with :

Miller on your show I believe and then

was Diego I think was an the old girl

and that was Diego Brandao Diego was an

amazing an amazing opponent the

Brazilian people I have so much love and

respect for the Brazilian people there's

so many Brazilians here in Ireland and

even just the other day I saw cell

Paolo's in darkness and with the Amazon

rain present like what tough what's

going on here look I'm just I don't know

what's going on but I mean the a guy was

a phenomenal opponent that I have a lot

of respect for the Brazilian people and

what an iconic moment am for it for the

sport in our land then and I'm I'm just

proud to be a part of it and I pray

every day I pray for that whole

situation out there I just pray for the

clouds to clear or something I prayed

and now we can put I mean a church point

down and we got it together and billions

were formed and the church was put down

and rebuilt now that we can put this out

there surely we can we can fight this

fire and clear the skies I mean sell

Paulo Brazil beautiful Brazil is in

darkness in the day I mean what we need

to do something about that encounter you

know we hear from famous athletes all

the time I'm gonna be better I'm gonna

learn from my mistakes could you tell us

what you are actively doing right now

differently than a few months ago

to try to get back on track to try to

not be in trouble anymore

I'm half first of all I'm focusing on my

family I'm a bit I'm focusing on my

family life I'm having and I'm also

having a long hard discussions with

myself daily discussions because there's

a daily thing I do not to get you know

you could save the world at my feet I

could eat a stomp on it or use it to

raise me up you know no means I'm trying

not not to succumb to temptation I'm not

I'm trying not to give in to bait I'm

trying to be a family man and I'm

working hard every day and these are the

things I'm doing focusing on my kids

focusing like I said training my son in

martial arts we moved into a new

property and only only a few weeks ago

when we were searching a hard time to

find them when I'm already we're very

happy with it and I'm settling down with

my family and raised them I finally

looking for skills now and these are the

things I'm doing to keep me focused

while also continuing my training and my

business Conner thank you so much I

really appreciate this it has been great

to catch up with you thank you so much

once again and we wish you the best and

hope that you have a speedy recovery and

are able to return sooner rather than

later I do thank you so much I

appreciate that and I appreciate that

and thank you so much for giving me the

platform to come on here and apologize

to the fans and that man and to my

people and just to show that I do not

feel like I'm above this I do not my

fault here and I want to own up to that

and man open and I appreciate you give

me the opportunity and I hope we can

continue this and I hope we can move

nice and steady towards more

conversation and more fight conversation

and things of that matter doubt that

that we are interested in and and I

appreciate it thank you any time there

he is the one and only Conor McGregor

months without a doubt the most famous

fighter in the history of mixed martial

arts there he was speaking for the first

time since October in a interview with a

media outlet he had not talked since

right before that Habib nurmagomedov

fight there is certainly a lot of

options for Conor McGregor upon his

return appears to be in great spirits it

to return and I think that is music to a

lot of his fans ears appreciate you
