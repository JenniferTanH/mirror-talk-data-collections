Michelle,To believe this was happening in our lifetime as the famed historian Doris Kearns.
Interviewer,Goodwin reminded us people will be writing about this moment for hundreds of years.
Michelle,And now as she prepares to leave the White House its Michelle Obama who's on the precipice of her own exciting next.

Michelle,First lady as a political force because this right now is the greatest country on Earth has pundits wondering about her.
Interviewer,Next move this is obama is not only a woman to watch in American politics but also considered the coolest first lady.
Michelle,In us history I remember being here eight years ago mm-hmm I was doing an interview for a.
Interviewer,Magazine we're actually sitting in this very room we took our shoes off we we did and you.
Michelle,Were talking about the girls schedules and trying to figure all that out and I left you know thinking and feeling the.
Interviewer,Weight of it all like the weight of the legacy that you all were carrying the responsibility so I want to know has.
Michelle,That weight lifted or has it just shifted you know it's it's lifted I mean you know let's let's be honest I mean.
Interviewer,You know there is there's no way to describe what it feels like to open up the paper every day and know that almost.
Michelle,Every headline is your husband's responsibility at some level mm-hmm anywhere in the world any major problem.
Interviewer,Any major issue falls on the laps of the commander in chief and that is a weight that is is indescribable and now that.
Michelle,It's time for us to move on yeah that weight has lifted a bit not completely because the work isn't done until the.
Interviewer,President-elect takes the oath of office but knowing that we've made it this far and we've survived and in many ways I.
Michelle,Believe we've thrived mm-hmm there is a weight that's lifted mm-hmm was there a time where you thought this.
Interviewer,Period would make or break you when did you feel the most tested you know I I think I tend to push the challenges this.
Michelle,Is a defense mechanism that i've had throughout my life you know the bad stuff I just don't hold on to you know I.
Interviewer,Mean so if we were to sit here and you were to read through some of that stuff I'd be like oh yeah that's all oh I.
Michelle,Forgot all about that it's like oh yeah I think I was kind of mad but I think the way I handle things and I you know I.
Interviewer,Can't i think we as women do it we as black women better be able to do it because there's so much that comes at us.
Michelle,All the time and every day in subtle that could tear your soul apart if you let it but my mother always taught me.
Interviewer,Girl you better keep it moving you know you got to brush it off and I think I've grown up doing that so the challenge is.
Michelle,Yeah there are times that you know frustrated me you know this this past election was challenging for me as a as.
Interviewer,A citizen to watch an experience it was painful had you originally planned to go out or was there a moment where you.
Michelle,Decided i'm gonna no well they didn't campaign they always asked me yeah party my husband people you know there isn't.
Interviewer,An important election that has gone by where they didn't ask you a they didn't ask you know the question for me is just.
Michelle,Always what and how how is the structure I've said this before if I'm out there if I leave this house and leave my girls.
Interviewer,How do i know that this will have impact I don't want to just be out there just to be out there um but I'm always asked.
Michelle,So i you know that was something that people were kind of dancing around the subject okay we're going to ask the.
Interviewer,First lady if she'll go out and you know you could see people dancing around the subject but it was pretty clear that you.
Michelle,Know you want eated yeah yeah after the primaries were or that you know they wanted us all to do as much as we could.
Interviewer,So there seemed to be something that happened to you during this particular campaign I think was in New Hampshire.
Michelle,There was a level of urgency and dynamism that we had not seen before that seemed to be coming from a.
Interviewer,Different space that wasn't just political well this was the context of that speech was unique mm-hmm.
Michelle,We saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women and I can't believe that I'm saying that a.
Interviewer,Candidate for president of the united States has bragged about sexually assaulting women and I have to tell you.
Michelle,That i can't stop thinking about this it has shaken me to my core in a way that I.
Interviewer,Couldn't have predicted you know to have a candidate for the presidency speaking in such terms about women as I said was.
Michelle,Not it was not a normal thing so my response you know in light of what I was seeing from my female staff what I.
Interviewer,Was hearing from my daughters their reaction to it for me required a different kind of response you know you.
Michelle,Can't just stand before people and just give a regular political speech I mean I was scheduled to go out on stump right.
Interviewer,After this was happening and the question was well do I just go out there and talk like that act like that didn't.
Michelle,Happen well god that's not true that's not honest and that's something that Barak and I have always tried to be in.
Interviewer,This office is honest you know so that people feel like when we say something we do mean it mm-hmm you know um so in.
Michelle,That time there was no way that i could be out on the campaign trail and not address how that was making not just me.
Interviewer,Feel we could feel that you had been shaken too yeah well not because a lot of people had been shaken to their core.
Michelle,And still are they are still feeling the reverberations of that kind of caustic language so I heard that on election.
Interviewer,Night you can't believe everything you read yeah please don't wait wait I read I.
Michelle,Read that on election night you went to bed yes and did not know the results until.
Interviewer,The next morning you know we absolutely I look I don't I do not like the back-and-forth the process of politics I.
Michelle,Don't like to hear pundits chit-chattin a man and I don't like it so you had awakened enough November 9th and you.
Interviewer,Were told yeah i got up and i looked at my my iPhone mm-hmm and I saw it and what was your first.
Michelle,Thought well pretty much you know you kind of saw the tea leaves I kind of felt helping by the time you went to bed.
Interviewer,He's in bed good sense he i was getting myself ready for either outcome you know so mentally I'd already kind of digested.
Michelle,It before I actually read it you know so this is what why it's important to.
Interviewer,Understand for all the people out there they have to understand that as I've said time and time again words matter.
Michelle,And they matter most to our kids our young people and the words that we say moving forward all of us it matters.
Interviewer,Which is one of the reasons why barack and I are so supportive of this transition because no matter how we felt.
Michelle,Going into it it is important for the health of this nation that we support the commander-in-chief wasn't done when.
Interviewer,My husband took office but we're going high and this is what's best for the country so we are going to be there.
Michelle,For the next president and do whatever we have to do to make sure that he is successful because if he succeeds we all.
Interviewer,Succeed when you say it wasn't done for your husband for his presidency what do you mean by that that there were people.
Michelle,Who did not support his presidency there were people in Congress there were leaders in Congress who did not support.
Interviewer,His presidency which was not something that was good for the country was good for politics but it wasn't good for the.
Michelle,Country um and that wasn't the right that way to approach it when someone is cruel or.
Interviewer,Acts like a bully you don't stoop to their level know our motto is when they go low we go high.
Michelle,So in this when they go low we go high that is that went viral now everybody repeats it it's now one of the most.
Interviewer,Famous quote i just want people to act on it okay so I want to know what that meat is like what does that look like in.
Michelle,The reality of this time it looks like so many things but you know it goes back to words matter what we say how we.
Interviewer,Behave we are modeling to the next generation so if we want maturity we have to be mature if we want a nation.
Michelle,That feels hopeful then we have to speak in hopeful terms we have to show love and empathy if we want smart leaders.
Interviewer,Then we have to be smart voters you know we cannot vote from a place of fear we have to vote from a place of openness so.
Michelle,We have to we have to model what we want and that's what you're saying you're doing mm-hm.
Interviewer,So what was it like when the trump's came to visit it was very pleasant it was very pleasant I mean it was a.
Michelle,Wonderful visit because this is a really great job you know we did you have any advice for it.
Interviewer,This is you know i didn't we didn't we talked about the kids but you know my offer to Milania was you know you really.
Michelle,Don't know what you don't know until you're here so the door is open as I've told her and as Laura Bush told me um.
Interviewer,You know and as other first lady's told me so I'm not new in this going high thing I mean I'm modeling I'm modeling.
Michelle,What was done for me by the bushes and Laura Bush was nothing but gracious and helpful and her team was right there for.
Interviewer,My team all throughout this entire eight year process and your team is doing the same we will do whatever they need to to.
Michelle,Help them succeed so that's one of the things I said to Melania when you get to a place when you can digest all this and.
Interviewer,You have questions because you know you don't have questions you know the day after the election it's just sort of.
Michelle,Like yeah you're looking on the house it's like well what do you want to know it's like I don't know what.
Interviewer,I should know and i knew that so my door is open and that that was really the nature of the the meeting coming up.
Michelle,Let's stop there yeah what did you say plus let let's not forget I just didn't wake up first lady.
Interviewer,And later that was one of those things that you just sort of think day you don't even know me.
Michelle, so how are you feeling right now you're packing up you're not physically packing.
Interviewer,Yourself well yeah i do a lot of pointing I'm not like boxing boxing things but.
Michelle,I'm doing a lot of but even when you're pointing you even when you're pointing cuz this happened to me when I was.
Interviewer,Leaving chicago you come across things and it's like oh I remember that I remember that well a lot of the books.
Michelle,You know books because we're going going through like my sign book from Nelson Mandela yes that's not being packed up.
Interviewer,Anywhere i'm gonna carry that with me i don't don't touch that book you know we have a lot of photo books and I think.
Michelle,You actually saw one i saw one of the photo books just now coming oh just imagine we do those all the time we do.
Interviewer,Them as you do look every year for your staff we do it every year Brock does one for his team for his entire senior team.
Michelle,We do one for family members sort of laying out the year that the girls had you know that's kind of a good Christmas.

Michelle,Were so little they were just looking through this year I was looking at your staff what I sent just looking through.
Interviewer,The book of this year mm-hmm so many events from college signing day going to have tea and lunch from the Queen so.
Michelle,Many meaningful school trips there so there's meaning and yet as I was going through the pages so much laughter oh.
Interviewer,Gosh yeah we're the happy side of the White House meaning and laughter yeah no no that was one of the things that I.
Michelle,Told my team when we first came in it's like we we because of the weight that the president has because of especially.
Interviewer,When he first came into office and we were dealing with a financial collapse that was unprecedented most people don't.
Michelle,Remember that um the country was little remember and a lot choose to forget exactly exactly.
Interviewer,That we're on the brink of financial we were on the brink and we entered an unprecedented recession and you're.
Michelle,Dealing with people losing their homes and we're in about their jobs and on and on and on and we sort of felt.
Interviewer,Like we need to be substantive but we also need to have a little levity you know Americans need a little joy and we.
Michelle,Were the joy masters and you did that in this house because sitting here in this house which represents many things first.
Interviewer,And foremost a seat of power but it was very clear that the image of you and your family rocked the world and then.
Michelle,You literally flung the doors open to everybody from every walk of life every ethnicity every kind of celebration we.
Interviewer,Wanted to change things up here in the White House hope it from the moment she moved in First Lady Michelle Obama made.
Michelle,It her mission to redefine the white House as a more inclusive House of the people he wanted to open the doors.
Interviewer,Really wide so a bunch of different folks who usually don't get access to this place she created an atmosphere of.
Michelle,Warmth by celebrating all cultures hello everyone knows let's animal Barack first lady's openness and acceptance led to a.
Interviewer,Flood of firsts on the white house staff the first man to ever serve as social secretary to the White House the first.
Michelle,Openly transgender staff member was hired and for the first time in history mrs. Obama opened a White House family.
Interviewer,Dining room to the public there she placed an expressionist painting by Alma Thomas the first work of art by an.
Michelle,African-american woman inside the white House it seemed that you all did that purposefully absolutely yeah absolutely.
Interviewer,And what why was that a priority because images experiences can be life-changing particularly for our kids and so many.
Michelle,Kids from so many backgrounds never get to do this kind of thing I mean you think of all the kids who live miles.
Interviewer,Away in anacostia who never get to set foot on that South Lawn who never get invited into these doors.
Michelle,And you know experience the magic that is the white house I thought of that the night all the Girl Scouts were out on.
Interviewer,Them yeah yeah you know and it's not just kids locally but kids all over the the country all over the world and quite.
Michelle,Frankly i love the look on their faces you know I mean some of it is selfish yes because well you know the joy is.
Interviewer,Gonna say the joy when somebody else feels something again right and for many young people you know getting to sit in.
Michelle,The state dining room and talk in the musicians and you know eating from our China and sitting in the East Room and.
Interviewer,Listening the alexander hamilton private performance I mean to see the joy the tears the you know we've changed their.
Michelle,Lives forever and so yeah that was purposeful that was necessary author Peter Slevin wrote this for the BBC.
Interviewer,About the unprecedented challenges that you faced he said first ladies arrive in the White House without a playbook they.
Michelle,Have no official duties no salary no official jobs let's stop there yeah what did you say first ladies arrive in.
Interviewer,The wake up okay yet the critics are ready to pounce from every point on the compass more so with the first.
Michelle,African-american first lady in a country that is anything but post-racial so you arrived here with great expectations and.
Interviewer,There were comments being made then and since that you said knock you back a bit what allowed you to stand in your own.
Michelle,Truth and find your way being a grown-up you know you know being you know I always said it to myself.
Interviewer,I this would be really hard if i were 20 or 30 and that's why I look at these young celebrities and I just feel for.
Michelle,Them because you have to be grown-up enough to know your self in this and that just takes time that's you know of.
Interviewer,Course i had great parents and i have a husband who loves me I have people all around me who affirm me look that helps.
Michelle,But just being straight-up grown-up helps because you know over the course of a professional career.
Interviewer,And let us not forget i just didn't wake up first lady I mean I went to law school I practice law I work for the.
Michelle,City i ran a non profit I was an executive at a hospital I've been in the world I've worked in every.
Interviewer,Sector and you don't do that without coming up against some stuff you know having your feelings hurt having people.
Michelle,Say things that aren't true you know and it's not just about race I mean you know it's just life Hitchin so.
Interviewer,Over the course of living you learn how to protect yourself in it you learn how to take in what you need and get rid of.
Michelle,The stuff that's clearly not true you know so I have a very good sense of who I am and my view to this stuff has.
Interviewer,Always been like it's always a challenge it's like oh you think that I'll show you cuz I'm gonna work so hard and I'm.
Michelle,Gonna be so on it yeah that my actions will speak for themselves and I don't have to say anything.
Interviewer,Coming up when you were labeled that angry black woman was that one of the things that knocked you back and later.
Michelle,Would you ever run for office  it made me wonder well does how are.
Interviewer,People seeing me or you might remember the onstage celebratory fist bump between me and my husband after a.
Michelle,Primary when that was referred to as a terrorist fist jab and over the years folks have used plenty of interesting.
Interviewer,Words to describe me once that i exhibited exhibited a little bit of uppity ism another notice that I was one.
Michelle,Of my husband's cronies of color cable news charmingly referred to me as Obama's baby mama this is what.
Interviewer,Chimamanda ngozi adichie wrote do you see that I did I like you know when I read that means I know you don't.
Michelle,Three pieces by rats one you should i read that one that was a pencil that this was in the New York Times recently.
Interviewer,And she said because she said what she thought and because she smiled only when she felt like smiling and not constantly.
Michelle,And vacuously america's cheapest caricature was cast on her the angry black woman mm-hmm that's what she said.
Interviewer,She said it well and she said it well but that was one of the most beautiful things I read about you I thought she.
Michelle,Summed it up for all of us but when you were labeled that angry black woman was that one of the things that knocked you.
Interviewer,Back and it's one of those things that you just sort of think day you don't even know me yeah you know I mean you.
Michelle,Just sort of feel like wow where did that come from yeah you know and that's the first blowback could you think well.
Interviewer,That is so not me but then you sort of think well this isn't about me this is about the person or the people who write.
Michelle,It you know i mean that that's just the truth it's like I always used to say it's just so it's so much about that and.
Interviewer,Then you start thinking oh wow mm we're so afraid of each other you know color wealth these things that don't matter.
Michelle,Still play too much of a role in how we see one another and it's sad because the the thing that least defines us as.
Interviewer,People is the color of our skin it's the it's the size of our bank account none of that matters you know this yes of.
Michelle,Course you know our it's our values it's how we live our lives and that was the blowback and then I thought okay well.
Interviewer,Let me live my life out loud so that people can then see and then judge for themselves you know how does it laugh.
Michelle,Out loud don't dial it back don't apologize dilute it don't apologize for it it speaks for itself.
Interviewer,So malia was 10 and sasha was 7 there were itty bittys and I remember one of the things that you said when I.
Michelle,Interviewed you eight years ago here you said either our stay here will make or break them.
Interviewer,Michelle calls the girls sasha and malia her proudest achievement she often said they're just two little girls trying to.
Michelle,Figure it out fifteen-year-old Sasha is in her second year of high school.
Interviewer,The obamas plan to stay in washington dc until she graduates 18 year old Malia will walk in her parents footsteps as a.
Michelle,Freshman at harvard university next fall were there moments were you thought they might be broken.
Interviewer,That's a good question you know i was so vigilant about this um I was I always had my ear to the ground I mean I talked.
Michelle,About this that the first year was really you know while we were doing work laying the foundation I'm on our.
Interviewer,Initiatives i mean i was really just cautiously making sure that they felt normal that they felt good um and I.
Michelle,Think they were okay now in the teenage years this is the time when you know kids start to bristle against all kinds.
Interviewer,Of authority imagine being 18 17 16 15 and you've got at least eight men with guns driving you around walking into.
Michelle,Your parties not letting you ride in your friends cars I mean there were those tensions for sure that we had to.
Interviewer,Sort of work through but as i reminded my girls it's like these aren't problems okay or they'll ease theirs I'm very.
Michelle,High class these are very high class rooms much security so memes Barack and I because of where.
Interviewer,We come from we just couldn't sympathize with there it's like girl you live in the White House you you're not gonna get.
Michelle,To complain about this coming up where do you think your greatest impact as first lady has been and later the next.
Interviewer,Family that comes in here their lives will be turned upside down you.
Michelle, with every song too long every laugh and daring style choice the.
Interviewer,Power of michelle obama's personality and authenticity has made her a pop culture icon why I'm in a bar yes.
Michelle,Whining about this work is there anything you wanted to do as a person you baby yeah how to do some cool things.
Interviewer,Like you know open a window as with all of the first lady's work there is a purpose behind all the fun exercise is.
Michelle,Not al the fresh approach shined a light on the initiative she felt most passionate about like healthy eating.
Interviewer,Everyone should have a healthy breakfast oh not me military families and one very near to.
Michelle,My heart educating girls all over the world so when you get here mm-hmm everybody beats with you and what.
Interviewer,Is going to be your initiative it feels like everything that you did came out of a personal space it felt like it was a.
Michelle,Real thing for you right do you think he moved the needle on childhood obesity yes yes I do I think we have I think and.
Interviewer,The we started talking about it exactly well the the when I first announced that we were gonna be working on childhood.
Michelle,Obesity i mean there were a number of people from all sides of the aisle you know they're feminists who thought well.
Interviewer,What's she doing out in the garden a woman who went to Harvard she should be doing X Y s everybody had their serve.
Michelle,This is too light this isn't a real issue or this is too weighty she'll never have be able to move the needle it.
Interviewer,Was it was a little bit of everything which is another reason why you can't take any of it seriously because.
Michelle,Everybody had something to say right i will take you the moment to get that that I can't pay attention to whatever.
Interviewer,Yeah i knew that coming in you did cuz just as a professional you know that if you want to get anything done you.
Michelle,Can't do everything and you're not gonna please everybody exactly you change the conversation really for the way we.
Interviewer,Looked at our military after teaming up with Jill Biden yeah that has been one of the greatest honors that we've had.
Michelle,Jill came to this issue differently than I because she is a blue star mom Beau wasn't the military so we're just funny.
Interviewer,How we and interesting i should say how we came to this issue from different vantage points but I always say every.
Michelle,American should spend some time in a military community yes I was going to ask you what being with those military.
Interviewer,Families um how did that enhance or enlighten your perspective I mean I knew you knew a lot going in right going into.
Michelle,This yeah it was important to have them as my inspiration because it made any challenges that we were looking at here.
Interviewer,In the white house with our chandeliers and our Butler's and our you know gowns and all that any complaints that I might.
Michelle,Have paled it was it seemed silly when i looked at some of these families you know dealing with their 8th and 9th.
Interviewer,Deployment you know with family members coming back in these the average military kid goes to eight nine ten.
Michelle,Schools over the course of their childhood and these kids are resilient these families are brave they do not.
Interviewer,Complain so when i would spend time in those communities I think I'm not complaining about nothing I'm gonna.
Michelle,Figure out how we live these people up how we tell their stories you know I get a little worked up that so you have to.
Interviewer,Just sort of calm on death so what do you think your greatest impact as first lady has been greatest impact that's.
Michelle,Hard to say that's one of those sort of I'm really good and let me tell you how you know I probably the greatest is just.
Interviewer,One of the greatest things when i see young women particularly african-american women but young women.
Michelle,Generally seeing somebody educated strong outspoken just seeing that on a regular basis it's exactly what I said.
Interviewer,On the way here in the car you then what did you say I said you're just being here being who you are being.
Michelle,Yourself and allowing the rest of us to see that made us feel that whatever it is you were we couldn't be that we.
Interviewer,Couldn't be in the white house but we wanted a little bit of that for ourselves coming up let me just tell.
Michelle,America this is hard Plus hope and whether or not you achieve that.
Interviewer,You I have to ask you this because when everybody found out I was gonna be.
Michelle,Interviewing you this question came up and I ever sang in no weevils oh it's not gonna happen but the people.
Interviewer,Seriously think that you are gonna run for office yeah yeah I don't I think some people think it's seriously and.
Michelle,Some people are just you know they're just hopeful and that's good hope is good but um yeah just that reaction.
Interviewer,Would you ever run for office i have to ask it no no County office no I I look that's one thing I don't do I don't make.
Michelle,Stuff up i'm not coy i haven't proven that I I'm pretty direct if I were interested in it I'd say it I don't.
Interviewer,Believe in playing games you know it's not something I would do but it also speaks to the fact that people don't.
Michelle,Really understand how hard this is and it's not something that you Kali really just sort of asked a family to do again.
Interviewer,Maybe cuz we got it wrong or we think we got it wrong so it's like well now you do it you just go back in there and do.
Michelle,It you're the closest thing to that so you do it um but let me just tell America this is hard it's a hard job I.
Interviewer,Set it on the campaign trail it requires a lot of sacrifice it is a weighty thing and it's not something that you even.
Michelle,Look to one family to take on at that level you know for that long of a period of.
Interviewer,Time it uses enough and 16 years would be right let's just you know 16 years I wouldn't do that to my kids yeah because.
Michelle,What people don't understand is that you run their lives stop at any age I mean the next family that comes in here every.
Interviewer,Person in that family every child every grandchild their lives will be turned upside down in a way that no American.
Michelle,Really understands and it's not for us to complain about it and so you don't hear complaints but it is a truth an.
Interviewer,Actuality that there is a weight to it yeah so the Democratic Party has not asked you to.
Michelle,Run for anything no no conversations I'm not having conversations no a conversation is like.
Interviewer,Two - a two-way street i don't know what they're talking about but I'm not talking back you're not gonna be talking.
Michelle,Back no no so your husband's administration um every everything the election was all.
Interviewer,About hope do you think that this administration achieved that yes I do because we feel the difference now yeah.
Michelle,See now we're feeling what not having hope feels like you know hope is necessary it's it's a necessary concept.
Interviewer,And barack didn't just talk about hope hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes I mean he and I.
Michelle,And so many believe that if you what else do you have if you don't have hope yeah what do you give your kids if you.
Interviewer,Can't give them hope you know our children respond to crises the way they see us respond you know it's like the.
Michelle,Toddler that bumps his head on the table and they look up at you to figure out whether it hurts and if you're like oh.
Interviewer,My god they're crying but if you're like you know what babe it's okay it's okay and I feel that way about the nation I.
Michelle,Feel that barack has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate having a grown up in the.
Interviewer,White house who can say to you in times of crisis and turmoil hey it's going to be okay let's remember the good things.
Michelle,That we have let's look at the future let's look at all the things that we're building all of this is important for.
Interviewer,Our kids to stay focused and to feel like their work isn't in vain that their lives aren't in vain what do we do if we.
Michelle,Don't have hope oprah what do we do we don't have hope is is cute oh hey you here.
Interviewer,Fancy meeting hey hope and whether or not you achieved that absolutely I was making that same point listen you ain't.
Michelle,Gonna see you how are you thanks for stopping behind Russ we were talking about hoping whether or.
Interviewer,Not your administration achieve that absolutely absolutely I feel hopeful what are you most hopeful about now the.
Michelle,Next generation okay the next generation you know we've talked about this history moves in.
Interviewer,Cycles and what lasts is the impact what we've done has had in people's minds and hearts that's a and that continues I.
Michelle,Want to ask you this so she change to be our first lady yeah we love her the approval ratings you can tell but she.
Interviewer,Was always your first lady yeah yeah what surprised even you about the way she took on this mantle of first lady.
Michelle,Ism you know we all knew she was brilliant and cute and strong and a great mom but I think the way in which.
Interviewer,She blended purpose and policy with fun uh-huh so that she was able to reach beyond.
Michelle,Washington on her healthcare initiatives on the military family work was masterful uh-huh.

Interviewer,Visionary conversation before the first lady of the United States it's funny.

Interviewer,Go to the michelle museum that's right you know you don't walk around the street match anything with those boots.
Michelle,Yes barely get on stage and but does this feel familiar so I know 20 was 20 19 your year or what it was crazy.
Interviewer,It was unexpected yes it was a good year that's because Michelle Obama's book be coming I know everybody in there has it.
Michelle,It wasn't just the best-selling memoir book of the year it's the best-selling memoir of all times and what that says.
Interviewer,To me i think it's like now eleven point seven million probably twelve since we've been sitting here billion what it.
Michelle,Says to me is that it's such an extraordinary time to be a strong confident assured and above all else.
Interviewer,Well a woman in the world today absolutely I mean so many people saw themselves in my story it's also a time.
Michelle,For owning our stories and i think that's part of what resonated with PSA a lot of people came up and said well you.
Interviewer,Were so vulnerable you was it hard for you to tell sorry to tell your truth there were.
Michelle,Things you covered that were difficult like trouble in your marriage in trouble having getting pregnant was that hard to.
Interviewer,Do and my response is no that's my story I embrace every aspect of who I am because as I've said I like my story I.
Michelle,Like all the highs and lows and the bumps in between yeah yeah and I think that you know what we learn from that is.
Interviewer,People are they are they gravitate to other people's vulnerabilities mm-hmm they we gravitate to one another when we.
Michelle,See the best and the worst in ourselves because it makes us feel human mm-hmm you know and I think people connected to.
Interviewer,The humaneness of the story what happened that you could never have anticipated on the tour I mean didn't.
Michelle,You all do 30 cities we did 34 cities we did Europe you know tour in Europe but I think that and I won't say that it was.
Interviewer,Surprising because we're feeling it here you know is that people are hungry for connection they're hungry for community.
Michelle,What's happening here is that there are people gathering together they're moving outside of their individual lives and.
Interviewer,The loaning loneliness that can come with social media obsession and Instagram worlds we feel lonely and when.
Michelle,We come together in a space like this you know for whatever the reason whether it's to hear about a book or to talk.
Interviewer,About health or to see oprah it reminds us that we are not so on a like and people are hungry for that and it's that.
Michelle,Hunger and i don't take any credit for it I don't I don't think you know I think we underestimate the the desire.
Interviewer,For people to feel a connection to each other I know all of the riddle in this room paid money to come out to give up a.
Michelle,Saturday we know all that saturday me and as I said ain't nobody twerking on this stage.
Interviewer,You know people are talking and having conversations but the the current climate speaks down to people you know.
Michelle,We think that people don't want to talk about books and talk about deep things and to you know really be.
Interviewer,Self-reflective speaking of a current climate you know one of the things that you have now become famous forever for.
Michelle,Is that when they go low we go high and that ain't always easy you know it's not always easy and what I wanted to ask you.
Interviewer,That in this climate where low has taken new lows yeah how do you maintain a high and not appear to be passive and not.
Michelle,Lose your equilibrium because low is gone lower yeah yes well because going low is easy which is why people go to it.
Interviewer,It's easy to go low it's easy to lead by fear it's easy to be divisive it's easy to make people feel afraid that's the.
Michelle,Easy thing and it's also the short-term thing and for me you know what I learned from my husband what I learned in eight.
Interviewer,Years at the white house is that this this life this world our responsibility and it is so much bigger than us right.
Michelle,So what i have to keep in mind is usually when I want to go low it's all about my own ego you know it's not about.
Interviewer,Solving anything it's not about fixing anything it's about seeking revenge on the thing that happened to you yeah and.
Michelle,When you as oprah you talk about purpose yes what it's all about and my purpose on this planet is not to just take care.
Interviewer,Of my own little ego you know there is a bigger purpose for me out there so when I respond to something I have to think.
Michelle,About that light i'm trying to shine what role model am I trying to be what what are the words that I'm gonna say.
Interviewer,And how will it affect young people who are looking at me but that's the bigger picture that puts you in a position to.
Michelle,Think high because if you're thinking about the long term you don't take the short-term measure of getting even with.
Interviewer,Somebody right here and now today because it makes you feel good in the moment if it's not gonna fix a problem.
Michelle,If it's not I'm gonna move the needle then you're not going high you're just being selfish.
Interviewer,Yeah i was going to ask you that because you know when you are the rock star that you are.
Michelle,And yes when you're filling stadiums all over the world you're a rock star just take it just take it no yes not just.
Interviewer,Rocks are rock star role model world's most admired woman when you are that well you carry all of those titles does.
Michelle,That affect how you then make decisions the is that now a part of what you think about before you make a decision or have.
Interviewer,An intention i don't know that it's any different today but I feel like I have a risk but when you I believe that when.
Michelle,You are a public figure I believe this that when you have any level of a Fame or if you have a.
Interviewer,Platform i believe and i always have believed that I have a responsibility with that platform and I think about.
Michelle,Kids i care a lot about young people and I know that what we say what they hear come out of our mouths all of us but me.
Interviewer,In particular because they're paying attention that it has a lasting effect and I am a mother I'm a mother I care.
Michelle,About kids first so i think deeply about what kids are hearing me say so yes I do I take that very seriously and I take.
Interviewer,The words that i say to children very seriously you know when I'm with a young person I want them to hear me I want.
Michelle,Them to hear me see them it's important for them to know that this person who's so famous and has this platform thinks.
Interviewer,That they are beautiful and smart and kind and good yeah as I said earlier that everybody just wants to know that.
Michelle,You hear me yes and that you see me what's the best advice do you think you've given your daughters oh gosh I.
Interviewer,Give them so much advice they're so sick of me you know now that they're in college I have these tech.
Michelle,Ding did i ever did i tell you to remember little things like you are eating some green things aren't you what.
Interviewer,Is the thing that over the years was a running theme in your house that you said over and over there you know what I.
Michelle,Tell them is what i continue to tell themselves is that they have to walk their own walk you know they they cannot.
Interviewer,Define themselves by looking at each other or looking at me or their dad they have to take the time to get to know.
Michelle,Themselves give themselves a moment to figure out who they want to be in the world not who they think I want them to.
Interviewer,Be not what the rest of the world says about them but to really think about how they want to shape their lives and how.
Michelle,They want to move in this world so i don't want them measuring themselves by external influences and for young girls.
Interviewer,That is hard to do oh no that is a very hard thing to do and everybody should understand that is responsibility its.
Michelle,Industry larger it drives me crazy hard when it was hard with just cable TV when you're watching all the images and in.
Interviewer,Music videos it's i don't know exponentially difficult yeah with with social media when you're comparing.
Michelle,Yourself to everybody on social media so I constantly have to remind them that they have to live in their own skin and.
Interviewer,That takes time too and i try to make sure they understand that that that unfolding of understanding who you are.
Michelle,It it is a journey of becoming you don't know it all in your 20s no you don't you just started to go something right how.
Interviewer,Did you do that in the white house where you have access to everything and everybody in the world I think it's.
Michelle,Difficult for people no matter where you are in your trajectory you want to do have a better life than your parents you.
Interviewer,Want your children and live comfortably everybody does but how do you not spoil children when they have access to.
Michelle,Everything it it was easy for us you know because we don't think they deserve it you know it's about.
Interviewer,It wasn't a difficult thing to do you know no the way me and Barack were raised I mean first of all you got to.
Michelle,Have a mate that shares your value so it starts way back to who you pick you got to have a good picker because if you all.
Interviewer,Don't come to parenting with the same kind of values and understanding that stuff doesn't isn't parenting giving.
Michelle,Kids things is not parenting is that it is a verb it is an active engaging thing and that means you got to know you your.
Interviewer,Kids are and each one of them are different right so you can't just apply the same principles to the first one.
Michelle,That you did to the second one because they come here totally different so we you know we didn't just show up in the.
Interviewer,White house you know we i'm michelle from the south side of Chicago a little bitty house I got nice clothes and.
Michelle,Jewelry now but my mother made my clothes you know I mean we were raised with that's enough you know you'd be.
Interviewer,Grateful for what you have you don't look at the next thing you'd be happy with what do you have and that's how we.
Michelle,Work in the white house that didn't change because we moved to a different house you know the house didn't define.
Interviewer,Us it's the values that defined us amen amen for us so I heard we read this.

Interviewer,Busyness of trying to move in and pack unpack and fold clothes and clean up a little get it all together and so when.
Michelle,You're busy with the busy stuff you're not thinking about the emotional stuff so usually we then drop them off get.
Interviewer,Them in the dorm then we take them out to lunch somewhere and that's like our last lunch and when the emotions come is.
Michelle,When we are getting in our cars and getting on a plane and leaving our babies and they're going somewhere where.

Michelle,Light and it's so easy a job is it oh no it is really good cuz doesn't the actual energy of a house change ya know what.
Interviewer,I'm saying is that parenting takes up a lot of emotional space and you know my husband was busy being president so I.
Michelle,Don't think he understood how much time time and energy don't we wish yes.
Interviewer,Just vote y'all that's all i'm saying just vote but anyway we digress but you know I put a lot of time and energy to.
Michelle,Parent think these girls in the white House because I wish we were trying to make their lives normal you know so that.
Interviewer,Meant weekends were always a pain right could you had to worry about what party they were going to whether there was.
Michelle,Alcohol and who was doing what and i had to know who the parents were so you're trying to do that as first lady I mean.

Michelle,Living their lives as my mother used to say sometimes you you just need to get out there and live your life and have.
Interviewer,Your mistakes where i can't see them because I'm tired of watching you walk at all you know she was there you don't.
Michelle,Follow them on social you know no no now we have a lot of people who do you know that was like no I'm serious.
Interviewer,We have my communications director every not group all the young people in our lives that I mentor they all follow the.
Michelle,Girls you know they're their bigger brothers and sisters who are grown it's like they're watching and they they're.
Interviewer,The ones because it's better for them to be checked by somebody other than me you know I also had to learn how to parent.
Michelle,With a balance of kids who have secret Service right so you have no matter what am I saying right you don't know what.
Interviewer,I'm talking about right you know when there's a Secret Service you know how that goes it's like no you don't but.
Michelle,They're neither did i but you're trying to make sure that these men and women who are following them around that the.
Interviewer,Girls can trust so i had to get my information about what they were doing or not doing just the same way everybody.
Michelle,Else from other parents and other kids who will tell on each other you know that takes that that takes some energy.
Interviewer,And now all that energy i can now place back on me and figuring out my next chapter you.
Michelle,Know how i want to spend the rest of my life what I want to do what I to 2020 vision is and Beyond exactly exactly.
Interviewer,Exactly so do you all actually now how do you have more time for each other just yes yes so and more emotional time.
Michelle,Really more emotional energy i mean it's just me and him and Bo and sunny at dinner and there's only they don't talk.
Interviewer,The dogs don't so we're celebrating 28 right it'll be 28 28 years yeah now that's real time your husband recently.
Michelle,Posted a message y'all see this message that he posted on Michelle's birthday on social media and said he said that in.
Interviewer,Every scene you are my star and you have called him your soul affirming partner is it more so now 28 years as opposed to.
Michelle,Earlier years does it just keep getting better or it's it's more seasoned it's it's all of that you know I mean and.
Interviewer,This is what i try to tell young people it's it's you know marriage is hard and raising a family together is a hard.
Michelle,Thing it takes a toll but if you're with the person if you know why you were with them you know you understand that there.
Interviewer,Was a friendship and a foundation there that may it may feel like it goes away during some of those hard times but it.
Michelle,It's something that you can that we always come back to and we're coming back to that point where we see each.
Interviewer,Other again you know because some of the hardest times in our lives we just we just.
Michelle,Escaped it we survived it you know we went through a tough time we did some hard things together and now we're out.
Interviewer,On the other end and i can look at him and I still recognize my husband he's still the man that I fell in love with -.
Michelle,Who i value and i respect and i trust he's been an amazing father through so much he is he shows up what he has shown.
Interviewer,Up well in the world and it's he has been who he promised he would be to me and so that has been tested over 28.
Michelle,Years you know so what i tell young couples is that you got to hang in there you know you can't quit the minute it.
Interviewer,Gets hard because this this thing of living life and building a life together is a naturally hard thing to do so you.
Michelle,Can't quit when it's hard because then you'll miss the good part and I do joke you know and some people hate when I say.
Interviewer,This but if you live long enough to be married for 40 years 50 years which is what we're working towards if you get to.
Michelle,A point where eight eight of those years are bad ten of those years are bad wouldn't you take those odds you know.
Interviewer,But that's what marriage is you can have chunks of hard bad times and if that's how you define your marriage by just the.
Michelle,Hard times then you'll miss the the the truth of what's really there so you were so open in becoming when you talked.
Interviewer,About it or was a boo-boo they went to therapy and therapy really was an eye-opener for you and for him.
Michelle,What we all need to reflect and it's very hard to do it in a marriage with the person you're trying to work on.
Interviewer,Sometimes you need an objective person to just hear you out you know you may not be right you may just want to get it.
Michelle,Out and so we have him sitting there listening to you get it out sometimes that helps it's like I don't know about.
Interviewer,Yourself i talked about this it taught me that I am responsible for my own happiness that I didn't marry Barack for.
Michelle,Him to make me happy no one can make me happy you know so my disappointments were about what I thought he should be.
Interviewer,Doing for me giving to me when i hadn't really done the work to figure out what did I want and how do I go after what I.
Michelle,Want on my you know if I'm gonna show up equal in this partnership I have to be able to.
Interviewer,Make myself happy and so I had to stop focusing on what he wasn't doing and started thinking about.
Michelle,How to carve out the life that i wanted for myself with or without Barak and the more I did that the more I succeeded in.
Interviewer,Defining myself for myself the better i was in my partnership and isn't that for you the cornerstone of your own wellness.
Michelle,Program is defining your own happiness and working towards that but one of the things I said this earlier what I tried.
Interviewer,To tell my girls is walk your walk you know that's been my mantra one thing I do every year I started doing right.
Michelle,After the white house is taking a retreat and I think some of the people who some of my girlfriends who've gone.
Interviewer,On a retreat we go to this place where you're essentially walking for four hours it is it's hard and my friends who.
Michelle,Don't know what it is are usually mad at me by the middle of it that's that place.
Interviewer,Where you get up at 5:00 in the morning actly and one of the lessons of walking for that long because it's rare that you.
Michelle,Have to walk and these are hikes this is up mountains and down streams and valleys and all you have is a Camelback.
Interviewer,With some water and some hiker is telling you it's water water water and you're just like shut up just shut up.
Michelle,With that water when is it over this hike but you're hiking with other people and what you realize is that not.
Interviewer,Everybody has their own way of hiking some people can get up the mountains fast some people are fast on the flats.
Michelle,Some people are slow and methodical about how they walk and I always found that when I was not enjoying my walk is.
Interviewer,When i was comparing my walk to somebody else in the group and I had to sort of start telling myself over these four.
Michelle,Hours stop comparing yourself to the person walking ahead of you or behind you walk your walk do your walk why are.
Interviewer,You here how fast do you need to go how how fast do you need to take that incline to get through it because if you.
Michelle,Do what she did in front of you you won't make it so for me the such that I always have to tell myself.
Interviewer,Is what is my journey what what is my definition of health for me not what I see in a magazine you know because the.
Michelle,The people in magazines don't look like us they do they don't even set it up to look like us they don't even look like.
Interviewer,That right so i sometimes i'm at a photo shoot you give urine looks around the photo.
Michelle,Shoot at last sort of shoot i counted 47 people oh yeah those are yeah yeah this is also rich people's problems talking.
Interviewer,About photo shoots right and in my photo shoot girl there were like a hundred people yes it requires so many people.
Michelle,Did youdid make you look like this right people somebody put these bracelets on me and then they moved one over there.
Interviewer,And i was like why'd you move that one what did why that one but who's got time to figure it out they just push her out.
Michelle,On stage just get out there was sort of my walk but some it's somebody else's walk to this way I was talking to Tina.
Interviewer,Fey recently and she said that she she's at a stage now where she appreciates that she has moved through life in a few.
Michelle,Different body shapes yeah what do you appreciate most now about your body it's mine all mine and it's a.
Interviewer,Healthy body that works every day and i try hard not to judge it and it is different I mean you have to get to know.
Michelle,Your body because what this body is at 56 isn't this I can't do the same thing that I did when I was 36 it's not the.
Interviewer,Same body we we are we're living things we're not machines you know we run out of gas we need fuel we need sunshine and.
Michelle,Light we have to take care of ourselves and when you don't as you get older just like any living thing it begins to fail.
Interviewer,On you and for me i'm trying to figure out what is that balance that I need to make sure that the this body that God.
Michelle,Me that i'm taking care of it the best that I can and that it will serve me well as I get older and that isn't doing.
Interviewer,That what i did at 30 does not take care of this body at 56 so I can't look at some little kid in the gym next to me.
Michelle,And even wanna walk her walk because she's 30 you know and I'm 56 with a 56 year old body and I love my body you.
Interviewer,Know and as a as a as a child of growing up with a person with a father with a disability who could not walk my father.
Michelle,Would have given anything to have any one of my legs for me to judge that and not to just embrace it and be happy that.
Interviewer,I'm alive moving able to move hmm i haven't L myself appreciate what what God gave you and take care of that yeah.
Michelle,Be and be balanced about it i like that you so freely speak the number 56 yay for me because you have been around.
Interviewer,Women we all have and men to like oh i'm not gonna say the number oh my gosh I'm turning 40 and oh my gosh I'm trying.
Michelle,Turning 50 you never had any of that we we are so ridiculous as women you know we were working with we were struggling.
Interviewer,With so much you know just the notion to the other thing we don't want to talk about our age and then we want to act.
Michelle,Like we should look like we did when we're 20 you know when I'm sorry men y'all can look any kind of way you know.
Interviewer,And it seems to be okay it's it's i told my daughters because as they're getting older they start to judge themselves and.
Michelle,You know it's interesting when they talk about well I couldn't fit in my jeans that I had last year and I said but.
Interviewer,You're a whole nother year older you're now becoming a woman you don't have a child's body that's like saying you know.
Michelle,At 20 i'm really upset that i couldn't wear my favorite overalls anymore when I was 10 yeah you know that's as.
Interviewer,Ridiculous as it is at 56 to think that I should look like I did when I was 36 or for anyone to judge me.
Michelle,Like that or to judge a woman like that we're aging a nice culture where people are trying to stop it yes and then you.
Interviewer,Have all of these frozen faces yes and let me tell you when you're old now this is another thing most people I mean.
Michelle,You're in a photo line and everybody looks the same and you're like didn't I just meet you no nope y'all just have.
Interviewer,The same lips right and the same forehead and the same yeah let it go but we have to embrace our change and I'm.
Michelle,Lecturing to myself truthfully ladies because I do I struggle with this too you know I struggle with looking at the.
Interviewer,Mirror going mmm well whoa oh and i hate I hate looking at myself I hate listening to my voice I hate watching.

Interviewer,We're you know so there's still that you know there's still that baggage that we carry and not everybody can relate to.
Michelle,That but yes there is baggage that that I carry just like anybody else I was wondering if touring the world filling.
Interviewer,Arenas and stadiums around the world helped to release some of that self-doubt the release doesn't come from.
Michelle,The adoration or the the book sales the work is still from within that's the thing you know it's yes it is it's the.

Interviewer,Take what what children hear from me you know I take that very seriously because my voice becomes the part that the.
Michelle,Recording in their head so what could that voice possibly be saying to you at this point that brings self-doubt it's.
Interviewer,Always are you working hard enough is there you know are you using this platform.
Michelle,Or a good purpose are you focused on what other people need are you getting outside of your own ego that's you know.

Interviewer,About my paternal grandfather dandy and he was kind of a crotchety old man I read about and now that I'm older I can.
Michelle,Look back and think why was he so angry but it it was because he was a brilliant black man in the era of segregation and.
Interviewer,Jim crow who could not realize his potential and he was probably very bitter about that and imagine how that.
Michelle,Would imagine how that would feel i wish I was old and I wish I had been old enough to sit down with him and ask him.
Interviewer,What you know what he went through how did he how did he survive living through a world that had such limited.
Michelle,Expectations for him when he knew that you know there was so much more for him yeah I would want to unpack that so that.
Interviewer,I could get to know him better and the reason why I put this kind of stuff in in the journal is.
Michelle,Because this is what our stories are and I want particularly young people to know that there's time now to have some of.
Interviewer,Those conversations with the elders in your life because the more you understand their stories their journeys.
Michelle,Their pains and their hurts you get to understand who they are in a full sense and then you judge less and you're more.
Interviewer,Empathetic i wish i understood my elders a bit more but we grew up in an era where you don't ask nobody question you.
Michelle,Know don't ask dandy that right you know you're you wish if you could have a conversation.

Michelle,Older oh any conversation with a young person you know here's one just personal sentiment I have a godson who you know.
Interviewer,Is just got his permit and his mother sent me a video of him behind the wheel and dad just tripped me out because I.
Michelle,Was like no one should let that little boy Drive he's on the road I mean he was the kind of kid like the girls would go.
Interviewer,Over his house when they were little and they come back with scratches on their face because he was a wild little boy.
Michelle,When he was little and i would come home and it's like oh he must have been it we call him boots you must have been a.
Interviewer,Bujji's house because your face is all scratched up he's driving that made me feel old seeing the young people in my.
Michelle,Life because to be like this yeah watching them out in the world you know buying groceries having conversations.
Interviewer,About life like they know something that makes you know the thing about young people though it's like their baby comes.
Michelle,Out you know it's like my children that can be all elegant and saying interesting points and then I get a.
Interviewer,Facetime because somebody doesn't know how to get a stain out of their duvet cover and I'm like oh.
Michelle,Is still a baby because you don't even know how to do laundry right yet so but that kind of stuff makes me feel I was.
Interviewer,Asking earlier julian was out and she was talking about her superpower is dance hmm what is yours I don't you know.
Michelle,I have a hard time thinking about it as a superpower but you know I I hope it's making people feel seeing.
Interviewer,You know i hope that that's my superpower that I make the people that I come in contact with feel seen and heard.
Michelle,Especially young people i hope i have that power to make them feel relevant and whole you know and and deliver it to.
Interviewer,Them what i didn't have when that what was that when I was that age like the sense of importance and relevance in the.
Michelle,World i hope that's my superpower I hope my superpower is empathy you know I try very hard even in these times to.
Interviewer,Understand what people are going through when they're angry or hateful or when they're doing things that just don't.
Michelle,Feel right i try to stand in their shoes and say there's got to be something there's got to be a context that I can.
Interviewer,Understand that helps me see how you see the world so that I can connect with you on some level and I think that's one.
Michelle,Thing that's missing in all of us you know it's just the ability to stand in somebody else's shoes and understand.
Interviewer,Their pain their hurt their fears their loss and to see them beyond their anger I think it with the is your superpower.
Michelle,And i'm also wondering like every time we see you I've seen you out since 2016 you look like and so does Barack Obama.
Interviewer,Like you really discovered what living me your best life means yeah it seems like you all took living your best life.
Michelle,To a new level have you you know we're yeah I mean we're we're happy people but I you know did you get happy your.
Interviewer,Oh yeah the white house yeah yeah look there's it it was an honor to serve I mean it was it was the the biggest.
Michelle,Privilege of my life to serve as this nation's first lady and I will and I will continue to work to try to be a.
Interviewer,Person of service to try to make sure that my life means something to somebody else but those eight years were hard I.
Michelle,Mean it's a hard job and it takes a toll so anything after that it's like they look really happy and it's like yeah yes.
Interviewer,Cuz it's not that so yeah we are happy people but why wouldn't we be we have our health you know we have each other.
Michelle,We have a sense of purpose you know i mean there are things to complain about he and I but we the two of us we don't.
Interviewer,Have anything to complain about that's why we believe we owe so much because to whom much is given much is expected Saul.
Michelle,Right i cannot sit up here and complain about my life what I'm worrying about are the lives of the people who don't.
Interviewer,Have a voice the people who don't have jobs the people who don't have health care there's so many people who are.
Michelle,Struggling with things that so it is a hard thing to me to look at the life I've been given and and complain about.
Interviewer,Anything so i know you don't do resolutions but we're here setting the commitment contract for a better vision.
Michelle,For ourselves do you have a vision for 2020 and beyond do you see it Oh for us as a people no for you.
Interviewer,Michelle obama oh from me okay good that's easier for me that the next phase of my journey.
Michelle,Of becoming is is is is really continuing to make sure that what I do has meaning and purpose anticipate.
Interviewer,Somebody outside of myself so my vision is in particular is to keep helping young people to find and build and.
Michelle,Support that next generation of leaders to help them understand a broader sense of values that they can operate within.
Interviewer,Because i do think that we are short on that right now that our leaders are not paving a good path for what we want our.
Michelle,Kids to be i'm just sorry to say that i don't want to make this political in any way but I think young people are hungry.
Interviewer,For something and it's time for them to step up and to take the lead because we're getting older and we need to move.
Michelle,Out of the way for them because they're gonna have answers that we've never thought of so my hope is that I want to.
Interviewer,Empower young people i want to empower the next generation of politicians and community activists and teachers and.
Michelle,Doctors and lawyers and i want to i want to be a part of laying out a set of values and principles that we can all be.
Interviewer,Proud of in this country you know honesty you know empathy compassion caring for others and as you say honor.
Michelle,To be he said earlier you you've also made voter awareness a top priority for this year's presidential election every.
Interviewer,Year i mean what i've said with voter registration is that this isn't something we can do every four years.
Michelle,Because we have to change the habit of people and voting we're not we're not in the habit of being engaged citizens and.
Interviewer,That's not something you do every four years okay it's a presidential campaign get registered no we have to be talking.
Michelle,About this every day when we want to do something in this country when a company wants to market and sell something to us.
Interviewer,They don't do it every four years they do it every day every minute every 30 seconds they are telling you what to buy.
Michelle,What to do we need to do that with civic and because people don't understand why.
Interviewer,Government is important in their lives because I always say government doesn't have a marketing budget it can't be on.
Michelle,Teeth be telling you what it's doing for you and your schools and your roads and your communities so we start taking it.
Interviewer,For granted and thinking that this is all a game but we have to be having these conversations every day every day.
Michelle,Why it's important why is it relevant you know and so no it's not just this year it's every year it's not just this.
Interviewer,Election it's every election we have to change our culture in in terms of our engagement in this political process you.
Michelle,You you've talked about being 56 in the shape that you're in you work at this though every day do you have a wellness.
Interviewer,Goal or wellness potion for yourself it is it is balance and understanding my walk I've got to understand trying to.
Michelle,Make sure i understand what healthy means for me not compared to the person walking next to me.
Interviewer,Not the person in the magazine i'm trying to understand what my blood pressure level should be and what my.
Michelle,Flexibility should be and what cardio means for me and when do I feel good because we can also overdo it right we.
Interviewer,Can work out so hard and diet so much that we might be thin and look a certain way but our bodies are broken inside.
Michelle,Because we're not walking our path we're walking somebody else's path so I am trying to figure that out every day and.
Interviewer,It changes because women our bodies change drastically in comparison to men we're going through menopause we've got.
Michelle,A lot going on and i don't think we've done enough to understand what aging means for women's bodies what are we.
Interviewer,Supposed to look like how are we supposed to feel we're not talking about that enough and I feel like we're at a.
Michelle,Time when women are age because we do have we do spend money now we have wealth women our age but the market and.
Interviewer,The fitness market they don't speak to us they're not catering to us they're catering catering to Malia and Sasha how.
Michelle,This work out where looks and what these classes are they're catering twenty and thirty year olds who quite.
Interviewer,Frankly have no money how is that so i want to make it I want to push these industries to start thinking about us.
Michelle,Women mature women so that we're operating with real good information about what we should be wanting but for.
Interviewer,Me i have to figure out in the absence of that information I've got to seek it out for myself and and stop comparing.
Michelle,Myself to the woman next to me you don't have to compare because you don't you represent you represent what Maya.
Interviewer,Angelou said in one of her poems you make me proud to spell my name WOM am you and when I see you walking it.
Michelle,Makes me proud because you are phenomenal but not a woman Michelle thank you.
Interviewer,Michelle obama  .
Michelle,Without mama critiques. Michele Norris
Interviewer,"Have you eaten anything, today? So, one of them literally is, is like a night crawler. You know, up all night, and then sleeps all day, and and emerges, kind of in time for dinner? My other child, is a planner. And makes lists, and, does everything, but is doing it all like, from the bed. You know?"
Michelle,"Right, hahaha, so it doesn't feel, very, uh, productive."
Interviewer,"So it gets done, but it's, you know, so, you know, showers, do or don't happen, and, but the thing that I was able to use to organize the house is, meal time. So we don't eat at a specific time, and we probably should, that would help, but we do eat together everyday. Breakfast is kind of fuzzy, cause not everybody's up, and I had first started to lay out breakfast, like, here's your breakfast buffet, and then."
Michelle,"Like a bed and breakfast, yeah? Really girl? Mm hmm. Michele Norris"
Interviewer,"No, I was putting out yogurt cups, and everything you know, and then I had."
Michelle,"Man, I should've come to your house!"
Interviewer,"You should have. I felt like I lost control of a lot of things, but I had control of my kitchen."
Michelle,"Mm. For Barack and I, we, we've lived outside of the norm of regular life for quite some time, and what we learned early on in the White House is that in order to stay sane, and to feel like the human that you once were, is that you have to have a schedule, and a routine, that's pretty, that's pretty lock step. So we were in the habit of, you know, I get up, you know, I don't have to set my alarm, but I."
Interviewer,Do you get up at the same time?
Michelle,"Uh, roughly, around the same time. I mean, but my sleep is off, too, and I've heard this from a lot of people, it's, you know, because we're not moving around as much. So I'm not as tired, I'm not, I'm not knocked out tired, like I usually am at nine o'clock, I'm going to bed a little bit later, so, and I'm waking up in the middle of the night, cause I'm worrying about something, or there's a heaviness. But, if I sort of set aside, an uneven night, I do tend to wake up at the same time. Not the crack of dawn, but, pretty much like six, seven o'clock, then I try to make sure I get a workout in, although, there have been periods throughout this quarantine, where I just, have felt too low. You know, I've gone through those emotional highs and lows that I think everybody feels, where you just don't feel yourself, and."
Interviewer,That's unusual for you.
Michelle,"It is unusual, and it is, you know, it's a direct result of just being out of, out of body, out of mind. And spiritually, these are not, they are not fulfilling times, spiritually. You know, um, so I, I know that I am dealing with some form of low-grade depression. Not just because of the quarantine, but because of the racial strife, and just seeing this administration, watching the hypocrisy of it, day in and day out, is dispiriting."
Interviewer,And master it.
Michelle,And master it.
Interviewer,"You know, we don't need as much."
Michelle,"Yeah, oh, and the beauty."
Interviewer,We don't need as much of anything.
Michelle,"Not to put anybody out of work, but this time has taught me how to do my own waxing, do my nails."
Interviewer,You're waxing? You're waxing!
Michelle,I did!
Interviewer,I am impressed!
Michelle,"I did, but it's like, there's a lot of stuff, I'm figuring out, if I want it done, I gotta figure out how to do it, but that's how we were raised, right."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"You know, nobody was going to the nail- my mother never went to the nail salon!"
Interviewer,"Oh a nail salon? A nail- there was, I, I don't think I even saw a nail salon."
Michelle,"You'd better learn how to do your own nails! I, and not until I was a lawyer, I tell my girls that. It's like, I never went, and got a manicure until I was a lawyer in a big firm, making money."
Interviewer,"And I remember, many of the beauticians worked in, there was that phrase, kitchen beautician?"
Michelle,"Oh, god yeah, my first, hair dresser, she had her uh, Mrs., was it Mrs. Stewart? Across the alley. Pressed my hair. In her basement."
Interviewer,"Just when you said pressed my hair, chhhhhhhh."
Michelle,"Press it, press it, burned my, tips of my ears, like ugh! Better sit still. But, you know."
Interviewer,"And it didn't, and it wasn't, before there was that little, little cylindrical thing that the hot comb went in?"
Michelle,"The heater thing, whatever it's called. The stopper."
Interviewer,"They just put in on the, stove."
Michelle,The stove! On the fire.
Interviewer,"Have you found that, for the girls, that, this has been, a recalibration? Where they've discovered that sometimes it's OK to just be?"
Michelle,"I, yes."
Interviewer,Like they're not running all the time?
Michelle,"I, yes, yes. It's an unburdening, for them. You know, I don't know if they've articulated it. But, there is a calm in them. It's almost like, they needed the world to stop a little bit. You know they didn't realize that they were, that the world they were on, and the way they were living it, was so treadmill-like. So fast and furious. Um, because it was all they ever knew. You know, this generation of, the internet, and social media, and constant instagram, and posting, and knowing too much and having access to too much information, and at this stage, worrying about who you want to be, and where you want to go, and did I get in? And taking the test, and what's the internships, it is just, it has just been relentless."
Interviewer,"You know it's interesting, cause, we did have television, we had, periodicals that came to the house, you know, magazines, catalogues."
Michelle,Highlight.
Interviewer,"Yes. Oh my goodness, yes! And we had this magazine called Ranger Rick."
Michelle,Oh that sounds like some Minnesota stuff.
Interviewer,"Oh it was some Minnesota stuff, yeah. It was, it was totally some Minnesota stuff, and you know, let's go looking for slugs! That was, you know."
Michelle,"That's right, but we would look forward to that, that would come like one a month, and they'd give you activities, and things you could do. That, that was big time."
Interviewer,"Yeah! Oh yeah. And we, I'd dine out on that for the whole month."
Michelle,That was like a new Netflix show.
Interviewer,"You know, it would last for the whole, months, and we had a, we had a."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"And you would cut up, you could not."
Michelle,Use the National Geographic.
Interviewer,"Cut up the National Geographic. And my father, got one of those magazine holders, so they were all like, displayed."
Michelle,Oh you all were fancy!
Interviewer,"January, February, March, in order, was his thing. And then year by year by year by year."
Michelle,"We were slowly spoon-fed into the world. If we were lucky, and there was time for it, right. I, I grew up with kids who had never, never got the opportunity to see Lake Michigan. Because they lived."
Interviewer,Even though it was so close.
Michelle,"Even though it was so close. There were kids, and I talked about this as First Lady, when we, when I've gone to museums, and openings, and things like that, and the thing I think about are all the kids who don't get to see these places because they don't feel welcome, because in many ways, they have felt quarantined, to their little worlds, to their communities, because there's a fear of going out, there's a fear of trying something different, there's a fear of the unknown. So when you don't feel welcome and you don't feel safe, and you don't feel secure in your space, then you, then you don't explore. You don't investigate. If you don't feel comfortable going downtown, Chicago, how do you feel comfortable thinking about the world in the National Geographic book, that you guys saw?"
Interviewer,"You know, I, I think about this a lot. Because there are, you know I left Minnesota, I love Minnesota, but I, I knew that I was gonna leave Minnesota. At a, I mean at a really early age, I knew that, as much as I loved my people, and, and the Land of Lakes, I knew that I was gonna go someplace else. And I wonder, maybe it was the National Geographic magazines. Was it something that my parents instilled in me? Because there were a lot of people that I grew up with, who didn't leave, and who barely leave the Southside of Minneapolis. And, and I wonder how much of it was told to us overtly or was just the messaging. Because as young Black kids, getting ready to go out into a world that was not really fully ready accept us, our parents had to do some sort of jiu jitsu messaging around that, right, because they were trying to encourage us to be bold, to go out into the world, but at the same time, they were terrified about what would happen if we did."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"And so how do you, how do you give your kid wings, in that situation, and I think about that."
Michelle,"Well I, I think that's the miracle of our, our parents' generation of parenting, especially in minority, working class Black communities. So I remember my grandfather, right, my, his mother, was so afraid for him. You know, so that kept him locked down. That, that kept his aspirations small. Because there were real risks in trying to, to operate outside of what you knew. My mother, kind of understood, that that's what held her father back. And so, while she still carried those fears, that, that fear of trying, of moving beyond what you know, still exists in her generation. She was very, very clear and deliberate about not passing that fear onto us. Cause like you, I always saw a bigger place for myself. But that came not just from the messages from my dinner table, but it came from those moments of dreaming, of daydreaming, of sitting alone and quiet and thinking about myself, my stories, making things up in my head, right. It's that quiet time that gave me the space to think about the life I wanted to build for myself, even at five, and ten, and eleven, and twelve, right."
Interviewer,"We also were, kids in the nineteen seventies. And so our cultural diet, provided us images, and things that our, our parents didn't see. I mean, they didn't grow up watching television. Soul Train. Actually, you got to watch soul train."
Michelle,"Right, haha."
Interviewer,"I grew up in Minnesota, where we didn't have Soul Train."
Michelle,"You all didn't have Soul Train? What did you do on Saturday at eleven, from eleven to noon, girl?"
Interviewer,"No, we had, hahaha, and it's amazing, and it's amazing that so much amazing music has come out of."
Michelle,"Aw, I feel so bad."
Interviewer,I know I feel bad for me!
Michelle,"Really, you mean Prince didn't have access to Soul Train?"
Interviewer,"Yeah, he didn't have Soul Train!"
Michelle,Your city cousins!
Interviewer,"And then, and all his brothers one by one moved to Chicago. We would get to Chicago, and the, I was more excited about, more than Wimpy Burgers, and more than going downtown, more than, remember Wimpy Burgers?"
Michelle,"Yeah, I do!"
Interviewer,"More than Harold's fried chicken. More than anything, I wanted to be able to watch."
Michelle,"Watch Soul Train. Aw, man."
Interviewer,"Right, and good times, ain't we lucky to have them. As tough as things are."
Michelle,"Right, or you were George Jefferson, you know, moving on up. You know."
Interviewer,Or you were Julia.
Michelle,"Or you were, I loved Julia! Michele Norris"
Interviewer,The Michelle Obama podcast continues after the break.
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Um, the word essential."
Michelle,Oh yes. Yeah.
Interviewer,"You know, because we think, I think we will forever think about the word 'essential' in a different way. And, when we were told to stay home, they got up, got dressed, and went out into the world, risking their lives, to, drive garbage trucks, to work in warehouses, to work in grocery stores, to work in hospitals. Often doing invisible, but yes, essential work, and I struggle with it because I'm not sure, that, we treat them like they're essential."
Michelle,"And that's something that we need to, that's a part of that reflection, that we need to do. You know. With ourselves, and, and as a community. And we have to think about that, in terms of, how uh, wealth is distributed. You know, how, how these essential people are supported. And what does that mean? A lot of these people are, broke. They don't have health insurance. That it, if they were to get sick, as essential as they are, we have not, as a society, deemed it essential to make sure that they can go to the doctor and get the care that they need. And even if they can get COVID care, even if they can get tested, to keep working and doing our stuff, after the effects of the virus have worn off, and they are dealing with some lung issue, or some breathing issue, or asthma, that they don't have to wait, in a, an emergency room, for hours on end, and then worry, that they can even, afford the prescription medication that they need to survive, I mean we have to think about this. We have to think about the people who are not from this country, who are essential workers. A lot of those folks are still out in the fields picking our corn, and making sure that that food is in our grocery stores, and working in these meat packing plants, to ensure that the, that the cow that was slaughtered, gets into our bellies."
Interviewer,"In a safe, and efficient manner."
Michelle,In a safe and efficient way.
Interviewer,"Yeah. It's it's the us and them pandemic. It affected, those people, and hasn't really affected me."
Michelle,"So why should I have to, not get my haircut. You know. Why can't I go to a restaurant. Um. You know, everything is fine here. But, here we are, uh, watching this virus continue to spread, it has behaved in the way that all the scientists have predicted. That, staying at home, can only flatten the curve if we continue to remain vigilant, and it's not enough if one city does it, and the neighboring town doesn't, because the virus doesn't know boundaries, it doesn't know parts of the country. Or even parts of the world. So having one state enact, stay at home orders, while another state, is, uh, gradually reopening, while another state isn't, employing any precautions, uh, has led us to this stage where we don't know, when the virus will be curved."
Interviewer,The great pause needs to become the great recalibration.
Michelle,"We've seen these times in our history before, not just like this, but, but, but when things are good, it's easy to forget about that. To take it for granted. To start thinking, yeah, how much, do I really want my taxes going to that, and school lunches? Eh. You know, that's a lot of money. What does it matter, let's cut this, let's chop that. But, all of that came, all the things that we look to cut, were put in place in response to some crisis. That revealed to us, that hey there are a lot of hungry kids, at home, because their parents are poor, so what's the best way to feed them, we're gonna provide them with nutrition, at school. So, we, we have it, in our country's DNA to step up, but we can't forget."
Interviewer,But we shouldn't assume that we will.
Michelle,"We should, we cannot assume that we will. It took great leadership to rally the country, to, to setup regulations during the time of the Great Depression to make sure that banks wouldn't go under. I mean."
Interviewer,And with great opposition.
Michelle,"Always with great opposition, because you're asking people to sacrifice, to give up, things that, that they think they deserve. That they're entitled to. For the sake of the greater good."
Interviewer,"We are all going through a significant period of evolution, and it means, that there's an opportunity in that, it feels burdensome right now, because so much has been taken from us. But there's such an incredible opportunity, to decide how you want to show up in the new world. Because it will be a new world. And my greatest hope is that we don't reach for normal, that we reach for better."
Michelle,Oooh.  Snaps. Love that.
Interviewer,"Yeah. Don't reach for normal, reach for better."
Michelle,"Don't reach for normal, reach for better."
Interviewer,"In this moment, of tumult and uncertainty, a lot of people, are feeling the highs and the lows."
Michelle,"Mm hmm. They've been real for me, and, you know I don't think I'm unusual, in that, but, I'd be remiss to say that part of this depression, is also a result of, what we're seeing in terms of, the protests, the continued racial unrest, that has plagued this country, since its birth. I have to say, that waking up to the news, waking up to how this administration has or has not responded, waking up to, yet another, story of a Black man or a Black person somehow being dehumanized, or hurt or killed, or, falsely accused of something, it is exhausting. And, and it, it has led to a weight, that I haven't felt in my life, in, in a while."
Interviewer,"You know I spend a lot of my time thinking about race and identity and studying race and identity and that aspect of my work has been roiling. You know. And it, it started really with the pandemic and the racial disparities that were apparent almost immediately. In who was getting sick and who had access to testing, and then who was dying. But there is, there's been this period, where it's been a ratatatat. Of death, that just doesn't even make sense. The killing of Ahmaud Arbery. Immediately followed, by Breonna Taylor and then, the killing of George Floyd in, in a manner that just didn't, just doesn't, I mean, I'm trying to find the right words to describe how much it hurt to watch that video, and I made myself watch that video. You know literally squeezing the life out of someone. I feel like it's almost, it creates a certain sense of vertigo, I think for us because we were told it was supposed to be better."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"We believed that we had made progress. And we have. You are a manifestation of that. But on some level, our feet are still in the cement. On some level, this country still has not dealt with some very basic hard truths. About, who matters."
Michelle,"We knew it was there. Right. We, we saw it right. I think, for me I had hoped that those were just, the last vestiges of it, and maybe it is, cause we don't know what the future holds. But we've just been given just enough, to be lulled into thinking that maybe it's gone. But there were signs. You know, the, fact that we have prisons full of Black men."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"The fact that a kid, with a small possession of drugs can be sent to prison for most of his life. We, see it in the, continued economic disparity. We saw it in the fight for the Affordable Care Act. I mean, the, the notion that we live in a country where, uh, all people don't have access to quality healthcare, and yes, there are disparities for sure, we, we lived those disparities. I worked in a hospital, I saw our, emergency room filled with people, coming in, with preventable illnesses. Like asthma, and other diseases that with proper preventative care, they would be healthy, and living a, a great life. We, we saw it there, we saw it in, just how adamant um, Mitch McConnell was, to, and how he treated the first Black President. You know the reaction to it. On all sides. The, the the vast discomfort. With the notion that a Black man could be sitting in the highest level of office, we saw that, we saw the signs, we saw the, the nooses, we heard, the, you know, but we had also hoped that, well, there we some people who elected him. You know, there are some people who voted for that Black man, there, you know things have changed. So, there were signs. There were, there were signs. That still doesn't take away the, the hurt and the pain that comes with realizing, that the people that we, so many of the people we share this planet with, the people that we worked for, whose floors we've cleaned, whose fields of cotton we picked. Who we've tried to live next door to, and raise our children with. The people we serve on boards with, with and sit in classrooms and got degrees with, That they still don't see us as human. What does it take? How did we get here? How are we still here? And how are people OK with it? And that hurts."
Interviewer,"That was what was, so soul crushing. About the, video that showed the George Floyd death. Because, you know, it, he sat on him like a ranch hand sits on an animal, I mean it was, it was just, it was awful. It was beyond awful."
Michelle,"It takes you back to those pictures of folks standing around, lynched bodies in trees. Eating a hot dog, and, it's the same feeling, and I wonder, is that, the intent? Is that really the intent? Is that how, you know, our neighbors want us, want us to feel? And we, we talk about fear, right, you know, we talk about white women clutching their purses at the sight of us, or feeling uncomfortable when we walk in the store, but, I wonder, do you know how, how afraid, we are?"
Interviewer,How much fear we live with! All the time!
Michelle,"Every day? Because we know that there are white folks who see us as not human. And have been told stories about us, that are, not true. That have no bearing on who we are, as hardworking, decent citizens, to know, so, yeah that's gonna create some kind of feeling. When you, you have to look at some, your neighbor, and say is that what you think? Is is that how you see me, or my brother or, my my cousin, or my is that what you think of us? Is, is this where you want us to go, as a country? And I think we have to have those conversations. Among, not just among ourselves, but, with our neighbors and our colleagues, and I'm at a point in time where I need some clarity. About well, what do you mean? Now, what do you really mean? What do you really want, what is really your vision? For this country? That we all invested in, all of us. All of our blood sweat and tears, I know, my, my great great grandmother's, blood is in the soil of this country. I know, my grandfather and, those wore the uniform and fought in wars on behalf of this country. I, I know that I've tried to do my part, getting a good education, and serving as First Lady, and trying to do it with a level of dignity, and, uh representing every American. Um, sometimes at the expense of our own community who felt like we were a little bit too accommodating, to people who were not Black. We weren't Black enough. haha So you're saying we don't have a stake in this country? That, that we don't belong? Well, then whose country is this?"
Interviewer,"And I think that that people are, you know react in a way that's, that, that suggests that, they're tired. Of these old rules. I mean the, never in my life, would I have thought, that Minneapolis, the Southside of Minneapolis."
Michelle,That's your hometown.
Interviewer,"Ten blocks from where I grew up, and the corner of 38th and Chicago, that that would be the epicenter for a wave of protests that would sweep around the globe. That would lead to the removal of monuments and statues, and lead to a moment of reckoning, and recognition, almost said reconciliation, cause I don't think we're there, reconciliation."
Michelle,"No, we're not there yet."
Interviewer,"So reckoning and recognition in this country, um, of a number of things that we weren't clear about just a few weeks ago. I mean people now are, embracing the notion that Black lives matter. All kinds of people, it's on city streets. Not far away from here. It's on, sports uniforms, we weren't clear on that just a few weeks ago. You know the retort was, well, don't all lives matter? Now I think we've established that, the importance of saying Black lives matter. The importance of, talking about, racial equity, and, the disproportionate, distribution of opportunity and education and so many things. But I wonder how, if you think that that will last."
Michelle,"We, we don't."
Interviewer,"What do you need to do to make sure that it's not just a passing, moment."
Michelle,"Yeah, I don't know. I am uh, heartened, by, the depth, the sustained, vigor, the diversity, the peaceful nature of these protests. That is, that helps me sleep at night, that, that reminds me of the truth. You know, that, no matter how, I feel or what my lull is, that we are making progress. There is that truth. And Barack and I talk about it all the time, that, this is a generation that is not used to the way things were, because, we raised them differently. And we meaning, every, parent, Black, brown, white, rich, poor, we instilled in this generation a different sense of, fairness. And justice. Right. Because all these kids wouldn't be out, on the, in the streets, if they weren't hearing something, that made the sight of these killings or the knowledge of these killings, intolerable to them. Where they are taking to the streets, at the expense of their health in the middle of a pandemic. That is powerful, and that is a good thing, that show, that shows our growth. The sustainability piece, it's the next and most important question. Because uh, we are in a pandemic. And as we discussed earlier, this has put us in a position where we, we have time on our hands, where we can't, look away, where we can't go back to business as usual, where we can't go squirrel! Right, and, you know, there are no playoffs."
Interviewer,It's the next shiny object.
Michelle,"Exactly, what's the next shiny object? Um, we are forced to stare hard, and cold, and fast on the truth of where we are in this country. Uh, and we've had time to parse it, apart in our own souls, and to discuss it at our dinner tables, in a way that makes it hard to get back to business as usual."
Interviewer,"And we need to make sure that the energy, the incredible energy that you've seen on the streets, in so many places, and not just in big cities, in small towns, that that translates, to civic action."
Michelle,"Yes. The hardest work that you can do, is to confront the racism and equality in your own life. And that I think, my feeling is, a lot of people have hesitated, to have some of those hard conversations. And to reconcile the inconsistencies in their beliefs, and in some of the worlds they inhabit. It is hard, if you were sitting, at a board room, to notice, that everybody around that table is the same, and it's very hard to make the decision, to either add more, uh, chairs to that table, to diversify it, or to get up and get out of the seat, to let somebody else come in. That's a hard, that's harder than going to your basement and finding a piece of cardboard, and writing, uh, some kind words on a sign. That is harder to do."
Interviewer,'Cause you're giving up something.
Michelle,"Right. It is harder to, sit down, at the Thanksgiving table, and have some hard conversations with relatives and people that you love, who are misinformed."
Interviewer,I think we do. I'm an optimist.
Michelle,"Well as, I."
Interviewer,"I think we do. And I think, I'm a pragmatist also, I think we better."
Michelle,"I, we must. We must, I, I agree with you Michele, I, you know, I tend to think that, um, what my time serving as First Lady has shown me, is that this this, this is a a decent, kind, country. Um, that people are just trying to get by. They know what they know, um, they're willing to know more, they're willing to be open, but everybody is, working hard, everybody is strapped. You know, the, this, economic inequality isn't just hitting Black folks, right. There are a lot of working class folks in small towns, farmers, losing everything right now. Who are feeling uh, and have felt, for a very long time, a level of stress, that has, unbeknownst to them, it has nothing to do with race, and ethnicity, and it has everything to do with the capitalistic structure, it's all an economic issue. But when you're hurting, and you're afraid, and you are struggling too, and you see you know, you are told that others are advancing at your expense, and those others, are people of a different hue, you know, your fear takes over, because, you're in survival mode, too. And we've gotta find a way, all of us, to see that humanity, in each other, so that there aren't us's and them's, I think in the end, that's what we have to remember, I mean it's easy for us, as people of color, to demonize folks who are out there, protesting against Black lives matter. They're not right, in their positions, but their fears are coming from somewhere. Because folks aren't just crazy. You know, folks are out there trying to work and trying to keep it together, and when you can't do it, and when things feel stacked against you, as many of the people who are afraid are, then you lash out. So that's why in the end, we've got to have leadership in there, that's gonna look out for the best interest of all of us. We're so close, if we could just open up and empathize a bit, and spend more time trying to wonder where folks' anger comes from. And to put ourselves in those shoes, not just white folks in Black shoes, but visa versa, we can understand where the common challenges are. And we can start doing that work. To get us to a better place."
Interviewer,"When you feel the lows, how do you get through that? How do you keep moving forward?"
Michelle,"Yeah. Well, this is, the part of, of knowing yourself, knowing how to replenish yourself with the things that do bring you joy. So for me, my spirit is, is lifted, when I am feeling healthy, when I am surrounded by good people, you know, so I, I reach out. I reach out to my family, and to my friends, uh, even in this time, of, quarantine, you know, I fought to continue to find a way to stay connected to the people in my life who bring me joy, and my girlfriends, my husband, my, my kids, it's, it's, it's the small things. It's small, the small rituals. Right. For me, there's no magic to it, but it is, effort, right. Because you have to recognize that you're in a place, a bad place, in order to get out of it. Um, so you kinda have to sit in it for a minute, to know, oh oh, this is feel, I'm feeling off. So now I gotta, I gotta feed myself with something better. And sometimes for me that means turning it off. Right, it it means turning off the phone, not taking in the news, because it is negative energy, I learned that in the days of the White House, and, sometimes we feel like that's irresponsible, to just cut off, and I think it is, if you do it over long term, but for me, for my mental health, there's some times I cannot look. I need to just take a moment, and to just not look. For a second. hahaha."
Interviewer,"I try to be honest about it, with both my kids but especially my daughter, because, the strong Black woman trope, is, a cement necklace."
Michelle,"Oh god, yes."
Interviewer,"You know, that's supposed to feel like pearls. It's supposed to be a compliment, but what it is, is, it perpetuates the notion that we can throw anything at you. We can just hurl anything at you and you will catch it, and look elegant doing it. And that's just not true. And so, I try to be honest in my low moments, you know, this this has been a tough day, this has been a tough day."
Michelle,"We will get through this, uh, you know cause the thing we have to remember is like we've been through, tough times, in this nation. Um, and, we, we are in a unique moment in history. We are living through, something, that no one in our lifetimes has lived through it. Uh."
Interviewer,"2020 is, just extra. hahaha In all kinds of ways."
Michelle,"Who would've thought. It's like phew! What more do you have for us, 2020!"
Interviewer,"Barack knows the story when we were engaged, I got mad at him about something, and I took my engagement ring off, and I said, forget this, who needs this, and I threw the ring. We were in my car, I wasn't really throwing it out, I threw it where I would know it would go."
Michelle,"I didn't mean it, I wasn't like, this is it, I just, it was, it was a fast."
Interviewer,"You, you threw it strategically into a cup in the back seat, where you knew you could get it back."
Michelle,"Exactly, right, it's like, bloop!"
Interviewer,Hey how are you?
Michelle,"Good, how are you?"
Interviewer,"I'm doing great, I uh, I'm letting my hair grow."
Michelle,"It's, it's very cute."
Interviewer,Thank you.
Michelle,"You've got a lot of, lot of bang action going on there."
Interviewer,"Yeah I do, I do. It's going to get curly soon, and."
Michelle,That'll be good. Or do you blow it out? Is that a blow out you've got going on?
Interviewer,"I have a whole team, I have a whole team."
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"Did you always know that you wanted to get married? Because, you know, not only is there misinformation, but I know from our generation, our parents just didn't talk about their marriage, it was just sort of, no one, it was like they just sort of woke up, and you didn't think about your parents or your grandparents in the context of their marriage, it just was."
Michelle,"There's no advice, there's no training, for it, yet it's one of the hardest things you'll ever do."
Interviewer,"You know it's amazing you brought up the generation thing, because I think that is key. There is a generational gap, I grew up very Irish catholic, in a very religious household, nothing about this was ever discussed, and I remember, when I was about, 15, up til that point, the only information I had was from my friend, Jake Fleisher, haha, who explained it to me in the driveway, and explained it to me in a very confusing way which made no sense, and my parents, never ever, ever, ever talked about sex in any way, it didn't exist, the six of us, we just showed up."
Michelle,Showed up!
Interviewer,"Don't talk about it, there's no talking about emotions, there's no talking about feelings No! You don't talk about anything, so, it's kind of a miracle, I think, it is, I hope, somewhat easier for young people today."
Michelle,"I mean, I know for me, and for a lot of women, we're socialized as young girls, to think about, and I don't think it's thinking about marriage. I think it's thinking about, the wedding. You, envision, the dress, the music, the, storybook, of marriage. But I always knew, that I was going to be married. I always knew that that's something that I wanted, um. And I came to learn, as I grew up, that not everybody, came with that perspective. When Barack and I started dating, we went back and forth about the importance or the value or the necessity of marriage, and."
Interviewer,"Mm hmmm, Mm hmm."
Michelle,"And, some of that probably came from how he was raised, the fact that, you know, his grandparents sort of had always stayed married but had a rocky marriage, his mom, was divorced. You know, he had a different view, whereas I came from as he called it, The Black leave it to beaver scenario."
Interviewer,"<laughs> Are they ever going to make that show, by the way?"
Michelle,"Yeah, I know, it's uh, we're working on it."
Interviewer,Good good.
Michelle,"But he always joked it's like you guys have this sort of perfect, the mom, and the dad, uh, so, he had a different view, about marriage. And I, I never knew whether that was because of how he was raised, was that because of his gender."
Interviewer,"Yeah, it's interesting, because, I can sum up, the difference between how it's built up for women and how it's built up for men in one story, which is when I uh, when my wife and I got engaged, we went to a jeweler, to start looking at her wedding ring. And we talked to this nice woman in Manhattan, for about two hours, about her ring. And, what her wedding band could look like, and how it could match the engagement ring I had got her, and how it would, and I swear it was two hours of talking about this ring. Then at the very end of the conversation, I said to the woman, I said, so, I'm supposed to get a ring too, right? What about my ring? And she went, oh yeah, that."
Michelle,"Laughs, right."
Interviewer,"She reached behind, and this is a very high end place in Manhattan. She reached behind her desk and took out a coffee can, and turned it over, and 45 or 50 rings that all looked kinda the same just went clattering out, and they looked like pieces of a washing machine, and she was like, just take one of those like, screw you, buddy, this is like, it's not about you it's about her."
Michelle,"Right, and it's like why are you even here?"
Interviewer,"Yeah, why are you here? We don't need you?"
Michelle,"Just, sit in the corner, let me give you some champagne, you know, drink up, just shush."
Interviewer,"I think, for men, and this is me, I can't speak for all men. But my sense is that we have to come to it a little later. It, you know, I've always thought, my wife, Liza, is the perfect person for me, but I also had to meet her at the perfect time. I was ready for the moment."
Michelle,You were open.
Interviewer,"I was open to it, and I was ready to meet her, and then the almighty, stage, gave her the stage direction, to like, walk through the scene, and we're, it's everything's right."
Michelle,"The same is true for me, and I, I think, a man's inclination to wait and to kind of go out there and search and get himself ready, I think is a good instinct that more young women should think about. Because who, you have to know who you are, to know who you're looking for. And I always thought, you know, if we approached a marriage and family like we approached, particularly, men, like you would, picking your basketball team."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"We'd have better marriages, because if you're looking at a team, the people you want to win with, then number one you want everybody on your team to be strong, right."
Interviewer,Yep.
Michelle,"You don't want any weak links, you don't want somebody that you can dominate, you don't want somebody who's kind of a loser, right. And also, if you're on a team, you've got to be able to do everything, especially in basketball, it's like, you would never pick somebody that says, I only dribble. You know."
Interviewer,"Right, right right."
Michelle,"I don't, I don't shoot, uh, I don't defend, I just dribble. You know, if we looked at marriage as a real team, you want your teammate to be a winner, then you want LeBron, you know."
Interviewer,"Yeah, exactly."
Michelle,"You don't want the guy, third row on the bench, who didn't make the team, but we often don't think about, that."
Interviewer,"Now you've got me thinking about marrying LeBron, and this i uh, this is, this is taking a turn."
Michelle,"You have, what you're supposed to say, is, I have married LeBron, My version of LeBron."
Interviewer,"Yeah. My wife, Liza is LeBron James, she's, uh."
Michelle,"She is the LeBron James, in your life."
Interviewer,"Yes. Yeah, she is."
Michelle,That's the equivalent.
Interviewer,"I, part of my job is to go out and shoot remote pieces. And so, way back in, late 1999, I had to shoot a remote, at a top uh, advertising agency, and I'm just supposed to go into this room and be a wise guy."
Michelle,Well that's unusual.
Interviewer,"Yeah, exactly. And I walk in to this room, and I'm bringing this up because people can google, 'Conan meets his wife', 'Conan meets Liza', because, cameras are rolling and I walk into this room, of eleven people."
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"This is, what, what is it? And then I left the room after this twenty minute conversation with only her, and I said, well, I think that went pretty well, and they're like we got nothing we can use, and then I, and then I said, um, we should probably get everybody's like, name and number. And my head writer, Mike Sweeney, said, it's that, it's that blonde woman, isn't it?! And I went, No no no! No! And he said, Why would we need their information?, and I went, For editing?"
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"He was like, Editing, what are you talking about? So then, we were ing down the equipment, and she walks out, and we start talking some more, and then we end up talking in the lobby. And, she said everything a woman is not supposed to say, leading off with, yeah I saw my uh, my gynecologist recently, and my gynecologist said I need to start having children within the next two to three years if I really want them to be healthy. And me, rather than being panicked, I'm thinking, yes, you should have children, your children should be my children!"
Michelle,"You, you said something that rang true for me, about Liza, and it's like, she wasn't a game player. And, I found that to be, one of the things that stood out, for me with Barack, as well. Once we started talking and became friends, he was very clear, just like you, it's like, I want to date you. At least in my experience up until then, men would be coy, they would, you know, sort of look around the room, it was all so, complicated, and it felt, a little immature.What struck me about Barack was his, lack of pretense, I mean, he was, he was somebody who knew what he wanted, and wasn't afraid to say it. And, I thought, well, if he's that in tune with his emotions that he can say out lout to somebody that doesn't know, he didn't know whether I liked him back. He was like, look, let me tell you, this is what I think about you I think you're special, I think you're different, and I would like to take you out. And that was rare. And it was attractive."
Interviewer,"I think, one of the things, that, that you hit on, um, I never know how to refer to your husband, so I just."
Michelle,"Barack, what's his name."
Interviewer,"What's his name, yeah. Cause I feel like I can't say Barack, but uh, hahaha It just feels weird to me, but uh, but when you met that guy, uh, you're in a situation where, yes, initially it's going to be really nice, let's walk, let's get an ice cream, let's go, to this really nice restaurant in Chicago. And so, everything is, who doesn't have a good time, when they go to a nice restaurant."
Michelle,That's right.
Interviewer,"Who doesn't have a good time when they've had two glasses of wine, for me, 6 to 8, hahaha I have a tolerance, but anyway, you know, that's all the easy stuff. You know when you think about it, it's the same thing with the wedding, it's one day, it's all about you, uh, there is a band, uh, everyone's giving you microwave ovens, and you're thinking this is great, It's one day, none of that tells you anything."
Michelle,"Mm mm. This whole notion of love at first sight, I, I believe in infatuation, at first sight, I believe in attraction at first sight. But, marriage is intended to be long, it's full of ups and downs and highs and lows, this is the person you're going through life with. So it's going to take you a minute to see this person in an array of situations."
Interviewer,"Yes, yeah."
Michelle,"To see yourself with this person in an array of situations, it's like, you wanna, you wanna see them when they're down, you wanna see them when they're angry, you wanna see how they treat their mother. And it takes time, um, to get to know that about somebody."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"And then I'm going to see where that goes, and if it doesn't go anywhere, then, OK, we'll up. Because that's what dating is. You can't Tindr your way into a long."
Interviewer,"You know they've done, uh, I think they've done studies, the chemical that gets released in your brain when you're swiping left or swiping right, on dating apps, is the same chemical that gets released when you're pulling the lever of a slot machine, in Las Vegas. You know, everyone's been to Vegas or walked through a Vegas showroom and seen all those people, just sitting there, pulling the slot machine handle over and over and over again. And the thing I always noticed about them is their expression is joyless. It's these, old ladies, and they've got a giant bucket of coins."
Michelle,Hey that's my mom.
Interviewer,"Ok, well, haha That's what this really is, it's an intervention, this is an intervention."
Michelle,Marian.
Interviewer,"For your mom, Marian, get in here, uh, I've talked to your mom, and I tried to bring this up, and I was escorted away by your security."
Michelle,"So, we did this whole podcast, just to, hahaha."
Interviewer,"Yeah, this whole podcast is, just, to get to Marian haha."
Michelle,"36, 37, years for you, Conan, whoa."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, it took a long yeah."
Michelle,"You're so loner, no I'm just kidding."
Interviewer,hahaha You didn't know I was that old!
Michelle,"It's like, whoa!"
Interviewer,"I'm 88 years old. I've just had a lot of work done. Um, but no, I, I got to the point, where I realized that, I could do more teamed up with this person than I could ever do alone, and that was exciting to me, and I cannot conceive of having that notion when I was 25. It took me, I've always been a late bloomer, it took me a while to get there, but I'm really glad, I didn't try it before I was ready."
Michelle,"Even once we do that, right, and you and I did it, right, having the right partner, at least what I found, was wonderful, those beginning years were heavenly, because we were two independent people. Um, you know, I had my job and career, he had his job and career, he'd travel, do his thing, then we'd come together, and date nights, and, you know, wonderful weekends together. Travel wasn't an issue, because it was actually nice for him to be away, for us to be away, and then come back together. But then for me, all that seemed to change, sort of the first, the first tough years came, uh, with kids. Um."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,"You know, and because I had infertility issues, I was ready, I wanted kids. I worked hard for them, we both did, we were mature, we had, I think we'd been married for, four or five years, so we'd had, a wonderful amount of time together, which was helpful."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,But even with all of that.
Interviewer,Yeah!
Michelle,"When these little people arrive, and the whole process of pregnancy, conception, delivery, and then they're there. That can suck the life out of all of that hard work, and all that wisdom, because it's hard to get ready, for the wonderful joyfulness that is having your children."
Interviewer,"Yes, yes."
Michelle,"Um, because they are amazing and I would not trade them in, but whew, they can mess up a marriage haha."
Interviewer,"I have this analogy for this, which is, I read years ago, that, I was reading an article, and it said, that, the BMW car company has, the best standards because what they do is they have this, they have this giant claw, that takes like one out of 20 BMWs, or 30 or 50 or 100. It comes down and it picks it up off the line. And it shakes the BMW really hard, for, two minutes. And if there's a flaw in the BMW somewhere, like a screw that's a little loose, or a ball bearing that's not quite there, or, there's a little problem with the axle, it'll come flying off. And, I read that article and I said, this is what having a child is."
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"What a child does, it's a giant claw that comes down, and it picks up your marriage, and it shakes it, really hard, for two minutes, and it shakes it as hard as you can imagine, and guess what, if there is a problem."
Michelle,Mmm hmm.
Interviewer,"If there is a loose screw, if there is, if there is a little bit of a thing, it is going to come flying out."
Michelle,"I love that, yeah."
Interviewer,"But it's absolutely true, that I thought, that women had babies and it was miraculous, and they just knew what to do, and my wife gave me the look that I was sort of looking at her, and wife looked at me like, What do we do with this, what do we do now? and I thought."
Michelle,Don't you know?
Interviewer,"I thought you would just magically know, and I would go back to work, and then I'd come home, and there'd be like, all these stews cooking, and, a fire in the fireplace, and you'd hand me a martini, and the baby would be, would have a little pink bow around it. No, it was uh, it was everything. It was my wife, went through a period of depression, she had a lot of anxiety about the child. She had a lot of trouble breastfeeding initially, and my wife is the most commonsense person in the world. And she was having a lot of trouble breastfeeding, and one day, when I was out of the house, she heard through a friend, Oh these women are really great, you gotta use these women they know what to do, uh, they're kinda old school. It turned out that they were part of some witch coven."
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"They came over, and they're witches like in the modern sense, not in a negative way, I mean they're not wearing black hats and running around on brooms, they're, they look sort of, um, like hippies. haha And, I came home to my apartment."
Michelle,"As lo, As long as they are calling themselves witches."
Interviewer,"OK, I'm pretty sure they were calling themselves witches, and this is all on me, if I'm wrong, but I'm sure, but I came home, and these women were surrounding my wife, and they had put cabbage leaves on her breasts. So my wife looked like, she looked like a salad bar."
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"And so my wife is covered in cabbage leaves, she's miserable, and I thought, what is going, how did this, happen? Why is it this hard? Eventually, we went to a dermatologist, who said yes, use this, salve."
Michelle,"Hot heating pad, and the salve."
Interviewer,"Yeah, exactly, exactly, and then, no problem off to the races, but, the point is, she was panicked, I was panicked because she was panicked."
Michelle,"Well this is just, an example, of how, disruptive, uh, these cute little creatures."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"But the division of labor, in a marriage, also becomes real clear when a child comes, because, if, if your wife is breastfeeding, if she has a career, she's going to have to make a different set of sacrifices than you do. Um, just the act of giving birth creates an inequality in opportunities, you know, not to complain about it, but the truth is, especially, and if you've had a troubled pregnancy, we're not even talking about if you had a C-section, or if you were put in the, or if you were hospitalized, or if you were, you know, and you're trying to keep your career going, and you're trying to, you know, maintain your autonomy, and physically. The whole structure means that, you know, he's got sort of a leg up because he didn't have to do any of this."
Interviewer,"Yep, yep."
Michelle,"Um, you know, that, at least in my marriage, that was the first time, I felt the sting, of gender roles, and I had to be there, and I had to go, and it was my body, and my husband was still sort of boppin around, living his life, then you start to sort of, the resentment starts to build up, or it started to, it's like well, what happened to the unit, what happened to my best friend? What happened to my buddy, who's, at the gym? It's like, how the hell are you at the gym? You know, dude, I, I'm, you know, I've got cabbage on my breast, and you know."
Interviewer,haha.
Michelle,"I find that a lot of young couples that we know, around this early childhood stage, when they're kind of dealing with these stresses, and dealing with the first time that they have to share roles, really truly share roles, you know, when kids are babies, when they're young, it's not the time, to start grading your marriage paper."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"You know, because, these are unique times. And, but a lot of times young couples, they hit these hard periods, and because they're short tempered or they're tired, you, you you know, sex life is gone the romance is out of the picture."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"Um, they give up. Because nobody told them that this time is hard. You've got to know, that there are going to be times, long periods of time, when you can't stand each other. You know, and I say it, and I said it, you know, on the book tour, as a joke. There were times that I wanted to push Barack out of the window, right. And I say that, because it's like you've got to know the feelings will be intense. But that doesn't mean you quit. And these periods can last a long time."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,"They can last years. But we don't talk about that, so young couples, they face these challenges, and they're ready to give up because they think they're broken. And, I just want to say, look, if that s a marriage, then Barack and I have been broken off and on, throughout our marriage, but we have a very strong marriage. And if I had given up on it, if I had walked away from it, in those tough times, then I would've missed all the beauty, that was there as well. Conan O'Brien"
Interviewer,"And, I early on, decided, I don't want to resent my wife, and I don't want her to resent me. So, we have this pact, almost, that if I'm, I can make a lot of jokes, sort of passive aggressive jokes, and she's really good at saying, Ok, you've made that joke three times now, are you really? You really don't like the way I make the broccoli? And then I'll, you know, let's have it out."
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"And we have it out. And we've had fights, and we've had fights where we're both emotional, and then afterwards, when the storm clears, we're better than we were before. And, so I'm on a mission in my marriage, to fight resentment."
Michelle,"That goes back to why it's important to have a whole person, to have two whole people in the marriage, right."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"Because, in order to have that out, to have that communication, both people have to have a voice, and they have to know themselves well enough. A lot of women aren't taught that. Um, in fact, we're taught the opposite when it comes to our marriage, our relationships. Don't tell them the truth, don't let them see you get angry, don't sound like a nag, you know."
Interviewer,Mmm hmmm.
Michelle,"You know, and all of those are just code words, for, keep it in, right."
Interviewer,"You were also, you were in a position, you have this very real, healthy, but real relationship with your husband, and then you had that put under the biggest microscope in the world."
Michelle,"Well, it's it, it goes back to the BMW example with children. You know, a presidency, is like taking that little shaking period and doubling the intensity of the shake, hahaha."
Interviewer,Yeah!
Michelle,"And the time of the shake, it's the same thing, I mean if you go into a presidency or a public life, and your marriage isn't solid, right, that experience will shake it, and anything loose will fly off. Um, and the presidency is, you know, you magnify that because it's, as, the First Lady, I am married to, the Commander in Chief. Ok. Now that right there, just like, OK. Who says. Um."
Interviewer,"I've had the experience of, you know, doing a week of shows at the Chicago theater and I walk out every night and there's lines around the block, and people are screaming, in the audience, you're doing a tour, and you get this kind of, rock star reception, and then walking into a room with my wife, and she's not having any of it. And, I find it to be life saving. I find it to actually be, the fact that, that, your husband has this relationship with you, and with your daughters, where you guys are not saluting him."
Michelle,Absolutely.
Interviewer,"You guys are not, you know, none of that's happening. In fact the opposite."
Michelle,"The opposite is happening, right."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, You're trying to push him out a window occasionally. And he."
Michelle,"Right, he, he is the butt of every joke at the table, I mean."
Interviewer,"Yes, yeah, as am I."
Michelle,"I mean, poor guy."
Interviewer,"As am I, and so, you know my point is that I have found, that one of the things that you get from a marriage, that's magical, is gravity."
Michelle,"Mmm, well said."
Interviewer,"Because, gravity is this incredible, gift to us, yeah, it causes our back to ache, yes, it causes all these problems. But gravity is the gift, you want gravity, and I get gravity from my wife, and I get gravity from my kids, because, I could go out in front of an audience and have an amazing transcendent experience, where people are bowing to me and saying that was so, and not that this has ever happened, but, like, wow, a great experience, and then I can walk into this room, and these people, are my gravity. They're saying, no, we know you, we've seen you be, really unfunny, at the fast table."
Michelle,"Right, hahaha."
Interviewer,hahaha.
Michelle,"We talked about how important it is to know enough about yourself, to have a voice, to be able to communicate, and make sure, that resentments aren't building up, but sometimes they do, haha."
Interviewer,Really?! Really!
Michelle,"In a marriage, some times."
Interviewer,Not my marriage! Not one argument! Not one. Ever!
Michelle,"This is where we're gonna, you know, I've already written about, our, our, our lawyerly way of arguing, you know, because we each, are, you know, we know how to win an argument, and sometimes, I, we can feel ourselves, just, lawyering ourselves to death."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"And, we both like to win. I know that we've had to learn how to argue differently. Because I, I hit fast and hard, and then I forget, it's like, oh, did that cut you deeply? I, I oh, yeah. I remember, Barack knows the story when we were engaged, I got mad at him about something, and I took my engagement ring off, and I said, forget this, who needs this, and I threw the ring. We were in my car, I wasn't really throwing it out, I threw it where I would know it would go, Conan O'Brien"
Interviewer,"You, you threw it strategically into a cup in the back seat, where you knew you could get it back."
Michelle,"Exactly, right, it's like, bloop! You know, it was on the floor, I knew where it was going, but, you know, whenever he gets the chance to relive that, as an example of, you know, how, where how fast and quickly I can go there, um, he does, so, he remembers it and I don't, right."
Interviewer,"Mm hmm, mm hmm."
Michelle,"So I had to learn, that he feels things, much more um, deeply, uh, for over a longer period of time, he remembers the exact words used, the context that they were in, and I'm like wow, was I really, I don't even remember being mad! So I had to learn, how not to go there, you know, you have to learn how to communicate in a way that the other person is actually going to hear it, not just, in a way that's going to ease you of your feelings, um."
Interviewer,"Yes, Yes , yeah."
Michelle,How have you guys figured this out?
Interviewer,"Well, you know, I think I grew up with this idea, that if something is bothering you, or if someone's offended you, you're supposed to martyr yourself. You're supposed to literally, my mother, used to say, I mean she would tell me about working at this prestigious law firm in the early 1960's, the men all got to go into the lunchroom."
Michelle,Mmm.
Interviewer,"And she, they set up a little card table for her outside, because a woman, couldn't go into the, lunchroom, it, it, I mean, it wouldn't ever even happen today. But at the time, I said to my mom, were you angry, and she said well, no, I just offered it up. And I said, offered it up? You know, what is, offer, and and she, when were were growing up would say, I just offer it up, to the suffering souls in purgatory. Which means, if something happens to you, you don't process it, you just hand it over to a higher power, and you keep marching. And I thought, that just doesn't work."
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"It doesn't work, like, if my wife, if I do something and it pisses off Liza, if I told her, look, just offer it up, to the suffering souls in purgatory."
Michelle,"Right, hahaha."
Interviewer,"And go about your way and let's hear no more of it, I would be, she would stab me, with whatever is in the room. It wouldn't even have to be sharp, she could stab me with."
Michelle,How's this for offering it up? Right in the jugular.
Interviewer,"Yeah, exactly, I'll offer this up, uh, and uh, and and it's the same thing, I have found, it doesn't work for her, because it also doesn't work for me. And so, arguments, are, it took me a long time to realize, that if someone's screaming at me, it's because they're scared."
Michelle,Mmm hmmm.
Interviewer,"That, a lot of times, in life, when someone is really losing their temper at your, it's because they're terrified. And so, you need to address the fear that they have."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"So I can understand where that frustration, where that anger, where that joy is coming from. And then, speak to that."
Interviewer,"You know, one of the things, it makes me think about, is that, when you're in a marriage, you do not, have the luxury, of making the person an other. You just don't have that luxury, because, you have to make this work. Um, yeah, there's the nuclear option of, I'm out, let's get a lawyer, but for."
Michelle,And a lot of people do that.
Interviewer,"And a lot of people do that, but, for the most part, even people that have gone through a divorce, have to, still see that other person as a person, and, we've all had, really good friends, that have done really stupid things. And we've stuck with them, because they're our friends, and because that's a human being to us, whereas if we were just hearing about them, on MSNBC or FoxNews, we could dismiss them, if we wanted to. And I think its just, about being really close to someone and you don't have that luxury, you don't have the luxury, of, you have to work it out. You just have to."
Michelle,"Yeah. One of the reasons why I'm having these conversations about the importance of relationship in defining ourselves, is that, the core of who we are, is built up of, of all these pieces, um, our relationship with ourself, our relationship with our family, our siblings, our spouses, our peers, our coworkers."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"Um, all of that, uh, contextualizes us. And, gives us substance. But we don't take time to explore that, to understand it, you know, to understand how it impacts us."
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"You observe and understand, and then interpret, in a funny way, what is going on in the world around us. Um. And we, we just can't take that for granted, that work has to be done, um. I want to thank you Conan, for your, your insights."
Interviewer,"Oh my god, this was a, yeah, well I, I, yeah, pick and choose the ones you like, and throw away the rest, but uh thank you. Thanks for having me."
Michelle,"I had so much fun with Conan. Hopefully you did, too. For those of you who are married, maybe you heard something that rang true. And for those of you who aren't, I hope that conversation gave you a sense of what marriage might actually feel like. Or what you might want to be looking for in a partner. But no matter what, I hope this conversation gave you a chance to listen, not to me and Conan... but to yourself. To that little voice that tells you if there's something you want to work on, or work through-with yourself or with your partner. Those realizations open you up to journeys that aren't always easy but they are always, always worth it. So with that, I just want to thank you for joining me, Conan, and thank you all for joining me for this part of our journey together. I will talk to you again very soon. Take care."
Interviewer,What is it about Chicago?
Michelle,I've traveled all over the world. And Chicago still by far is one of the most beautiful cities.
Interviewer,Uh oh.
Michelle,And we'll get in my neighborhood.
Interviewer,So this is the house.
Michelle,This is my house.
Interviewer,Wow.
Michelle,"And that was that's where we lived, upstairs. The Robbie and Terry lived downstairs. That was my bedroom. So you see the four windows? I walk in there and I think, My God, how four people."
Interviewer,"Well, what."
Michelle,"Lived a full life in that little, bitty space, up there. Yes, yeah. Up until recently this little apartment was sort of our inheritance. So any time anybody hit on hard times, we'd just move back up there. You know?"
Interviewer,"Nice to meet you, Mr. Reed."
Michelle,How's everything going in the neighborhood?
Interviewer,Going well. How's Miss Robinson?
Michelle,"She's good yeah, yeah, I'll tell her that we saw you."
Interviewer,"See this is what you're talking about, it's a small town."
Michelle,"It was one of those kind of moments where it was, like, Pssh, you're not like us. And it was because of my speech. At this point the viewers who are watching this, there're a lot of people nodding because when you grew up in the neighborhood, you know, you could get your butt kicked goin' to school if you looked too uppity or if you were studying too hard. So I had to grow up learning these two languages of how do I fit in with my family and my community and still excel? This wouldn't be the first time that my identity would be challenged. You know, where people couldn't figure out who I was with how I talked and what they who they thought I should be."
Interviewer,"they weren't there to prevent you from falling, but to pick you up when you did."
Michelle,"Yeah. You could speak your mind, but you had to be respectful, you know? And if you got outta hand, you got a look. You'd get a spanking. They weren't free wheelin' parents. They were still black parents. But they believed in teaching us to think for ourselves."
Interviewer,"You write about foolin' around with your boyfriend. Oh, and smokin'."
Michelle,Which which one?
Interviewer,"Oh, well, we'll talk about."
Michelle,"Oh, high school boyfriend."
Interviewer,"Yeah, the high school boyfriend. And you even write about smokin' pot. Now, you didn't go into great detail, but you did you could've left that out. So why'd you talk about that?"
Michelle,It was the first time I had been in a predominantly white situation. So I had to learn how to adjust in this new world of wealth and privilege and kids that I didn't realize had come from prep schools that had prepared them. And I didn't even know the language of that college. What was a syllabus? Never heard of it.
Interviewer,You really blazed a path for others. We went back to Princeton. We spoke with grads recent grads and people.
Michelle,You did?
Interviewer,"Yeah, and people that are and young women who are still in school at Princeton. And they spoke about the example that you set for them, I want you to hear it."
Michelle,Oh.
Interviewer,This is.
Michelle,Robin. (watching video of Princeton students).
Interviewer,"Yeah, these these are your."
Michelle,Oh my gosh.
Interviewer,"It's just incredible walking the paths of Princeton, knowing that Michelle Obama was one here."
Michelle,Oh my gosh.
Interviewer,"Knowing that Michelle Obama came from, like, a working class family. Like, Michelle Obama's parents didn't, like, come here and she still came, thrived, found her place. And had a productive experience at a school like this, it inspired me. And it's just one of the reasons why I applied to this school."
Michelle,"They're standing where I was. Oh, of course, you did that."
Interviewer,"She's inspiring us today. And the current students are Princeton, the people applying to Princeton and just every little girl in America today, I don't think she even knows. Thank you just from the bottom of my heart. I can't thank you enough. And I hope to one day be able to convey that in person. But thank you."
Michelle,Oh my goodness.
Interviewer,"I know, I know. I didn't, we did feel bad at that point because she thought she thought it was, like, one of those."
Michelle,"With, like, the cameras."
Interviewer,TV shows.
Michelle,"And it's, like."
Interviewer,And a TV show.
Michelle,"And it's, like, she's gonna come out from the."
Interviewer,"How does that make you feel when you see these young women who said that, because of you, they're there?"
Michelle,"Yeah, it's yeah. So what'd you do that for, Robin? It feels, you know, I'm glad. I'm glad that they."
Interviewer,You proud?
Michelle,Yeah. I am. I am.
Interviewer,You talked about lust for your man. That's not something you expect to hear or read from a first lady.
Michelle,Who?
Interviewer,You're at this law firm.
Michelle,Got it all together.
Interviewer,You got it all together.
Michelle,I had made a declaration that I was off men. I was focusing on my career. I had my checklist. I was.
Interviewer,You were.
Michelle,Getting' it down.
Interviewer,"Locked, focused."
Michelle,Was focused.
Interviewer,he's still a law student.
Michelle,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,at Harvard.
Michelle,Right. A first year.
Interviewer,"First year. You're gonna be his mentor. He comes blowing into town, a little bit famous already. Late for the first meeting."
Michelle,"Late. Late. I was, like, Is he trifling?"" This the black man's gonna be late on the first day? I was."
Interviewer,You you weren't overly impressed in the beginning?
Michelle,"I I wasn't, you know? I have my suspicions when a bunch of white folks fawn on over a black man 'cause I sorta think, Okay, he can talk straight so they think he's wonderful. So so that was my theory. And then his name was Barack Obama. He was from Hawaii. I thought, What, you know? So I didn't really know what to expect. And then in walks Barack Obama. And Barack Obama has always walked like Barack Obama. Like, he's got all the time in the world. He's he had that stride. I was, like, Dude, you're cute. But in my mind, I was, like."
Interviewer,Not interested?
Michelle,"Off limits. Not even not interested. I'm not gonna date the one of the few black summer associates. Robin, how tacky, you know?"
Interviewer,"You realize there's a plaque there, right?"
Michelle,I know. The kids are highly embarrassed that there's a plaque about their parents' first kiss.
Interviewer,There're many things in reading that your book that I don't think I would ever imagine hearing from a first lady. Lust. You talked about lust for your man.
Michelle,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,That's not something you expect to hear or read from a first lady.
Michelle,But it's there. I don't know what to tell you. It was it was there. It still is. I love my husband a lot.
Interviewer,You write about at one point in your marriage that you and Barack went to marriage counseling. Why did you think it was important to share that?
Michelle,"And marriage counseling for us was one of those ways where we learned how to talk out our differences. What I learned about myself was that my happiness was up to me. And I started working out more. I started asking for help, not just from him, but from other people. I stopped feeling guilty. I know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them. And I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage. And we get help with our marriage when we need it."
Interviewer,"As much as you love your husband and gave him your blessing to run for president, you didn't think he would win."
Michelle,Oh yeah.
Interviewer,Not that he shouldn't win.
Michelle,Um hm.
Interviewer,"And you saw Time Magazine. And I think it was, like, October, 2006. And on the cover it says, Could Barack Obama be the next president? And you looked away."
Michelle,Um hm.
Interviewer,You didn't even wanna see that. Why?
Michelle,"I think I did what a lot of black folks were doin'. We were afraid to hope because it's hard to believe that the country that oppressed you could one day be led by you, you know? I mean, my grandparents, you know, lived through segregation. My grandfather his grandfather was a slave, you know? So this these memories were real. And they didn't think the country was ready. And so my attitude was a reflection of that skepticism."
Interviewer,"Ten years ago we were sitting down in Norfolk, Virginia. This is pre-White House. And I want you to take a look and tell me what you see about this version of yourself."
Michelle,Wow.
Interviewer,What do you wish you could tell your pre White House self?
Michelle,"Whew. You know the hard parts were the things that I expected. That it was gonna be hard, you know? So much of this country lives in isolation and we just don't know each other. And so there were people who didn't know what a black woman was and sounded like. And so I knew that I'd have to earn my grace."
Interviewer,"I remember talking to you during the campaign about the criticism. And you said you didn't really pay attention to it. In the book, you admit it. You said, This stuff hurt."
Michelle,"Yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,This stuff hurt.
Michelle,"I don't think we do each other a service by pretending like hurtful things don't hurt. And that's what I've come I came to after that experience. I need to own that hurt. I need to talk about it. I need to put it out there for myself so that I can heal from it. But at the time, oh gosh, you know? I wasn't gonna allow myself to feel victimized from it because there was no time to hurt in that role."
Interviewer,Is the current first lady how do you think she is doing in defining who she is?
Michelle,"You know, one of the things you learn as a former, it's, like, I don't judge, what a current is doin', you know? So I'd prefer not to, you know, speak on what she's doing versus what I did because I think every first lady approaches this job differently."
Interviewer,"I know that Laura Bush reached out to you and said, If you need any help, I'm a phone call away. You wrote about how and have talked about how you extended that same courtesy to Melania Trump. Has she reached out they and asked-."
Michelle,No.
Interviewer,For any help?
Michelle,"No, she hasn't."
Interviewer,"What you haven't said before, you said, I will always wonder about what led so many, women in particular, to reject an exceptionally qualified female candidate and instead choose a misogynist as their president. Some powerful words."
Michelle,"I implored people to focus and to think about what it takes to be commander in chief. It's amazing to me that we still have to tell people about the importance of voting. You know, that almost every two years, we're having this conversation to get people to the polls. And in the end, that's how our democracy works. People have to be educated, they have to be focused on the issues and they have to go to the polls if they want their politics to reflect their values."
Interviewer,"People want to hear more from you about what's currently going on. And there is a fine line that you and your husband, as previous administrations have done, is that you have to step, step back and let the current one do what it's doing. But I think it's safe to say that during your husband's presidency, it was no drama Obama. No drama Obama. So what goes through your mind when you read and hear all that's going on right now with this administration?"
Michelle,"I said what I continue to say. Being the commander in chief is a hard job. And you need to have discipline and you need to read and you need to be knowledgeable. You need to know history, you need to be careful with your words. But voters make those decisions. And once the voters have spoken, you know, we live with what we live with."
Interviewer,"There're some people that feel that the seed of discontent that led to Donald Trump being elected president, that the seed of that discontent happened during your husband's presidency."
Michelle,"I would like to indulge the question, but it requires a level of speculation about how people are feeling and thinking that I don't have. And I think we're gonna have to figure that out as a nation."
Interviewer,"How is Chicago, and in particularly your neighborhood how is it the same, when you were growing up, and how is it different?"
Michelle,"You know when we moved in, it was a coveted neighborhood. But from time I was young until the time I was high school. It became a neighborhood that you didn't wanna live in."
Interviewer,Wow. Just that time.
Michelle,"And that, you know, and that's the story of urban neighborhoods all over the country."
Interviewer,Not just Chicago.
Michelle,"Not just Chicago. Over on this area, this is North Kenwood. This is where the Hadiya Pendleton family lived."
Interviewer,Very impressive.
Michelle,I have not played the piano in so long.
Interviewer,"That's it, di di di di..."
Michelle,Now that I taught myself. I grew up in a household of music. Music was important and it still is. It really set me on a course.
Interviewer,"And did it mean something to bring something different to the White House, different music that had not been played there."
Michelle,Different.
Interviewer,"Before, artists."
Michelle,"Different music, different people. Yes absolutely. I mean it's why our first cultural event was spoken word."
Interviewer,"Can I have everybody's attention? Can you turn that off? You guys, we have a very special guest for you guys to meet and be introduced to."
Michelle,"How are you guys doing? Who's that? Oh my goodness. Look at you guys. So what, what, what is this? What are you all doing? (Class"
Interviewer,"I know you see her right now. And you would not know that she walked around in these halls saying, Am I good enough?"
Michelle,Mmhmm.
Interviewer,She doesn't work here anymore.
Michelle,"But that was just one of many examples, the doubters. Instead of walking away going, Yeah, you're right, maybe she's right, I would always think, I'll show you. And I'm gonna work hard and I'm gonna make sure that people know that I am substantive and smart and kind and patriotic and hard working."
Interviewer,Can we dance for you?
Michelle,Yes. I would love that. Oh yes.
Interviewer,We're performing for Michelle Obama.
Michelle,"You can do that? Is that what you all are doing in this room? I'm so proud of you. I'm gonna cry. You guys are gonna make me cry. Do not doubt anything. Anything. If you can get out here, look you got cameras and Secret Service and Robin Roberts, (Teacher"
Interviewer,Could we get you to sign the poster?
Michelle,Yes.
Interviewer,We love you.
Michelle,I would love to hug each and every one of you. I'm proud of you guys.
Interviewer,How important was it to put it there?
Michelle,"It was important for both me and Barack. Because, first of all, we both lived together in South Shore. We lived in Hyde Park. These communities are ours. Our kids went to school here. I grew up here. So symbolically it was important."
Interviewer,You excited about the book?
Michelle,I am. I'm excited. I'm a little nervous.
Interviewer,Why?
Michelle,"Well, because it's my work being put out there, it's just like anything. It's, you know, I'm still that kid, What grade am I getting? Did I do okay? Do people like it? So I'm excited and anxious to, you know, see what people get from it. I'm hoping that it generates a conversation."
Interviewer,What do you want your legacy to be?
Michelle,"Young people are the future. And if my story, my journey, somehow gives them hope, if I played a role in that for some young people comin' down the line, then I'll feel good about it."
Interviewer,In 1989 our first guest went on a fateful date with a charming Muslim immigrant from Kenya and had no idea.
Michelle,That it would lead to her one day being first lady of the United States you can read all about her history-making life.
Interviewer,In this new memoir called becoming police say hello to Michelle Obama that gives you.
Michelle,You see you see you see well miss you I mean where did.
Interviewer,You go yeah we did you back in the old house how is unemployment going are you embracing it yeah it's okay and I was.
Michelle,Just trying to think of what we've been doing but truthfully we're boring you know I we have a teenager at home and.
Interviewer,She makes us feel inadequate everyday low can I tell you how we feel we feel like you remember the first Superman.
Michelle,Movie christopher reeve yeah when he gave up his powers to save Lois Lane's life and then he was powerless and then.
Interviewer,They got beat up in a diner and then he had to get his powers back to come save us from Lex Luthor that's what we need.
Michelle,From you and your husband called the constant we dispense with that already happily what is he doing.
Interviewer,Right now like right now what is my husband yes oh he's probably in his hole in our new house in his office writing.
Michelle,He's working on his book can i tell you when I was reading about you mentioning in your book that his office is messy.
Interviewer,And disorganized yeah yeah me licensed to have a messy and disorganized office because my wife is that before oh it's a.
Michelle,Disaster but now i feel like well yeah yeah the president does that yeah putting up it's nice to me and it's.
Interviewer,Annoying are you sending a message for your husband through me I wish I could I really do it appears based on social.
Michelle,Media that you are really following Beyonce around the country going to her condo is that activity besides your.
Interviewer,Husband indoors with which celebrity do you text most often oh I'm not gonna tell you really and you know it's like.
Michelle,You don't text and tell that's not a thing I thought you just made that up what's going on lately because Oprah.
Interviewer,Kicked off the tour and she was an early reader I've been doing a lot of texting Gayle is a worrier.
Michelle,So a lot of times she'll call like what the oh really yeah yeah Oh Gayle that's pretty solid.
Interviewer,That's - you said barack is working on his book right now did you guys ever have a situation where you fight over an.
Michelle,Anecdote like it's like i wanted that for my book you know I'd since my book was first he's he lost.
Interviewer,And when it caused a rift in your relationship if Oprah doesn't put his book in her book club because she do it.
Michelle,With yours it might hurt his feelings but don't get over it the book is number one on Amazon that's was it fun to write.
Interviewer,The book it was more fun than i thought because here's the thing rarely does anybody get time and they get paid to.
Michelle,Reflect right that's true and reflecting I find is very important because the truth is is that for the last decade.
Interviewer,There was no time to even really think about what just happened to us you know I did I write about the fact that you.
Michelle,Know the week would start something amazing would happen and then by the end of the week I would have forgotten all.
Interviewer,About that other amazing thing i mean our days were full we were we were just inundated so coming out of the White.
Michelle,House it you needed that time to take stock and say what just happened what was that yeah and this book allowed.
Interviewer,Me to do that and to really understand what those eight years meant to me personally and how it fit into the.
Michelle,Context of the rest of my life yeah that was something I needed it was therapeutic for me and such a big part.
Interviewer,Of your your family your daughters being so young when how old were your daughters want on the day you yeah you.
Michelle,Started living in the white house they were seven and ten and I hope I get that right because that's yeah but they they.
Interviewer,Lived in the white house longer than they lived in any house that we lived in your mom moved in lived there the whole.
Michelle,Eight years with you reluctantly but he locked at least eight what year did she try to get out how far in oh you know.
Interviewer,She felt like by the time she wasn't taking the girls to school everyday they were both in middle school she.
Michelle,Thought i can go right oh right no not yet you stay here you stay here so we'd let her go home in the summer.
Interviewer,So you can have a summer break but you got to come back and I would call her it's like you're coming back right if.
Michelle,And when sasha or malia become president  you would not move in with them or would.
Interviewer,You move in with them to help them i would you have to man oh if they had kids yeah well she only my mother wasn't.
Michelle,Helping me she was helping her grandchildren gotcha yeah I understand I would because they would need the help.
Interviewer,Did bo the white house dog know he was the White House dog you know he acted like he did he's an odd dog because in.
Michelle,Barack you know he criticizes bo a little bit because he had an aloofness to him it's almost sort of like don't.
Interviewer,Touch me i am a bo don't you know who i am I mean he would prance around the White House he had a schedule both the.
Michelle,Dogs did they would get picked an official schedule yeah I would do a briefing request for them they they had.
Interviewer,To get my permission but i would find i in my briefing book it would be Ken Bo and sunny stop by this press event no.
Michelle,There would be a time and i had to approve of it so they'd get picked up and they'd hang out with the gardener's.
Interviewer,For the day and they were very like when they were at home they were mommies dogs but if they were working with the fellas.
Michelle,They would ignore me it's just sort of like don't buy don't touch me I'm at work I'm busy one of the.
Interviewer,Most interesting things i learned from your book is that the president first lady family you have to pay for your.
Michelle,Food yeah wow you're in the light go figure that is crazy to me well you know it is.
Interviewer,And it isn't it's crazy because you don't know it and most people don't know what it's like to live in the White.
Michelle,House so you know only 45 families have done it um but true Brenna's free staff is free you know we shouldn't be.
Interviewer,Mooching off of the taxpayers but you're okay with that yeah but it's a little shocking because nobody really tells you.
Michelle,This stuff and then they let you get whatever you want like if you say you want some exotic fruit yes ma'am we'll.
Interviewer,Get that right away and then you get the bill for a peach and it's like that was a $500 do not.
Michelle,Express pleasure for anything until i unless I know how much it Wow so they're very responsive at your expense yeah in.
Interviewer,All fairness it's like the taxpayers should you know we want a certain kind of jam in the or jelly we should pay for.
Michelle,That yeah but if you're going smuckers it should be free we're gonna get into other important things that are in this.
Interviewer,Book the book is called becoming Michelle Obama is here with us Michelle Obama is here but you know I do want to.
Michelle,Say mrs. obama gave you guys a very nice compliment during the during the break and and you mentioned in the book that.

Michelle,Howard just curious just wondering if there's somebody that rubbed you the wrong way.
Interviewer,Would you send them a letter we had wonderful people in our administration and you never had a situation like that.
Michelle,One i don't believe that for a second but we play a game almost every day here at our show and then my wife and I play.
Interviewer,It at home if the game is doesn't really have a title but it's basically called what if Obama had done this oh god we.
Michelle,Played that at home you do i know i know you've said repeatedly you will not run it it run for office but has anyone ever.
Interviewer,Really like seriously approached you and tried to convince you to run for office all the time like I mean I'm talking.
Michelle,About like the head of the committee or rock or Hillary or somebody like that who rock keeps those people away from me.
Interviewer,He does so yeah no no we've never had any serious conversations with anyone about it because it's not something that.
Michelle,I'm interested in or would ever do ever you said something very interesting I thought about your husband in your book.
Interviewer,Is that on high-pressure days he would be at his most relaxed and he would be the friendliest on those days why do you.
Michelle,Think that is on his busiest day yeah because that that's what fuels him he's he's a grinder you know I think and yeah.
Interviewer,He may be i think he feels most fulfilled when he's full when his plate is full I call him a plate spinner you.
Michelle,Know those jugglers that keep spinning those plates and if one is starting to wobble he spins it and if everything's.
Interviewer,Going okay then he'll put another plate up I think he gets his energy is he doing that at home now like literally.
Michelle,Wet the china right now he's not doing that do you have a secret like Instagram or Facebook or.
Interviewer,Page like what if i told you it wouldn't be a secret no I don't I don't I'm barely good at that stuff in any way I.
Michelle,Mean i have an instagram account and a Twitter account obviously but you know I I have to get permission to use it I see.
Interviewer,My staff they don't trust me with it so speaking of permission in the book you talked about three kids one was a girl.
Michelle,Named edie who you fought she was a bully and you fought her my first fight first fight then there was a boyfriend.
Interviewer,You smoked pot with uh-huh and then there was a boyfriend that you broke up with because his his goal his career.
Michelle,Goal was to become a mascot for like the Cleveland Browns or something right yeah now do you call those people beforehand.
Interviewer,Or reach out to them in some way to go guess what no no I did and I didn't use last names for that reason although some.
Michelle,People will know who they are Yeah right so it's up to them to out themselves but but I did give books to.
Interviewer,Send books to everybody with kind of a nice note like thank you for helping me become the dee dee get a book I think so.
Michelle,We're trying to track everybody down yeah so because these are people you know this was in childhood this didn't.
Interviewer,Happen yesterday i wasn't fighting yeah yeah when I was a little kid so it takes a second to like find everybody so I'm.
Michelle,Not sure if everybody's gotten a book but we tried to get everybody about you and then if they call and they want to.
Interviewer,Fight again yeah then the pay-per-view yeah right you have to be very careful when your first lady I spoke to your.
Michelle,Husband about this also because he jokes around a lot but then you realize like oh I I have to maybe real an end because.
Interviewer,The position i have but you're not first lady anymore I am NOT and as far as I'm concerned you can cut loose and really.
Michelle,Say anything now right yeah so what I've done is I've got a sweater made of cards here what have you.
Interviewer,Done i written some things down and if you are you've written yes if you're game for this okay.
Michelle,Maybe here are some things that you could say now that you are just look at those cards and just read we don't even.
Interviewer,Look at them just read what i wrote yeah start with that one all right and look at the camera right there so we feel oh.
Michelle,Look at that what sorry yeah okay yeah I've I've never eaten a vegetable I knew it I knew it.
Interviewer,There's another that's not true mm-hmm the whole eight years we were in the White House who use Laura Bush's Netflix.
Michelle,Password there you go I'm not sure which ones Sasha and which ones Malia they agree they get so mad.
Interviewer,Every time i miss their names up i'm like who are hard to be in a parent the game that Sasha plays with me is that.
Michelle,When we're with a lot of people she'll call me mom mom mom and I and I don't hear and she's like Michelle Michelle.
Interviewer,She's like see all right couple more these are important I stole the phrase when they go low we go high from the.
Michelle,Back of a snapple cap to more barry be quiet and hold my purse and you're fine a racist statement to make.
Interviewer,Now that you're no longer first lady Clooney is my freebie Michelle Obama everyone this is your book becoming it.
Michelle,Is a hi I'm Jimmy Kimmel and I am not allowed to eat this cookie until you click the.
Interviewer,Subscribe button so please click now i'm hungry .
Michelle,The star of your own kids tv show absolutely not i mean when i was very young i wanted to.
Interviewer,Be a mommy like my mommy and then when i got a little older i thought i wanted to be a pediatrician.
Michelle,And then i got a little older and i realized there was math involved and i wasn't good at that.
Interviewer,And then i decided on law because i talked a lot so you know i could only imagine for my life what was before me.
Michelle,And this wasn't it so no is the short answer well now you are.
Interviewer,The star of your own kids show waffles and mochi what has that been like has it been a.
Michelle,Lot of fun oh it it's my favorite project i mean you know you have followed us and supported a lot.
Interviewer,Of the work that we've done and i love it all but this project you know it just sort of it brings it.
Michelle,All full circle um because it brings me back to kids and nutrition.
Interviewer,It's fun um the creative the co-creators erica thornlin and jeremy connor or are funny they bring the education but they.
Michelle,Bring the funny um and it's something that all families can enjoy this isn't just a kids show.
Interviewer,It's a family show and that's what drew me to it because i i was like i i'd watch this without my.
Michelle,Kids because i don't have little kids anymore so i am so excited about this it is a.
Interviewer,Quality uh program for sure and i'm glad to be a part of it and you guys are uh partnering up with.
Michelle,Partnership for a healthier america in a year where we've all witnessed these heartbreaking images.
Interviewer,Of people lined up for miles at food banks why is it so important particularly this.
Michelle,Year well this has been a hard year for millions i mean.
Interviewer,So many of us have complained about being cooped up and isolated and it's just hard it's.
Michelle,It's a strain but the truth is there are a lot of people who have lost work they're people who are struggling.
Interviewer,To keep food on their table there are families in this country today that are going hungry.
Michelle,And so uh we're partnering with a partnership for a healthier america to create the pass the love campaign um.
Interviewer,Where our goal is to feed a million families in need right here in this country and.
Michelle,Folks can go on to the website wafflesmochie.org and they can uh find out how to be a part of that effort.
Interviewer,As well as uh use the website to interact with the show.
Michelle,Um the kids can get on in their recipes that they can practice and um they can win their own.
Interviewer,Badges because waffles and mochi always earn a badge from mrs oh when they complete an assignment.
Michelle,Um so it's a it's it's the site is for a little bit of everything but you can learn more about the pass the love.
Interviewer,Campaign there too well as you said this show is for moms too.
Michelle,We know that you know we're all watching the shows our kids watch and this has been a really trying year.
Interviewer,For mothers mothers who are working from home and teaching our kids two million women.
Michelle,Have left the work force this year what do you say to all of of those that are struggling.
Interviewer,You know mothers were all always already hard on ourselves and this is a time where we have to give ourselves a.
Michelle,Break um this is not the year to try to do it all.
Interviewer,And to beat yourself up when you can't this has been stressful so we have to give ourselves a break as mothers.
Michelle,Do the best that we can and remember in the end that what's most important for our kids is that they know.
Interviewer,We love them and that we try to be as consistent as we can but we can't get everything right.
Michelle,The other thing i would encourage mothers to do is to find some time just to get a moment by.
Interviewer,Yourself even if it means going into the bathroom lock a door and if you don't have a lock.
Michelle,Barricade yourself in and just get a moment to take a deep breath.
Interviewer,Because we can't be there for our families if we're not there for ourselves first.
Michelle,I've hidden in the pantry i have to admit maybe while eating my kids string cheese.
Interviewer,I can only imagine i mean my girls are young adults they're running from us now.
Michelle,I remember those years they are barricading themselves in their rooms because they're tired of talking us.
Interviewer,But you but you've said that one of the most beautiful parts of this year was the unexpected.
Michelle,Uninterrupted time with your girls i mean you thought they were off and go gone to college and now all of a.
Interviewer,Sudden they're back what's it been like it's been great for us i i feel for them because.
Michelle,You know malia is a senior this year this was her last year in college and sasha has essentially missed her.
Interviewer,Second year in college so i feel for them but for barack and i we have cherished this time i mean you.
Michelle,Don't get that time back again where you see your children in their adult life.
Interviewer,You know uh having a different set of conversations cherishing a different kind of.
Michelle,Relationship i'm no longer just parenting i i'm guiding i'm counseling.
Interviewer,And it's just fun seeing how their minds work what they're afraid of it's even fun.
Michelle,Just peeking in and hearing them in their online classrooms it's like oh you.
Interviewer,Actually did your reading you have an opinion i like that like probably astounded by.
Michelle,Them and and i i read that um your husband was shocked by how much one of their.
Interviewer,Boyfriends ate oh yeah we're speaking of food yes we had uh.
Michelle,The the pleasure of having malia's boyfriend with us for part of the time last year because he was graduating and.
Interviewer,Was afraid to go home and miss an internship so we housed him we didn't grow up we did we didn't raise.
Michelle,Boys and so they eat a lot and sometimes we forget that he'd need.
Interviewer,To eat he'd need to eat often so we had to really adjust our shopping and our eating schedule the poor boy.
Michelle,Would be sitting around waiting for the next meal it's like we we weren't thinking about lunch so.
Interviewer,Yeah it's a whole different ball game and we just got a little taste of it.
Michelle,One of the things that i think people have found comfort in is your honesty and you posted a.
Interviewer,Photograph and and you wrote an open message really to everybody that's in which you said.
Michelle,I hope you all are allowing yourself to feel whatever it is you're feeling so i.
Interviewer,Wonder at the darkest points of your last year what what were you feeling.
Michelle,You know the darkest points were you know when we we when we felt bombarded by everything.
Interviewer,You know a virus that felt out of control with no real clear solution uh before us the.
Michelle,Country shut down racial un unrest visualizing the kind of injustice that.
Interviewer,Can happen on the streets seeing young people despair.
Michelle,At where this country was going i mean it was a it was a lot and it continues to be a lot.
Interviewer,Because we still haven't solved those problems so you know i i shared that because it was.
Michelle,The truth of how i was feeling it's hard to say oh i'm great i'm fine when deep down.
Interviewer,You know that's a lot to struggle with and i know that as an adult at least i have some perspective and context to.
Michelle,Bring to life most young people don't um and you want young people to stay.
Interviewer,Encouraged to feel okay about their down times but know that life is long.
Michelle,You want them to realize that there's a a brighter light at the end of the tunnel and to just.
Interviewer,Stay stay fast steadfast in your pursuit of coming out of that darkness you know so.
Michelle,If we don't share those emotions with our kids then they think those feelings that they have.
Interviewer,Are abnormal so we have to kind of learn to be open and honest about our down times.
Michelle,As well yeah talk about our lowest times yeah absolutely um as you mentioned in this last year we.
Interviewer,Watched george floyd call out for his mom we watched rihanna taylor's.
Michelle,Mom grieve her baby as a mom yourself how do you like how do you come to terms with all of that.
Interviewer,Yeah you you you don't come to terms with it but you do have to talk about it you.
Michelle,Have to you you have to sit down with your children and acknowledge the truth.
Interviewer,Of the world we live in um and we what i know is that you can't shy away from those discussions.
Michelle,Even if they're uncomfortable um or painful uh and i don't think if there's a.
Interviewer,There's an age where it's too soon to have those conversations now the conversation you.
Michelle,Have with a seven-year-old is very different with the conversation that you're going.
Interviewer,To have with a teenager but finding ways to help young people know that what they see and.
Michelle,Feel is real that they're not crazy that that that we still do struggle with race in.
Interviewer,This country um and that they can't take that in they have to know that that's not their.
Michelle,Problem to own uh so how i come to grips with it is to talk about it and to talk about it.
Interviewer,Often and to be ready to take on my kids pain and their questions and their concerns.
Michelle,And do it with as much truth and honesty as i can muster like i can't imagine how many moms and.
Interviewer,Their kids were sitting around kitchen tables having those conversations well and the truth is.
Michelle,Jenna this isn't new for minority families i mean these are the conversations that we.
Interviewer,Always have to have because you know when you're sending your child out into a world.
Michelle,Where people might fear them simply because of the color of their skin you have to prepare them early we don't.
Interviewer,We we've never had the luxury of not talking about these issues and now hopefully.
Michelle,The rest of the country the rest of the world understands that it's not enough for.
Interviewer,Us in minority communities to have those conversations if we're all not having them with our.
Michelle,Children yeah so this time maybe it feels like there's.
Interviewer,Real progress well we have to hold hold that that that hope up high because uh.
Michelle,You know we we have to continue to make progress you know you've got little ones growing up and i know you have a vision.
Interviewer,For the kind of world that you want your your children to walk into and it is one of fairness and justice.
Michelle,And equality and unity and we have to work for that it won't just happen.
Interviewer,Uh just because we want it now you know we have to sacrifice for it we have to use our voices to speak on and i think.
Michelle,That more people after this year uh are ready to do work yeah i think so too um i.
Interviewer,Remember talking with you i wonder if you'll remember this and talked about life in the white house although you.
Michelle,Didn't take a single moment for granted that there were moments of real loneliness.
Interviewer,And so i wonder when you watched meghan markle speak out the other night if what went.
Michelle,Through your mind um public service in uh is a it's a it's it's a bright sharp hot spotlight.
Interviewer,And most people don't understand it and nor should they um but you know there are ways to uh steal.
Michelle,Yourself and protect yourself but the thing that i always keep in mind.
Interviewer,Is that none of this is about us public service it's about the people that we serve.
Michelle,Um and especially in times like this you know i want the country to be focused on the the big issues that we face you know.

Interviewer,You but what about when she talked about the fact that she experienced racism i mean i feel like that was.
Michelle,Heartbreaking to hear that she felt like she was in her own family.
Interviewer,You know her own family thought differently of her as i said before race isn't a new.
Michelle,Construct in this world for people of color you know um.
Interviewer,So it wasn't a complete surprise to sort of hear her her feelings and to have them articulated i think.

Interviewer,I pray for forgiveness and healing for them uh so that they can use this as a.
Michelle,Teachable moment for us all you know living in a world where there are.

Michelle,Always heard knitting but that that can right knitting do whatever you start you're later.

Interviewer,Have been fun to to rewrite it well we didn't really um i worked with.
Michelle,The publishers and their young adult editors and we i i didn't want to rewrite it.
Interviewer,And and we had sort of looked at versions that sort of fundamentally changed chapters and i was.
Michelle,Like no that's not what the book is and that's not what the story is and it's hard to say what would you leave out.
Interviewer,So the book is basically the same it's a little shorter we condense some paragraphs to make them.
Michelle,More accessible we change words out that we're a little too you know an adult um but the core of the.
Interviewer,Book is essentially the same we added an introduction that's especially.
Michelle,Structured for our my young readers um added some more pictures that were a little more kid-friendly um kind.
Interviewer,Of the fun times in the white house and uh more my interactions with young people.
Michelle,And online there's actually a a study guide that um parents or book clubs or.
Interviewer,Teachers can use to help sort of walk young readers uh through the content because what i.
Michelle,Realize is that the young adults version of a book isn't just for kids it's yeah.
Interviewer,People who are where english is a second language or adult readers who are just learning so i didn't want to change the.
Michelle,Story fundamentally i wanted to be as honest and as real with this version of the book as we were.
Interviewer,With the original so well i think it's i feel like it's really appropriate too.
Michelle,Because you're going to be speaking you know writing directly to young women and men who are.
Interviewer,Becoming who are trying to figure out what it is they want to be exactly exact i mean the story truly my.
Michelle,Journey was told with young people in mind um you know sharing so much of my early.
Interviewer,Years my childhood was was really me tapping into the experiences that all kids are facing you know those.
Michelle,Insecurities those first failures and embarrassments the you know the.
Interviewer,You know the the first time you got into an argument with a friend your first kiss.
Michelle,All of that you know um those are important things to hold on to and i want kids to understand that now.
Interviewer,That those small moments that you think are nothing well those are the kernels um.
Michelle,In your story uh and i want young kids to start valuing that um because they're gonna they're gonna.
Interviewer,Be able to look back and point to some of those uh those small moments to say aha that's.
Michelle,That explains my feelings today or that gives me clarity.
Interviewer,On why i approach problem solving in this way you just never know it's the sights and the.
Michelle,Sounds and the smells of your childhood that stay with you i mean those are the things i draw on.
Interviewer,Those messages those images i still drawn at 57 years old um some of those.

Interviewer,On this day and it was me as a young person showing your and my sister.

Interviewer,Wow that those are little memories that felt like even 12 years later something important.
Michelle,To me and they remember malia and sasha remember that time more than a lot of things that i would have.
Interviewer,Thought of because they saw those pictures too and we sat and had an entire dinner.
Michelle,About those first days and uh how they just cherished you know these two young beautiful women who had done what.
Interviewer,They were doing who had taken time out of their lives because it was very clear you guys were.
Michelle,Excited to do it you can't you came in from where wherever you were especially.

Interviewer,Better way to live in the world um it's it's it's better when we're kind and we're.
Michelle,Generous to one another it feels good inside i am praying.

Michelle,"Don't look like, don't roll your eyes. haha."
Interviewer,"Hey girl hey, hahaha For this conversation, I thought it might make sense to bring in some of my closest girlfriends."
Michelle,"All right, my phone's over there."
Interviewer,"You know what, let me just make sure to check, I know I've turned mine off, but you're just making me like crazy. Making me crazy."
Michelle,"haha You'll probably recognize one of them-and that's Sharon Malone, who I'm so glad to have back on the podcast. We are also joined by our good friends Danielle Pemberton-Heard and Kelly Dibble."
Interviewer,"Hi, I'm Denielle."
Michelle,"Now these three have all got great careers in medicine, business, and public affairs, and I met each of them at various points of my life. We got into all that during the episode, so I won't spoil it here. As it always does when we're together, the conversation ends up in a number of different places. It's a pretty good window into what I love about my girlfriends-we can reminisce, we can talk and laugh with each other at each other's stories. But most of all, we can talk about the important stuff:what's going on in the world, in our families, whatever we're thinking about, really. We're just there for each other when it counts-for a laugh, for a hug, for whatever we need. Now, the four of us recorded this conversation not long after the police killing of George Floyd and so all those feelings-grief, anger, outrage-were top of mind."
Interviewer,"We're Sharon and I were talking about this, on the way over, about. We just witnessed a murder by suffocation. And, and they're like, Black people are you OK? Keep doing what you're doing."
Michelle,"A lot of people look to us, as, now senior people in our lives, not just as mothers, but, as mentors, and everybody like, it feels like everybody lays this at, sort of the feet, of, hahaha."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"Of, and I'll say it. Black women. You know, it's like, make us feel better. Help us understand."
Interviewer,"You know it's almost as if, you know, these concerns that we have, and knowing what goes on in the community with young Black men. Young Black women, for that matter. We've all known it. And you feel it, and we process it when we send our children out there in the world. But then there's been this, people don't believe you. You know. They think, oh you're just being overly sensitive, or, you know, it's not really like that, that was years ago."
Michelle,And and when you say people you mean white people.
Interviewer,"I do. I do. Well, I do, I do, because."
Michelle,"Our white friends, our white colleagues, people who don't experience this in their lives."
Interviewer,"And even when you see it. There's still a asterisk, well it wasn't really what you saw. Don't believe, don't believe your lyin' eyes, you know, that's kind of the story of, Black America being gaslit, for, forever. Just simply because no, no no no that didn't happen that way, he was resisting, she was, you know."
Michelle,"Oh this, was this the the bird."
Interviewer,"This is the bird watching, yes."
Michelle,"Well she, well she weaponized."
Interviewer,"And, so she weaponized. And she knew that she could do it. So it's almost we're going back to, I don't know, I mean you can look at Emmett Till. You know knowing that you, soon as you call foul, right, with a Black man, introduce the police, anything can happen, even the worst. But it was just, it's not as dramatic as seeing a murder, but the fact that she knew that she could bring harm to him, and that the, and that the police wouldn't question, her."
Michelle,"That incident in central park, which infuriated all of us, as we watched it, it was not unfamiliar, I mean this is what, the white community doesn't understand, about being a person of color in this nation, is that, there are daily slights. You know, in our workplaces, where, you know, people talk over you, or people don't even see you, I know Denielle you talked about being in meetings with people, who can see you as a professional but then you step out into the street, and those same people don't even see you."
Interviewer,"They walk right by you. I've had it, several times. Where I've presented to, um, members of my team, people that I've worked with, peers. Go downstairs in the elevator, go out to lunch, and they walk right by you on the street. You're standing in line next to them, at, sweet green. And they look right through you, they assume they don't know you, um they have no use for you, and yet, um, you just helped solve their legal problem. Or helped make them some money, or saved them some money. But then, when you're out in the world, you're just an invisible, person."
Michelle,"Denielle and I, when the girls were little, this was when I was First Lady, I, I am Michelle Obama the First Lady of the United States. And."
Interviewer,Of America.
Michelle,"Of America, and we had just finished the, taking the girls to a soccer game. We were stopping to get ice cream, and, I had told the secret service to stand back, because we were trying to be normal, trying to go in, it was Haagen Dazs, wasn't it."
Interviewer,"Exactly, Haagen Dazs."
Michelle,"Um, and there was a line, and once again, being, when I'm just a Black woman, I notice that white people don't even see me. They're not even looking at me. So I'm standing there with two little Black girls, another, Black female adult, they're in soccer uniforms. And a white woman cuts right in front of us. To order. Like she didn't even see us."
Interviewer,"I live, you know, a rather diverse life I think, you know, and I have white friends, and I have my Black friends, that I've known."
Michelle,We all do.
Interviewer,But very few of my white friends have Black friends.
Michelle,Mm hmm. You are the.
Interviewer,"Like I'm your only Black friend. And, I said that's interesting, it's always amazed me that we've lived in Washington D.C. for as long as we have, and I've been here for thirty years, and I said, and, my husband and I will go to, a party, and it will be like."
Michelle,Still just us.
Interviewer,"Just us, you know, and, but it allows people to accept Black people one by one. Cause it's you. I like you, but that doesn't change my view generally. I still feel how I feel about them, Them. Oh well those people. And them. And somehow you have allowed me to be an honorary white person."
Michelle,"But this is also why, my girlfriend group, while it is diverse, it it has been so important for me to have Black women, in my crew.Throughout my life, professionally, because there's just a certain, There's a certain relief that comes when you don't have to walk into your friend group and explain yourself. My group of, female friends, aren't calling me to say what can I do? They're, you guys are calling me to say how you doin' girl? You know, let's talk."
Interviewer,The same time!
Michelle,"At the same time, with Malia and Kelly has twin girls born almost a month apart."
Interviewer,"Right, so July 4th and July 22nd. So, the same month, um. So, as a working mother, um, the first thing was like how do you balance, you know your work life, and, motherhood. But the main thing was, what's the model of a mother? So part of it was getting the girls together for play-dates cause we knew moms did that. Our kids were six months, years old, sitting, on the floor, back to back, were, and oblivious of each other. But we had each other. And it gave us a chance to, you know, have brunch, have a bottle of champagne, you know, and talk about what was going on in our lives, and the adjustments we were making, you know to our home life, you know, the responsibilities between a husband and wife, around the kids, you know, and we progressed through, you know soccer games, and um, getting museum."
Michelle,"Oh, the birthday parties!"
Interviewer,"Birthday parties! You now, and we had summer babies, so we had, like the first birthdays were crucial, cause, you know, they, they survived! Us for a whole year, right."
Michelle,It was a big deal! And we were hot!
Interviewer,"Bid deal, and we were, you were still in the condo on Everett so you had the barbecue, obviously for July 4th."
Michelle,"Yeah that's when you learn, you know, that when you have, the ba- the first baby, cause we, we all went through this, oh, we can organize this birthday, it's just a birthday party, in the house, and I remember Barack goin', we don't need to rent a facility, you know, it's like why would we spend that money, why don't we just do it ourselves?"
Interviewer,Right!
Michelle,"And then, you're exhausted."
Interviewer,... exhausted!
Michelle,"With food, and you got all these people and folding chairs."
Interviewer,Oh my god.
Michelle,"That was the first and last at home, birthday."
Interviewer,It was. That was that. haha.
Michelle,"Stay here, I'll feed you."
Interviewer,"It's a double edged sword there, I'm like."
Michelle,"That's where those little uh, birthday parties, see the Chuck E Cheeses, those, you know I would pay any amount of money to be able to go somewhere, pay somebody, for two hours."
Interviewer,My gym.
Michelle,My gym!
Interviewer,Gymboree.
Michelle,"You know, they had that stuff, organized, and all you had to do was bring some pizza, and you would leave, wouldn't have to clean up. But we went through, Kelly."
Interviewer,A range of those.
Michelle,"Pizza and goody bag, that's all you needed."
Interviewer,"Well that was really, important."
Michelle,"When your husband was traveling... he was on the road, mm hmm. Yeah."
Interviewer,"And he was on the road for a long time because he was at Springfield, before he ran for US senate. And presidency."
Michelle,"But all of us were in some state of, professional need, and having a group of women that we could call on, each other, and just, you know, it wasn't like we were leaving our kids, but just having another adult in the room for the day, that you could go, is this working for you? Or just."
Interviewer,"And also with the girls, I mean they still feel, a comfort level, almost as."
Michelle,With each other.
Interviewer,"As a family as a cousin, you know, um."
Michelle,"An extended, you know, yeah. Our girls, see themselves more as cousins than they do, well I think all of our kids."
Interviewer,"Yeah, all of our kids."
Michelle,"Cause Denielle we, you were one of my White House moms."
Interviewer,I was the newbie!
Michelle,You were the newbie!
Interviewer,"I had no prior history. And just sort of, um, you know, we came together really over the girls, um, just by chance being, um, in the same school. And then being assigned to the same basketball team. And I think the first time I really reached out to you was um, you know, the most important thing of basketball game is snacks! And, we were assigned randomly, to be snack parents together. And I said, now how do you, serve snacks with the President and the First Lady of the United States."
Michelle,"To show up, to be, the President and the First Lady and not have snacks!"
Interviewer,To show up without snacks! No snacks!
Michelle,They would've talked about me like a dog.
Interviewer,"Yep, the sure would have."
Michelle,You saved me.
Interviewer,"So, I, I thought I was doing something."
Michelle,And what did you bring that day.
Interviewer,"I thought I was doing something, I went to trader joe's."
Michelle,What did we bring? haha.
Interviewer,"Well you guys showed up with um, coolers marked, you know, West Wing, President of United States, brought in by, armed men. And wheeled up. Um, wheeled everything out, and um, you had a very diverse group of um, beverages. Waters, gatorades, all, all high end stuff."
Michelle,"Well see, back in the day, it wasn't, like you said I wasn't doing the Costco runs, I would you know, go approach, the White House chef, or, and then they wouldn't know how to like, just, just chill out, you know. If I brought cookies, they were freshly baked White House cookies, individually wrapped, with bows."
Interviewer,And packaged.
Michelle,"In packages. And you're kind of going, oh, you know, this is kind of overboard, and even Sasha and Malia would be like why can't you just bring regular snacks? Why couldn't you just get some chips ahoy cookies and just bring 'em up, and it's like I can't shop?"
Interviewer,"Well, and see, I was always the mom forgetting snack day, so I'd be."
Michelle,Missed the game.
Interviewer,"And I, you know, and when you have."
Michelle,I am failing.
Interviewer,"Is it Christmas, was I supposed to bring those?"
Michelle,"It's like did, are you still playing soccer? It's still soccer season? Aw, no."
Interviewer,More on the Michelle Obama Podcast after the break.
Michelle,"No, no, can't do that."
Interviewer,"You have to have, you know, license, ID, et cetera, so they have all of your information, down to your social security number, you pull into the gate."
Michelle,"And then somebody's gotta ask for that, I mean that's the other thing."
Interviewer,"Right, so, you're going, so there are three or four exchanges, of getting all of this information just to drop your child off, for a play-date. So we get there, I drop Olivia off, again, you don't get out of the car, you just let your child out of the car, and let them go in."
Michelle,"Well you said, you'd go and get your car washed."
Interviewer,"Oh absolutely, I wasn't going to roll up to the White House in a dirty car! So I got my car washed, I think I had my hair done, and my nails done. I was not going up there looking raggedy. And, I, made sure that Olivia had herself together. So we go in, I drop her off, I'm told, please be back at, one, again, at that time we lived outside of the city, so I'm killing time in D.C., trying to, you know, just wait, And at about twelve thirty, I get the call, restricted number, hello? Um, yes, is this Denielle Pemberton-Heard, Yes. This is the White House calling. And I'm thinking, heart drop. What did she break? What did she do? What happened, I'll be right over. And they're like no, no no, um, the first family would like for her to stay a couple more hours, they're going to watch a movie. I'm like Oh, OK. so again, I'm driving around D.C. just went to CVS like three different times, in different parts of the city, I'm like killing time."
Michelle,"Well I also thought, I am still a Black mother. You know, so I figured, this child had just been at our house, I know her mother would want to see me, you know. It's like I can't act like I can just have people's kids over and not know them. So I thought, OK, Olivia's been at our house all day, I haven't even met her mother, I need to go down, like a normal person, and say hey, she's safe, we aren't crazy, you've seen us on TV, but you need to see us in the flesh, and I also need to see you. And so we started talking, and I thought, I like this woman. They are gonna be friends, it was like me building up my posse here in D.C., it's like I need to have some other mothers, who can help me, and sit well, who I think we share the same values, you know I just got a sense of Denielle that she wasn't playing around, Denielle was my first, like, real friend in D.C."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"We met each other in the realm of this political beast that was our, that were, that would become our lives, um, and, we talk a lot about the first time we kinda connected across the table, where I was like, your reaction to the situation was the same as mine, this again, was before, the presidency, but."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,"Barack, was a US senator, and."
Interviewer,"Well you know, it was one of these, you know, interminable, D.C. dinners. And you know, it's like and people are up and glad handing, and you know, and D.C. is a big, who are you? and why do I need to know you? kind of town, you know. So we're there, and, I remember there was, and, and I we won't call any names, but there were just people, and, just looking at how people would react, and you know how you look across the table, and not a word was said, you know, you look at someone's eye and you're like, OK. You know, I got it. And it was like this instant, uh, understanding, of the situation. And it was like, OK, yeah. OK."
Michelle,"Sharon was as done, with this event as I was. To put it, she's being kind, but. I saw this look of done-ness, that, you know, where everybody else seemed so excited to be there. And I was like who is that woman that feels like me, I can see it in her face, I just wanna know who she is. hahaha."
Interviewer,"But when we, and, but the first time we had really had a chance to have a real, conversation, was, um, when you were here, you were the First Lady, you had moved here, and you were staying at the Hay Adams, and I get this call, and someone says, I'm whatever, and I'm from Mrs. Obama's staff, and I was like whaaat? And she says, would you like to have lunch, And I was like, I think I can make that work. And we had lunch. And we had, a lunch, which, you know, 12 to 1, what time did we finished like at 3."
Michelle,"Well that's when, you know that was when we were in the midst of the transition, and I would have these lunches, cause I said I just need to meet people, I need to understand Washington, and so, my staff would block out these, like OK you have an hour meeting with this person, and an hour meeting with that person, so, initially, it was an hour meeting, that they would usually, you know I'd usually be like OK this is over, but when Sharon and I sat down, it was just like, this is another me. And, because, Sharon's husband, is in my husband's administration, Eric Holder, let's just not beat around the bush, that's who your husband is, so you had been in this, world, for so much longer than I had been, and, you were a professional in your own right. And that was something, that I, I saw, I was like OK this is a woman who still has a career, who is raising kids, whose husband is a big deal, but she's an even bigger deal, in her own right. Well, that's what really drew me to you is just your, your attitude, about this place, you were you were unimpressed, but you, you cared deeply. It was that you were straddling that fence that I so often straddled as the wife of a politician, in a world, where women are just sort of, uh, accessories. You were not an accessory. haha Sharon Malone"
Interviewer,"Yeah, exactly."
Michelle,"Denielle, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, invite Olivia over, we're gonna sign up for something. Sharon I'm gonna ask you to go to lunch, um, we're gonna plan, Kelly, a time to take our kids to go see Disney on ice. It, you have to put as much time and energy into cultivating those friendships but that's something that, women, oftentimes aren't taught. You know, you all are the people that I can go to, for, for just a gut check. Too. Because that's also the beauty of the diversity of my particular girlfriends, because you all are uniquely, yourselves, and I see myself differently, in contrast to who you guys are."
Interviewer,"Oh my gosh, what about Camp David. That was."
Michelle,"Don't look like, don't roll your eyes. hahaha."
Interviewer,I mean the Camp David.
Michelle,That's a.
Interviewer,Look.
Michelle,"You know, what I called like a spa weekend."
Interviewer,It's a spa weekend.
Michelle,"hahaha Well, after the first one I had to put wine back on, at least."
Interviewer,that was thanks to Sharon.
Michelle,No alcohol?
Interviewer,"I said, we're gonna have to add some wine back. And they're like OK."
Michelle,"I know for me, I was always thinking about, OK, how do I get outside, so finding something that would get me out, and, so skiing wasn't something I knew I grew up with, Denielle you skied way more than I did."
Interviewer,"Mm hmm I grew up, yeah."
Michelle,"But I thought, well when it gets cold outside, and we can't go for walks, or go on the Potomac, it's like well what are we gon' do? Um, so, one year we went up to Camp David and Liberty Mountain was really just a short drive from Camp David. And, so we started there, on that, on that hill, um, the kids started learning there. I remember my agents, none of them could really ski. hahaha not, none that were on my detail, so everybody was taking these crash skiing courses, uh, before we went skiing, but then we put it on our radar screen for every, every winter, and we, you know, went went went to Vail, and."
Interviewer,"We started in Vail, first."
Michelle,"And Aspen, and that's when we learned what a mountain was. Or at least I learned what a mountain was."
Interviewer,"You could see the the, the joy that you had when we were out on the mountain. Because, once you put on the ski helmet and the goggles, she's pretty anonymous, right, so there's the ability to sort of be out there and do your thing and be free and you're outside, and we spent hours on the mountain."
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"Um, because he's the ski instructor that's sort of instructing her, as opposed to us, though we're in the group. And you just see, that she's getting better and better. Secret service frankly could not keep up, and there's this one time where we're taking this long run. She doesn't even know what's happening, right, because she's at the front of the pack, with the ski instructor. You've got all of these secret service agents skiing behind her, sort of flanking her, and zig zagging, crossing themselves as we come down the mountain. And I sort of ski a bit behind her, to give her room. Well, on this particular run, it was icy, she was flying down the mountain. One by one, agents started wiping out. One who will remain nameless because he got so much smack from the secret service for wiping out, because he was like her detail lead. Other people falling, you know I'm looking at bulletproof vests, and snow going up backs, you know everyone's wiping out. And at, one point I look, all of her agents are down. And I'm still standing, and I yell to them, I got her guys, I got her! Thinking to myself, now, if anyone needs, me to do anything, we are sunk, but, that's my girl, I'm gonna trail her."
Michelle,"For me, one measure of, like, finding my crew, is not just sort of how do I relate to them, but are they open enough, and are they, kind enough? And are they secure enough, to be friends with my friends. And slowly over the course, the course of many many years, you guys have come to know each other, as, as well if not better, you know, than, than, and connect even better than you connect with me."
Interviewer,"Right, and you know, and it's the sorority of, it's that circle of trust, I should say, that we had, because, you know, we had this really tight group of people who knew you could say what you wanted to say, you could do what you want to do, and it was going nowhere. To this day, you know, no one, nothing has ever leaked out, from this group, about what was going on. Because we understood, how important it was, to guard, your privacy. But that's the way it is, with, you know, with your girlfriends that you trust, whether they're First Lady, or they're, anybody. You know, I have, girlfriends that, you know, honestly, that I would say, if I killed somebody, she would, they would say, girl, lemme get a shovel. OK. haha."
Michelle,That's right.
Interviewer,"No, you just know that that's how it is. That's the cycle of, of, of how you're feeling and to let someone vent, and it's, it's an amazing pressure release, because I can say it to you, so I don't have to say it to the person."
Michelle,"I know, right, right, right."
Interviewer,"Oh, I've just got to go solve Mideast peace today. And it's like well did you pick those, did you leave that on the kitchen counter, I mean you know it's like, it all means, you know."
Michelle,"But yeah that's where your girlfriend group, and again, taking this away from the White House, and from me in particular, I mean, the, the truth is is that, we've all been that way with each other, and with the women, and women friends, in our, in our lives, where, you know, having a crew that you can go to and say whatever is on your mind, and not be judged for it, give yourself a space to blow off some steam, this is why when I, I look at some of these, reality TV, I have a love hate relationship with it, but I, I never like the way they portray women friendships, because they're always so catty, and bickering, and argumentative, in ways that I have never experienced among my women friends. Ever. Um, and that has meant so much to me to have women who are secure enough to have friendships like that, that aren't possessive, but are, you know, they're broad, and they're open, and they're, you know, they're inviting. You know, if I ever get to a point in a friendship where I can't say, tell the truth, and know that the trust that we've built up can sustain whatever that truth, or whatever that, maybe it isn't even, maybe it's my truth and it's not your truth. But, you know, if the friendship can't sustain that, then, something else is wrong, and at some point in time, it's gonna come out. It's gonna show itself. But you can't do that if you don't have trust, you know, you can't do that if you don't know that you can come back from it. And that there's genuine love, you know, I know for me, the, the people that can get me riled up are people who I care deeply about. I have such wonderful friends in my life, that it's, you know, I want as much for them as I want for me. But I feel like you all feel the same way, you know. I get that back, that's why these relationships, have sustained themselves over so many years. Because I feel like you guys, have literally, ridden and died with me. haha."
Interviewer,That's what we do.
Michelle,"What you got goin' on, Kelly?"
Interviewer,"I don't know, I just had a moment."
Michelle,"Well, Kelly had a moment."
Interviewer,And you know I have my moments.
Michelle,"I know, what's the moment."
Interviewer,We love you Kelly!
Michelle,Yeah. yeah.
Interviewer,For the last couple years.
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"But isn't it amazing, how quickly though, the time has gone by."
Michelle,New?
Interviewer,"And I'm like, wait a minute that was thirteen years ago. You know, new relative to, you know, we have sort of moved into a different category, and I tell you, and it is, I, I mean, can't tell you how many happy memories I have, of all the things, collectively, individually."
Michelle,"A group of, of good girlfriends, provides a lifeline, that, I, is, is unlike any other. When we can lean on each other, when we can learn from each other, and show up for one another, no matter what we're going through, that is how we grow. It's an evolution that happens not just day-by-day, but moment-by-moment. Interaction-byinteraction - all these little sparks of connection that build on one another. And together, they compose the magic of a life. Doesn't have to be anything flashy. It doesn't need to involve flash bulbs and red carpets. But those sparks we have with the people in our lives keep pushing us forward. Keep helping us evolve. And keep helping us become even more of who we are. So I want to thank Kelly, Danielle, and Sharon for their time, but most of all, I want to thank all of you for, for being here, for listening. These conversations couldn't be more important. Thanks again everybody. I will talk to you again soon."
Interviewer,Got multiple episodes here haha.
Michelle,"Well, see."
Interviewer,"Give us another bottle of that tequila, and we can really go."
Michelle,"You know, the truth is, is that the the presidency isn't ours to own... It's the people's jobs. ... It's not how me and Barack feel... Because we occupied that seat for eight years and did the best that we could do. And the next president that is voted in gets to do the same thing. You know, the question that we have to ask, as citizens and as voters, what direction do we want our country to go in? And we we saw here that when you sit out, sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don't. That's the nature of our democracy."
Interviewer,Why do you think Donald Trump won this election? You probably don't spend much time thinking about it.
Michelle,"Because a lot of people came to the polls, and a lot of people didn't. ... Our democracy is clear. It's just sometimes people think, My vote doesn't count. And that's just so wrong. ... Voting matters. And the people who go to the polls determine how the country is going to be led. The notion that voting doesn't work, that it's fixed. No, it's not. You know? We saw in this midterm people wanted the country to move in a different direction. And they came out in record numbers. And they voted. And that's how it works."
Interviewer,"Do you still believe, 'When they go low, we go high?' After all that has happened?"
Michelle,"Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, what's the alternative? You know, because going low means you're operating from your place of emotion. You know? It doesn't necessarily mean you're operating from a place of results... More often than not, you don't get results when you go low. You just, you know, get your attitude out. ... And... when you're in the White House, and you have that platform, and that responsibility where every word matters, you know, you're often thinking or at least Barack and I often thought, is what we're about to say gonna help? Is it gonna move the needle forward? Or is it just gonna make us feel vindicated in the moment? And you learn that vindication in the moment is so short term. ... Going high doesn't mean you don't feel have feelings, and that you don't express feelings... That you don't acknowledge hurt, or pain, or anger. You know, that's not what going high is. Going high means now you now you have the feeling. How do you express that feeling in the world? And how do you do that responsibly?"
Interviewer,"You end your book with, Let's let kindness in. You still feel optimistic about our country."
Michelle,Yes.
Interviewer,And we the people. We as a nation.
Michelle,"Yeah. Because I I lived in the country, you know? I traveled the country. ... I saw the heart of who we are... Forget race, or party, or ethnicity, or gender. People agree with us or not. People were kind. ... People are worried. People have issues. But everybody's working for the same thing. The same goal. And I got to see that part of America."
Interviewer,You've been out of the White House for 663 days.
Michelle,Oh my gosh. hahaha.
Interviewer,How's it going?
Michelle,It's going okay.
Interviewer,"I want people to get a sense, Michelle, of your life."
Michelle,Uh-huh. Yeah. My life now?
Interviewer,Your life now.
Michelle,Uh-huh.
Interviewer,And that first day. It's one of those rare moments. I call it Toast-gate for lack of a better thing. Toast-gate.
Michelle,"Yeah. hahaha This is how I open up the book, as sort of the life that I was living months after we had moved out of the White House. ... I was alone for the first time in a long time. ... Because for eight years prior to that, I had lived a life where I was always with somebody. There was always a constant presence in the White House. ... But that day... Barack was traveling, Malia was in college, Sasha was somewhere doing something. And it was just me, and Bo, and Sunny, my dogs. ... And I did what I didn't do for eight years, which was open up my own cupboard, pull out some bread, and make some cheese toast."
Interviewer,Did you remember how to do that?
Michelle,I remembered! ... I still had cheese toast skills.
Interviewer,"Throughout the book there is a lot of, Am I good enough? ... You're told by a school counselor, You're not Princeton material... Why did that not destroy you at the time?"
Michelle,"Well, because fortunately... it was the direct opposite of everything I had ever been told about myself. ... I had grown up with love and support and encouragement and high expectations. ... But here I walked into this room with a woman who really didn't know me, because it was a big high school, and she had to make a quick assessment. And her assessment could've been and I don't know was, Grade point average? Yeah, you're a good student. You know, your scores are good. You're black. You're here in this public school. Maybe you're stretching. She didn't even know my brother went to Princeton. She didn't ask me any questions. ... She didn't try to figure me out. She just decided that the dream I presented was wrong. ... But let me tell you... we could probably go into any room of black women, or people of color, or people who grew up in poor communities, or rural communities, and you'd ask them, Has anybody ever told you you couldn't? And everyone would raise their hand."
Interviewer,"You get to Princeton, and one of the first things you notice is... They're not smarter than me."
Michelle,"Mmm-hmm. So now I'm expecting brilliance. Genius. And then what I discover is, wow, there's a lot of arbitrariness to this stuff, you know? Because while a lot of students are sort of criticized, there's a debate about affirmative action when it comes to race. What I point out is that I got to Princeton, I realized there's a whole all kinds of affirmative action that goes on. There are kids who get in because they're athletes. There are kids who get in because there's a legacy. ... It's just that race stands out. ... But it was important for me to see that."
Interviewer,Did you feel you were judged differently? Because you write in the book your grace would have to be earned.
Michelle,Mmm-hmm.
Interviewer,You knew that you you felt you could not stumble.
Michelle,"Yeah. Well I I had experienced that over the course of the campaign. ... I write in Chapter 17, you know, that chapter was probably one of the hardest for me to write. And it's the hardest, still, for me to read. Because it goes over a painful time in the campaign when I thought I was doing great telling my story, sharing it honestly. But... my whole persona was distorted. This was the time I was called an 'angry black woman.' I was called 'Obama's babies' mama.' I was called someone who didn't love her country. And I I I I it's important for me to paint all that. Because people don't remember that. They see Michelle Obama. Now, especially young girls. And they don't they don't they were too young to know that part of my journey."
Interviewer,Let's go back to 'angry black woman.' How did you process that? ... It's painful.
Michelle,"It's like the punch in the gut that the counselor... it was another series of punches. Someone who judged me without knowing me. It was just happening at a bigger level. ... But I had to draw on the same foundation of, I cannot let one, or two, or a few people's judgements of me control me. And at that point I had thought about getting off the campaign trail. And I."
Interviewer,You went to Barack Obama and said.
Michelle,"Yeah. I was like, Look, if I'm not an asset, then just pull me out. And he was like, No. You areyou're the closer. You know, we need you out there. And so I had to get myself together... I'm gonna have to show the world that I do belong. I am good enough to be the first lady. I do love my country."
Interviewer,"You've had a complicated relationship, it seems, with politics."
Michelle,"Mmm-hmm. Every time Barack came to me with the idea of running for an office, I was just like, Please don't do this. Pick another career. You're gifted. Y'all went to college. You got a law degree. Can't you do anything else besides this? There's so many ways to save the world. But every time I had to think to myself, that approach is selfish. Because I knew I was married to someone who was gifted and someone who could contribute. And but for the fact that I was married to him... it would be hard on me I would want him to run."
Interviewer,Yeah. But he was always a different kind of guy.
Michelle,He's a different guy.
Interviewer,"He's a different kind of dude. There's a great story in the book where you said, you wake up one night, and he's staring into space. Is he thinking about his dad? Or is something bothering him?"
Michelle,hahaha Right.
Interviewer,And what was he thinking about?
Michelle,"Like, income inequality. It's like, really, dude? I thought you were dreaming about me."
Interviewer,So you knew he was different. ... You're very candid about talking about marital counseling.
Michelle,"Mmm-hmm. You know, I I tell young couples it's like when you get married, you've got that moment. Those those years, if you're lucky, where it's just the two of you. Individuals on your paths. You come together when you need to. It all works until you have kids. Your first joint project where the inequalities are felt, you know... I'm working, and managing child care, and sick kids, and trying to coordinate my job, and he's flittering in... Tension started to to arise. And we knew that we needed to have a place where we could really work these feelings out."
Interviewer,"Was he like, Great, let's go to counseling?"
Michelle,"Oh, no. Oh, no. No, he was."
Interviewer,I can't wait to go.
Michelle,"He was Barack is a problem solver. It's like, I'll buy a book, and we will study."
Interviewer,hahaha On relationships.
Michelle,"On relationships. And we still study Chapter 12. You read Chapter 13. And we can figure this out. You know? It's just one of those things. It's like we don't need help from anybody. And I was like Because for me I was like, I need to go to somebody who's going to tell you you're wrong exactly, and I talk about that. It's like, well, I didn't get that. The period of counseling, for me, was a turning point. Because I learned that... I was still responsible for my own happiness. ... It wasn't his job to solely make me happy. I had to figure out my space in this."
Interviewer,"Do you still feel if we need to go back, we would do that? Even."
Michelle,Absolutely.
Interviewer,even though that you're so well known now?
Michelle,"Oh, gosh, yes! Yeah. I I I think counseling is one of those tune up times. ... Marriage is hard. All marriages are hard. And even look, I you you know us. I love my husband."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,We have a wonderful marriage. But it takes work.
Interviewer,Stop. hahaha.
Michelle,"Oh, because for the girls. You know, I I I wanted them to come home to family... There was just parts of the girls' lives that I just knew were gonna be okay 'cause mom was there. When I traveled internationally, grandma was there. When I wasn't home at the end of the day, grandma was there. When the kids were still little and they needed to have someone be with them in school. I mean, you think about my girls were being driven around in a motorcade of three cars with at least four grown adults with guns in each of those cars. And I just thought that that's an unnatural way for a little second grader to go to school. Well, mom would ride in the car with her to make it feel like a regular carpool."
Interviewer,"You're in the White House where they say, Mrs. Robinson, can we get you something? Mrs. Robinson, do you need anything?"
Michelle,And she taught the girls how to do their laundry. They would go upstairs for laundry lessons. And she was the most beloved figure in the White House. Let me tell you.
Interviewer,I believe that.
Michelle,"And she had a stream of people. The butlers, the housekeepers. They would all stop by, and they would grandma's room was like the confessional. You know, everyone would go there and just unload, you know? And then they'd leave. People still visit mom in Chicago."
Interviewer,They were like family.
Michelle,"Some of the staff come and visit. If they're in town in Chicago, they visit her."
Interviewer,Do you feel you have your life back? Do you miss the White House at all.
Michelle,"No. No. I mean, the eight years was more than enough. And what I realized over the years is that home is where we are. You know? And the White House happened to be our home for eight years. But we took all that love and energy, and we just moved it to another house. It's still there. And... that's the part of life that's important."
Interviewer,What's the best thing about Michelle Obama that makes you proudest?
Michelle,"And, my brother is here, with me, on my show. We're gonna just talk about life, our life growing up, um, and it's probably good to start at the beginning."
Interviewer,"Do you remember moving from South Parkway, to Euclid?"
Michelle,"No, cause I was one. I was a baby. I have no memories from when I was a baby, so no, OK OK, so we have to explain this, parkway gardens."
Interviewer,We have to explain that.
Michelle,"Was in the 'hood, right, yeah. Mm hmm."
Interviewer,"Right, and it wasn't quite a project, it was a coop. But it was kinda subsidized housing, and in the back, was the, train yard, and it was, a young boy's dream, to sit there and just watch all of these things going on, there were cranes back there, there were trucks back there, men with hard hats, and lunch boxes, oh man."
Michelle,"Say a little boy's fantasy, sitting and watching, grown men with lunchboxes and helmets, hahaha."
Interviewer,"Boxes, and mom used to let me sit out there and eat my lunch, when they were eating lunch, and watch what they were doing, oh I remember that."
Michelle,"You and your little boy wonder thought, we're living large! We are in the back in the alley, by the trains! You could've been, in a castle."
Interviewer,"I did! there, there's a big, 8 foot fence, with a top layer of barbed wire, three rows aboMichelle."
Michelle,That was just cool.
Interviewer,"It was like, barbed wire? Are you kidding me? Do you know if you threw an apple and you hit that, it would stick?"
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"I remember, a couple of things. I remember first and foremost in the summertime, how hot, it got."
Michelle,"Oh yeah, because there was no A/C!"
Interviewer,"I don't think, was A/C invented back then?"
Michelle,"You know, haha Our aunt Robbie, owned the home, with her husband, Terry, uncle, Victor Terry."
Interviewer,"Victor Terry, yes."
Michelle,"But we called him Terry for some, strange reason."
Interviewer,"a distinguished, the most distinguished man we knew at the time... distinguished."
Michelle,"we ever knew, I mean, Terry was, he was trip, you know, now we know it as distinguished, but when we were little he was just kinda odd."
Interviewer,"It was like, why is this guy dressed up all the time?"
Michelle,He wore a three piece suit every day. Every day.
Interviewer,Every day.
Michelle,"He'd be mowin' the lawn, with his fedora on."
Interviewer,"And the, he still had the vest on, he took the jacket off, when he was cutting the grass, but he still had the vest on, yeah."
Michelle,"Yes, when he was cutting the grass doin' yard work, hahaha he was a little bit relaxed, his tie on every single day."
Interviewer,Tie!
Michelle,"When I think of Euclid, when I think of our childhood, I think of music. Music was the backdrop of everything. We didn't do anything without music, and that's because our father, was a big jazz lover, and had a huge jazz uh, album collection, that he, that he cherished and our maternal grandfather, Southside, was a big music enthusiast. And he had, he had a wall full of jazz albums."
Interviewer,"I remember, both of those homes, Southside's home and our home where you walk in, and dad's got a record playing. And it could've been Dizzy Gillespie, or Miles Davis, or."
Michelle,"Thelonius Monk, was one of his, we thought that was some made-up name."
Interviewer,"Thelonius Monk, was one of his, favorites, yeah, we did. hahaha."
Michelle,"Thelonius Monk, it's like really? Dad, is that really his name? Who did that? Who did that to that man."
Interviewer,"Yeah, fingers on the."
Michelle,"You had to hold the rim like it was a precious disc, and you'd just blow on it, you know to clean it,  just a light blow, you couldn't spit on it, you know, it was a light blow. Then you'd lay it on the turn table, put it on the first song, and let it play. You know, and we, used to like a certain song on an album, you tried to put it in that little groove, and you'd always get in trouble, because you."
Interviewer,"Because it would go, werrrr! yes, right."
Michelle,"Or you'd scratch it, you know, but we were still allowed to figure it out, you know, it was, there was nev, never any hands off, so we had our own albums, and played our own music, and one of my favorites was the Jackson 5."
Interviewer,"Mm hmm, Yes, 45, Record player."
Michelle,"It wasn't the stereo system, but it was the thing you plugged in, and you could put the disc, in the 45, to play it, mm hmm."
Interviewer,"So you could play it, yeah."
Michelle,"Mm hmm, but we used to love playing the Jackson 5."
Interviewer, Stop the love you say baby.
Michelle, Darling take it slow.
Interviewer,"Right, yeah."
Michelle,"Playing lullabies and we both took piano lessons, although you gave up quite early, but you never looked like you practiced, you never did."
Interviewer,"Nah, uh, well, I pr-, I would practice."
Michelle,I never saw it hahaha.
Interviewer,"But I would practice the bare minimum, if if they said you should practice thirty minutes I would practice thirty minutes and like fifteen seconds. And that's it, I'm done, I'm going on to the next thing."
Michelle,"It's like and that's it, I'm done, I'm out."
Interviewer,"Uh, and you were very hard on yourself. I'm gonna digress a little bit, because you would practice, and here's our practice. I'm playing the tune, and I hit a wrong note, I just keep going, and I finish it off, and then I'll go back again. You practice, you dun dun dun da dun er- uh, I gotta start over. dun dun dun da dun er- gotta start over. Dun dun dun da dun dun dun dun da dun, der, and you just kept starting over, cause you had to play the whole thing perfectly."
Michelle,"Whole thing through perfectly, well that was."
Interviewer,"That's, that's maddening."
Michelle,"You all teased me a little bit about the perfectionism, but you didn't make me feel bad about it, you know."
Interviewer,"No, it was it was it was like a badge of honor, slash, joke, slash, I hope she grows out of this, hahaha."
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"I remember you saying I've got a good idea, haha."
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"We can't get mom and dad to stop smoking, let's break all their cigarettes!"
Michelle,"It's like, sounded like a good plan!"
Interviewer,And it sounded like a great idea.
Michelle,"Well that was after a couple of other attempts, we tried to dip their, remember we took the tips of the cigarettes and dipped 'em in hot sauce, and lemon juice, thinkin' that that would haha."
Interviewer,"Dipped 'em in, in lemon juice, and then put hot sauce on it, that that would turn them off."
Michelle,"That that would turn them, that they would've notice, that their cigarettes were damp, hahaha that they would just think, oooh, cigarette butts are hot, you know maybe I should cut this out, you know, hahaha."
Interviewer,"And I, I remember, distinctly, dad putting one in his mouth, and going, there's something wrong with these filters, haha."
Michelle,"And it didn't work. So I guess we figured after we dipped them, dipped the tips in lemon juice and hot sauce, then, what was left, but to just crush them, into, into teeny pieces."
Interviewer,Just destroy 'em.
Michelle,"So who actually did the crushing, I don't remember."
Interviewer,"No we both did, I remember, because there was, there were like two cartons underneath the sink, and we opened."
Michelle,"And, and we didn't even realize how expensive cigarettes were, you know, mmm hmm, yeah, yeah."
Interviewer,"Cigarettes were, yeah, and we broke, two cartons worth, but the really, scary but funny thing about that whole thing was, when mom, when they got home, and they were looking for their cigarettes, and they were going around the house, and we're sittin' there, trying to look innocent."
Michelle,"And we're and we're sitting there, in front of the TV, looking like, mmm, right hahaha."
Interviewer,"And, but, but, always thinking, it's working, they won't be able to smoke, they're gone, this'll be the end of it."
Michelle,"They won't know, they won't notice, that their cigarettes are missing, and this'll be it. Right they'll be like Oh, well, can't find our cigarettes, I guess we're done with that bad habit."
Interviewer,"And then finally, mom steps on the garbage can, and the top lifts up, and she's, Frasier! Frasier! Get in here! Craig! Michelle! What is going on! Well, and by then, we were in tears, crying, like oops!"
Michelle,"Cause it's like, now we didn't really, think this through. This, this isn't how this was supposed to end."
Interviewer,"This, this is not how we thought the reaction would be."
Michelle,"We were supposed to end happily, with people, with our parents going, well you young people were correct, and I'm glad you threw away our cigarettes, and now we know the error of our ways, it didn't work out that way, we got in trouble."
Interviewer,We got in trouble.
Michelle,We got in so much trouble.
Interviewer,"Give me, one of your best memories."
Michelle,"Once I, got up the gumption to go outside, cause you know what kind of kid I was, right, I'm like, hahaha."
Interviewer,"Whoa, yeah, whoo, you had a, there was a force field around that house, you never left."
Michelle,"I know, and I write about it in the book, it's like I really did believe that little kids were kind of messy, you know, I mean, and my, I liked my little world, of my dolls, and the scenarios I would set up with my blocks, and your G.I. Joe's, you know so there was that part of the house for me, that felt like a sanctuary, it's like, in our little play space, I'd have my world set up, and I was very territorial."
Interviewer,"Oh, yes yeah I notice, I noticed, I didn't read too much about how you used to keep me away from your situations."
Michelle,"I think I wrote about that, I think I was honest about the fact that I didn't want you interfering, I didn't want your energy, because I created a whole world for myself, where Barbie and Ken, they were divorcing, or they had a baby, there was some drama, going on, and I felt like your play energy, would mess with my, the plot line, of my, of my doll life. I remember that about Euclid, you know, playing in the house, until, I got ready, to be outside, with the other kids."
Interviewer,"You loved your inside. But you would come out in the backyard because you were, you, you'd play with me, and I don't think people really know, you used to play football, in the backyard, you would play baseball in the backyard, we'd play wiffleball, you could hit, you could catch, we'd play, running bases, when we had a third, if dad came back there."
Michelle,"Well I was like your little, play dummy."
Interviewer,Yes!
Michelle,"Because, and I talk about this, because that was, the part of the beauty of our relationship, even though I could be a little brat, you always included me. And dad always expected me, to be able to be your equal in sports, so you never babied me, you know, like, you, you can hit the ball, you can catch, you can run, you can throw, and you guys, you, you and dad never excluded me from learning how to box, learning how to do everything that the boys were doing. And I really reveled in the fact that I could keep up with my big brother. Yes."
Interviewer,"Aw, well that's good, but, it was selfish, 'cause I knew once you got good you could come up with us to the park and be on our team."
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"Just, up and down the street. The big step was going around the block. Whaaaah!"
Michelle,Woooaaaah! That's just like.
Interviewer,"Do you remember the first time, we rode around the corner together, around the block?"
Michelle,"Absolutely, yes. Tell the story. I wanna hear your version of the story."
Interviewer,"That was, oh, it was, first of all, I was so proud that mom let me have you with no supervision off the block."
Michelle,She worked that up to be like you were taking me to the moon!
Interviewer,"I, you would've thought I was taking you in the car somewhere. I almost crashed, cause I was too busy turning around, looking at you to make sure you were right behind me! I was like you OK?! I'm OK! you OK?! I'm OK! You know, thinking about that, that was a big milestone for mom, letting your kids be independent, and you know, I, I think, things that mom and dad let us do that way, sorta helped our development."
Michelle,"You have to teach kids how to be independent, which means that at some point you've got to trust them that they can make decisions on their own, which, now that we're parents, you kinda think, how hard that is, to let your kids, go. You know. To let a five year old, and a, you were seven?"
Interviewer,Seven.
Michelle,"It showed that she trusted you. You know, which, meant that I could trust my big brother, right."
Interviewer,"Yeah, isn't that something."
Michelle,"Mm hmm, you're probably right."
Interviewer,"The one I got wrong, menstruation."
Michelle,haha uh huh.
Interviewer,"Hadn't heard the word, ever, because I'm older than you, and you hadn't gotten there yet, and mom never talked about it. So I put that under, Men. Because it had menstruation."
Michelle,Men-struation. haha.
Interviewer,"That that wasn't a problem. The problem was I only got one wrong, so mom got a call from the school, saying, we have something we'd like to talk to you about. We had a sex ed test, and your son got too many right."
Michelle,That's crazy.
Interviewer,Isn't that crazy.
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And she, went up to school, and talked to."
Michelle,"So what were they, were they accusing you of cheating, were they accusing you of being, being a pervert, what?"
Interviewer,"No, no, they, I don't know what they were accusing me of."
Michelle,"I mean, what was, what was the problem?"
Interviewer,"I think the problem was, they were worried I was too far ahead, to be in the class with all these kids who didn't know the."
Michelle,For sex ed?
Interviewer,For sex ed.
Michelle,"Where were they gonna put you, in an advanced sex ed class?"
Interviewer,"I don't know, yeah, I don't know."
Michelle,"Were they gonna send you to the playboy mansion? I don't, I mean, what, uh, it's like sometimes the logic, of grown people, as they deal with children. Right."
Interviewer,"And it's, it is a real testament to mom's parenting, because she didn't go crazy, she want up and talk to the teachers, and, said, did it ever dawn on you, that, when kids ask you questions you just tell them the right answers?"
Michelle,Mmm hmm.
Interviewer,Absolutely.
Michelle,haha That was a big deal.
Interviewer,"That was a big deal, going to the drive in, and we have our own car, a lot of our friends didn't have cars, you know, we live in a nice place, I was like, by golly, we must be rich. And he said, well, you know, if you think we're rich. I'm gonna show you. The next time I get paid, I'll show you how our budget works. So, Friday he gets paid, he gets paid all of his check in cash. And he was like, hey, Kat, come in here, cause he used to call me Kat, and I'd go in their bedroom, and, on the bed, he's laid out, what, was probably, you know, 400 dollars, but it looked like it was like, 2000 dollars. Sittin' on the bed. And, he said, well, here's what I get paid. And I was like, Oh my god! We ARE rich!"
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"And he was like wait, whoa, wait a minute, hang on, he was like, where do we live? I was like we live here, and he was like, well we have to pay rent here, and I was like oh, yeah, that makes sense, so how much is that? And he takes a few twenties off, and he puts that aside, so that goes over there, and I was like man, we, so we, we are rich. And he was like, whoa, whoa, that car out there, that deuce and a quarter, that costs so we have to pay for that every month, that's $100 a month, so he takes another hundred dollars off, and he proceeds to do this with all the bills, and we get down, to where he's got like, $50, and I'm still thinking, $50! That's a lot of money. And he was like well wait, wait, we gotta buy groceries. And we have to buy gas for the car, and, you guys like eating out every now and then, so he got down, um, to where there was $20 left. For the week. And then he said he had to give us a little allowance. And it basically got down to where there was $10 left. Now I left out a very important part, because here's where I get my, sort of fiscal responsibility. Before he did anything, he took out $20 and paid himself and said, that goes into a savings account. And I think that's the kind of, lesson that could've been learned in a bunch of different ways, but he had a way of making that one, I mean that's, I remember that like it happened two weeks ago."
Michelle,Mm Hmm.
Interviewer,"This conversation with the former First Lady, Michelle Obama, continues after the break."
Michelle,"Well, everybody knows I love my big brother, and you were one of my favorite people in the whole wide world, you were my first hero, but, it's not like you're not a pain in the butt sometimes. For example, going to college with your big brother, who is a star athlete, entering Princeton and trying to, you know, create my own space, and having this big, looming shadow, of a brother over me, that was kinda, a pain. hahaha."
Interviewer,"Yeah, it's tough, it was tough. You, you're really paying me back now, because now I can't walk down the street without people, like, are you Michelle's brother? Can I take a picture? hahaha."
Michelle,"It's like, I love it. I love it. It's like payback. payback."
Interviewer,"But what about you? Now, you were an athlete, who didn't play organized sports. That's how I, always described you, because I've, I've seen you run as fast, as boys, and play softball with the boys, but you chose, not to play organized sports. In high school."
Michelle,"Mm hmm, some of it, was, as the younger one, I was trying to contrast myself against you. And because you were the sport kid, even though I liked sports, it was almost like people assumed, you know, you must play basketball. You know, so, little stubborn me, was still like, Oh, you, you assume I should play basketball? Well I'm gonna go over here, and I'm gonna learn how to dance. And I'm gonna do ballet, and I'm gonna do, all these things, because basketball is what my brother does, don't define me by what he does, I do something else. And I will do it, just to spite you. Don't make me."
Interviewer,"Now that's the Meesh I know! that's the Meesh I know! Everybody, you heard that? You heard it here first."
Michelle,"It also makes me think, when we talk about sports, and all that, I think about, how, important sports and athletics, and movement, has been to, our family. Um. How much our dad's disability played a role in how, we value sports, and how we value movement, and I was just wondering, if you thought about that too."
Interviewer,"You know, I, it, it took me a while to come to grips with the fact that dad had, had MS, as a disability. Um. Multiple sclerosis, and, I didn't really come to, the realization that he was disabled, until we'd go somewhere, and people would say hey what's wrong with your dad's leg? and I'd be like, oh, yeah, I, he's got a bad back, he walks with a limp, he's had it all the time, but it doesn't affect, what he has to do, he gets up and does everything. So, most of my childhood, I blocked that out. I blocked out the fact that he had a disability until it started to get progressively worse."
Michelle,"We argued over what kind of casket to get dad. And I was like, my emotions said, get him the most expensive thing, because that shows our love, and it can't be cheap, and, you were like, he's dead. And, dad wouldn't want us to spend a bunch of money on a box, and, we got into it."
Interviewer,We did.
Michelle,But I don't remember it. You remember.
Interviewer,"I, to me what I remember was really, the aftermath of it. Because I know we argued about the coffin, but the best part about the fight was, that, we tried to have a real fight, and we didn't know how. We didn't know how to fight, cause we never got into any fights, and so, mom, just starts laughin', is like, do you all hear yourselves? You all hear yourselves? Frasier would be here crackin' up. And then we started, we were like laughin' and cryin' at the same time, that's how I remember that, and my question to you, is, what kind of went through your mind, looking back now, on, dad's death, and, how do you see that having, played out in our lives? Him dying so early."
Michelle,"Dad was always the glue for the whole family. Not just us, but for mom's side of the family, as well as his side of the family. He was, the, the patriarch, you know. People came to dad, because dad couldn't come to everybody, so that made our house, a hub, in so many ways. And I think when we lost him, it threw us for a second. It's like, OK, here's our, here's our core, our core was missing. And so, we had to kind of rebound. And, remember, all that he taught us. And understand that family is key, we won't have dad as our excuse. To, keep things going, so we've got to be pretty consistent about setting up rituals, and routines, and, as a result, we were always close, but I felt like after dad's death, we were closer, you know."
Interviewer,Oh yeah.
Michelle,"Yeah which was not, that helpful, you know."
Interviewer,"Yeah it just ruined your whole dating, college."
Michelle,"I mean I don't know what it did, who knows the amount of play I could've gotten."
Interviewer,"There may have been one or two guys you dated that I absolutely did not like. But for the most part, your decisions on who to date, were solid, you know, just being able to, judge people, and develop your own relationships, and be able to navigate that, at a young age, and you were usually a pretty short term dating, eh, lemme date this guy for a month, nah, and then lo and behold you meet, uh, Barack Obama. So after a while, you were like finally gonna let us meet him. You drove up in your nice black Saab, and you were driving of course, and he gets out of the passenger side, and I remember the first thing mom said, Oooh he's tall, he's kinda good lookin'."
Michelle,"What you thought of him, was important to me."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"So, I did ask you, in the, the way that we learned, that you could check out the character of another dude, was to, take him on the court, and play some basketball."
Interviewer,"Yeah. And I'm like whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute, these are professionals I play with, we can't just be bringing some guy there, it'll make him look bad, so I was like, ugh, lemme figure how to do this out. So we have this pickup game, and, when you play pickup basketball, a lot is based on integrity. Because you have to call your own fouls, there are no referees. And there's always that guy who, acts like he's a good dude, until, he has to make his own calls, and he's callin' fouls all the time, well Barack wasn't that guy, and that was good to see, that was the first thing. The second thing, is, he could actually play a little bit. He wasn't lying about that he played, about how good he was."
Michelle,About how good he was.
Interviewer,"He was just like, I play a little bit, and, it spoke a lot to his authenticity, as far as I was concerned."
Michelle,"That was kind of a big star, in his column, that said, OK we can keep going forward. So thank you for that, thank you for that."
Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, my pleasure, I'm glad it worked out."
Michelle,"Because of dad's death, you were the person that I would go to, so, in in that way, I depend on you, more. For all the things that dad would do, for that double check. For that gut check, for that, I'm feeling nervous, just like when Barack was running, for office, you know, I mean, it's like, talking to you about my fears about it, you know, having you assure me that this is gonna be OK, like, you were the one that said, you know, you married a guy who has this kind of ambition, and this, in his heart, so, what are you gonna do. You might, I don't know if you remember what you said."
Interviewer,"Oh I remember it, I remember, because, you were in one of your moods, where you were like, nah, I want my husband to be like Frasier Robinson. And, first of all, that's not fair to anybody. That dude, he was a special guy, and there was no way you were gonna put that pressure on any guy, it wouldn't ever work, you'd never be married, but second of all, was what I said about, I was like listen, you're trying to penalize, because, let's face it, none of us thought, that Barack could do what he was talking about doing. You know, I mean I remember."
Michelle,"Well I don't know that he thought, he."
Interviewer,"No, well, I will tell you, he may not have told you this, but when we first met, and he came over for the first Thanksgiving, I figured I'm gonna do the brother in law thing and take him to the side, hey man, dad's not here, what do you think you're gonna be doing for your future, and he was like, well, I would love to try this political thing, and I was like oh, really, like, so like like what do you want to run for Mayor, or for Alderman, and he's like you know, eh, may, more, a little bigger than that, so, maybe I'd run for Congress, or, run for the Senate. Or maybe even run for President. And I was like, shhhh shhh man, you don't want to say that too loud around here, folks'll think you crazy!"
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"And lo and behold, he makes it."
Michelle,"Yeah, at the, at the Hyatt, or wherever we were."
Interviewer,"And we had this dinner, we were gonna have, that was gonna be normal, no TV's, nobody had their phones on the table, and all the kids were there, and we're sittin' there trying to talk about things, as if we were, you know, had just played, had had the kids had a soccer match, and we were over on a Saturday afternoon, like we would normally do. And all of a sudden,  then you hear your phone buzz, then you hear my phone buzz, but Barack looks at his phone, and he, he takes a look at it, holds it up, looks at it, straight on, parallel, sets it back down. And he says, Well it looks like we're gonna win. And you were like, Oh. And no one said anything. For what felt like, fifteen minutes. But it probably was just, you know, forty seconds. And, mom said, Well I guess we'd better get ready. haha."
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"And all I could think of, was oh my gosh, Barack's gonna be President and you're gonna be the First Lady."
Michelle,"At Grant Park, lit up."
Interviewer,"At Grant Park, lit up, filled with people, a whole row of media."
Michelle,"The bulletproof glass, the first time."
Interviewer,"With the bulletproof glass, and, everything, just came hittin', it was like, this has to be a television show, and then you guys, go out there, and it's like, you're, the Beatles."
Michelle,"And it felt so, eerily silent. You know, I mean people were excited, it was, it felt palpable, but it also felt, like a calm, in a way, that, because the whole city was shut down, in order for this thing to take place, in Grant Park, so all the people had to get to the park on public transportation, or on buses."
Interviewer,"Or walk, yeah."
Michelle,"Or walk, and those tens of thousands of people all parked somewhere in the city and walked to that park that night."
Interviewer,"And, and what I remember, distinctly, was there was a feeling of, both, relief, and hope. And what people ask me all the time, once you got there, was, hey how do you deal with the fact that people say all these horrible things about your sister, and your brother in law, and, you know they don't understand, how we view, life, right, and I always would tell them I was like, listen. We grew up with Frasier and Marian Robinson. First of all, you do not really care what people who don't know you think about you. That if you're doing what you love to do, and you're doing the best job that you can do, it doesn't matter what those people say, and I just used that when I would listen to people talk about you, on Fox, or on CNN, or they'd, you know, they'd write mean stories and people would try and get me to be upset about it, and I was like listen, these two are doing what they love to do. And they're trying to do the best for the most people. And that makes me proud."
Michelle,"I never questioned that I would have the support of my brother, and my mom, although, when we, when Barack was elected, and it was time to move, to the White House, one of the things that I wanted, was to have mom come, and live with me, but when I asked mom, would you come move to the White House? She was like, no, you don't, I don't need to be in the White House, I'm fine here, and you, cause mom had been helping me with the kids all through the campaign, and even before that, just balancing things, but, who was the one who was able to convince mom to move to the White House?"
Interviewer,"I, I was able to convince mom to move to the White House, but."
Michelle,Why? Because.
Interviewer,"Because I'm her favorite, that's why. I'm the favorite, but."
Michelle,"Yes, let the record show. Yes, yes, let's just take a moment to pause, America. Yes, Michelle Obama, is the least favorite child."
Interviewer,hahaha.
Michelle,"That Marian Robinson, loves her son, and I could be First Lady, I could be the queen of England, and she's still gonna be like, where's Craig? When's Craig comin'? haha So thankfully, you convinced her, that her poor daughter."
Interviewer,"Yes, and I think mom kinda understood when I presented it to her, that, you, guys are gonna be so busy, she's not gonna be intruding at all, the, deciding factor was the girls really needed some stability while you all were trying to figure out what this new part of life was gonna be."
Michelle,"And trying to create some continuity in their lives, with this big transition, was so important, and we all knew that, so, it wasn't just, mom moving, but, everybody, in our family, our friends, made it a point, to be there for us, so it was almost like every major thing we did in the White House, we invited our friends and family, and created new traditions, everybody came to the White House with us, which had to have been a huge sacrifice on you all's part."
Interviewer,"Yeah, but we all felt like we were part of the team, of, hey let's help, you guys help this country, you know, and by helping you guys, meant helping the family."
Michelle,"Mm hmm, yeah."
Interviewer,"So, people think that that's this glamorous thing that you have, that they don't realize is so, intrusive, and out of the ordinary. So how do you, how do you deal with that."
Michelle,"Well first of all, to the credit of the secret service, they have some of the most professional people there. Um, trained, they care about what they do, they know what they're doin', you know, so first of all, we have to go in thinking, this is their job too, right. Because if something happens to me, or to the girls, there's a congressional hearing. Somebody could lose a job, and I would have to explain that to the girls, it's like, you know, I would joke, and it's like, you know what the secret service are here to protect the Commander in Chief of the United States of America, we are ancillary to that. You know, we are protected because if something happens to us, it could jeopardize the security of the nation, not because they care about you, Malia. haha It's like they don't want to follow around an eight year old, either. You know, think about how not fun it is for them to be sittin', in a car while you're at a play date, but with that said, you know, Malia and Sasha each had a pretty extensive detail, you know, each of them had a armored car that they were in, with two drivers and a lead car, with more men, with guns, and some women, and a follow car. Imagine a second grader, that's how Sasha went to school every day. That's how Malia went to school every day. This was all great when the kids were little, right, because, their agents were like their best friends, it was like uncles, and so you had agents that, they were out at recess, with the rest of the kids, pushing, the kids on the swings, and they were in classrooms, and kids would bring the agents cookies, and make sure, so the whole school kind of started to know, you know that Malia and Sasha had a detail. We also were lucky that the girls went to the school with the Biden grandkids, um, as well and are good friends, so, Malia and Sasha weren't the only kids in their school with a detail, so that kinda helped. Like when Barack was coaching the vipers, Sasha's fourth grade uh, rec basketball league..."
Interviewer,Packed house.
Michelle,"Packed house. Half of 'em, because we brought like a hundred people, that are guarding us. And you've got agents linin' up on the wall trying not to cheer, and Joe's yellin' at Maize, and screamin' score, score! It, it was a scene, it was kind of a spectacle. The, the leaders of the most powerful nation were in a gym, watching fourth grade girls, go up and down."
Interviewer,In bad basketball.
Michelle,In bad basketball.
Interviewer,"What I want to know is, at what point did you say, OK, although I'm the First Lady, I'm gonna treat these girls and their activities, like I'm a regular mom."
Michelle,"Yeah, I mean that just came with it, it was like, if they're gonna be normal, we have to be normal parents. We made sure they had responsibilities, and so, we had to do things like, institute rules that the housekeepers couldn't clean the girls' rooms, and that they had to make up their own beds, and have a set of chores, at least, you know, we grew up, you know, we, each of us, we had our own set of responsibilities."
Interviewer,"Right, right, right."
Michelle,"I don't know if, I remember what you did, but I know I had to clean the bathroom, we each had to do the dishes, we had our shared nights of doing the dishes. What was your what what did you do?"
Interviewer,"I had Monday Wednesday Friday, you had Tuesday Thursday Saturday, and mom did 'em on Sunday. I also had yard duty, cut the grass, rake the leaves, I also, and, and what are you like, I don't know what your duties were."
Michelle,"Well, I, they weren't my duties, I thought they were just."
Interviewer,Did you take the garbage out? I took the garbage out.
Michelle,I'm sure I took the garbage out at some point.
Interviewer,"Yeah, after I left, but I, spent my years taking the garbage out."
Michelle,"You know, and you know that's how mom was, you know, as a grandmother, she showed up totally different. You know."
Interviewer,"She sure did, she sure did."
Michelle,"Cause she spoils our kids, it's like, she acts like, you know, why do they have chores? It's like, because you taught us, to be, where, who are you, lady?"
Interviewer,"Yeah, one of the memories that's most vivid in my mind, is, dad asking me, now remember, dad can barely get himself around, and he asked me to come down, and help him give Terry a bath, because he really couldn't give him a bath and lift him up, and to see dad bathing this man, and this man being so thankful, you know, I get, I'm, I get choked up just thinkin' about it."
Michelle,"And he was, Terry, uncle terry was a dignified man, this was the."
Interviewer,"Dignified, yes."
Michelle,"This was the man who wore three piece suits and a fedora, he was a Pullman porter, he was an elegant man, but he got old. And he couldn't care for himself, and it was just a given that, our parents, but we also saw the toll, that that can take, because there was a period of time, when Robbie was really sick, and before she got care, that mom was, she was working, she was taking care of us, but at night, she would have to bathe her, and make sure she got fed, and I remember, how tired mom was, before she decided you know what I can't do all of this by myself, but I think because of mom's experience with Robbie, um, she is very determined to be independent."
Interviewer,At some point she's gon' be livin' with one of us.
Michelle,"One of us, you know."
Interviewer,And it's just a matter of who it's gon' be.
Michelle,"And I'm the mean one, so."
Interviewer,"So it'll probably be, us but that's quite alright."
Michelle,"No no I'm mean in terms of I'm the one that's gonna make the call, cause you won't, mom will be like fallin' in the bathroom, and you're like well she wants to live on her own. She will definitely live with one of us. But everybody loves mom, so you know, it's more a fight over who, gets to have her, hahaha."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,"And the other thing, that, I kinda, take away from our childhood, and I think one of the reasons that we get along so well, the fact that, I never felt like I was competing with you. And I think that mom and dad did a good job of, recognizing us as individuals. And so I've tried to do that with Malia and Sasha, is like, give them a moment, you know, to show me who they are. Right, because you know, like I said earlier, kids come here with a certain temperament, I was always feisty, I was always an internal perfectionist, Sasha's temperament is different from Malia's, that's different from Leslie, your daughter, that's different from Avery, and it's like you've got to give them space, and parent the kid you have, not the kid you want. And mom I, and dad were good about that. So I always felt secure in who I was, and fine with who you were. You know, your success was my success. I wasn't competing with you. So I'm trying my best to make sure that Malia and Sasha feel like they're on the same team, even though they're two girls, and, all that, their success is each other's success, that's all you have. That sibling relationship, is special."
Interviewer,"That's, that's a really good one, you have to show up is absolutely right."
Michelle,"I can always, trust who you are. And I don't know that everybody can say that about their siblings, you know. Um, that, I know, I know who you are, through and through, I mean, that's, that's the wish that I have for all of our kids. Is that, all of our nieces and nephews, our kids, that they show up in the world. I don't care, who, who they are, what their titles are, I don't care how much money they make, I don't care whether they're famous or not, I want them to show up, with empathy, with, consistency, with honesty, you know, with decency, and, if we, if we can pass on to them, those traits that our parents passed on to us, I will tap out, and view us as successful old people. haha When the time comes."
Interviewer,"But this was really, enjoyable."
Michelle,Love you.
Interviewer,Love you.
Michelle,"Well, as you can see, I am so grateful for the relationship that I have with my brother. To be able to trust him, to be able to count on him, to know that he's always gonna show up for me, that's a gift that, I cannot replace. And so if you have a sibling in your life, whether that's by blood or by choice, I hope that you'll take some time to dig into that relationship with them too. I bet it will be as meaningful for you as it was for us. Thanks so much for listening everybody, and I will talk to you again soon."

Michelle,Remember going into the library in our neighborhood was three blocks from our house and my mom who was a housewife at.

Michelle,Library card and stand like counter high watching them put me into the official files I felt really important I didn't.

Michelle,It and we would go to the library it was a community spaces all of you all know the library for us like for all of you.

Michelle,Immersed in that process so this year has been a little tougher for me because I'm trying to you know stay in my voice.

Michelle,Was to meet bruce springsteen i mean Melissa went to her is my book recommender she loves you all and I may.

Michelle,Yeah get lost in a book you know i couldn't read in the White House at times there were just too much going on.
Interviewer,And we were running so fast that whenever I got a chance to sit down and pick up a book I would get maybe a.
Michelle,Sentence and i would fall asleep so i literally sitting down I don't know if I was napping or passed out I did I.
Interviewer,Couldn't tell the difference i'd wake up and it would be an hour and I think I thought I was I asleep that's how the.
Michelle,White house years felt so usually on a longer trip I could get into a book but it was you know it was a hectic eight.
Interviewer,Years now you said pick up a book so that implies the physical book oh I already bought you books yeah I'm not an.
Michelle,E-reader i like to have a book in my hand yeah I mean even in my writing process I.
Interviewer,Like to hold it i don't i can't really edit things on the computer well I feel like I have to I have to write down my.
Michelle,Thoughts i can jot down things on a on an iPhone but that's hard I have to feel it I have to still be able to touch it.
Interviewer,I'm old sorry so I we still have a lot of books in our house and my husband who as you know as.
Michelle,An avid reader and still loves books around everywhere we've gone he's just boxes and boxes of books that I can't.

Interviewer,School but then i graduated to a job downtown the bindery was downtown and a friend's mother worked there and my job.
Michelle,Entailed doing one thing a thousand times every day all day over and over again so I got to put the little metal.
Interviewer,Thing in a hole and then pass the cardboard over to the guy that would slam it down so my job was to take the.
Michelle,Metal thing put it in the hole and pass it and I was good with doing that for the first day even I thought you know.
Interviewer,I'm gonna and i'm gonna was aiming at finishing it I thought there would be an end to it that there were like thousands.
Michelle,Of them and i would prove to the bindery people that I was so fast so that I can complete it and I would be.
Interviewer,Done and i just realized it's never over they just kept coming the little pieces of cardboard and the little things and.
Michelle,That went on for weeks and weeks and weeks doing the same thing and I just thought my god I'm ready for college I.
Interviewer,Can i can do this but it taught me great respect for the men and women who do that work every day that thankless work.
Michelle,That makes it possible for us to have books and folders and you know I'm I learned work ethic at the bindery the.
Interviewer,The dozens of people in that plant who came there and they did the same job every day for years and years and years.
Michelle,You know it reminded me of my father those those blue-collar workers who didn't look for passion in their jobs.
Interviewer,They didn't have the luxury like we did to think about doing the things that we love they had to do things that put food.
Michelle,On the table and that was my first experience shoulder-to-shoulder with men and women who were making a living for.
Interviewer,Their families now you mentioned your father so many times about his work ethic and what it took for him to go to.
Michelle,Work and and provide and things you saw it first oh my father Frazier Robinson man he was you know every value that I.
Interviewer,Have in me came from my mother and father and watching them day to day as most people know my father was a.
Michelle,Blue-collar worker worked the same job his entire life worked at the water filtration plant and my father had MS.
Interviewer,And contracted it at the prime of his life so I never knew him to be able to walk without the assistance of a cane.
Michelle,But my father got up every day was a shift job so you know some days he was on days some days it was on nights some.
Interviewer,Days he was on evenings so his schedule changed and I remember him putting on his white t-shirt and his blue button-up.
Michelle,Uniform and getting his crutches and making his way out the back door to the car.
Interviewer,To go to his job without complaint without regret because he was proud that he had a job that allowed him to invest.
Michelle,In his children me and my brother you know with that blue-collar salary he put two of us through college and Princeton.
Interviewer,At that and he made sure that you know and those were we went to those schools long before they had you know the.
Michelle,Financial assistance that puts you completely through we were still paying my parents had to pay a portion of our.
Interviewer,Tuition and he made sure that our tuition was paid on time we never were going to be late and not be able to.
Michelle,Register for our classes so who i am today is so much of it's because of my parents and that hard work ethic and you.
Interviewer,Know the values of your word is your bond you do what you say you're going to do you know Trust is important honor.
Michelle,Honesty you know i saw my father behave in that way every single day with everyone regardless of race or station.
Interviewer,In life so that's who i think about when I write my book and I how I carry myself in the world I do what I think Marion.

Interviewer,Yes she's just calling eight hey mom sorry and so whenever anything happens she says this is Robinson.
Michelle,She's models after your mom oh yeah and how your mom handled all of that so she your mom was right there with you well.

Michelle,Full-time job i was at at any point in time I was a professional with a big job of my own and we had two little kids and.
Interviewer,We had you know we could afford help and we had a couple of great babysitters but you know the time I lost that one good.
Michelle,Babysitter and that crushed me like nothing else I mean when glow when she said she had to leave because she.
Interviewer,Couldn't needed to make more money i thought I was losing an arm you know Brock was trying to console me and I was.
Michelle,Like dude just get out of here you are of no help to me I need Glo I don't need you do nothing for me but I remember.
Interviewer,That pain and i thought how can i go to work every day and not know that my kids are good that there was somebody who.
Michelle,Loves them which is not to you know get on a soapbox which is why affordable child care is so important because so.
Interviewer,Many having access to that kind of security for all the families out there who don't have a choice they have to go.
Michelle,To work i know that that pain of what it feels like when you don't know your kids are good and good not just being safe.
Interviewer,But that they're in a place where somebody loves them and is going to instill values in the.
Michelle,And is going to read to them and take them to the library and it's not gonna just plop them in front of the TV so I.
Interviewer,Was about to quit working and i thought I just can't do it I can't keep up the balance and who stepped in but my mom.
Michelle,Who was not yet retired but she would come over at the crack of dawn to allow me to go to the gym she'd started.
Interviewer,Getting the kids ready for school she'd wake him up fixed breakfast I'd come back I'd grab him I take him to school.
Michelle,She'd go to work she'd get off she'd come and pick them up get them home start dinner by that time.
Interviewer,I'd get home i mean we had our routine down and there's just something about having your mom in that place where you.
Michelle,Know she she will she will kill someone for her grandchildren so she was the grandmother at the pick up line she was.
Interviewer,Going to be the first one at the pick-up line because she didn't want her little grandbabies walking around wondering.
Michelle,Where their ride was so she would get there an hour before pickup to be the first car so that she'd see her babies.
Interviewer,And to bring him here bring him here the you you know you don't you can't pay for that no so we.
Michelle,Brought that energy with us to the white House and we needed it that kind of no-nonsense solid tell it like it is.
Interviewer,Unimpressed with everything kind of personality that is Marian Robinson you know she did not want anybody doing her.
Michelle,Laundry at the white house she could do her laundry just fine really was Jo know she did was notoriously doing we had.
Interviewer,Housekeepers and butler's and everything at the White House and she was like don't touch my underwear I've got it.
Michelle,Too old for that my heart's role-model and she taught the girls to do their laundry so they had laundry duty with.
Interviewer,Grandma oh so she really helped keep them grounded because my god yeah she kept the whole White House grounded she.
Michelle,Just kept because and everybody used to go up to her room the the butler's the staff they'd just be in there.
Interviewer,Chit-chatting with her shooting the breeze getting some wisdom telling their stories you know she just.
Michelle,Had a whole little psych counseling session up there in her Suites of rooms but she she kept us humble and focused.
Interviewer,On what was important and she was my sounding board anytime anything crazy happened over the course of the day the.
Michelle,First thing i would do her her suite of rooms were on the third floor above us and I'd go there and I'd sit on her.
Interviewer,Couch she'd have on MSNBC or something and she'd be trying not to talk about what.
Michelle,Was on the news until i kind of let her know that I was ready to talk about it and she would do what she always did sit.
Interviewer,There and just listen and go hmm and then what because my mother was not going to solve your problems for you no.
Michelle,You know she was gonna listen and she would say well what do you think about that and then you'd figure it out and by.
Interviewer,The time you'd leave you figure i feel great so so much of my ability to get out there again and again and again had.
Michelle,To do with going up to that little counseling room and sitting and having Marian Robinson mm-hmm you'll be fine.
Interviewer,Just going back down there did she stop now did she ever tell you you know you've talked about that a lot what are.
Michelle,You gonna do say that again did she ever say you've talked about that a lot now what are you gonna do about it.
Interviewer,No she's mom my mother and i write about this about how I my mother my parents had a really advanced sense of parenting.
Michelle,At a very early age they taught us how to advocate for ourselves very early so her expectation.
Interviewer,Like you you know how to fix your problems you know what to do and when you teach kids at an early age that they.
Michelle,Have a voice that's worth listening to number one and that their opinions actually matter and that's what they get.
Interviewer,Day in and day out in their home at the dinner table two adults listening intently and asking questions and you.
Michelle,Know encouraging kids to contribute that was the household those were our dinner dinner tables so that when you came home.
Interviewer,From school with a problem you could air it but you had to go back and solve it and so at forty fifty years old no my.
Michelle,Mother wasn't assuming at all that she needed to solve any problems that I had at first lady her expectations were you.
Interviewer,Will do this and you will do this well because you know how to do this so there was never any need for her to even.
Michelle,Pretend like she had to give me directions she knew she had instilled those values in me when I was four and.
Interviewer,Five and seven so she had done the work wonder what a blessing and you mentioned to the you almost thought about quitting.
Michelle,Because you did have it i don't know how many people realize what high-powered positions you had as a career woman I.
Interviewer,Mean to balance that well but before i was first lady oh yes oh yeah yeah I had a jobs before I was first lady everyone.
Michelle,Pretty high-powered and sometimes that getting lost executive vice president I had big jobs I was really I was smart.
Interviewer,Was continue to be that's why sometimes when I keep the question how did you know what to do his first lady yes.
Michelle,That's like whoa okay i went to Princeton Harvard Lauda was a lawyer work in the city worked with Carla.
Interviewer,Working on libraries i worked in planning and economic development ran a nonprofit organization was vice.
Michelle,President a hospital i don't know I just maybe was osmosis so they're an instinct you were able to.
Interviewer,Use some of those experiences so yeah you you know I I didn't come to the position of first lady a blank slate and.
Michelle,That's sort of what happens in society with spouse you become a spouse all of a sudden burn you know and I felt I talked.
Interviewer,About this in the book of how i felt myself becoming a spouse I went from being an executive to becoming a spouse.
Michelle,Where the first thing people would talk about was what shoes is she wearing and it's like oh no no people not you're not.
Interviewer,Focusing on my shoes right i mean i'm standing in front of like a military families we were doing important things.
Michelle,But so yes there were moments in my profession because the the burden of child-rearing fell on me as a woman you.
Interviewer,Know there was there was a part of my trajectory as my husband's ascent got faster and higher and louder there was.
Michelle,The challenge of how do i make sure that my kids are saying and I have a career but then yeah that started very early.
Interviewer,Those doubts those questions of how do you balance it all and is it fair that we're on his rocket ship ride when I.
Michelle,Have one too but that's something that i write about that's what you learn the balance in marriage that and I tell.
Interviewer,Young people this all the time particularly young women is that you what I've learned is that you can have.
Michelle,It all but you you usually can't have it all at the same time and that that's a myth that even having the expectation of.
Interviewer,Having it all it's a setup for a young people young young couples young men and women with children the.
Michelle,Notion that you're not successful if you don't have it all well it's it's hard to balance it all but if but I started to.
Interviewer,Learn that life is long and there are trade-offs that you make and I think that the trade-off of stepping off of my.
Michelle,Path until at least i found a child care solution that worked for me which was my mom I entertained the notion of stepping.
Interviewer,Off of my track because I felt like I have these two kids and that is I brought them here so my first.
Michelle,Priority is to make sure that they are okay I can't save the world if I if my household isn't isn't solid so but the.
Interviewer,Other thing i learned at that point in time when I was ready to jump off the professional track I started not caring.
Michelle,What people thought about me professionally so I felt more freedom to ask for what I needed so I wanted up.
Interviewer,Staying in my career because i had an opportunity to become the vice president of Community Affairs at the University.
Michelle,Of chicago the president was looking for a new person to head that division and I had just had Sasha she was four months.
Interviewer,Old and i was like not doing it don't care don't care about work but one of my good friends said well you should.
Michelle,Interview because this guy is really different and I was like okay I don't care so I took I was still breastfeeding.
Interviewer,So i had sasha in the crib but said we're going to an interview baby we're gonna go see this man who wants me to.
Michelle,Work from him but we don't care we're not we don't care so we're going and he needs to see all of me have a baby and a.
Interviewer,Husband who's a u.s. senator whatever he was doing at the time it's like you want you want to hire this well let me tell.
Michelle,You what it'll take I'll need this much money on the flexibility I laid down a whole list of.
Interviewer,Demands that i knew was we're gonna have him running in the other direction because I really felt the freedom to be.
Michelle,Like well if you can do this this this this and this for me then maybe I'll think about it.
Interviewer,And he said yes to all the whole list of all the things I asked for and I thought wow I guess I have to try this now but.
Michelle,What i learned there is that as women as individuals you have to ask for what you need and not assume that people are.
Interviewer,Gonna give you what you need and that taught me that I can define the terms of my professional life in a way.
Michelle,That i didn't feel the freedom to do so I thought if I'm gonna do this I'm going to do this in a way that provides.
Interviewer,Balance and i you know i i told folks there don't expect me at every meeting don't expect me to come to meetings.
Michelle,We're not doing anything because i'm going to the Halloween parade and that's important and I'm doing my job and I'm.
Interviewer,Doing it well but this meeting isn't necessary so I felt that freedom for the first time in my professional life to.
Michelle,Ask for what i need knowing that i was worthy of it that I that I was valuable to them even in all my complicatedness I.
Interviewer,Was still giving them value but i had to learn to appreciate that value before I could ask for what I needed.
Michelle,Right and not be afraid oh gosh yeah not be afraid at all that they might say which is easier said than done so I mean.
Interviewer,You know i i understand it is not easy to tell somebody that you're worth a lot especially for women we have a hard time.
Michelle,Saying that about ourselves that i know my worth and I can put a monetary number on it too that there is there that there.
Interviewer,Is a value to it and that's that those are kind of things that I'm exploring in the book as well and I'm not really just.
Michelle,Trying to pump the book but i'm i'm these are what I've been asking about for the last year I've been sort of.
Interviewer,Reliving these things and figuring out what it's taught me so I'm writing about all that so if I'm if I sound a little.
Michelle,Like therapy here where you're in it i'm in it I'm still in it thinking about and people and you're having the time to be.
Interviewer,Able to step back because you mentioned going and going you didn't have really time to reflect as things were happy.
Michelle,With no time to reflect in eight years i mean we did so much so fast and we also knew we didn't have the luxury to make.
Interviewer,Mistakes when you are the first I mean I'm I've lived my life as the first the only one at the table and.
Michelle,Barack and i knew very early that we would be measured by different yardstick making mistakes was.
Interviewer,Not an option for us not that we didn't make mistakes but we had to be good no we had to be outstanding at everything.
Michelle,We did and when you're operating at that level and your your-your-your trying to live up to the you know to the.
Interviewer,Expectations of your ancestors of your father when you're the first you're the one that's laying the the the red carpet.
Michelle,Down for others to follow so yes we were moving fast we I I was starting an initiative almost every year during the.
Interviewer,Eight years that i was there and when i started an initiative there was a lot of work that went into it beforehand.
Michelle,Because coming from to this work as a professional I knew that strategic thinking about an initiative had to.
Interviewer,Happen the background work had to be done we met when we started let's move before we even launched it we spent a.
Michelle,Year meeting with every expert in the field we had already developed partnerships before we had even.
Interviewer,Announced it we had focus groups we were meeting with legislators and policymakers so that when we stepped out.
Michelle,Into the arena we knew what the pitfalls would be we knew where the partnerships needed to be we knew where the holes.
Interviewer,Were well that that was work that we were doing at the same time that you're doing state visits and Halloween parties.
Michelle,And christmas decorations and so you're like a swan with the paddling legs underneath that was eight years of that.
Interviewer,So yeah i realized there was time that something really major would happen at the beginning of the week let's say you.
Michelle,Met the pope or something like that let's just say that you know this is the weird thing that's.
Interviewer,Kind of stuff we did i met the pope or hanging out with the Queen it's like okay that was my week that's.
Michelle,My life or that was one week - that was it could be in one week you know a state visit my first trip to Africa that was.
Interviewer,My solo trip involved doing push-ups with Bishop Desmond Tutu literally and I was like please get up please don't use.
Michelle,I know no i'm gonna do push-ups when you come Michel come down so I just looked around it's like if something happens to.
Interviewer,Him it's not me well i so i was doing push-ups with Bishop tutu I gave a speech to a group of young African women.
Michelle,Leaders i met nelson mandela we went on a safari I went to Botswana I you know that's like four days all of that kind.
Interviewer,Of stuff would happen in like four days and then you'd go to the next week and I could literally forget everything that.
Michelle,Just happened the week before because something like that would be happening in the next week so to be able to.
Interviewer,Remember it all to keep it all in your head I would find myself forgetting oh yeah.
Michelle,I've i went to prague i literally forgot that I have been to Prague and I and I'm not I I mean we had this conversation.
Interviewer,Somebody said what do you think of Prague and I said I've never been to Prague and my chief of staff said yes.
Michelle,You have and i was like no i have never been to Prague ever she was like yes and we went back and forth and it took a.
Interviewer,Picture of me in prague going you're right I forgot all about that I was there for two days that's how.
Michelle,That's what the pace is you can forget big major things not because they weren't important but they get crowded.
Interviewer,Out by the next series of issues and demands so I don't know what the question was how we got on this.
Michelle,You forgot the question i forgot the question all right so when you think about all of that and then you have the.
Interviewer,Two little ones say the two little ones right oh my kids and so they might have I never ever got about them and so that.
Michelle,Balance and so when people are thinking about balance and how you do it any advice for how people can be try to yeah.
Interviewer,There's there's a lot of advice for balance my balance is crazy it's it's it's on you know because you're the.
Michelle,First lady but you're also trying to go to the potluck and the soccer game and you know I tell the story of how Barack.
Interviewer,Goes went to a parent-teacher conference and you know he's got a big motorcade it's big it's a lot of stuff and men.
Michelle,With guns machine guns black you know sniper gear they follow him everywhere they're in trucks and they're leaning.
Interviewer,Out looking at you like i will kill you because that's their job but when they're at Sidwell fourth-grade.
Michelle,On the roof of the undergrad the elementary school even Malia was like dad come on.
Interviewer,You know so everybody was sort of okay when dad didn't go sort of politely going dad you don't have to come to the.
Michelle,Fall/winter concert you it's okay we'll take a picture you could take a pass but I would be there and mom would be there.
Interviewer,And you're trying to be a normal parent in the midst of it you know when you know you your kids invited over for.
Michelle,Sleepover and you have to explain to them we will need your social security number and there will be dog sweeping.
Interviewer,Your house and they're going to ask you if you have guns and drugs and you'll have to tell them sorry mrs. Julia's mom.
Michelle,But this is what it means to have such over but it's gonna be fine you know don't have fun they but but.
Interviewer,Kids have fun they learn how to work past all of that but you're balancing at least I was balancing not just the the.
Michelle,Act of being a mother but being the first lady of the first daughters who had their own detail all the time so.
Interviewer,Imagine trying to go to prom with eight men with guns and doing anything else that you're trying to do as a teenager.
Michelle,With eight men with guns barack and i were very happy about it .
Interviewer, we were very but she even had to like learn how to like discipline them.
Michelle,Without letting them think that their agents told on them right so all parents you understand this so I had to I had a.
Interviewer,Lie a little bit about where i got my information from it's like how did I know that no parent was at that party.
Michelle,Julia's mom called me and told me not because I got a full report in detail it's like why are they so dumb not to.
Interviewer,Know that how do you think i knew their kid that's our dads are those are some of.
Michelle,Our parenting scenarios so my goal as a parent was to try to make sure my kids had normalcy that's a different set of.
Interviewer,Challenges for the average parent but here's the thing that I learned one of the things I learned living in the White.
Michelle,House is that kids don't need that much you know if they know you love them.
Interviewer,Unconditionally you can live in the White House you can live in a you know you can you can live in a little bitty.
Michelle,Apartment i grew up in home is what you make of it inside it's that interaction that you have everyday and it doesn't.
Interviewer,Have to be perfect it can be broken and funny and odd in many ways and you know our oddness was a level of.
Michelle,Dysfunction that most families will never experience but it was odd and and they kids are resilient they make it.
Interviewer,Through which is why i think about all the kids that don't make it through because it takes a lot to break a kid.
Michelle,You know it takes a lot but there's so many broken kids which reminds us how bad we're doing because you got to do.
Interviewer,Really messed-up stuff to kids to to send them off they have to come from a brokenness that is so deep and off and.
Michelle,We have to see that in our children and understand that when kids act out there's a reason for it there's there.
Interviewer,There's no such thing as bad kids kids aren't born bad you know they are not they are products of their situation so.
Michelle,I learned to give myself a break because my kids are loved and they're going to be fine and we we mess up a lot we make.
Interviewer,A lot of wrong calls as parents but you know we we we hold them to high standards as people you know we don't.
Michelle,Measure them by things and grades we measure them for how they interact in the world how do they treat their.
Interviewer,Friends how do they treat each other things like kindness and compassion and empathy those are the things that we.
Michelle,Have tried to teach them over these years and here's the thing kids watch what you do not what you say so the.
Interviewer,Biggest thing that barack and i could ever do to be good parents to our kids is to be good people in the world for.
Michelle,Them to see every day so and that is true whether you're the president in the first lady or you're Marion and Frazier.
Interviewer,Robinson those standards don't you know they don't know title they don't know income that's just all that kids need.
Michelle,And we as you librarians know who you're working in the communities and you see you're seeing these kids come into your.
Interviewer,Your doors and they come with such promised and they they just want somebody to love them you know they just.
Michelle,Want somebody to tell them that they're okay and that's one of the things I've tried to do as first lady with kids why.
Interviewer,Did so much with kids because i always thought this is the interaction that could change a kid's life.
Michelle,This one hug this one you are worth it you never know what what can make a difference now all of this you're giving.
Interviewer,To communities you're giving to your children and you're giving but you've also I've heard you say it that.
Michelle,Sometimes you have to put yourself first or not feel guilty about taking care of yourself.
Interviewer,No yes ladies and men too but let's talk to the ladies a little bit on this one because we do that right we put.
Michelle,Ourselves forth on our priority lists after everybody else and then we're sort of aunts and sometimes we're not even on.
Interviewer,Our own list at all it's so filled with so many obligations and the guilt that we have and you know you this is nothing.
Michelle,New but that oxygen mask metaphor is real you know if you can't save someone if you are dying inside and that death.
Interviewer,Can look like so many different things it can be our you know our self our sense of self-worth our own physical.
Michelle,Health our mental well-being all of that is if we let that go and we don't nurture it as women we are not good to.
Interviewer,Anybody else and i you know i and that is something to that you have to practice and that's what I had to learn.
Michelle,I had to learn to learn that because i didn't see that even in my mother I mean my mother was one of those who didn't do.
Interviewer,Anything for herself you know my mother died her own hair until she turned it green and it was like mom it's green.
Michelle,It's not working you don't know what you're doing just go to the hairdresser and she's like it's fine.
Interviewer,It's just green I can relate to that just green I remember that you know it's like my you.
Michelle,Know so i i grew up with women who put didn't put themselves first and I thought I want to show my girls.
Interviewer,Something else you know i want i want them to see that being a good woman out here in the world means that you're.
Michelle,Smart you're educated yes you were gentle and kind and loving but you know you could you can do some push-ups you.
Interviewer,Know you can you know you're gonna think about what you put into your body what you eat you're gonna take time out for.
Michelle,Yourself you're gonna invest in your relationships with your friends I thought it was important for me to my.
Interviewer,Girls to see me having strong friendships with women in my life so I have a posse of women who keep me sane.
Michelle,That's what i wanted to know oh yeah oh yeah and the posse started early in my life I always had a crew of women crew.
Interviewer,Girls i had my my lunchtime girls that we went over to each other's house at lunch time in grade school and played.
Michelle,Jacks and complained about the teacher and just analyze things watched all my children then we got ourselves together.
Interviewer,And we were fortified and we could go back in and finish the day that was my early group but when I went my kids were.
Michelle,Young i had a really strong group of woman still do these women are still a major part of my life and I could have.
Interviewer,Gotten through those early years without him because we were all at varying stages of our professional careers some.
Michelle,Of us were married some were single parents some had husbands who travel but every Saturday we would get together and.
Interviewer,We started when the babies were in those cradles and we would just set them down around each other in a circle so they.
Michelle,Could look at each other and then we talked about everything you know about are they walking yet are they supposed.
Interviewer,To be do all those questions you have as a new mother and you don't know whether you're doing anything right it was just.
Michelle,Nice to be around a group of women who knew just like you they didn't know anything either we were.
Interviewer,Just messing up and it was okay but we became our most important confidence as mothers raising kids and our kids all of.
Michelle,These kids who have come up together are like cousins and they're they they're out in the world and they've all done.
Interviewer,Well which was another lesson that i learned you can parent all different kinds of ways there's no one right way.
Michelle,To do it again if there's love and consistency and a foundation and security they're going to be okay so we.
Interviewer,We started learned to let ourselves off the hook you know and then we started doing fun stuff together like we worked.
Michelle,Out together these same women i would do a boot camp with at Camp David I want to thank these women who would come because.
Interviewer,I was trying to get everybody healthy so like once the season I bring them to Camp David and we do like these.
Michelle,Intensive workouts and i like eliminated wine and stuff like that until everybody said they weren't coming unless I put.
Interviewer,Wine back on the menu so i had to put wine back on there just to not lose my friends but we work out like three three.
Michelle,Three times a day and the little navy cadet kids they'd be like ma'am go lower on your pushup and be like oh you're.
Interviewer,Just so cute and don't call me ma'am so we were getting healthy together and we started doing a little seminar as we do.
Michelle,Each other one of my friends was an ob gynie so as we got older we would have sessions on menopause and then we talked.
Interviewer,About other things that i can't talk about here but but that group was that was that that was my crew throughout the.
Michelle,White house years and that was a part of that self-care that we all felt good about and we all got stronger over these.
Interviewer,Eight years we as women this group of women we got physically and mentally stronger.
Michelle,Together in ways that i love my husband you know he is my best friend but they're more fun sometimes.
Interviewer,Don't tell him he doesn't know that i have more fun with them sometimes but they gave me the kind of the kind of.
Michelle,Fortification that i needed and i encourage young mothers to understand that you are we were not meant to parent.
Interviewer,In isolation and so many young parents because of you know circumstances maybe they were transferred they're living.
Michelle,Away from their homes i saw this in military families a young you know military mom would move away from her.
Interviewer,Family she'd have kids she'd be alone and she'd be wondering well why is this so hard and I'd say because you're not.
Michelle,Supposed to do this alone you know children weren't meant to be raised in isolation we need community that it does.
Interviewer,Take a village and so i encourage young women to build their village if it's not at home with your mom and your aunts and.
Michelle,Your cousins then wherever you are build that village because that will be your salvation it keeps you saying and and it.
Interviewer,Just keeps you in imbalance in a way that I think we don't appreciate and what about fun fun yeah I just told you.
Michelle,A bunch of fun we had the push-ups the push-ups are fun Carla you Shay should so you wouldn't enjoy like working out.
Interviewer,Well you keep score that's what you tell Carla doesn't work out because she thinks there are scores to be kept.
Michelle,During a workout it's like okay one pushup for me and one for you well we had fun oh yeah we had fun we made sure.
Interviewer,We had fun and we wanted the white house to be a place of fun and particularly in tough times you know and we went through.
Michelle,Some tough times crisis shootings i mean I the the the amount of of grief that we that that that we had to I wanted to say.
Interviewer,We weren't carrying it but we had to help the country get through you can't have all crisis you know the country.
Michelle,Needs a moment to feel like they can celebrate in some way shape or form even in the darkest times so we had Halloween.
Interviewer,At the white house and kids came and they mostly military kids and their families they would come around the.
Michelle,South lawn and it was all decorated and the house was orange and everybody was in costume and they got to.
Interviewer,Trick-or-treat at the white house you know we had any major state event that we did whether it was a state dinner or.
Michelle,A rival we found a way to incorporate kids in that so we had a big act performing at in the evening usually.
Interviewer,They'd agree to do a separate performance or a talk or a workshop with young kids from from when we'd fly them.
Michelle,In from all over the country so that there would be kids getting different experiences so kids sat down and talked.
Interviewer,To you know every major star that came to the White House we did the had the whole cast of Hamilton come back and.
Michelle,Perform and it was a very full circle moment for for me because we first met lin-manuel when the very first cultural.
Interviewer,Event that we did at the white house was the spoken word event because spoken word rapped for those of you don't know.
Michelle,Poetry you know sort of cool had never been done in the White House in the East Room with George and Martha.
Interviewer,Standing there and so we were going to do that as the first event so we were finding some of the hottest young voices.
Michelle,And we did a rope line and this young kid lin-manuel came up and he and Barack and I were what are you gonna perform.
Interviewer,Young man and he said i'm gonna do a rap about Alexander Hamilton if we were like you know that's when here you remember.
Michelle,You're the president first lady you cannot laugh in the face of your guests and go what are you kidding and then he.
Interviewer,Went on to perform the first number that that was the the first number he had prepared and it was obviously amazing.
Michelle,And so afterwards we were like that's really good and he said yes I'm gonna do a whole Broadway show on it and we were.
Interviewer,Like hey like good luck with that kid and then it blew up and and we invited the whole cast back and they performed.
Michelle,First they did a whole day of workshops for kids from all over the country so they were doing lyric writing and you.
Interviewer,Know you name it they were in the red Room writing and rapping in the Blue Room and they were dancing in the yellow.
Michelle,Oval and you name it they were everywhere and then they did the performance in the East Room with all.
Interviewer,These kids who had never gotten to see the Broadway performance but they all knew the words so we had fun we had lots.
Michelle,Of fun and all our fun always involved kids because kids are good they just make everything better and we.
Interviewer,Wanted to make sure that kids felt like this white house belonged to them you know that they felt like when they walk.
Michelle,Into it and kids of all backgrounds felt like this was a place that kids were supposed to be not like peering out the.
Interviewer,Front gates but they were supposed to walk in those doors and experience everything that was going on in there.
Michelle,And that was i think of all the things that we did the work that we were able to do with young people there's a.
Interviewer,Fulfilling and hopefully the most impactful work though that we did in those eight years and they felt like oh.
Michelle,Yeah i'm rapping in the blue room rapping in the Blue Room we did a whole design workshop where kids were draping.
Interviewer,With designers and there were mannequins up in the so we did a whole workshop Anna Wintour helped to put it together.
Michelle,So we had some of the top designers come it was sort of a way to kind of give an A Maj to all the American designers who.
Interviewer,Would work with me but not to do it and make it about me so it had to be about kids so they all came for a day of.
Michelle,Working with all these young designers around the world and they were making jewelry in different rooms and they came.
Interviewer,Together for a panel and they got to meet Diane von Furstenberg and all these big names came and they spent the day.
Michelle,With these kids and it was about them but it was also about fashion so those are the kind of the ways we tried I.
Interviewer,Tried to think about you know linking the stuff that people wrote about to something that was important there's.
Michelle,Like okay you like my shoes but let's teach some kids how to be designers how do what this craft means in America that.
Interviewer,It's a you know that it's not just about how you look but what you do and design and all of that was fun fun fun and and.
Michelle,The kids left feeling like hey i've been to the White House they felt like they were something special I'm in the White.
Interviewer,House doing this we had a mentor program that we never really publicized but I worked every year with a group of twenty.
Michelle,Girls from the area because mentoring has always been a big part of my life and brock's as well so he had some young.
Interviewer,Men that would come and they'd come once a month they were usually kids from the DC area not the top kids but not the.
Michelle,Kids struggling but sort of those kids that are just in the Middle where there probably isn't a lot of programming for.
Interviewer,Them and they would be paired up with a high-powered woman in the administration Valerie Jarrett was a mentor Cris.
Michelle,Comerford who was the first female executive chef at the White House who Laura Bush appointed she was a mentor.
Interviewer,And they meet with these kids all the time but they would come together once a month in the White House and it was.
Michelle,Interesting to see the transformation when they first start they were shy they couldn't look me in.
Interviewer,The eye you know they were just nervous you know because it was nerve-racking you're in the white house you're meeting.
Michelle,Michelle obama and why were you picked and you're wondering but we'd spend time talking and eating popcorn and we talk.
Interviewer,About everything and by the time they complete it usually two years with us by their graduation ceremony when their.
Michelle,Parents would come they felt there was just a shift in who they thought they were you know they felt comfortable in.
Interviewer,That space in that room with me they knew that they deserved that for themselves and it's that process of just.
Michelle,Giving them that exposure on a regular basis saying you are worthy I don't even care about your grades who are you as a.
Interviewer,Person and you were worth being talked to being listened to and they came in and after while they owned the place.
Michelle,They were taken they didn't even notice me it's like oh yeah mom that's Michelle Obama.
Interviewer,We're old friends now let me show you the Blue Room I mean they just they had a confidence and my belief for them was.
Michelle,That if you can walk into the white House and look me in the eye and introduce yourself there is no room you.
Interviewer,Cannot go in there's no room you can't go into after that right right before we started there was.
Michelle,A high school high schooler and she's here this is her first time with librarians / hope to recruit her there.
Interviewer,She is there she is hi honey and of course we hope she'll be a librarian but but any advice you might give a high.
Michelle,Score and she said i know about college and what I want to do and any advice what how old are you 17 well you're.
Interviewer,Gonna go to college right okay well that's the first advice go to college because you need a college education in.
Michelle,This day and age if you want to be competitive right but here's the thing there are so many different ways to get.
Interviewer,An education we live in the united States of America and we have wonderful community colleges we've got four-year.
Michelle,Colleges there's so many ways to do it there's no one right way to do it right you don't have to go to some four-year.
Interviewer,School and live in a dorm if that's not your thing it's an excellent experience if you can do it but you have to get an.
Michelle,Education beyond high school that is a must a high school diploma is not enough anymore and we want you to be the very.
Interviewer,Best you can be and be able to take care of your family and wear nice shoes and be all fly and have power and all that.
Michelle,Good stuff having an education is the key to that so good that that's my advice in a nutshell.
Interviewer,Now we don't have much time left but I meant to ask you about the book I'm talking.
Michelle,About you know okay cuz it's coming out in November these are like you guys ready we want to be able to book talking.
Interviewer,You got to give us a few things so we can book talking that's what we do all right oh I've given you a bit few.
Michelle,Tidbits but you know if i were to describe the book it's it it's a real man ization effort because you know for.
Interviewer,Me a black woman from a working-class background to have the opportunity to tell her story is interestingly rare you.
Michelle,Know i think that's why some people ask the question how did you become here how did you go from here to there it's sort.
Interviewer,Of like people think i'm a unicorn it's like like I don't exist like people like me don't exist and I know that there are.
Michelle,So many people in this country in this world who feel like they don't exist because their stories aren't told or.
Interviewer,They think their stories aren't worthy of being told you know in this country we've gotten to the point where we kind.
Michelle,Of think that there is only a handful of legitimate stories that make you a true American and so if you don't fall into.
Interviewer,That narrow sort of line it's like you don't belong but we all belong and I think my book is just it's the.
Michelle,Ordinariness of a very extraordinary story and and I hope that by telling it that it it makes others not just black.
Interviewer,Women not just black people but other people other women people who feel faceless and invisible and voiceless to.
Michelle,Feel the pride in their story in the way that I feel about mine the ordinariness of growing up as a working-class kid.
Interviewer,With two parents who had values they didn't have a lot of money you know I we grew up with music and art and love and.
Michelle,That was just about it and were encouraged to get an education you know I am NOT a unicorn there are.
Interviewer,Millions of kids like me out there and it's just a shame that sometimes people will see me.
Michelle,And they will only see my color and then they'll make certain judgments about that and that's dangerous for us to.
Interviewer,Dehumanize each other in that way we are all just people you know with stories to tell and we're flawed and broken and.
Michelle,There's no miracle in our stories it's just we're living life trying to do good and that's who this little girl in.
Interviewer,Becoming is she is becoming a lot of things in life but the journey continues and I hope it that it starts a.
Michelle,Conversation about voice and it encourages so many other people because we need to know everyone's stories so.
Interviewer,That we don't forget the humanity and each other because what we've learned Barack and I over the course of this.
Michelle,Eight years and traveling around the country is that Americans are good people decent people really even if we.
Interviewer,Don't agree on politics and we have to remember that about ourselves and understand that that's true not just.
Michelle,Here in america but around the world their own there are no Devils out there there are no people out there they're.
Interviewer,There people who do bad things but all of us are really just trying to figure it out and if we've done something.
Michelle,Really horrible it's usually because we were broken in some way and if we understand each other's stories and we.
Interviewer,Share those stories that maybe we can be more empathetic maybe we can be more inclusive maybe we can be more forgiving.
Michelle,And be more open so i hope that the book encourages some conversation around those kind of things and then you'll.
Interviewer,Hear about the china and my shoes a couple of nice stories you know Bo and sunny make an appearance so not to worry.
Michelle,They're there they're still alive doing well by the way thank you you got that well I just have.

Interviewer,Around that aspirational ride particularly on Sunday yeah uh-huh look at other rich people's houses.
Michelle,Mm-hmm white people mm-hmm yes and the truth is it doesn't get any bigger than the White House but what you allowed us.
Interviewer,To see is that it isn't always as it seems and that the White House is really a paradox I'd like for you to paint the.
Michelle,Picture for us of life inside the white House yes Wow I describe it it's like living in the fanciest hotel and you.
Interviewer,Have your elevator that takes you up to your room and there's a lobby where all the action.
Michelle,Is going on and that's the central floor what you see on TV about the White House the state floor that's not the private.
Interviewer,Residence that's where all the official stuff goes on with a Red Room in the Blue Room in the green room and all the.
Michelle,Rooms are the old the the east room that that's the ceremonial floor but then up the next floor there are two more floors.
Interviewer,That are the residents and those floors are private to the families who live there and once you get in that elevator.
Michelle,And you come up to that floor and those elevators open and there's usually an older black gentleman in a tuxedo who is.
Interviewer,Worked at the white house for decades often through standing there a drink of refreshment.
Michelle,No no just with a lovely smile okay you know although you could have them do that too and any time I never thought of.
Interviewer,That and any time I look down at any time of the day I'm night can you just say I'd.
Michelle,Like some refreshment you know you you can but then you realize I write about this yes that you pay for it.
Interviewer,Right so they tell you you can order anything and they listen very carefully because everybody listens to every word.
Michelle,That the president says and i used to tell Barack don't say you want something because then we'll have like thousands.
Interviewer,Of it you know and then we're paying for it so I know it was a shock if he said he likes some rare fish he just happened.
Michelle,To say this is delicious and then we get the bill at the end of the month and it's like you flew that fish in from.
Interviewer,China that fish wasn't that good i said listen everybody don't say you like that fish everybody's.
Michelle,Just just getting the book today so i can see the surprise on people's faces when you hear her say that they had to.
Interviewer,Pay for it yeah a lot of people think you know and this is also is sort of an interesting thing when people would say.
Michelle,That taxpayers are paying for that and the truth is yes but you know you don't pay rent and you don't pay for staff but.
Interviewer,Every thing every dish every they they would count the number of peanuts that you eat and.
Michelle,Charge it back no so you'd get a bill at the end of it it's not a you know it's not at all we lived in a white house.
Interviewer,Y'all i mean this is not a complaint it's just something that people don't understand you pay for your own Charmin.
Michelle,You can pay for your charmin you pay for all your guests the food that they eat Saul y'all came and visited when you.
Interviewer,Were thinking i'm just gonna take some put it in the purse I was like we got the bill no but all the official events.
Michelle,Are paid for there's a budget for that but all of our private meals all of our entertaining whether we had family over.
Interviewer,For thanksgiving those things were paid for but you know that's a minor part of the experience but the house is.
Michelle,Beautiful but it is staff and there are people they are constantly they're chefs and Butler's and the butler's when we.
Interviewer,First came in wore full formal tuxedos at all times black men serving people in full tuxedos.
Michelle,Who've been there for presidents like for year after president after president we loved the staff the butler's are.
Interviewer,Amazing the whole staff at the white House is amazing and one of the first things we did because we were trying to.
Michelle,Figure out how do you make this normal for children you know because Malia and Sasha were 7 and 10 thank you for that.
Interviewer,You know i won't hear the end of that she's like mom didn't even know how old we were they were young and we were.
Michelle,Figuring out how do we keep them grounded and the first thing we thought is like they cannot you know what we're.
Interviewer,Having pancakes in the morning it's just crazy to have a man with a tuxedo come in when when you got some little girls.
Michelle,At a sleepover and you bring in in some water that you know so we cancelled the tuxedos it's like you'll take those.
Interviewer,Tuxedos off wear some polo shirts and some slacks unless we did something formal we just sort of loosened it up a.
Michelle,Bit but other than that the white house does feel like a home you know and I always say that a house.
Interviewer,Is a house and what we what you bring to the home is what makes it at home and how we lived in that home was what I.
Michelle,Remember most and people asked to do i miss the White House and it's like no I don't miss the house because we took.
Interviewer,What was important in that house with us and it is with us it's family its values and the friendship so the house is.
Michelle,Beautiful and it's historic and you know it was an honor to live there but the people in it make it what it is and.
Interviewer,You're watching book tv on c-span - its television for serious readers we're in the midst of showing you portions of.
Michelle,Michelle obama's book tour across the country well she sold out Capital One Arena in Washington DC twice and we want.
Interviewer,To show you those appearances now .
Michelle,Hey honey hey my love here we are this is so exciting we are in this town that has become your town yeah we are with.
Interviewer,All these amazing people and the thing that I think is so extraordinary as we keep discussing is we are here to talk.
Michelle,About a book it's something all these people are here because you know buddy's twerkin no there's no tricking we are.
Interviewer,Reading that's right that's right we're all reading and so no costumes no no no costume changes sorry y'all but.
Michelle,You know we've been talking about this and I've been thinking so much that the the the extraordinary presidency comes.
Interviewer,To an end you and we're going to talk about transitions and swerves in life but your time to make another transition.
Michelle,And what you decide you want to do is write this book yeah why did you do that well first of all it was sort of an.
Interviewer,Assignment right because every first lady is supposed to write a book and I think they've done it for quite some.
Michelle,Time so it was one of those okay i'm supposed to now write about this and that's one thing the other thing as I've.
Interviewer,Told some young girls that i talked about I thought about this book and thought how many times does a black.
Michelle,Woman get to tell her full story herself in a way that's going to be read potentially by millions of people so I.
Interviewer,Thought to myself let me you know take this seriously I want to make sure that this isn't just a chronology of things.
Michelle,That happened in the white house because what I've learned over the years what I've learned from my parents is that to.
Interviewer,Understand one's life you you have to understand the context of it so for people to understand what I got from the.
Michelle,Eight years in the white house they not they'd have to know all of my story that I'm to understand the neighborhood that.
Interviewer,I grew up in the family that built me the values we were raised on the challenges that I faced and I wanted the.
Michelle,Book to be very readable i wanted it to feel like a story so that people of all backgrounds and young.
Interviewer,Folks of all ages could sort of follow this journey of this little girl Michelle Robinson who had very much an.
Michelle,Ordinary life but took it took many extraordinary turns and as my brother said on the clip I want I wanted my.
Interviewer,Story to to be an example to many that we all deserve and are worthy of an amazing extraordinary life and the.
Michelle,Stories that we all have in us you know those small memories are really what make us who we are it's not the eight.
Interviewer,Years in the white house that define me that just happened to be part of my journey so much more of Who I am comes.
Michelle,In the first three sections of this book and I wanted the people to understand that and and so what you've given us is.
Interviewer,A story of this ordinary extraordinary girl in a way that all of us I think can read into the ordinariness of living.
Michelle,Near your cousin's having dinner at a certain time having a relative who's a little bit cranky but who's still a part.
Interviewer,Of the fold all of these particulars are something I think that that give people an American coming-of-age story and the.
Michelle,Fact that that is a black woman's coming-of-age story for everyone to identify with I think is an.
Interviewer,Extraordinary feat and as you know i think you have written a work of American literature for which I thank.
Michelle,You well that that means a lot coming from my friend who is a literary amazingness person in her own words the.
Interviewer,Truth is the truth is the truth and so this story begins with my little invisible pretend best friend Michelle.
Michelle,Robinson i wish we had known each other when we were five years I know that would have been so good it would have.
Interviewer,Been so wonderful because you are my favorite little girl this little girl is very determined.
Michelle,She's single-minded she's fierce she has a rich interior life oh yeah she lives in a close-knit family and you.
Interviewer,Live on on in an iconic place the south side of Chicago outside South that's right one of the America's great.
Michelle,Metropolis is we are biased south siders of Chicago but when I think back on my life in the community that I was raised.
Interviewer,In the truth is is that when you read about my community it feels like so many communities in this country you know it.
Michelle,Was a working-class neighborhood of peace some people who own their homes some people who didn't.
Interviewer,It was very racially diverse when we first moved in as you can see from my kindergarten classroom pictures there.
Michelle,Were people with all kinds of last names consul Ponce in Abu Asaf sand dempsey's and Robinson's we were all sharing the.
Interviewer,Space together and living in a very vibrant community and I was in and out of the homes of all these kids you know.
Michelle,We grew up in a time where you know if you got into some trouble you could count on the neighbor lady calling up.
Interviewer,Your mother a stopping by and telling on you and you couldn't talk back to the neighbor lady you know you had to listen.
Michelle,To what other adults you had to respect what other adults in your life had to say about you we can get an amen on that.
Interviewer,Right but it wasn't just the people that was sort of the sights and sounds I mean we had a park down the street that had a.
Michelle,Men's softball league that played at Knights in the summers and I remember falling asleep on the screened-in porch.
Interviewer,Because we didn't have air conditioning and when you didn't have air conditioning you slept on a porch we.
Michelle,Spent on the porch had many a great night on the porch just falling asleep to the sounds of people cheering on.
Interviewer,Their teams you know we had the liquor store on the corner that sold bread and penny candy that's what your mother sent.
Michelle,You to get newport cigarettes and you could get a week's worth of candy with a quarter and I remember getting my latest.
Interviewer,Now later only recently you know not so recently I realized that they were now or later but.
Michelle,We didn't say it like that he said that's right it's Annihilator can and the flavor was great it was.
Interviewer,Great colors yeah i want red and i think like a lot of people in working-class families we lived in a community of.
Michelle,Relatives you know people didn't live on their own you know you lived with an elder and every elder in our family had.
Interviewer,Somebody who lived with them we lived with a great on above in a very small house but she owned the home she allowed.
Michelle,My parents to live there with little rent because my parents moved to the neighborhood to put us in better public.
Interviewer,Schools around the corner was my maternal grandmother who lived with an aunt around the other corner was my.
Michelle,Maternal grandfather they were divorced but they never just talked but they lived around the corner from each other.
Interviewer,Mm-hmm you know you just learned that they didn't talk and what we thought was light years away was my father's family.
Michelle,They lived basically like five minutes away but it felt like a big trip when we went over to dandy and grandmas because.
Interviewer,She had to get in the car to see them but I grew up with a community of cousins and cousins of cousins and.
Michelle,People who probably weren't your cousin but they were your cousins the story never really got fully.
Interviewer,Explained they're all your cousins and music was a big part of my life I write about my father who was a lover of.
Michelle,Jazz and if you grow up with a father you know of art that generation that's when you play records on the stereo and.
Interviewer,You actually actually had to sit there and listen to them and learn how to put the needle on the record player without.
Michelle,Scratching it yes because you'd get in trouble if you scratched up your father's records and and.
Interviewer,You had to listen to the whole album you couldn't pick up and put it in the middle on this song you like in the.
Michelle,Beginning wait until your song came on that you weren't in the bathroom when it came on can we start it over nope no.
Interviewer,Gotta wait till we get to the end and some of that to that music you listen to with Southside you're grab great I loved.
Michelle,All the men in my life and this is something yeah I point out because when people talk about what what makes a girl.
Interviewer,Strong and a lot of times you look to the mother and my mother definitely did that there were strong women in my.
Michelle,Family but i was surrounded men by a lot of men who loved me and treated me well and respected me I didn't know and and.
Interviewer,And i didn't realize until i got older how rare that is for a young woman to grow up safe and loved by the men in her.
Michelle,Life and that's a sad statement for us as a society as a world quite frankly but I was one of the fortunate ones who.
Interviewer,Grew up with both of her grandfather's men who adored me in South Side I would spend whole Saturdays with him.
Michelle,They were working-class folks who managed without a lot of money without degrees and connections to provide us.
Interviewer,With a home full of stability consistency love guidance values and what they remind me and should remind.
Michelle,Everybody is it doesn't take a lot of stuff to raise good kids you know you don't have to be titled to do the job of.
Interviewer,Good parenting and my parents did that my father was a stationary fireman his whole life worked the same job until the.
Michelle,Day he died and my father was the oldest of five my mother was the middle child of seven and my father was the rock for.
Interviewer,So many not just us but for his brothers and his sisters he was he was a giver you know I say in the.
Michelle,Book that he believed that time was a gift you give others and he gave and he gave and he gave he was that person that.
Interviewer,Everybody would gather around in his recliner they would come and bring the girlfriends so he could check them out.
Michelle,And they'd ask him for advice and he was a visitor you know he visited everybody and oftentimes he dragged me along with.
Interviewer,Him on a saturday where i would be sitting on some plastic sofa you know the feeling.
Michelle,Some ladies house with a little little cup of 7up and I would listen to him visit and visit and visit but my dad was.
Interviewer,A storyteller and he was courageous and he also had MS which was only part of his story and probably something I.
Michelle,Didn't realize that he struggled so mightily with as a young person because my father was somebody who wasn't going.
Interviewer,To complain you know he wasn't going to seek professional help for his disease which was a frustration to all of us he.
Michelle,Was going to get up and go to work and earn a salary and we were his world he invested everything he had in us and any.
Interviewer,Other kid that came his way so i learned to be a storyteller I learned to be a listener I learned to be a giver from.
Michelle,Watching him and then there was my mom Marion who is as I described her in the book she just had a Zen neutrality in.
Interviewer,Her ability to parent and she taught us responsibility at an early age she was the kind of mother I think we were about.
Michelle,Seven or eight when she gave us alarm clocks and she was like you're gonna wake yourselves up because as my mom.
Interviewer,Said i'm raising adults not babies so she taught us how to think for ourselves in an early age and I think the thing.
Michelle,That i want to share with people i've shared in the book that I want to say about my parents is that they valued our.
Interviewer,Voices from an early age we were not shushed we were allowed to speak our minds and.
Michelle,To ask questions they encouraged our curiosity they told us the truth and they told us the context of people's.
Interviewer,Existence so if there was the crazy uncle there the funny you know cousin they'd explain to us that history so.
Michelle,That we could understand why they landed where they were so I think because of the two of them and we as Craig said my.
Interviewer,Brother said on the video we we were successful because of these two hard-working good valued folks and I.
Michelle,Wish my dad could be here to see all this how proud would he be of you yeah so there was Michelle there was Craig.
Interviewer,Your brother who at one point you even shared a bedroom with oh yeah what was he like as a big brother and how did he.
Michelle,Add to this equation of this family he was my protector you know I joked when I was on some show.
Interviewer,This week because i've been on a lot of them I can't even remember which one I was Robin Robinson Robin Roberts.
Michelle,He was my he's the favorite okay and that's okay he's my mother's favorite she won't admit it but he knows it I.
Interviewer,Know it you know and i tell her all the time it's like what do I have to do I'm the first lady I live in the White House.
Michelle, you know I'm taking her to China I'm like you know she's meeting the Pope and.
Interviewer,At thanksgiving it still wins craig coming I'm like I really really care but the thing is is.
Michelle,That i adore him too so i can't be too bad at him and and here's the thing I want to tell you about Craig he was he.
Interviewer,And my father treated me as an equal and that's so important for fathers to understand about girls it's like having.
Michelle,A strong girl isn't just about having a strong mother it's about having men in their lives who loved them and respect.
Interviewer,Them so when my father taught my brother to do anything whether it was boxing or learning how to throw a fastball or.
Michelle,Running bases i was right there with him and my brother encouraged it he wasn't like this this is not for girls we.
Interviewer,Didn't deal with that kind of stuff so having men in my life who loved me from the start and then I had a whole.
Michelle,Community of men who loved me i had my grandfathers and my uncles one of who is here one of my favorite uncle's are here.
Interviewer,And he knows who he is i grew up with men who took care of me and looked out for me so my bar was really high by the.
Michelle,Time i was getting out in the world so education was also important to your family and early on in about second.
Interviewer,Grade something happened that really changed your trajectory tell us a little bit about what was going on back in.
Michelle,Those early days well this is also a story about this gives you some insight into who my mother is as well but we.
Interviewer,Grew up in a neighborhood called south Shore on the south side of Chicago yes South Shore in the house we are.
Michelle,Everywhere on the south side we just come everywhere but when we moved into the neighborhood it was a mixed.
Interviewer,Neighborhood mixed race neighborhood and it was working class to middle class which is one of the reasons why we moved.
Michelle,There to go better schools we lived with my aunt Robbie and she was a teacher so she was.
Interviewer,Able to own her own home she was married to my uncle we called him Tara he was a Pullman.
Michelle,Porter so they had a stable income and was able to buy a house in South Shore so the neighborhood was mixed and that.
Interviewer,Meant the schools were mixed so in kindergarten and first grade my classrooms I put a school picture in my.
Michelle,Book to show you the diversity that was there but what was going on in the 70s was what we call white flight and all my.
Interviewer,Little white friends that i had and i had plenty of them they started literally disappearing before my eyes.
Michelle,And i didn't realize until i grown up and learned about segregation and the whole issue of pushing folks fleeing out.
Interviewer,Of communities as black families moved in was that the neighborhood was starting to change and so we started to.
Michelle,Feel though those effects not just in friends leaving but Adi investment disinvestment in the neighborhood and we.
Interviewer,Felt it in the school so second grade comes around and it was the first time I was in a chaotic classroom you know.
Michelle,Where erasers were flying and teachers weren't teaching and I knew this as a second grader and I would come home with.
Interviewer,My little lunch my bologna and i'd come sitting because you came home for lunch back then lived around the corner we.
Michelle,Turn on all my children and we'd watch the shows and I'd have my bologna sandwich and I would complain be like.
Interviewer,Mom this class you will never believe it we didn't even get homework and I was that kind of kid you know I was like we.
Michelle,Are not learning enough in this class how will we make it in third grade I was this kind of worrier it's like.
Interviewer,What we our friends saying who you brought home with you they were all saying because we had we had girls that.
Michelle,Came with us we traveled in packs and we were all complain and it's like this isn't we this needs to change and and we.
Interviewer,Were just complaining and my mom did the mom thing of like and we thought she was just listening and just you know.
Michelle,Humoring us but little did we know she was back up at that school and she was making some moves and what happened was.
Interviewer,That a few of us got tested out into the third grade because of my mother and the advocacy of.
Michelle,Other mothers but i tell this story because I knew even at that age that I wasn't being invested in as a second.
Interviewer,Grader and sometimes we like to pretend that kids don't know when they're being shortchanged and devalued and I'm here.
Michelle,To tell you that i knew that at second grade so as we look at school inequality and things aren't right kids know when.
Interviewer,They are not being valued and it and it makes them feel some kind of way and I was lucky to have gotten out of that.
Michelle,Classroom and into a better classroom but that wouldn't have happened if I didn't have a parent at home who was.
Interviewer,Also one of my fiercest advocates and understood the difference between whining and real distress and that was.
Michelle,The former first lady during her book tour appearances in Washington DC now book TV covered several of these.
Interviewer,Appearances but we were only allowed to tape about ten minutes of each she also stopped in Philadelphia and here she is.
Michelle,In conversation with comedian and author Phoebe Robinson there is so much I want to talk to you about tonight your book.
Interviewer,Becoming is literally life-changing i really do feel that way it's so incredible and smart and wonderful.
Michelle,There's a lot of stuff i want to cover but I'm gonna come out hot out the gate okay with a topic that's a.
Interviewer,Controversial just the way we like it hi hi so stick with me um Thanksgiving was last week yeah and I remembered.
Michelle,Four years ago when you're being interviewed by Robin Roberts on ABC you and Barack and she asked you guys this.
Interviewer,Question so let's take a look how it turned out oh it's tur stuffing favorite pie pumpkin for Thanksgiving okay okay.
Michelle,So let's talk to me can be freeze back on him that is that's not Michelle that's a little fun being like what the.
Interviewer,Hell every woman knows that look when it comes to her band it's just like wow they're people looking at their men like.
Michelle,That tonight i can't can't believe you just said that did you feel pretty betrayal when he picked pumpkin pie what.
Interviewer,You know that's sort of that's barack swervy wades pumpkin pie in the Robinson household we do sweet potato yeah.
Michelle,I didn't even really know there was pumpkin pie so I left home I didn't even know what that was the concept of.
Interviewer,Pumpkin in a pie no no sweet potato pie it's like I look at him like you know better than that.

Interviewer,Open to so many people in so many ways and people are curious about other people's stories I mean that's what I.
Michelle,Experienced when i first campaign for Barack and Iowa the notion that there's a little girl from the south side of.
Interviewer,Chicago who at the time was named Michelle Obama berry to Barack Hussein Obama was going to dive deep into the.
Michelle,Midwest in iowa going door-to-door in people's homes and they were opening up their homes and welcoming me around.
Interviewer,Their kitchen tables and what connected us was our story it was our shared stories of the stuff.
Michelle,That i put in this book you know it wasn't what degree I had it wasn't what school I went to it wasn't what career I.
Interviewer,Had it was what was our food like what was that kitchen table conversation like what was the relationship with my.
Michelle,Favorite what relative like what were our neighborhoods like the sights and the smells and that's the commonality.
Interviewer,That we share across this country it is not race it is not gender it's not religion it's the stories that make us.
Michelle,Who we are and the fact that this is resonating with so many different people just reinforces what I know is true.
Interviewer,About this country so yes i think that is now incumbent upon us to stop being afraid of our stories and to know that.
Michelle,There are so many ways to live a life and is up to us to share it with one another and know that we won't be judged.
Interviewer,Or criticized or looked upon oddly so now we have to dig deep and and and know our stories and be ready to put them on.

Interviewer,People who love you up close and moving out in radiating circles to the whole world who you are up close is who you.
Michelle,Are writ large and that's an extraordinary thing to see and what I think is amazing.
Interviewer,About what you decided to do after the White House years is you decided to write a real book yeah you decided not.
Michelle,To write a book that hit certain first Lady marks but rather a book that I want to tell you all and you have not yet.
Interviewer,Read this book this is an important work of American literature okay this is a coming-of-age story a girlhood to.
Michelle,Womanhood story of finding your power story and ultimately a story that like so many great works of literature helps.
Interviewer,Us know ourselves better so why did you decide that you wanted to write this kind of book when you did it was the.
Michelle,Only way i can write a book because for those of you who haven't read the book what you'll see as I started telling the.
Interviewer,Story that the least important part of the book was the eight years that I was first lady that was just a part of a.
Michelle,Bigger story and for people to understand how I got there the context was important in my life because I know.
Interviewer,It's important in everyone's life you know the real meat of our lives come in those little moments that you see it.
Michelle,In the first section in the section second section you know the stories about real life the real stories not.
Interviewer,Your stats not you know where you went to school and how much money you make and what kind of occupation you have but.
Michelle,It's it's it's sort of what are the sights and smells of your life you know who are the people that touched you you.
Interviewer,Know what relationship did you have with your father what was your first fight you know what was your neighborhood like.
Michelle,What did it feel like what were those sounds that's what makes us who we are that's what made me who I am so you.
Interviewer,Don't understand michelle obama the first lady unless you understand Miche little Michelle Robinson who grew up on.
Michelle,The south side in a working-class community we went to public school you know who had her ups and downs and you.
Interviewer,Know here's the thing that i want people to understand it's like people are really interested in that part of our.
Michelle,Stories and and i wrote this book and hopefully as a way to let people know that we need to tap into the stories.
Interviewer,That we have you know and and and not only be willing to understand those stories to understand the journeys that.
Michelle,We've all gone on to get us to where we are now but then you have to have the courage to share them because that's.
Interviewer,When you really know people you know that that's when you you can tap into their real essence and I and I hope by.
Michelle,Being as vulnerable about all of my life the highs and the lows the embarrassments the challenges the.
Interviewer,Struggles that people would understand that that just opens you up to Who I am so there's no need to hide that stuff.
Michelle,For any of us that's what connects us so my hope is that this book will inspire everyone to tap into their own journeys.
Interviewer,Of becoming and to share those stories with one another and I think you know starting as you do on the south side of.
Michelle,Chicago without side side with the left you say South Side but we're actually in New York so we can only say it a few.
Interviewer,Times because then they'll start talking about the whole New York thing - Brooklyn.
Michelle,Everybody's got their neighborhood that's it my - happened to be the south side and that little girl who I loved so.
Interviewer,Much who who i claim as the the childhood best friend in my mind a little Michelle Robinson was an amazing.
Michelle,Little girl and as you described her an ordinary extraordinary little girl like so many of us and that there are so many.
Interviewer,Things about your life living within five blocks of cousins and extended family having those family members who.
Michelle,Are sometimes coming with their feelings or their anger or their outside miss but still they're part of the fabric of the.
Interviewer,Family and listening as you write so beautifully to the sounds of striving yeah right listening to that all around.
Michelle,You talk about that and about that that world well my neighborhood was like most.
Interviewer,Neighborhoods you know not just in cities but in in rural communities you know you you we grew up with family and.
Michelle,Everyone lived with an elder i lived with my great-aunt I had another aunt who lived with a.
Interviewer,Grandmother another couple of aunts and uncles live with my grandfather south side we all live in the same community.
Michelle,And we grew up in a time when you respected your elders you know even in the neighborhood when you were playing.
Interviewer,Around and if you ran over somebody's grass or did something wrong neighbor lady X was going to tell your.
Michelle,Mother hmm and your mother wasn't gonna curse her out for telling you she was gonna come.
Interviewer,Home and beep your behind because you're supposed to listen to neighbor ladx you know and it was a community it was a it.
Michelle,My my neighbourhood south shore was a vibrant diverse community a working-class neighborhood where people.
Interviewer,Own their homes it was it was a diverse until 2nd grade right before white flight set in that's when white folks.
Michelle,Felt comfortable sort of living with us in our neighborhoods and then people like us moved in and they they fled so.
Interviewer,You can see that in my class pictures in my early grade in kindergarten you can see that there are kids of all.
Michelle,Backgrounds and we all played together and we were at each other's homes and little did I know that people were.
Interviewer,Whispering in their ear realtors saying get out because this is turning into a ghetto you better run and by the time I.
Michelle,Was in eighth grade as you can see in this picture this the neighborhood was all all-black and that sort of.
Interviewer,Sociological phenomenon of white flight has gone on in countries in communities all over the country and I stopped here.
Michelle,Because i i just want us to understand that in that time people were afraid of us right now let's just hold that.
Interviewer,Thought because we we're sort of going through that right now where we are telling ourselves are being told that we.
Michelle,Need to be afraid of people who don't look like us who don't speak the same language or because somehow we are to be.
Interviewer,Feared there were white folks who were afraid of Michelle and Craig and Marian and Frazier and Southside and I want us.
Michelle,To hold on to that because that still goes on that sort of notion that people look at the color of your skin and they.
Interviewer,Make assumptions about who you were they didn't know our values they didn't know that we were kids striving to be good.
Michelle,That our father was hard work and they didn't care they were running from our race and we still do that so I grew up.
Interviewer,In what was a vibrant community but as it started to become more more more black you know we could see the.
Michelle,Deterioration and you could feel it you could feel it in the school system as people were taking money out of the.
Interviewer,Schools you could see it and the attitudes of the school teachers towards us I could see it as a young child I.
Michelle,I was that kid who would come home i came home from second grade just all disgusted at the fact that we weren't.
Interviewer,Learning in the second grade I would come home and slide to mom we didn't get homework again last night.
Michelle,Yeah i don't know how we're gonna be prepared for third grade this is outrageous I was a bad kid and your.
Interviewer,Mother wonderfully always said i wasn't raising children I was raising adults she was raising it though so she taught.
Michelle,Us to express ourselves and to speak our minds but to do it politely but at the same time she was a mother who.
Interviewer,Fortunately because my father worked so hard allowed my mother to stay home from work so she was one of those handful of.
Michelle,Mothers in the schools who were looking out not just for her kids but for all the kids who didn't have parents who.
Interviewer,Could be at home and she went up to that school and because she she heard my cry and she took my complaint seriously and.
Michelle,I say this to say that parents can be advocates in some very powerful ways early on for kids when they're young and.
Interviewer,That wraps up book tv's coverage of Michelle Obama's book tour for her best-selling memoir be coming now if you.
Michelle,Missed any of the segments that we've shown you today or would like to see them again go to book tv.org.
Interviewer,Watch them in their entirety this yearbook TV marks our 20th year of bringing you the country's top.
Michelle,Nonfiction authors and their latest books find us .
Interviewer,Thank you so much for having me.
Michelle,"So one of the reasons why I wanted to talk about health, especially in this series of conversations where we're talking about relationships, and all the things that make us who we are, as women, in particular, we can't really full unravel that, that, that idea without us fully understanding the relationship we have with our own bodies."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"It's a relationship that's fraught with complications, to say the least. And ones that I think that we as women, we need to spend some time exploring, talking, sharing, we come from a generation, our mothers, and grandmothers, and those before, who didn't talk about anything."
Interviewer,"Oh, no."
Michelle,"And, I fortunately, had, my mom was, I think ahead of the game, because she, was like, we're talking about it all, here's your little kit, you remember, in our generation, you got the kit, um, that came in the box, it was a, it was a flower box."
Interviewer,haha.
Michelle,"And it had the pamphlet on all the information, and that was before tampons, and you had the belt, and the big ol' pads, and, and that got delivered, and we discussed it, and then it was stored, the box was stored under the bed. It was sort of like a little treasure, waiting for the moment to happen. But, unlike a lot of people my age and younger, I was prepared, in a way that I've come to learn, a lot of young girls weren't prepared."
Interviewer,No.
Michelle,"And so, imagine. That major thing is going to happen to you, one day you are going to wake up, and your whole, physical being is changed, and nobody, nobody told you, it was coming!"
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,haha It's true. That's true.
Interviewer,"From you, you know, and, you know, cause, I used to go through this all the time, you know I'd try to talk to my girls, and then, you know, and they would be, I'd try to go someplace and they're like oh, mom, please, don't, I don't want to hear that, you know?"
Michelle,"Well and you're a doctor, so everything is very matter of fact."
Interviewer,"Oh, they don't want it, they don't want to hear it. But it's important that the information gets transmitted. However it does. So whether or not you have, you know, your girls have a favorite auntie, or they have, you know, or they go to their doctor, to their pediatrician, but it should be another person, in their lives, that, that's a trusted, person, and, you know, sometimes it hurts your feelings, but it may or not be, you, it was not me, um."
Michelle,"Yeah, hahaha."
Interviewer,"But, I can talk to, it's funny, I talk to other peoples' daughters and young women all the time, and my girls are like, please, and it's only been really since they're probably, been in their twenties that they've come back around to say well, maybe mom does have something to say."
Michelle,"Well, and I think our generation has an opportunity to send a different message, to the young, to the generations that follow us. I know for me, I've approached conversations with my daughters very differently, and we both have, have daughters. We started talking about, their bodies, what's gonna happen, what that means, talking about it openly, I found that, my girls would be as open as they saw me being, you know, so, if they, if they thought I was tiptoeing around something, or I was like, don't ask about that, or shut down when they had a question, even if the question was uncomfortable... I had to learn how to put that mommy poker face on, and go, OK, OK let's, there's the, Oh, OK, well, you know sometimes I'd try to buy myself a night, Well, let's sleep on that! And talk about it, in the car, right, just to sort of, figure out what to say, because I always wanted my daughters to feel comfortable with their bodies, comfortable asking questions. And in order to do that, you can't have anything that's off limits, because, especially when kids are young, the minute they see you clenching up about something, they notice that, and they will never ask it again, or they're never ask you, and instead they'll go and talk amongst themselves, and I used to tease, what I told my girls when they were young, is like, I don't want you learning about your bodies and sex from another twelve year old. None of y'all know what you're talking about! You're twelve. Come ask me."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"But I think we have to kind of, kind of acknowledge, that that's, that's a good direction. I mean, that doesn't make your child more promiscuous, it doesn't, you know, information is power."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"In all, in all areas of life, but especially when it comes to, health."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"I want my daughters to grow up, seeking out information about themselves, because sexuality ties to other things around health. Mammograms, pap smears, all of that, is like, if you're, if you can't touch your breast, because you feel like you can't, you'll never discover a lump earlier, if you're not getting regular pap smears, you're probably not going to the doctor, at all, right, so, our comfort level with our sexual health is directly tied to our, in my view, our physical, overall well being. And I don't want my daughters, to think that they can't ask questions when something is wrong, when there's a bump, or a lump, or a, you know, something out of sorts, if we've shut them down sexually, when they're young, it's their first interaction, as adolescents, with health. And, if we shut that down, what does that do to them later on in life, when they really need to be questioning when things feels different, when things are wrong, when there's a discharge, when there's an itch, when there's a, all of these are signs of bigger things that have to be dealt with, but if you've shushed that, that conversation, in your household, for, for girls and probably for boys as well, you're shushing down the power that they'll have, in the years to come, to have control over their health, to take control over their healthcare broadly."
Interviewer,"I have been practicing now, for almost thirty years. And, it's interesting how things evolve, just in terms of my manner, how I talked to my patients, you know, twenty, thirty years ago versus now. The one thing that I have come to, understand, is that, it's true. You never know the answer to a question that you don't ask. And when you're in a situation like that, one of the things that I have learned to do, is to bring it up. I ask questions about sex. You know. OK, well, how's that going? Or how is this going, and, it's just, you can see a sense of relief that just comes over, like,  I thought you'd never ask. And, but I realized probably for the first ten years of my practice, I, you know, you didn't ask, cause you're busy talking about other things, it's, you know."
Michelle,"Hmm. So that wasn't a part of your training? Or, what."
Interviewer,"Well, yeah, it was not."
Michelle,Wow. Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"You were, you're busy talking, about, you know, contraception, and pap smears, just like you're saying, all the health stuff, and, we get you through a pregnancy safely, on the other side, but when you are done with that part of your life, that discussion about sex, very few women will bring it up. But once the topic is broached, then you've opened a door. And it helps to, you know, the same thing we do with, with girls, that we do with young women, you need to normalize the conversation."
Michelle,Yes.
Interviewer,"And to not, make it seem like, OK well I'm weird, or I'm the only person that has this, and you set the stage, and once you've done that, it's so much easier to have the conversation."
Michelle,"My conversation with my mother, you know, good ol' Marian, I love that, I love that woman, cause she talks about a lot of stuff, but then, there's just some stuff she's like I don't know, I don't, I don't remember menopause. I was like you don't rem- Ma, you don't remember it at all? Can you give me some hints, did you have hot flashes? Ahh, Iunnnoo! Which, you know, and she's eighty something, so, you know, look, I barely remember what I did last week, so, I mean maybe by the time I'm eighty I won't remember menopause either, but that is, another reason why we need to talk about it, while we're remembering it. Our friend group, we've had many, many conversations over the last ten years or so, about menopause."
Interviewer,"There is so, there is so little information that people know to really access. Because, sometimes with menopause, and the perimenopause, and I'll, just for definition's sake, perimenopause, is the years leading up to menopause."
Michelle,"Which, what, when does that start?"
Interviewer,"Anywhere, starts, usually in your mid forties, sometimes in your early forties, but it goes, and menopause itself is your last period, you've had your last period, that's it."
Michelle,Hallelujah hahaha.
Interviewer,"That's it, and, plus, and then you are postmenopausal, for sure, when it's your last period plus a year. And why it's so confusing, is because it, cause, it happens to you before you're even thinking about it, that's the problem. And so you're forty three, forty four, and you start to be irritable, or you've got hot flashes, or your periods get screwy. And that's why you kind of, need to know what to expect. So you don't think that, again, that there's something terribly wrong, or what am I gonna do about this, because women complain a lot about, I just can't sleep. So, the range of symptoms is huge. And then there are some women, those few, lucky women, who don't really have any symptoms, they're kind of like oh, yeah, and then my period stopped. Those are the same women who, Oh, yeah, I just went into labor, and I just had the baby, OK, they, they exist, but, I."
Michelle,"Right, hahaha."
Interviewer,"You don't see many of 'em, you know."
Michelle,"Why the irritation, just like, you know, I guess the same thing is true, when you're gonna have your period, what, what, what is going on?"
Interviewer,"That is exactly it. That is, that is the perfect analogy, because menopause, is puberty in reverse. And you know how teenagers act, because their hormones, they're up, they're down, they're here, they're there, Ah! They're screamin' in one minute, Hate you, mom I love you, the next, OK, exact same thing. But you're winding down, at that phase. And it's not just the presence or the absence of the hormones, because once you get done, and your, everything has settled down, then you're kind of back to a baseli- a different baseline, but you don't have those mood fluctuations that you have in the transition."
Michelle,"And then everybody's emotional changes are different, right, because your genetic makeup, your size, everything will, will impact how you feel, though, some people, like you said, that have those emotional shifts, and it just, they, it, it doesn't even register, because that's just, you know, Or, they don't register."
Interviewer,"Right, that time of life, which is, which makes it even more complicated, because usually in your mid forties to your mid fifties, there's a lot of stuff going on in your life, too, and sometimes you're just mad, and upset, because sometimes they're really maddening and upsetting things, to, you know, going on in your life."
Michelle,"Mmm hmm, right haha."
Interviewer,"So there's that, but what, that extra hormonal, sort of imbalance does, is it takes away your buffer. You know, your ability, something, that would be."
Michelle,"Your coping mechanism, mmm hmm."
Interviewer,"Exactly. You'd be irritated on a regular day, you might be in a murderous rage, the next, because you just don't have that ability to modulate. And that's why this sort of perimenopausal, menopausal phase is also a time when, either women who've had, history of depression, or anxiety, it's worse, around the time of the menopause, and sometimes it's women who've never had a history of either of these things, and then they find that, around the time, it's this great unmasking of all the, sort of emotional changes that go on."
Michelle,"Where are you on hormones? I mean cause that's another thing, right, to take them, to not take them?"
Interviewer,It depends. it depends...
Michelle,"Right, hahaha, it's like, you know, just when I thought you would be good for everybody else, but there are like eight thousand options."
Interviewer,"No, but they're not, but you know, I think, the first, divide, is hormones or no hormones. Are you, do you want 'em or do you not want them? And, I, and it depends upon which category you fall into. I think the women who have the most symptoms who are most bothered, who've got hot flashes and night sweats, and you know, and just all the mood stuff, that's an easy sell, because you're going to, when you take hormone replacement therapy, there are a lot of other alternative things you can do, and that's assuming that you've already exercised and you're eating right, and you're, you know, mitigating the stress in your life. But nothing is going to hit all of those things as efficiently as hormone replacement therapy. The other imponderable about this, is that even though after I've told you all those symptoms that you could have, and you say, well, how long does it last, well, if it lasted for two months, you might be fine and say I'm good, I'm."
Michelle,"Right, right, That's how I felt about an epidural, you know, it was just like."
Interviewer,Exactly.
Michelle,"It was just like, now, in the height of your pain, it's like now how long is this gon' be? hahaha It's like, if it's a twenty four hours, it's like, stick me in the spine!"
Interviewer,"Perfect, that is perfect, that's exactly, it's like, I could do this for twenty minutes, but, mm mm, no."
Michelle,That's right! haha.
Interviewer,"It's the same thing. Those sort of immediate things, hot flashes, sleeplessness, the bleeding stuff, it tends to go away, in time, but there are some other things that actually don't show up until later. And there are things like, um, you know, vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, urinary symptoms, those happen, just when you think, phew, I'm out of that."
Michelle,I'm me again! And then it's like what?!
Interviewer,Phase 2 kicks in.
Michelle,"Yes, Yes. right."
Interviewer,"And we've had this conversation, I said, I can't be any madder than I am right now."
Michelle,Right! hahaha.
Interviewer,"I just cannot. So, I think the better lemme see, mm hmm."
Michelle,"Easy way out of this, deep anger, or."
Interviewer,"Let's, let's take some hormones. Killing somebody, you know, so, haha right."
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"If you are bothered, and I say bothered to the point that it is affecting the quality of your relationships, how you do your work, how you feel, then that's an easy sell. And for everybody else, you know, if you're not, you know, if it's kind of like a, a non-event, like you're, if you say, your mom, she kind went through it, and it was over."
Michelle,Well she doesn't remember.
Interviewer,"Well that's true. You, you know what else, haha."
Michelle,"haha She could've been swinging from the chandeliers, and I was in college, my father's not here to share, so, she might've been like I'm fine, and he's like oh no she wasn't!"
Interviewer,"But there are some non, sort of menopausal symptom benefits, really, of hormone replacement therapy, and it prevents osteoporosis, you know, so you have less fractures later on down the road, and, you also, will have less of those longer term complications I was saying, you know, like vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, if you want to remain sexually active."
Michelle,"I, too, am a hormone taker, low risk, on all the other fronts, because I have a, a a very healthy baseline, and, and also, you know, well I was experiencing hormone shifts because of infertility, having to take shots and all that, I experienced the night sweats, even in my thirties, and, when you think of the other symptoms that come along, just hot flashes, I mean, I had a few before I started taking hormones, I remember having one on Marine 1."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"The temperature in the room, but again, if we're trying to hide this stuff."
Interviewer,"Right, right."
Michelle,"And we're not talking about it, that doesn't mean you bring it up in the meeting, but, it's like we've got to be aware that this is happening, if it's happening from women beginning in their forties, the whole system of the workplace, doesn't work for us in the right way. What a woman's body is taking her through, is important information. It's an important thing to take up space in a society. Cause half of us are going through this."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,But we're living like it's not happening.
Interviewer,More on the Michelle Obama podcast. After the break.
Michelle,"How many men, do you think, could deal with the severest form of cramps, which, literally feels like, a knife being stabbed, and turned."
Interviewer,hahaha.
Michelle,"And then released. And then turned! And then released. And you got to do that, and you got to get up and keep going , it's like, go to work."
Interviewer,Go to school.
Michelle,"Go to school, you know, go play on the basketball court, every woman who's playing a sport now, is doing it through all those circumstances. And I don't know any men who could possible conceive of what that feels like."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"If we can't acknowledge what's going on with us, we can't, we can't fully celebrate, just how amazing we are. We got a whole channel dedicated to men throwing a ball in a hoop, and I love sports, I love watching men play sports. I get it. But there should be like, some, birthing channels, haha just some, Did you see what she did, did you see that little woman push a ten pound baby out, let's give here a, where's her ESPY?, or there should be an award ceremony!"
Interviewer,"Right, right. And then, after you go, from that, after you've given birth, then your children become your priority, so you know, still, there's still this point at which, you kind of say, alright, when is it my turn? And this is, I think the good news, about menopause, is that, even though getting there, is complicated, you know, it may be the first time, in a lot of women's lives when you're not tied down by the other things that are, that are just part of your day to day life. The notion of, trying to present yourself, to someone, other than your truly, authentic self, kind of fades away. You know?"
Michelle,"Yeah, Yeah."
Interviewer,"You just get to say, you know."
Michelle,This is it.
Interviewer,"This is it, you know."
Michelle,"I have changed, and tried to adapt, and I've been accommodating, I've accommodated my husband, I've accommodated society, I've accommodated my children, now I'm done. Whew."
Interviewer,"When I turned 60, I said to myself, you know, I'm going to give myself this gift, and the gift is, I'm going to say yes, to everything I want to say yes to, and no to everything I don't. And I don't think I have ever, in my life, given myself permission to do that."
Michelle,"And let's stop there, so that the men that could be listening to this, hear this, because, they start doing that, when they're 20. They adopt their, that philosophy much earlier in their lives. Men, it takes us, until we're 50 or 60 to feel free enough, physically and emotionally, to say, I'm going to think about what I want, and say yes and no to the things that bring me joy, or turn me off."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,It takes us a lifetime to get there.
Interviewer,"It does. And some people unfortunately never get there, you know, we are, accommodating because that is how, that is what is required of us, you know."
Michelle,To get through.
Interviewer,"Right. You say, you know, sex, for a woman, you have to have another person into your body, another person. Pregnancy means you've got to share your body, with another human being, for nine months, and that is a, a level of accommodation that you realize that that's why we're always second, because there's always like, I've got to keep this here, got to keep, you know, this pers-, then you get this baby, I've got to keep this baby alive."
Michelle,haha.
Interviewer,"Because it's a lot harder than it looks, but, you know, I look at it now, and I think about it, and I say hmmm, first time, first time, that we are not having to accommodate other people. And I think that's a beautiful thing, and I think that's how, women should really, look at menopause. Don't think it, think of it as the end of things, it's the beginning of things, it's the beginning of your new chapter, or as I like to call it, we're entering our third, trimester, you know, of life."
Michelle,"Well one of the things we've talked about, and that I'm, I'm finding as I get older, not just dealing with menopause, but dealing with, what does health mean for a woman of our age? Right. So, you know, there's that."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"But then I think backwards, and I think, well what's what does being healthy mean for women, period? And, we've always talked about how there's so many conflicting messages out there, about, weight, about, mostly about weight, right, first of all, because it seems to be that that's the only thing, from a PR standpoint, that people tend to care about. But, we don't sort of, have a real clear baseline, for what health means for a woman."
Interviewer,"Women's value, goes up, with how little space you take up, you know."
Michelle,haha Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"So, the smaller you can make yourself, the higher perceived, you know, socioeconomic group that you're in, and whatever, it's all about being thin. But you're right, being thin, and being healthy are two completely different things. I'm going to focus more on function, than form. So what you look like, and how much you weigh, is less on an issue, particularly as you get older, because the question is, what can you do? What's your function level like?"
Michelle,"And also, we, we we, come with different skeletal structures."
Interviewer,We do.
Michelle,"I am, 5'11, and I have hips, and thighs, and I can look over my family, and I can see, that's genetically who I'm supposed to be."
Interviewer,"We spend a lot of times, a lot of time, being unhappy with our, in our physical selves. My breasts are too small, they're too big, this is too what, that was right, I'd look better if I had, on and on and on and on."
Michelle,Do you know a woman who's happy with herself?
Interviewer,Off the top of my head?
Michelle,"I mean, yeah, if you just think about it, do you know any woman who would come in and go I'm good? haha I don't know one."
Interviewer,"Mmmm, mmm , no, cause we were always, we're always trying to fix or tweak something."
Michelle,"Yeah, and how exhausting is that?"
Interviewer,It is.
Michelle,"It is an exhausting way to have to live, and so many of us are doing it. Women of a certain age, we, we lose our value in society, unlike men, who gain value the older they get. You know, and those images are propagated in, on television, where you see the frumpy, funny old guy, with the young, vivacious, or even if she's our age, she is perfect. hahaha you know. Hair laid, you know, the woman always looks a lot better than her husband in the movies, and it's like well, how is she with him? You know, so that, you know I've heard a lot of women my age, feel like, as, with each age, they feel less seen in a public place. You know, no longer do heads turn, because heads only turn, in your twenties or thirties, or maybe forties, if you, keep up that, bod, you know, in order to be noticed. Women are rewarded for not looking their age, you know, it's like, oh, she snapped back, she doesn't even look like she ever had a baby, she doesn't, so that's essentially saying, she doesn't look like she's maturing."
Interviewer,Exactly.
Michelle,"And so, wow, that's the goal."
Interviewer,"People need role models, and they need someone to look, to say, because they don't have, whatever you have in your mind, of what, fifty looks like, or what fifty five looks like, it might be based upon something that is really, not, you know, the way that you would aspire to be, but that's in your head. But the more women that they see, who are, fifty five, sixty, who are out there living their best lives, and being, you know, active, and, physical, and beautiful, you know, but beautiful in a fifty year old way, not in a twenty year old way."
Michelle,"Yeah, not in a twenty year old way! Yeah."
Interviewer,"You know, it's a different way of doing it, and I think that, you know, that's what, you know, we've got to keep putting out there, I think for women, uh, I'm not trying to be twenty, and guess what, I'm just, nope."
Michelle,"Mmm mm. I wouldn't, not for, all the tea in China."
Interviewer,"But, you know, once you sort of redefine what that space is, then it becomes, I think, easier for the women who come behind us."
Michelle,"We have, we have, to give people a sense of our women's health group, started in the White House, I have always had this wonderful group of girlfriends. And I thought well I need to not just see them, I have to be out and physical, and doing something that gets me into the fresh air, so I started organizing what I called boot camps. Which were held at Camp David, and I invited a group of women friends, and we started off pretty strict, because I, I was kind of losing my mind back then."
Interviewer,"You know, over the years, I've always sort of considered myself, hmm, relatively physically fit, but, you know, that meant, like, oh, couple, 2, 3 times a week I'd do something."
Michelle,Mmm hmm.
Interviewer,"And I'll never forget that first time I came to Camp David, and I said, we're going to work out three times a day?"
Michelle,hahaha.
Interviewer,"We had something that is quite a luxury, cause we had, we would have two or three hours, to talk about things, and, even if you go to your doctor, and you have legitimate questions, you got fifteen minutes, twenty minutes, tops, and, it's hard to get into a rhythm of what you're really trying to ask, and a lot of times, you don't even know what to ask, you're just hoping that someone can direct the conversation, but when you have the luxury of ten women sitting around a room, you know, one thing will spur another question, or another comment, about, what's going on. And, and having the safety, that's also a big, big, big factor in all of this, because most people don't trust enough to be able to say what really is going on with them, or what you really fear."
Michelle,"And, cohorts matter with women. They've always mattered for me. Health for me, I enjoy it in community. Like I always joke, it's like, my husband can get on a treadmill, he can follow a workout on a piece of paper in a dark corner in a room, And he could do that everyday. And I look at him sometimes, his workout situation, and go, That's sad. That just makes me sad."
Interviewer,hahaha.
Michelle,"That you're down here lifting weights by yourself, And he's like, Well, what are you talking about? He's like, doesn't want anybody around! I am happiest, when I am exercising with my friends! Exercise, if like, I gotta have somebody else, cause we have to talk, while we're doing it, or talk before, or talk afterwards. I say this because if that's part of who we are, as women, and we're trying to fit our health plans into a male model that is very individualized and isolated, well no wonder we're not embracing our health. Because it's no fun! And, it's, it has to be fun, it has to be collaborative, which is, goes back to our boot camp retreats, you know. We got through those, because we knew well, we're going to eat breakfast together, and then we're gon' workout. And then we're gonna talk, and then we're gonna workout, and then we're gonna complain together, and then we're gonna workout. I want to encourage women, who find it difficult, to get started, to think about, shaping their health communities. Right. You know, cause maybe that's the thing that will keep us in it. I will quit on myself, faster than I'll quit on my friends. So, thank you, Sharon."
Interviewer,"Oh, you are so welcome, it's been the ride of a lifetime, and we're still on it."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,Hi everybody we are here for the united state of women now i know you all have had a busy.
Michelle,Packed full day very inspiring right and hopefully our conversation will live up to the hype but before we begin of.
Interviewer,Course i want to take a moment to just acknowledge what has happened in orlando that even as we gather here today and we.
Michelle,Talk about the challenges that women face we have to remember those that we lost in orlando as well as those who are.
Interviewer,Injured and all of their loved ones and know that we will all continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers but the.
Michelle,One thing i just want us all to know that as tragic times like these in this country it's time for us to come.
Interviewer,Together to love each other to support each other and not see reach other down so i hope that that is one of the many.
Michelle,Takeaways that we we move forward with and i just love you all for the work the amazing work you all have done today and.
Interviewer,That you do every single day so i'm going to turn it over to oprah hello we have oprah winfrey here.
Michelle,And our first lady i of the united States of America of America is not just a women yes so I think that the fact.
Interviewer,That i've been watching this being streamed all day and the fact that there are men here women here of all ages.
Michelle,Young women maturing women and all walks of life is a move in the right direction would you not say absolutely I'm just.
Interviewer,Proud of all the work that's been done here so I agree I agree well I wanted to start with the issue of self value and.
Michelle,Self-worth because over the years i've interviewed thousands of people most of them women and I would say that the root.
Interviewer,Of every dysfunction i've ever encountered every problem has been some sense of a lacking of self value or of.
Michelle,Self worth and i know that we all we all know that we live in a world where you are constantly being bombarded by images.
Interviewer,That encourage you to be light literally and it's a lot to live up to and I wonder particularly you who've had to.
Michelle,Face this as your own woman and as a candidate's wife the pressure of other people's expectations and what can you.
Interviewer,Share with our audience here and online that would help us stand more inside ourselves and own that space very good.
Michelle,Question well you know one of the things that I always I tell my mentees I tell my daughters is that the our first job.
Interviewer,In life is women i think is to get to know ourselves and I think a lot of times we don't do that we spend our time.
Michelle,Pleasing satisfying looking out into the world to define who we are listening to the messages the images the limited.
Interviewer,Definitions that people have of who we are and that's true for women of color for sure.
Michelle,There is a limited box that we are put in yeah and if we live by that limited definition we we miss out on a lot of.
Interviewer,Who we are but it it takes it takes taking the time to know who you are to be able to deal with the onslaught of.
Michelle,Negative messages that you're bound to get so for me I came into this with a pretty clear sense of myself and some of.
Interviewer,That comes with age some of that comes with experience some some of that comes from being fortunate enough to been.
Michelle,Raised by a loving mother strong focused and a father who loved me dearly so I fortunately came into this.
Interviewer,Situation with a really clear sense of who I was so when you hear the smack talking from outside the world it's easy.
Michelle,To sort of brush that off because i know Who I am but when you came in there were the world's expectations there were.
Interviewer,Other expectations what did you really expect you know it's interesting I really tried not to limit myself by.
Michelle,Expectations right because anybody grows up thinking I'm gonna be a first absolutely not.
Interviewer,Yeah you know and as you all know when Barack was talking about running I was like are you crazy I mean would you just.
Michelle,Like chill out and do something else with with your life so I was working hard to try to get him to do the other.
Interviewer,Thing so whatever that was so yeah absolutely it wasn't something that I could have planned for could have.
Michelle,Expected for myself but one of the things I knew because people asked all throughout the campaign what are your.
Interviewer,Issues are gonna be what are you gonna be like his first lady and I said I have to wait until I get there.
Michelle,To figure out what that's gonna feel like for me right I specifically did not read other first lady's books because I.
Interviewer,Didn't want to be influenced by how they define the role I knew that I would have to define.
Michelle,This role very uniquely and specifically to me and who I was so I came in thinking about who I wanted to be in.
Interviewer,This position who and who i needed to be for my girls first of all so you remember you know Malia and Sasha were.
Michelle,Little itty bittys when we came in the office I mean it still moves me to tears to think about the first day I put them.
Interviewer,In the car with their secret service agents to go to their first day of school and I saw them leaving and I.
Michelle,Thought what on earth am i doing to these babies so I knew right then and there my first job was to make sure they.
Interviewer,Were gonna be whole and normal and cared for in the midst of all this craziness and then I started to understand that if.
Michelle,I was gonna protect them i had a number-one protecting myself and protect my time so I knew going into this role.
Interviewer,That i didn't want to waste any time that anytime I spin away from my kids and I actually took this on even before.
Michelle,I became first lady even as a lawyer as a vice president at a hospital one of the things I realized is that if you do.
Interviewer,Not take control over your time and your life other people will gobble it up if you don't prioritize yourself.
Michelle,You constantly start falling lower and lower on your list your kids fall lower and lower on your list so by the time.
Interviewer,You got here you knew how to do that i knew how to do that I think that's one of the number-one issues with women you.
Michelle,Know i never in all my years of interviewing I've ever heard a man say you know I just don't have the time I.
Interviewer,Just don't i don't you find a way to know they don't have to balance anything yes sorry you know and I hope that that.
Michelle,Is changing but so many men don't have to do at all so how did you figure it out you know.
Interviewer,I've read the story i'm sure many of you've heard the story of early on you were going to a job interview and you.
Michelle,Took sasha with you - yeah yeah i we never heard did you get that job I did okay and I was.
Interviewer,Vice president of community outreach for the University of Chicago hospital and I got that job because I didn't compromise.
Michelle,Because before getting working at that job I was working as an associate dean I had had Malia Barack was in the US.
Interviewer,Senate so i was basically you know mothering part time on my own having I had a full-time job so I tried part-time.
Michelle,I've talked about this before i tried part-time because I thought I have to figure this out I have to be able to.
Interviewer,Pick the kids up i've got to be able to do all this so try part-time the only thing I found out from part-time was.
Michelle,That you just get paid part-time because I was still doing a full time job I was just cramming it all into the few hours.
Interviewer,That i was there and driving myself crazy so I had vowed that if I continued to work that I would never settle for.
Michelle,Part time i knew what my time and energy was worth so when I went into that the president's office to interview for that.
Interviewer,Job i thought i have a little baby i don't have babysitting so here we go we're all gonna go in to see the.
Michelle,President because this is who i am yeah and I said and if I take this job I need flexibility and I need full pay so.
Interviewer,If you want me to leave my baby and my kids then you're gonna have to pay me because I'm gonna do the job that was.
Michelle,Never a question you know i could deliver but I wasn't I knew then I wasn't going to sell myself short and I.
Interviewer,Had the leverage at the time to make that decision well that comes from a sense of and you said you arrived here.
Michelle,Knowing who you were i think that is the journey that is the journey and there is a question from a farm fresh cow farm.
Interviewer,Fresh gal she must have our own garden hope like we do yes and farm fresh cow says as a woman leader in the corporate.
Michelle,World i feel like i have to be brave a lot and what you just described was brave any advice or tips on bravery.
Interviewer,That's a good question gosh I don't know if I ever I don't ever view it as bravery yeah.
Michelle,You didn't think that was brave saying look I'm gonna be paid by time right I just I just viewed it is I'm I'm not.
Interviewer,Gonna be taken advantage of you know I just I am just not gonna keep you knew your value that's new your.
Michelle,Value i was just saying that to a friend recently and then goes back to knowing who you are and I think as women and.
Interviewer,Young girls we have to invest that time and getting to understand who we are and liking who we are because I like me I've.
Michelle,Liked me for a very long time so for a long time I've had a very good relationship with myself I know and we.
Interviewer,Like we all like ourselves out here but you gotta work to get to that place and if you're going out into the world as a.
Michelle,Professional and you don't know who you are you don't know what you want you don't know how much you're worth then.
Interviewer,You have to be brave and then you have to you know you have to count on the kindness and goodness of others to.
Michelle,Bestow that goodness on you when you should be working to get it you're on your own could you deserve it because.
Interviewer,You know your own value know your own value okay so when you're saying I know who I am and I'm telling you it's the.
Michelle,Thread that runs through everything it's the thing that allows you to stand in your own truth and one of the things for.
Interviewer,Years that my angelou used to say to me is baby you need to know that you alone are enough you alone are enough so how.
Michelle,Do we get there you were there you've loved yourself a long time what is that process I think.
Interviewer,It's different for everyone and i can't say that I you know I've loved myself for a long time but there was a journey.
Michelle,To get there and it's you know some of it starts as a young young girl when you you know confront your first bully the.
Interviewer,First time somebody calls you out your name as we would say you know the first disappointments and failures that you.
Michelle,Have how do you deal with that what support systems do you set up for your self I always tell young girls surround.
Interviewer,Yourself with goodness you know i learned early on how to you know get the haters out of my life you know you got.
Michelle,To just sort of surround yourself with people who uplift you who hold you up and for whatever reason while I was.
Interviewer,Lucky i had people like i had parents who held me up yeah I had a father they have good parents all right.
Michelle,They come into the world with a strength yes and an advantage that was an advantage but if you don't have that.
Interviewer,Parent that mother that father then you got to find it you got to find those people because they're out there I tell.
Michelle,My mentees all of their there is somebody out there who loves you and who is waiting to love you and you just have.
Interviewer,To find them and that means you have to make room for them and if you're surrounded by a bunch of lowlife folks.
Michelle,Who aren't supporting you then there is no room for the people who do love you you mentioned a moment ago the haters.
Interviewer,How do you handle the haters particularly in this office where haters have to be handled politically correctly.
Michelle,And with discretion and i know so many people are faced with it we know this about social media people say just the.
Interviewer,Meanest things and you're faced in your life with people who can tear you down a lot the haters when it can raise social.
Michelle,Media they're just times i turn off the world you know they're just sometimes you have to give yourself space to be.
Interviewer,Quiet which means you got to set those phones down you can't be reading all that stuff I mean that's like letting.
Michelle,Somebody just walk up and slap you you know you would never do that you would never just sit there and go.
Interviewer,Slap me in the face and i'm good with it no you know so why would you open yourself up to that so that's one thing.
Michelle,With social media and i don't read that stuff I learned that early in the campaign I couldn't keep reading stuff.
Interviewer,About my husband and what people thought and thought and you know because I knew who he was I knew what was going on in.
Michelle,Our home in our lives so i didn't need to read about it from somebody else but the other thing that I have found.
Interviewer,Particularly in this job that it's people won't remember or what other people say about you but.
Michelle,They will remember what you do so my my strategy and I've always been like this when a teacher would come and tell me.
Interviewer,That i couldn't do something i would get so much satisfaction proving them wrong I'd be like okay all right oh you don't.
Michelle,Think i'm gonna do x y & z well i'm gonna be the best X Y Z you can imagine so when it came to this role I just said.
Interviewer,You know let me just be first lady let me wake up every day and work hard to do something of value and to do it well and.
Michelle,To do something consequential and to do something that I care about and then let that speak for itself and that would.
Interviewer,Shut up the haters because i would have a whole portfolio of stuff that defined me because it's what I did not what you.
Michelle,Called me so the best revenge is success success and good work yeah you don't have to say anything to the haters you.
Interviewer,Don't have to acknowledge them at all you just wake up every morning and be the best you you can be and that tends.
Michelle,To shut them up you know i've always thought too that the best success comes when we you when you can actually shift.
Interviewer,Your paradigm to service and obviously you are in a position of public service was it a conscious intentional decision.
Michelle,To sort of sit still be with this place and then allow your passion to fuel your interest allow your passion to lead you.
Interviewer,To all the things you've been able to do with international girls education with health and wellness was that that's a.
Michelle,Conscious intentional decision absolutely because in this war particularly when you're in public.
Interviewer,Service your first lady the president you're interacting with the world you know people can.
Michelle,Smell in authenticity you know they know when you are not what you appear to be and that was always something that I.
Interviewer,Said in this role that i want people to know me know Michelle Michelle Robinson Obama not the first lady but I'm.
Michelle,Wherever in every interaction i have had with anybody who's had some connection with me I have tried to be authentically.
Interviewer,Myself and in order to do that i learned that I have to do things that I authentically care about because if I.
Michelle,Fundamentally deep down have a belief in the cause and I it moves me that I'm gonna be excited about it it's gonna be.
Interviewer,That excitement is gonna be conveyed to the people that I'm trying to reach it's not gonna be a heavy lift you know.
Michelle,That's why people say how can you speak in front of all these people and do this every day look I get energy from people.
Interviewer,And not everybody in politics in in public service or people people Barack and I really do we are we are energized.
Michelle,By the people we meet you know by the military spouses that I meet out there I'd pick working with military families.
Interviewer,Because they moved me I met them out on the campaign trail and I didn't know that there were millions.
Michelle,Of military families out there serving and sacrificing in ways that we take for granted in this country and I vowed then.
Interviewer,And there just from meeting them that if I got to be first lady I would try to be that voice for them I would try to shine.
Michelle,That light on them so that came out of a direct passion for who those people were and what I learned about them and I.
Interviewer,Remember when you all first arrived to the White House you said to the country that this is your house and we're gonna.
Michelle,Open this up as your house and so when i saw all those Girl Scouts out on the lawn I went y'all really did open up the.
Interviewer,House yes yes that's been some of the most fulfilling things we've been able to do in in the White House it's really.
Michelle,Bringing people here who would never ever get to set on that lawn and walk into those doors I.
Interviewer,Tell my mentees all the time you know one of the things I want them to take away when they come because they come.
Michelle,Regularly they come at least once a month then we sit down and we talk and they have seminars and I want them all.
Interviewer,To know you walk into the white house every day and you walk up to the First Lady of the United States and say hey.
Michelle,Michelle what's going on and if you can do that you can do anything if you can exist in this space at this time in this.
Interviewer,Moment yes and there is no class that you can't handle there's no school who's rejection will make you fold or make you.
Michelle,Crumble you've been here you know and I've watched so many kids come through those gates and really be in that space.
Interviewer,Picking you know tomatoes with me in the garden getting to sit in and have tastings at the state dinner being.
Michelle,Invited to watch hamilton i mean just watching their eyes just experiencing things that really only the privileged.
Interviewer,Get to the experience but having it be kids and people who would never believe they would set foot in that you see them.
Michelle,Get empowered oh yeah transformed in the process how many kids you think their worldview will never be.
Interviewer,The same and that's the least we can do as president in first lady I think that's the obligation of anyone who.
Michelle,Lives in that house do you how do you feel you know I always feel that until you take your last breath you're always.
Interviewer,Growing and that every experience that you encounter in your life just all of you being together here today and being.
Michelle,In a room with people who are like-minded who share the same vision all of that is so stimulating you leave.
Interviewer,Here and you feel like you couldn't be better and and do better what has the experience or how has the experience of.
Michelle,Being first lady you know actually grown you wow it's so many ways I mean first of all there is absolutely nothing I can.
Interviewer,Do I mean cuz you walk-in that's right yeah that's right we've been in the.
Michelle,Mountaintop hard climb but we made it so you just you know again you begin to understand how much you can you know how.
Interviewer,Much you can tolerate how much growth you can have how much potential there is how much opportunity there is to help.
Michelle,People how fulfilling it is i mean that's been the thing that I've learned that oh it feels public service.
Interviewer,I left the practice of law to go into public service for selfish reasons I wanted to be happy and feel good every.
Michelle,Single day i wanted to wake up inspired and ready to do something greater than myself and that's what service and.
Interviewer,Giving and you know that's what this room means to to so many and I just want to make sure that when people leave here.
Michelle,They don't go back into their isolation that they don't go back to their phones looking down because this relationship.
Interviewer,Isn't enough you know you need to have people in your lives that you're connecting with that you're helping I.
Michelle,Mean there's there's nothing that makes me feel better than knowing that I helped to change somebody's life Oprah.
Interviewer,You know this more than anyone else and if you're doing that every single day the haters the doubters none of that.
Michelle,Matters because you are getting so much by the work from the work that you're doing well you know I figured this out.
Interviewer,Early on in the show i had read this quote from dr. King one of my favorite quotes from him that says not everybody.
Michelle,Can be famous but everybody could be great because greatness is determined by service and I literally shifted I used.
Interviewer,That quote to help me shift the way i saw the platform of television instead of like oh I'm on TV how do I use that.
Michelle,Platform as a platform of service is amen is what I did yeah yeah we know and you did that pretty well but when you.
Interviewer,Think about growing and being empowered yourself it is what you've been able to do for other people that that leaves you.
Michelle,The fullest yes that absolutely that is that is really the thing so I don't know I you know I don't sort of my growth is.
Interviewer,Incidental it is the it's it's the lucky gift I get forgiving you know and like you said I'm still growing you know we.
Michelle,Are all still growing i i used to tell some of the young people I work with way back in Chicago days that I used to hate.
Interviewer,The the question what do you want to be when you grow up because it assumes that at some point you stop becoming and you.
Michelle,Just are something and that would be a sad thing you know to think that this is it.
Interviewer,And that's one of the things i've learned that there is there's so many phases to life that this is just this.
Michelle,Even as big as being first lady and living in the White House has been this is still just a portion of a very bigger.
Interviewer,Journey that i have yet to know the outcome and I won't know it until I'm laying laying down it's just.
Michelle,Ever-evolving and i think that that reality that this experience has helped me to see that that these are just.
Interviewer,Phases you know and this has been a very interesting phase and a very impactful phase but there's more to come I love.
Michelle,You saying that i'm not through wait though oh okay so yes I believe in service I believe in.
Interviewer,Helping people i want people to feel fulfilled and empowered in their life but still some days I think it's just.
Michelle,Cool to be me and I think that to some days it's just cool to be Oprah yeah no I want to say.
Interviewer,So i want to know what are those days when you just say there are so look at me in the White House yeah just setting.
Michelle,Up here you know there are a lot of those moments you know Prince and Stevie Wonder singing in the East Room just may.
Interviewer,May he rest in peace i mean those rare gifts of entertainment that the kind of music we've been able to bring into the.
Michelle,White house you know sitting with the Pope watching my mother and my daughter's talked to the Pope that's.
Interviewer,Like look at you know dinner with the Queen of England you know you try to play these moments off like oh yes yes I.
Michelle,Know what i'm doing and inside you're going oh good lord yes watching my husband walk off a.
Interviewer,Marine one and go to the oval office is life and and you know he's got that wok right.
Michelle,I know he's got the swag did he always have that swag or has he gotten swaggy er no he was very swagalicious look I.
Interviewer,Told people this from the very start when I started running Barack Obama who is exactly who he says he is we both are.
Michelle,That's what i've been trying to tell people and no surprises we're telling you who we are and no tricks up our.
Interviewer,Sleeves we're regular folks we care about people we care about family we want to do well we want to make our.
Michelle,Country proud we don't want to waste our talents just making money for for ourselves Barack Obama hasn't changed.
Interviewer,You know not as a person because he is an authentic man who came in and he's gonna leave that same person so it's not.
Michelle,The it's not the office that changes you it's just it amplifies who you are I think I said that at the last convention.
Interviewer,Being president doesn't change who you are it reveals who you are and that's something that we should all remember.
Michelle,This is a united state of women there are a lot of cool men out here I love the president give it up for the.
Interviewer,Brothers it's not a cool man out here for them for the men out here I love the President's speech saying you're looking.
Michelle,At a feminist what can men do leaving here be better be better at everything be be better.
Interviewer,Father's good lord just being good fathers who loved your daughters and are providing a solid example of what it.
Michelle,Means to be a good man in the world and showing them what it feels like to be loved that is the greatest gift that the.
Interviewer,Men in my life yes gave to me and we've talked about this the fact that I've never experienced.
Michelle,Abuse at the hands of any man in my life and that's sad to say that that's a rare reality so men can be better at that men.
Interviewer,Can be better husbands you know which is be a part of your family's life do the dishes.
Michelle,You know don't babysit your children you don't babysit your own children you know be engaged you know don't just think.
Interviewer,Going to work and coming home makes you a man being a father being engaged all that stuff is important be a better.
Michelle,Employer you know when you are sitting at a seat of power at a table of any kind and you look around and you just.
Interviewer,See you it's just you and a bunch of men around the table on a golf course making deals and you allow that to happen and.
Michelle,You're okay with that be better be better be better and be better I love that just be better I could go on but.
Interviewer,I'm not you you get the point fellas right fella what are you gonna be you go there you go.
Michelle,So here's the question that comes up over and over and over and we talked a little bit about it this idea of balance.
Interviewer,Is that a false notion for women because can we really are we ever gonna have it all I used to say you can.
Michelle,At all you just can't have it all the one time or is that a is that a false notion look I I am always irritated by.
Interviewer,That you can have it all statement and I grew irritable occasion the older I got as you're trying to have.
Michelle,It all yeah and you're beating yourself up right and feeling less than because you aren't having it all because it is.
Interviewer,Uh it's it's a it's a ridiculous aspiration especially if you're looking at everybody else's Facebook page Oh God.
Michelle,Everybody has it all everybody's lying they're lying y'all need to stop lying be real about.
Interviewer,The fact that you know no one gets everything that was one of the first rules you learned as a little kid you.
Michelle,Don't always get your way come on people you don't always get what you want all the time and that's true in life so what.
Interviewer,I've told many young people is that you can have it all but oftentimes it's hard to get it all at the same time I believe.
Michelle,You know so it's just a manager a matter of managing expectations so for me for example you know when your husband is.
Interviewer,President of the united states and you have children something's got to give you know I I've made compromises in my.
Michelle,Life in my career but i've also in exchange gained a wonderful platform to do some great work who would have ever.
Interviewer,Imagined that we would make the inroads we've made on healthy eating and changing the way our kids are fed in.
Michelle,School and you know yeah i can point to so many things that I've had I've been able to do if I want to be heavily.
Interviewer,Involved in my girls lives that means that sometimes I have to put some things on the back burner to give them what.
Michelle,They need so it's it's hard to have it all but that's where you go back to knowing who you are and knowing that you.
Interviewer,Know you're really living through phases and if you don't if you're compromising through one phase of your journey you're.
Michelle,Not giving it all up you're just you you're compromising for that phase there's another phase that's coming up.
Interviewer,Where you might be able to have more of what you thought you want it you know you get to know yourself a little bit.
Michelle,More so so no iii don't want young women out there to have the expectation that if they're not having it all that.
Interviewer,Somehow they're failing life is hard but life is long if you maintain your health which is one of the reasons why we talk.
Michelle,About health talk about taking care of yourself because you want to get to the next phases in life where you can do.
Interviewer,More of what you want to do at any given do you want to be wherever you are right now and just like you say I'm not.
Michelle,"Through no you're not through not through so 5,000 women and men in this room thousands and thousands of others."
Interviewer,Streaming us online hey hey everybody streaming what is the one thing because I think it's really easy when you come.
Michelle,To a conference like this and you get so inspired and you see Marlee and Michaela those young women and you see Billie.
Interviewer,Jean king and gloria steinem and sandra Rimes and amazing Gary Washington you see all these women and you're just like.
Michelle,I just want to be more of a woman and you you you you you get you're gonna be over stimulated what is the one thing.
Interviewer,You want us to leave here with what is the one charge or one offering what do you want to say it's hard to think of.
Michelle,One one thing okay a couple but the work always continues I mean and by that I just mean we're never done we can never.
Interviewer,Be complacent and thinking that we've arrived now as women and because I hear this.
Michelle,From young women some of the some of you young women who aren't feeling the you know the the pains that many of our.
Interviewer,Predecessors have felt you think well there aren't any problems women's rights we got this all figured out.
Michelle,I'm already equal i'm oh i'm good now just like oh just you wait you'll feel it so the work continues and for.
Interviewer,All the young women in this room all the young men we can never be complacent because we we have seen in recent times.
Michelle,How quickly things can be taken away if we aren't vigilant if we don't know our history you know if we if we don't.
Interviewer,Continue the work so my hope is that people leave here inspired and ready to do something you know again remember.
Michelle,It's not what people say about you it's what you do so the question is what are you gonna do you know how are you gonna.
Interviewer,Be better what are you gonna change in your office in your life in your relationships what are you gonna change.
Michelle,In your family dynamic and how are you gonna empower yourself with the knowledge that you need to know what.
Interviewer,Work needs to be done we can't afford to be ignorant we can't afford to be complacent so we have to continue the.
Michelle,Work yeah i think that's powerful because the question that you just just offered to us is what did this mean and.
Interviewer,What can i do with what i have received from all of the stimulation all of this energy what can what can I do that's the.
Michelle,Question you were talking about the next phase I heard you say that when you all are done we saw your new house when.
Interviewer,You're we're neither conforming or confirming or denying okay which okay when you all are done okay when you're.
Michelle,Done and you move out of the white house I've heard you say that you look forward to riding around what the wind is down.
Interviewer,Are you still gonna be a michelle obama yeah we're gonna know who you are and it won't matter how many baseball caps you.

Michelle,You and me that will be a scene you know it's what what do you want to go shopping with me go shopping with us.
Interviewer,Yeah it's it's really the the little things I mean and you feel this you know Fame can be confining you know and then.
Michelle,You start missing the little things you know what do I want to do I want to walk out I want to open my front door without.
Interviewer,Discussing it with anyone and i want to walk out that door and just walk just want to walk by myself or with a.
Michelle,Semblance of feeling like i'm by myself because that's what you learn how to do it's like I'm alone with 800 people.
Interviewer,Walking behind me but i've learned how to provide I'm by myself but I do I want to walk down a street I want to sit in a.
Michelle,Yard that is not a national park you know I I do want to you know drop in on into target I want to you know I do I.

Michelle,Rien tree training yeah like okay what do you do at CVS now how do you check out you know it's like I've been living.
Interviewer,In a cave but it is it's the small things you know fresh air you know in the white house you can't open a window.
Michelle,Sasha opened her window once they were calls shut the window never opened again so it it's the little things that you.
Interviewer,Know you you you the things that we all take for granted a ticket you know I won't even ask for anonymity but you.
Michelle,Know because i think that's forever gone but one of the things that I've learned.
Interviewer,Is that if you just flow into a pattern of life with people they give you space to come in that's happened at my kids.
Michelle,School and that place is where i go and work out you know once people get used to the fact that you're gonna be there.
Interviewer,It's late then it's sort of like it's over it's like you do it a few times it's like it's the first lady you know.
Michelle,So i i hope to find a way to seamlessly work my way into a normal life and it's gonna take time but I'm gonna slowly.
Interviewer,It's gonna happen and we're gonna go shopping we gonna shop we're gonna shop in and you will leave here most proud of.
Michelle,You know what truly i am most proud of my daughter's you know I mean I can I could go down the list of my initiatives.
Interviewer,And we have done a lot changed the way our kids e we're supported military families we made that conversation part.
Michelle,Of the community the work that we're doing on girls education will be something that I do for the rest of my.
Interviewer,Life this is all work that will continue it is there those problems won't be solved in my lifetime but raising two.
Michelle,Girls like i said at the beginning when I sent them off in the car that first day and they were so little and the the.
Interviewer,Bulletproof glass was so thick you know I thought oh my god I just want them to grow up feeling a sense knowing that.
Michelle,They're loved by us feeling confident feeling a sense of normalcy feeling a sense of obligation to do something.
Interviewer,Outside of themselves just being good people and we just you know went to Malia's high school graduation and we're.
Michelle,Watching sasha move her way through high school and I am very proud of those two and how they've managed this situation.
Interviewer,And how they have continued to be themselves regular little girls just trying to figure it out and I'm as all.
Michelle,Mothers do you breathe that sigh of relief that you didn't mess up your kids and I'm everyday I cross my fingers and.

Michelle,People so thank you and i just want to say the way you handled this office the way you carry yourself have presented.
Interviewer,Yourself to the united states of america and the women of the United States of America and men of the United States of.
Michelle,America reminds me of a line that maya used to say it's actually in the beginning of one of her books she says.
Interviewer,You make me proud to spell my name Michelle Obama and I would like to add to that I would like to add to that.
Michelle,Is oprah winfrey you  .
Interviewer,Thank you so much for having me on your podcast.
Michelle,Just in case you don't recognize that voice...
Interviewer,It's me!
Michelle,It is you. It is you...
Interviewer,"You don't seem to happy about that the way she said it, right?"
Michelle,It's just a fact.
Interviewer,I've been loving it.
Michelle,"Yeah, I've been having a great time. But we've had some."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"We've spent a lot of time talking about, sort of, how do our views."
Interviewer,Absolutely.
Michelle,That I grew up with as you call it the...
Interviewer,Leave it to Beaver!
Michelle,The Black Leave it to Beaver....
Interviewer,The Black Leave it to Beavers...
Michelle," With a family of four, you know. A father at home..."
Interviewer,Only thing missing was the dog.
Michelle,"A dog, I know..."
Interviewer,Cause Marian wouldn't let you get a dog.
Michelle,I know...
Interviewer,She feels bad about it now....
Michelle,"And now, I got revenge. I've got two of them..."
Interviewer,You do.
Michelle,And I'd have more if it weren't for you.
Interviewer,Classic nuclear family unit.
Michelle,Exactly. And you grew up a little bit differently.
Interviewer,"Ah, things were a little crazier on my side."
Michelle, Well I don't know if it was crazy but it was different.
Interviewer,"Yeah...yeah. Look I was raised mostly by a single mom and my grandparents until we then moved to Indonesia and I had a stepfather and then Maya, my sister, was born. And then I moved back to Hawaii and lived with my grandparents for high school."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"And, thinking that you had to make sacrifices for kids."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And so, we felt loved and supported. And that's obviously where a."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"One of the things we talked about a lot it that, one way or another."
Michelle,Extended family...
Interviewer,Extended families. Structures around that helped families raise their.
Michelle,A lot of the way families ran before recently was an economic necessity. You know my parents were poor...
Interviewer,You're livin on the second floor of you aunt house.
Michelle,"Livin on the second floor of my great-aunt's house because that was a way to save money so that my parents... My mother could stay home. And you know, my mom was able to work on the PTA at our public school because she and a couple of other mothers who could afford to stay home, stayed home and they kept their eye on everybody in the school."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"So there was an opportunity because we saved money and we lived small, as my father said, there were parents who could be in the schools and who could be going on field trips, knowing that there were plenty of single mothers or mothers who couldn't stay home. So, moms like mine were looking out for all the kids at Bryn Mawr Elementary School."
Interviewer,Yes.
Michelle,And that's not true today.
Interviewer,Couldn't happen.
Michelle,Couldn't happen.
Interviewer,Because of the higher cost of health care...
Michelle,Wage stagnation.
Interviewer,The higher cost of if you want to send your kid to college.
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"So, you get financial pressures on the family. You then have all these institutions that used to be support systems - shrinking. So more and more, people start thinking in terms of..."
Michelle,Me.
Interviewer,Me. And I do things on my own.
Michelle,And not us.
Interviewer,"I pursue a career. I make money. And then, if I'm successful enough."
Michelle,Right. But now you've got separation within race.
Interviewer,Right. Talk about that cause you... one of the things that happens in your neighborhood is... It's not just white folks who move out over time.
Michelle,Right.
Interviewer,"It's also Black folks who have means. They start saying, ""well we want the same thing.""."
Michelle,We want to go out the suburbs.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"You know we saw that too. I mean, I write in my book about."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"But the truth is, later on down the line in the 80s or so as Black folks earned more money and got professions, the dream was to move to the suburbs."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,That was the dream of middle-class Black folks too. But I also...
Interviewer,Why did your parents not think about that.
Michelle," You know, my parents were uniquely stubborn about the suburbs. You know, they really..."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"So, there were times that they talked about buying a home. And I remember going to look at some homes and being excited that - Oh, I am going to have my own room. I was obsessed with having stairs in your house.."
Interviewer,"So, you wanted some stairs..."
Michelle,I wanted some stairs! And a station wagon.
Interviewer,Cause now that's some success.
Michelle,That's some success right there.
Interviewer, Did the Cleaver's have stairs?
Michelle,Everybody had stairs!
Interviewer,They must have had some stairs.
Michelle,Everybody! The Brady Bunch had stairs.
Interviewer,All those people. Damn.
Michelle,The Partridge Family. The only people who didn't have stairs.
Interviewer,Was y'all.
Michelle,The Jefferson's and the Evan's Family.
Interviewer,And the Robinson's.
Michelle,"So I thought, you know, I want some stairs."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"And who cares about stairs? And you know, we grew up in the city. And this is just fine. And you need to learn how to live in the city."" And my father was suspicious of the suburbs because they still weren't completely welcoming."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"We had had incidents of going into the suburbs of Park Forest, that were all white. And I write about the incident where somebody scratched my father's car because we were Black folks in a neighborhood."
Interviewer,Well one of the things when I move to Chicago - and I started as a community organizer - And I was basically working in the neighborhoods that you grew up in.
Michelle,You were there.
Interviewer,"And I remember when I went to start my job - the guy who was training me - he said, ""The first month all I want you to do is just talk to people.""."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"So I would go around the neighborhoods and just talk to people about how they ended up in Chicago. Folks coming up from the South in The Great Migration. Their parents and grandparents. And people would reminisce, and they would say, ""You know, when we first moved here everybody raised everybody's kids.""."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"That was a really common theme. People would say, ""If I was messing up, it wasn't... Ms. Smith down the street, she'd see me messing up. She'd scold me."
Michelle,Yup.
Interviewer,"Then when I got home, I might get whooped because Ms. Smith would have called my mom..."
Michelle,"""How dare you have Ms. Smith calling me and telling me you were on her grass and then you said...And you had the nerve to talk back boy.""."
Interviewer,Exactly.
Michelle,Boy.
Interviewer,"Right, so what you got was this portrait of a village."
Michelle,"Yeah, things were just...it felt easier in those times..."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,To have a family unit because it wasn't just you were supposed to branch out. That success was defined by your ability to leave your nuclear unit and make it on your own... That wasn't how either one of us was raised.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"Every elder lived with someone. They shared expenses, they shared households, they shared the duties of raising kids. So, there wasn't this feeling that you were supposed to do this thing called loving and supporting you family on your own. You know that seems to be kind of a new thing."
Interviewer,"Your values always start with those closest to you, right? So, my mom deeply believed in everybody being worthy of love, praise, and support."
Michelle,Fed him.
Interviewer,"And Mike Ramos' mom looked after him and made sure his clothes were clean. You know, his dad was working, Greg's dad was a hard-working guy. The point is... to some degree... We built our own community."
Michelle,"You know that at the core of everything you have done politically, what I know about you as a person and one of the reasons why I feel in love with you is..."
Interviewer,It wasn't just my looks... but that's okay...
Michelle,"You're cute you know... But no, one of the reasons I feel in love with you is because you are guided by the principle that we are each other's brother's and sister's keepers. And that's how I was raised!"
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"I mean, my values, in terms of what I think my obligation - my personal obligation -."
Interviewer,Cause you didn't know what was happening...
Michelle,"You didn't know what happened to them. You know, we weren't special. And as a result, you know if something good happens to you, if you have an advantage, you don't hoard it. You share it. You reach out. You give back."
Interviewer,"I think I figured out once I got to school that if I am chasing after my own success, that somehow, I am going to end up alone and unhappy."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And that's why I ended up going into community organizing and the work that I was doing because when I thought about how I was going to spend my life, what I looked at was what those civil rights workers had done...And the freedom writers had done."
Michelle,"Mm hmm, yeah."
Interviewer,That looks like hard and risky work but it never looks like...
Michelle,Selfish...
Interviewer,"Selfish, isolated, meaningless work..."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Yeah, see that's why you started dating me... you thought I was."
Michelle,"Nah, I didn't even... I didn't know all that."
Interviewer,I was a meal ticket. You didn't know I was gonna do some...
Michelle,"Yeah, I didn't know you were gonna be like, ""What?""."
Interviewer,Broke..
Michelle,"You were running away from the money! I was like, ""What is wrong with this negro?""."
Interviewer,"So, but the thing that a Harvard education gave me, the real ticket that I punched wasn't to chase as much money as I wanted. What I purchased was enough credentials and security that I could go do the crazy things I wanted to do in terms of working in neighborhoods, going in to politics, all that. Knowing that I had enough of a floor beneath me that I was going to be okay."
Michelle,And our paths were almost flipped because I was punching the ticket.
Interviewer,"Yeah, you were that Saab driving..."
Michelle,"I was like... That was what I thought. Get out of school, buy a nice car, you know?"
Interviewer,Remember the wine club? Remember that...
Michelle,"Yeah, I joined. Yes."
Interviewer,You were a wine club member.
Michelle,And we didn't even drink wine back then.
Interviewer,"Nah, I don't want to know how good that wine is left either. I was."
Michelle,"Yeah, I never opened the bottle. I just joined the wine club. It seemed like the very professional thing to do."
Interviewer," Yeah, I think I teased you a little bit on that one."
Michelle,"Oh, definitely. Definitely."
Interviewer,The Saab did have heated seats though.
Michelle,"Oh, you loved the Saab. Don't act like... Especially coming from."
Interviewer,"Cause, at that time I was..."
Michelle,"I was like, ""No we are not taking your car my brother, we are taking the Saab.""."
Interviewer,"I was still driving those thousand-dollar, five-hundred-dollar cars."
Michelle,But I was punching the ticket.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,I was on the track. I was checking my boxes. Because I was doing what I thought I needed to do because I was a poor kid.
Interviewer,Yes.
Michelle,"So, I didn't feel like I had the option to just go off and do other things. But I also had a limited vision of what I could be because schools don't show you the world, they just show you a bunch of careers."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"And it felt isolating. And you know, I had this amazing view of the southeast side of city from my office. I could see the lake and I could see all of the neighborhood that had I come from. And I never felt further from that neighborhood than when I was sitting in that office working on briefs and cases that has nothing to do with anything that helped a broader group of people outside of myself."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,And it felt lonely.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,I never looked back.
Interviewer,"You know, you're exactly right. I always to say the years I spent."
Michelle,"Really, we were young. We didn't know..."
Interviewer,We were so young. And inexperienced..
Michelle,"We were stumbling around trying to figure it... We can fix it... It's like, 'No, we can't.' We don't know anything."
Interviewer," Right. So, it not like I set the world on fire but I felt like, ""Okay, I got roots here, I've got a community. I've got people whose stories I know, who know me. Who connect me to a larger vision and larger purpose..."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"Talk a little bit about how seeing all these different neighborhoods in Chicago and these young people gave you a better sense of, ""Oh, my community is not just the South Side, my community is all these communities'..."
Michelle,"When I left the firm, I went to the city and I got really interesting."
Interviewer,You don't leave the neighborhood.
Michelle,You do not leave the neighborhood. Some kids never had ever been from... left the West Side to even go to the South Side. There were kids who has never seen the lake... Lake Michigan.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"There were kids who had never been downtown before. That was not an unusual thing. Because of racism, because of segregation, because of gangs, because of a whole host of things. So I was one of those kids, I saw more of the city because I went to a magnet high school..."
Interviewer,And took the bus.
Michelle,And had to take the bus. Take an hour-long bus ride so at least I.
Interviewer,You had... You wouldn't go into Pilsen or...
Michelle,"Pilsen Little Village, which is a predominantly a Latino community with all this culture."
Interviewer,"Devon Street, with this entire Indian-American community. It's like."
Michelle,It's just a whole new world. And they were all alive and vibrant. With good people trying to affect their neighborhoods. And caring...
Interviewer,Polish neighborhoods in Chicago. Second largest outside of Warsaw.
Michelle,Exactly.
Interviewer,More Polish folks than Chicago.
Michelle,And for the first time I felt like a true Chicagoan. I felt the 'we' of.
Interviewer,Yes. Exactly.
Michelle,"And that was, by far, one of the best parts of my career development was working with that non-profit organization and meeting kids from all over the city and watching them discover each other and discover different parts of the community. And start to find their power and their voice. I mean..."
Interviewer,"And start to find their common stories, that's right?"
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"But I also think that something changed it seems like in the late 70s, early 80s. And I am a little bit older than you - although I look so much older than you."
Michelle, Good one...
Interviewer,Yeah...
Michelle,Point scored..
Interviewer,"Yeah, but I think when we were coming up the culture wasn't beaten."
Michelle,"Oh yeah, it looked like my...our apartment."
Interviewer,It wasn't any bigger than the place you guys stayed. I didn't feel.
Michelle,Exactly. As we didn't feel poor either. But you go back to visit.
Interviewer,It's tiny!
Michelle,"You think... On my God, we were broke."
Interviewer,We were broke.
Michelle,"But yeah, we talk about this a lot, it's like...The phrase that sticks with me from my parents is 'Never Enough...Never Enough.' Because the minute you had a little bit of something, you know you had a pint ice cream and a chocolate and you asked for strawberry? You'd get in trouble."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"And then we would feel bad. Because you'd think ""you're right... here I am with all this little bowl of ice cream and I am asking for more..."" you know?"
Interviewer,Yes. Before you even finished!
Michelle,Before you even finished!
Interviewer,You haven't even finished your ice cream!.
Michelle,Never satisfied. Never satisfied. And I find myself saying that to.
Interviewer,I know...
Michelle,That's the biggest thing that gets on my nerves. They know it. It's like we're doing something great and you start looking over at the other...
Interviewer,You start looking over to see what else is next...
Michelle,"Never satisfied, you know..."
Interviewer,"Yes. So, this were I was going to take it."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"I think that culturally, we become much more focused on stuff and much less focused on relationships and family. And part of being an adult..."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,Part of being a citizen is you give something up.
Michelle,"So instead of that, we have - you can have it all. You know, that's the philosophy. You know even when I talk to young mothers its, ""how do I have it all?"" You know, or young families..."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"Cause if you have it all, that meant that someone didn't have."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"But that's what we're teaching young people. You should, you know, have a career and you should earn a lot of money. You should be fulfilled. You should have your passion. You shouldn't have to sacrifice that much. You should have it all."
Interviewer,And you now have this sense of kind of a cut-throat competition.
Michelle,We're all on our own.
Interviewer,That we're all on our own.
Michelle,And it's a dog-eat-dog.
Interviewer,And it's a dog-eat-dog.
Michelle,It's not us... it's us against them.
Interviewer,"Right, and we are constantly nervous able where we are going to be on this pecking order."
Michelle,Pecking order.
Interviewer,"And that then reflects itself in our politics, right? Because at a certain point, you know, I am going to start thinking about politics in terms of how do I protect me."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,Not how do I look after us.
Michelle,Help the most people.
Interviewer,"Look the good news is that I think everybody's feeling this uncertainty. This anxiety. This sense that what we've been doing isn't working the way it should. Now, I think you have this big contest of competing ideas. On one side is those who just argue that the problem is just 'them.'."
Michelle,Mm hmm..
Interviewer,"So, there nothing wrong with chasing after as much money as you can get, not investing in public goods..."
Michelle,"Because when the problem is them, you don't really have to."
Interviewer,You don't have to change. All you have do to is to stop them from.
Michelle,Yeah. And how beautiful and safe...stabilizing that would be. We all have each other to lean on.
Interviewer,Yes.
Michelle,"That we don't have to hold up this big, gigantic thing all by."
Interviewer,When everyone was looking about for everybody then the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.
Michelle,Yes.
Interviewer,Everybody gets a little bit more. Kids get more role models even if their family is not doing as well. Because there are people with some clout in these neighborhoods...
Michelle,Everybody benefits from that piece of clout.
Interviewer,"Everybody benefits from their ability to advocate, to make sure the resources are coming in. That whole process of lifting all boats comes about from this network of relationships in a community."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Well, now everybody is on top of each other. And you can't just feel secure in your own neighborhood. Either you are going to war with the other neighborhoods or you start seeing that the people in the other neighborhoods are just like you and not as scary. And let's see how we can put this whole thing together. I think that's how young people... that's their instinct."
Michelle,"The only thing that worries me, and I agree in terms of the hope that I feel when I look at young people - just how they were raised, the values, their exposure, the questions that they have, the change in the economy that's forcing them to ask a certain set of questions - that give me hope."
Interviewer,"Well, partly because they have been told. The message is sent every day that government doesn't work. They take for granted all the things that a working government has done in the past..."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"In some ways, we're still living on the investment that was made by."
Michelle,"I always joke, and I've always said one of the challenges of being."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,"There's really no structure to market government, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"The average young person knows far more about the cereal they're eating, and the car they are driving than they do about what government actually does for them because they don't have marketing budgets. There isn't a jingle..."
Interviewer, The only time they know about what government doing is when...
Michelle,"Is when it doesn't work, right?"
Interviewer,So we're getting a good lesson in that right now.
Michelle,Exactly. If people are paying attention and understand what's.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"Not having, you know, a public health system that takes care of people whether you are working or not. That takes care of you whether you have preexisting conditions or not. Unemployment. Social Security. You know all of the things that sort of keep people going when the chosen path doesn't work.."
Interviewer,"And I think you're absolutely right, that the danger for this generation is that they have become too deeply cynical in government. Not understanding that all government is us collectively making decisions together."
Michelle,That community we talked about.
Interviewer,That community we talked about.
Michelle,"Well and we've talked about this, this is how we raised this."
Interviewer,We gave lip service to it...
Michelle,"Yeah, well we didn't complete the cycle of the message, right? You know, I think more people in our generation raised our kids to be more open-minded and to be more thoughtful and considerate. We had the words for it, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"When it comes to fathers raising their girls, I do think that the average father today does believe that their girl can be anything she wants to be and they are delivering those messages around the dinner table."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,There is a different way of parenting. But what we didn't do... We delivered those messages at the dinner table but we didn't take them to the board room. We didn't change our workplaces; we didn't change things outside the home...
Interviewer,We didn't institutionalize...
Michelle,"We didn't institutionalize the values that we'd been teaching this generation of kids. So now, they are growing up. They are leaving the dinner table and they are going out into the world and going, 'The world doesn't look like what I was taught back home.' You know, and this isn't right."
Interviewer,Young people are idealistic as they have ever been. I think they are more idealistic now than they were when I was growing up. The difference though is that idealism that they feel as if they can channel it outside of governmental structures and outside of politics.
Michelle,"We can't effectively educate the public by ourselves, through."
Interviewer,"There just certain things that you have to do collectively cause they're too big, they're too expensive. At the end of the day, I think that people are going to be..."
Michelle,You think that they are going to do the right thing?
Interviewer,I think folks are going to do the right thing.
Michelle,You think they're gonna vote?.
Interviewer,You... You know me... I'm just...
Michelle,"You are the eternal optimist. You're the 'Yes, We Can!' man!"
Interviewer," I'm the 'Yes, We Can!' man. I am the 'audacity of hope'."
Michelle,Yeah. What's the alternative? That's the thing...
Interviewer,And that's the point.
Michelle,Cynical as I can be in this... in the end I... I agree. We don't have.
Interviewer,"I think where we disagree is usually you just think things just have to get super, super bad before folks figure stuff out."
Michelle,"Well, I hope we're at that point."
Interviewer,I'm always thinking... You know what maybe we can learn a little bit...
Michelle,No... we'll figure it out before we crash into the Sun.
Interviewer, Before...
Michelle,"We're getting close, Will Robinson, pull out! And it's like, ""Nah, it's not hot enough...""."
Interviewer, Will Robinson... See that's a reference that anybody under.
Michelle,"Our older viewers will know Lost in Space. That's okay. But I tend to agree. When in doubt, rely on hope."
Interviewer,Might as well.
Michelle,"Because, well as you pointed out as a former president who reads."
Interviewer,It's in fits and starts.
Michelle,It is bumpy and it is uncomfortable. And that is how change.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,It's up and down. It's cyclical.
Interviewer,Exactly.
Michelle,"Well, one of the things I want to encourage as we come to a close..."
Interviewer,A close...
Michelle,Because I know you are a busy man. But I want to first of all thank you for...
Interviewer,"Right, exactly. What are you talking about? Come on now..."
Michelle,But it's been fun to share...
Interviewer,We like talking!
Michelle,"Conversations that we have around the dinner table. Yes, sometimes our dinners get a little heavy. Part of what I hope that listeners take away from this conversation is not that we have the answers, but these kinds of conversations need to happen around our dinner tables and in our smaller communities for us to just sort of understand and to appreciate the importance that community plays on who we are."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"It is much more hopeful, it is much more gratifying, much more effective to live this life as a 'we'. And I think as young people listen to this, as they are starting to shape their paths, I would really strongly encourage them to think about building lives that are self-less."
Interviewer,It's more fun.
Michelle,It's more fun.
Interviewer,"It's more fun and it comes back. Look, I know that this podcast it focused on a bunch of different kinds of relationships that we all rely on. And maybe one thing everybody can take away from this podcast, relative to the other shows and guests that you are going have on is just that you can isolate healthy friendships, marriages, parenting that goes on from the communities that they are in. So, all these relationships are valuable by themselves but they thrive, they prosper when the whole society is reinforcing these relationships. When you and I think about what's the inheritance that we would like to leave Malia and Sasha, more than anything what it would be is that they are living in a country that respects everybody and looks after everybody. Celebrates and sees everybody. Cause we know that if we're not around, that those girls are in a society like that."
Michelle,"Mm hmm, like that."
Interviewer,They'll be fine. Right?
Michelle,Yeah. That's absolutely right.
Interviewer,Okay.
Michelle,Couldn't have said it better myself..
Interviewer,"Well, you could. Thanks for having me. Appreciate ya."
Michelle,More conversations to come...
Interviewer,I'm so looking forward to all the other podcasts and wisdom that will be doled out.
Michelle,Love you.
Interviewer,Hello and welcome to my next instalment of Meet the Author. Today I am sitting down with the incredible and the inspirational Michelle Obama and we're going to be talking about her book
Michelle,"Of course Holly, how are you? It's great to see you again."
Interviewer,"You too, I'm really good thank you very much. I just want to say how much I absolutely love this book. You're the most phenomenal storyteller and and I know that's what you're like from your personality. You're very open and honest and that really shines through in every little bit of the book. From the very first moment, first chapter, I was sucked in, especially as I was listening to you on audiobook and I was listening to you tell me the stories of your life and I really felt like I was very much there, so well done; it's something you should be really proud of."
Michelle,Thank you so much.
Interviewer,It's absolutely brilliant. I'm not the only one who thinks it's great. You have sold two million copies in the US alone.
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"It is brilliant and for anyone out there that hasn't read the book please get out and buy it because it's absolutely amazing. As I was listening I was writing down lots of questions so can we get to it and answer some of them? Your words are so beautiful so I'm going to just quote some of them back to you. I grew up with a disabled dad in a too-small house with not much money, in a starting-to-fail neighbourhood, and I also grew up surrounded by love and music in a diverse city in a country where an education can take you far. I had nothing, or I had everything. It depends on which way you want to tell it. And tell it you did. You absolutely bare your soul in this book and at times that must have been quite painful and difficult. How did you go about approaching writing something so deeply personal?"
Michelle,"Well part of the thinking was that if I was going to tell my story... because a lot of people are curious, how did a girl...working class kid from the south side of Chicago wind up as the First Lady with all the accomplishments that we had and then thinking about that I thought well the eight years in the White House is the least of my story It doesn't really explain anything so I felt like I had to give people the context of my life. I had to introduce them to that little girl 'Michelle Robinson' and give them a sense of what the sights and sounds of that little girl's life was like."
Interviewer,"And you shared them so well and I feel like your mother, Marian Robinson, had a really big part to play in that. She says as parents you're not raising babies - you're raising adults. How do you feel in reality... what did that actually mean for you and your brother Craig when you were growing up?"
Michelle,"That meant that our voices had real value in our house. There's some people who raise kids and they use the philosophy - 'kids are to be seen and not heard' - and it was just the opposite for us. I mean we sat around the dinner table at night and we told stories about our day and when you grow up with parents who not only respect your voice but enjoy your voice that's how I felt in our home that my parents thought we were brilliant and funny and they wanted us to... you know I say in the book, my parents knew that there was a flame in me that they wanted to keep lit and that's, what I call, 'Zen Neutrality' in parenting, I describe my mother in that way. It's that gift of understanding that to empower children in the long term you have to give them that space and that room to be themselves when they're young so our's was a household full of lots of conversation, lots of debate, one-upping each other in story telling and that wasn't just true in our immediate family but we grew up in a vast extended family that I describe in detail. Grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins and second-cousins and when you grow up in a big family you find that you have to use your voice to get a word in edgeways and I grew up in a family of storytellers so..."
Interviewer,So that's why you're so good at this storytelling.
Michelle,"It's probably part of the reason why I'm good at it. I also describe myself as that little girl, when I was young, I was very much in my head. I talk about how I played with my dolls and and I loved to create this imaginary world and I could spend hours on end just playing alone and in thinking about this question I think that because I spent so much time in my head before I was ready to get out there and interact I lived with stories in my head. I could play all day so storytelling for me is a way that I can sort out the world and have it make sense and it was always that way for me even as a child. But the parenting really matters and I try to share that with the audiences that I talk to. We have to give children the space to be and to be who they are and you know as a mother kids come here with their own personality...."
Interviewer,"I know, bringing up twins at the same time they get the exact same everything but they're completely different people."
Michelle,"Right, and I think my parents understood that so they didn't expect the same thing from me as they did from my brother but they did treat us as equals which I think played a big role in me being a powerful woman with a powerful voice. I was used to being respected in my home so I went out into the world and I expected that same treatment from others."
Interviewer,"Wonderful. You've had many different careers in your life you attended Princeton and then became a high-flying lawyer, you were a powerhouse in City Hall, Director of a variety of community not-for-profits and then a 'reluctant' political campaigner - you call this 'swerving'! And I absolutely love that term because I had a dramatic swerve myself where I trained to be a doctor, worked as a doctor and then became a business woman and so I completely understand how dreams and aspirations can change. You talk about the worries you had about other people judging your career choices - especially leaving law. How did you overcome that and what would you say to others facing the same dilemma?"
Michelle,"Well the first thing that I had to overcome was my own guilt because when you spend so much time and money, in my case, taking out student loans, I came out of law school with a lot of debt, the notion that I wouldn't want to invest financially to recoup that initial investment was a struggle for me. Especially growing up as a working class kid. You know I talk about the conversation I had with my mother where I was trying to break down how I wasn't passionate about my career and I feel guilty talking to a woman who had sacrificed so much for me and probably never had the luxury of thinking about something as trivial as passion. You know, so explaining that to a working class family, how you're going to walk away from a solid career and a solid income to pursue what's deep in your heart, my parents didn't..."
Interviewer,And were they your biggest worry when you decided to leave?
Michelle,"Initially they were but also part of the challenge was what else was I going to do? That's part... I describe myself as a box checker because that's how we teach kids. It's like, there's a path, you pick a career when you're seven, you study that career in elementary school, you go to college you get a major and life choices are not that orderly but that's how we train kids and I was right on that path and I knew how to achieve, I knew how to get A's and how to get to the next level but no one taught me how to dig deep inside my soul and figure out what I cared about and we don't talk to kids about what they care about, we talk about what they should major in, what they should study and those two things are very different. So part of the struggle was I had to relearn how to educate myself about who I was. Schools didn't teach me that, all those degrees, all those fancy schools didn't help me connect into who I needed to be as a person. So I had to rewind all that learning."
Interviewer,And it's such a shame because the education systems really should start that from the very beginning.
Michelle,"Yeah, we struggle and I think the challenge is that education systems are developed for masses of teaching but every kid is so different and if you don't have the resources to individualise the educational curriculum then you're really pushing kids through a funnel that may not fit them and that's something that I worry about and see now in my girls."
Interviewer,Especially with the standardised testing and having to pass the exams and get on to the next level.
Michelle,"Right, this notion that every kid is going to learn in the same way at the same time is disastrous and it creates box checkers who then go on to careers that may not fulfil them and then they're not good at it. So the tough part for me was relearning and figuring all that out on my own and so I had to find people who could help me. I did, what I called, informational interviews. I had to go out and just meet people who were doing all sorts of things that seemed interesting to figure out what I cared about Was it kids? Was it working with kids? Was it mentoring, was it education? I didn't know, I hadn't explored it because I was on the path to be a lawyer. So that was the hardest thing for me to understand how to do, is to walk away from the formal training that I had gotten and swerve into something more creative."
Interviewer,And so would your advice be to others it is important to find your passion in life?
Michelle,"It is absolutely important and I encourage young people to try on different hats. I think it's a shame that kids are forced to figure out so early in their life and get on a path so I encourage kids to do internships, to work, to talk to people who are doing things that they think are interesting because most kids are intimidated about approaching you for example and saying ""Holly, you've done some swerving. Tell me about what you're doing."" And having those conversations in high school and in college before you commit to something but I think kids feel the pressure to have to know...."
Interviewer,It's such a young age....
Michelle,Exactly.
Interviewer,"You're sixteen, seventeen. eighteen when you're making these big life decisions."
Michelle,"In one of the first lines of the first chapters a question that I hate the most that we ask children is 'what do you want to be when you grow up?' As if growing up is finite. As if you get to a place and at some point that's the end and that sort of one of our big dilemmas that we ask kids so early to figure out who you're going to be at five, and seven and ten and even twenty years old. So I do encourage young people to be open to 'the swerve' and don't beat themselves up if they feel that they've maybe not made the right first choice because life, Holly, is long and as you know, we can have many lives within a life. We are always evolving, that is why I called the book 'Becoming'. This notion that we ever stop evolving is just wrong."
Interviewer,"Yeah, you didn't call it 'Become'."
Michelle,"That's right, 'Became', already done that."
Interviewer,"So while building your incredible career, you were put in charge of an intern. A man who you describe as"
Michelle,"Well I tried to put it in words but it is difficult because the love you feel for a partner, it evolves and it has so many different layers, right? It's the first love that you feel when you're giddy and you're falling and it's new and it's exciting and every aspect of that person is fresh. There's the part of the love that's always there. This sort of unpeeling of each other and that was what first attracted me to Barack was that he was so different from me. You know, he had swerved his whole life. His background... And it didn't seem to bother him? He was completely comfortable with it and then knowing in the context of his childhood and upbringing which was very different from mine. That was a curiosity. You know, we grew up with this solid stability of the four of us at the dinner table. My father had a job, my mother stayed at home. We were very traditional. He didn't know his father, his mother travelled and she was getting her PhD and she lived in other countries and exposed him to travel and so swerving was all he knew and I knew stability so I think that sort of....that contradiction that we found in ourselves was the first part of that love."
Interviewer,The opposite attracting.
Michelle,"Yeah, absolutely. And then I respected his choices, so it wasn't just his life it was the choices he was making with it. The fact that he was a lawyer but he cared very much about the community. That he had taken time off to be a community organiser which is something you just don't find. Young people who were taking time out to figure out how to help others in their own communities, that was attractive to me. The way he treated his mother, the way he treated the women in his life, the way he treated those that were of a lesser standing than him. So when we worked together in the law firm I fell in love with the fact that he was kind to everyone. So there's that bit of it. So yes, the relationship does grow and change and so now we've built this life together and we've had all these journeys together and we've had all these hardships and we've raised two beautiful children and there's the love that comes when you see the man that you love care for your children. That's a whole different layer of love and nothing can replace those memories. That's more important to me than what he accomplished as President of the United States, or anything that he's done on paper. The fact that he is a good father to my daughters is a powerful aphrodisiac. So yes, it's difficult to put it into a few words because it's a lifetime of learning, and growing, and falling and recovering, together."
Interviewer,Well you've done it so well at putting it into words 'cause if I was asked the same question I think the English person in me would have really struggled with that. So you've really done well and it's....
Michelle,"Well that was the assignment of the book, it's like I had to be as open as possible."
Interviewer,Again it's very lucky that we both had parents that stayed together.
Michelle,"Absolutely, and we see that."
Interviewer,"And my parents have been very open with my brother and I about the fact that, it is tough."
Michelle,And they've been open with us and we'd just met them. So your parents are examples of a couple who is very clear and honest about who they are and what it took for them to be as strong as they are now. I feel like that's a gift we're supposed to give others.
Interviewer,"Yeah. And it's definitely a love that's got you both through tough times. Especially the struggles getting pregnant and I've experienced miscarriages, I've been through IVF as well. Why did you feel you needed to share that bit of your life story which was very very personal?"
Michelle,"For the same reason. We don't talk about those things and when I was in that position I wished I had more people who would tell me that it would be be okay. That this happens to more people than we know and it wasn't until I experienced it and then slowly started talking about it and then you meet so many women who are like 'that was my journey' and I didn't even realise how common miscarriages were and that's something, you'd sort of think that OB-GYN would just sit down and tell us that at the outset. This is how it works."
Interviewer,You spend your whole life trying not to get pregnant....
Michelle,"Exactly. And the no one tells you that it's not just a magical thing that happens. So I think... my parents taught me more information is better, giving young people the truth helps them in the long run, so I felt like I had to share my truth and it wasn't a difficult thing for me to share. Anybody who meets me I would have the same conversation. So I couldn't see not sharing with the world what I would share with anyone who I was trying to help."
Interviewer,"Yeah I felt the same when I was going through the experience that it took me ten months, a year to openly say 'yes I'm trying for a baby and it's not happening.' I wish I'd done it earlier but once I'd opened that floodgate I was like, I'm so thankful that I have now got it off my own chest and also helping others to understand that it does happen to people and there can be happy endings as well."
Michelle,And there are many many happy endings.
Interviewer,I'd love to touch on your support systems. Throughout 'Becoming' you list amazing female mentors and leaders who have advised and supported you. You also admit you actively sought out these strong women. What would you say to young women and to young men about the importance of seeking out strong mentors and what did they mean to you?
Michelle,"Oh, my goodness... you don't do anything alone and I think a lot of young people think they look at people like us and think 'you just magically appeared, you became and there you are,' and and it's like no, I always looked ahead of me, at the women primarily who were doing the things that I wanted to do. I talk a lot about Valerie Jarrett, for example, who has worked in our administration but I met her very early on before Barack and I even got married and she for me was one of the first examples of a strong professional woman, who was a single parent, who was doing a phenomenal job as a mother and was just a boss at work. And watching her balance that and not losing herself in either role I'd talk about how I'd sit in a meeting with her and she'd be in the midst of business leaders sitting around the table the mayor on the phone and her secretary would call and say her daughter had just got home from school and wanted to talk and she turned herself off in a second because she said 'I will always make time for my daughter.' So I saw how important it was that even in the height of your career putting your kids first was important. And that helped me think about how I wanted the White House experience to feel for my daughters. That's why in so many instances we would stop our day no matter what was going on, and give that time to the kids because we wanted them to feel like they were at the centre of everything even when their mom and dad were some of the most powerful people in the world. So I wouldn't have known that example was possible had I not looked ahead at the women who were my mentors."
Interviewer,"And I love the story in the book where you pick up three month old Sasha and go to a job interview and you take her with you and you say to the interviewer, 'I'm a family woman, if you want me you need to have my family too and I need to be able to have flexible working.' That was way ahead of it's time."
Michelle,"Well that was an act of complete frustration and desperation because I also talk about how I had tried it so may different ways. I had tried the part time situation when I was at the university and I first had Malia and I realised that part time work for professional women was it was an unequal trade off because I found that all I got was a part time salary. but I was still doing the same amount of work and still needed the same amount of babysitting so I was like, well that's a rip off for me so I tried that, then I was at the stage of trying - I was just so completely frustrated I had lost one of my best babysitters and I talk about the drama that happens when a working mother or mother of any kind loses their help and it's almost worse than being upset at your husband it's like 'you, I don't need the babysitter, I need her.' But at that point I was just ready to give up because I was tired of trying to make the balance work. So what gave me the courage to walk into the President of the hospital's office with my child was that I didn't want the job and I was just going out of a favour so I felt like I had nothing to lose and that also taught me that it's a shame I had to be pushed to the corner for me to to really ask for what I needed. Because I think a lot of women, we're afraid to just put our cards on the table and say, 'This is what I'm worth, this is what I need to make this happen. I can do this. These are my top three things.' I would have never had the courage to do it and I think many women sit on their talents and their gifts because they're afraid to make that ask sometimes we're too polite in the professional world and many women don't have the luxury or the leverage to make the kind of demands that I did because I had the option of staying home because my husband brought in enough income, it would be tough, but it wouldn't have been impossible and I absolutely realise that I was lucky to be able to walk in that office and make those demands."
Interviewer,And it's so brilliant that you did. I truly believe that flexible working is the only way we're going to get full equality in a workplace.
Michelle,Absolutely.
Interviewer,Men being flexible with their work and women as well. And so it's so important and you were ahead of the curve.
Michelle,"Professionals are doing that already. We just don't call it flex. People just don't get the credit that they need. People are juggling and managing to keep things afloat all the time so we just haven't labelled it properly. It's happening and people aren't getting the credit for doing it, but if you work and have kids you're doing something flexible in there to make that happen we just need to label it."
Interviewer,"You're a mum of two children juggling a full time career and your husband decides to run for President of the United States. And you admit that you struggle with politics as a career choice for anyone. So he then came and asked you whether you gave him the family seal of approval to do it but you admitted 'Barack was a black man in America after all, I didn't really think he could win.' And how wrong you were."
Michelle,I was so wrong.
Interviewer,"So the big day arrives, this is the front page of the Times at the inauguration. Can you remember what was going through your head at that time?"
Michelle,"It was freezing cold first of all. And I was thinking are the kids warm? Did I dress them well enough because they were standing off to the sides, and they're still whenever your kids are around for me, I'm still very much in mommy mode. What you do when you have two young kids at a big event where the international spotlight is on them? I'm thinking, are they cold? Are they paying attention?"
Interviewer,"It was a monumental day in history. It was huge. My dream and the core message of my first book, Weconomy, is that one day all businesses will be purposeful, that they will all be forces for good in the world. And I was heartened to learn that when it came to your initiative as First Lady, such as 'Let's Move', the child nutrition bill, and encouraging business to employ veterans you appeal to that very sense of purpose. What role do you think businesses should play in society?"
Michelle,"I think that corporations are citizens of the world in the same way individuals are. I know that that's not necessarily how the free market works but that's how businesses of old used to work. There was a time when a business was a part of the community, the owners lived in the community and employed workers. They knew the people there, so when they made decisions it was hard to look beyond the fact that your decisions impacted your neighbours, and your family and your friends. I wish that businesses still had that sense of fiduciary responsibility to the broader society and I think we need more leaders who think that way as well. But we are in a time when you have to tie purpose to the bottom line which is one of the things I always try to do so with health and nutrition, for example, my argument to food manufacturers was get ahead of the curve because people are being educated about their health and they're going to make different decisions as consumers and so it's incumbent upon you to look at the quality of your products and and how you market them so that you meet the demands of the people who are buying them. And then we tried to focus on the customer and tell them, you have power in this. That what you buy is what they'll make and if you buy junk they'll make junk so it wasn't just the advocacy, but we tried to put ourselves in the positions of the business owners. You can't tell a person making a big juicy high calorie burger to stop making it if that's what people are buying it's not a responsible or logical thing to expect. But if people now are buying healthier options that burger maker is going to make the switch because they want the customer. So we would think in those terms as we started to develop our initiatives."
Interviewer,"I was moved by your desire to open up the White House to many many more people including military families, injured servicemen and women and you regularly invited school children to come from all over the country to work with you on your newly installed vegetable garden. You use a beautiful quote about your father Fraser, right at the beginning of the book"
Michelle,"That and just my experiences as a kid and with kids growing up. Kids can only dream of what they know and I grew up with so many kids who didn't have the advantages I had even though we were a working class family. I grew up in neighbourhoods where a kid could live five minutes from a museum and never think they could go into it because they didn't think it was for them. I know that that's how kids think and the White House is just another big museum that feels like an other place. So I thought about all those kids who needed to walk in those doors and feel like all that wonderful stuff that they saw on T.V. that we do, the military greetings and the state visits and the dinner and the music performances, I wanted as many kids as possible to feel like they belonged in those chairs too and the only way to do that was to open it up and invite them in. I wanted kids running all over the South Lawn, I wanted kids to talk about how they regularly came and helped build that garden and have a sense of pride in the house that is theirs. But you can't send that message if kids don't see themselves in those hallways so I wanted every event to be connected to kids in some way so that whatever was sent out into the world kids would see themselves in that house."
Interviewer,So we did a social media competition where we got lots of people to send in the questions they wanted to ask you and we've got a winner from one called Natasha on Instagram. How do you manage to teach your children the same resilience that you've shown through your life when they have many privileges that you did not have growing up? And I was really interested in this one for my own children as well.
Michelle,"That's a very good question. There are many different approaches that we try to use normalising their experience, setting the same set of expectations for our children that our parents had for us. Contributing around the house not taking your advantages for granted. It's the conversations about advantage as well, pushing them to face their own fears and that's the hardest part as a parent because that means you have to let your kids go and do things that are a little frightening for you, like sending them off away on a trip, I mean Malia for her gap year spent three months in the Amazon camping. I didn't want her to do that, but I thought what what an important lesson in resilience for her just physically to know that she could endure something that hard and be away from home in a different country, learning a different language, so I had to have the courage to let her do that even though I desperately just wanted her to be close to home. So some of what we have to do as parents is let go of our fears and let them fail a little bit and be there for them when they fall because if we're always saving them if we're always helicoptering around they never fall, and they never learn how to get back up and that's a hard thing to watch your kids do is fail."
Interviewer,"I know, it's something my dad always said to me was the importance of failure. I was a bit like you at school, I found it quite I worked hard 'cause I knew how to pass the exams so I never really experienced that failure bit and passed my driving test when I rang him up to say 'Dad I've passed my driving test', he was like 'Oh.' I was like, 'why are you saying oh,' and he was like 'I really wanted you to fail because it's so important to fail at something'."
Michelle,"And it's also who they're surrounded with because maybe the failure isn't theirs but if they're put in circumstances where they see hardship and they whether it's in their communities, or through volunteerism exposing them to all the different challenges that other people face even if it isn't their challenge so service was a huge part of it having them in schools where some kind of mandatory community service was a part of the curriculum has always been important to me. So there are many ways to do it it depends on your circumstances but kids will model what they see at home and the values that are promoted at home so whether they have a lot or a little they still know what their parents believe and what they expect, just as you know, which is why you focus on businesses with purpose. That had nothing to do with the fact that you grew up in hardship but you grew up with parents who expected you to give back. And that stuck with you. And I can only hope that Malia and Sasha will be as giving and as generous as you are."
Interviewer,Thank you very much. Another question lots of people asked was would you ever run for President of the United States but all I'm going to say to all those people is it is answered in the book!
Michelle,Very clearly.
Interviewer,"So go out and buy the book and read it and you'll get your answer 'cause that was probably the question that was asked the most. One of my biggest takeaways is your quote, 'Work with purpose, parent with care.' And I really think that is a motto to life your life by, so thank you so much for that and also thank you very much for the interview today. It's been really lovely seeing you again."
Michelle,Thank you.
