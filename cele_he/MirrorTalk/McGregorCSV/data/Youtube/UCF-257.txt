connor it's good to see you again it has

been a while since we last spoke thank

you for doing this

good to see you ariel thank you good

good to be on

uh obviously different circumstances

you're in dubai getting set for ufc 257

i'm here in new york but

always great to talk to you before your

fights and i actually want to start

uh the last time we spoke on camera it

was moments after

you beat donald cerrone in las vegas

we're in the locker room

you're very happy you're excited but

you're not

overly excited you're just kind of

satisfied but you obviously had very big

plans

for 2020 and much like the entire world

those plans

changed and so after everything you

experienced this past year

i'm just curious off the bat how would

you describe your 2020

as always ariel we focus on the positive

side uh you know i had a great 2020 i

had a great performance i opened the

show

highest pay-per-view highest gate

fastest main event knockout

and an extravagant blockbuster event

that

set the ufc off on a trailblazing run

and i'm very very happy about that very

proud of that

as you said i was you know

satisfied but not you know overly overly

satisfied i was ready to continue

and it didn't go that way

it is what it is i still have that

inside me now i'm still ready to go i've

kept up my preparations

and and we're back and i'm very happy to

be back 2021 we're going to replicate

this you know

again i'm starting the year first

pay-per-view of the year

and i'm very excited about that you know

at the beginning of the pandemic at the

at the very early stages i'm talking

march

april it almost felt like you were

taking it upon yourself

to be a ray of light for in particular

your country you know you're almost

doing these presidential addresses you

were going out and donating

uh a ton of equipment to hospitals and

whatnot it really felt like you were

taking this on your shoulders

is that accurate and if so why did you

feel that you had to do that

you know there was just there was

elements of of worry in there ariel you

know

my family my my my friends you know

everyone got that that i hold dear to

him to myself and you know

i just wanted i just i just wanted us to

be on the ball with this and not let

this get out of hand and get a hold of

it

and that's it i put myself forward in

every way shape or form that i could

and and that was it you know i was out

it was just out of

you know a touch of worry for for my for

my people i wanted to i wanted to

put myself forward and you know helps

help guide us or steer us in the right

way from what i was what

from the studying i was doing on online

you know i i was

delving deep into it and you know it was

a crazy time

and you know it still is you know we're

still not out of it it's actually

it's almost like a re-return of it it's

rampant again and this that and the

other it's

i feel like i feel like we've we've a

tough year ahead again i think we

we all got to just stay stay the course

here and i i feel 2022 is when we're

gonna break out of it

is when we're going to emerge from it

fully you know you know we

we are learning so much about it as the

time goes goes by obviously the vaccines

are being rolled out and this

this type of thing so there's there are

many positives

on the horizon but i still think it's

going to be a tough year

ahead but like i said it will lead into

a great 2022 and

you know i'm just happy to be back in

competition form

start the year 2021 take people's minds

off of of

what's going on around the world and

give them a great show and a great match

so speaking of you know taking people's

minds off of what's going on around the

world

once the ufc came back in may and once

it seemed like they were able to put on

events in a safe and healthy way were

you back home saying to yourself you

know there was talk

a mcgregor card in july with no sports

going on across the world that would

probably do over 2 million buys people

were speculating you versus nade

fight island things like that were you

starting to get those competitive juices

flowing and were there ever any serious

talks about you coming back

a heck of a lot sooner than you are

right now

uh ariel come on man there was a lot of

talks about me coming back i was so

eager to come back i wanted to come back

the tuesday after the fight against

cerrone i had that meeting with lorenzo

and dana and you know

the conversation was what's what do we

do now what's next there you know there

didn't really seem to be

what was the next belt we couldn't we

had not got the answer at that at that

dinner

and you know it just didn't it didn't

come

to fruition i was eager i was trying to

get things moving

and it just didn't happen but you know

with all the circumstances

surrounding it the year and what went

down it just went the way it went and it

is what it is

i feel now you know i'm i have

transformed my body into a lightweight

frame again i've done it healthily i i'm

full of energy i'm full of full of

vitality and i'm ready to

ready to showcase myself at 155 pounds

um at my absolute best and i'm very

excited about that

doing that also opens up many more

options

for me you know there's there's many uh

lightweight contenders

and you know there's many options i've

even heard nate is coming back down to

155 which is an exciting one obviously

you've got

this box and escapades and things i

think i don't think what happens

what happened last year will happen this

year and i've kept that fire going

throughout 2020 2020

and i'm excited to continue it into

2021. and of course i want to ask you

about some of those options but there's

so many unanswered questions about last

year because it did

appear like you were in great shape and

ready to go and so could i ask you know

ufc 250 that night in june after amanda

nunes

defends her title you retire once again

online could you explain now maybe some

months removed

it felt like it came out of frustration

it felt like you you had just kind of

had enough and you needed a break

now that it's it's it's removed why did

you do that and do you regret

quote unquote retiring

you know i'll probably never retire from

the game to be honest i'll always be

although i'll be competing for a long

long time yet so you know there's just

it is certainly brought out of

frustration you know when you're trying

to get these events going you're trying

to get

things moving and it's just not

happening you're you're you're you're

getting

you know you're getting sh it felt like

i was shelved almost you know i felt

like

if i had been ran out a couple more

times that year

not only would my you know would my

with my skill set and my sharpness

everything be in tune a lot more

we'd also be talking the goods of 800

million dollars in revenue toward

for the company and you know it's just

it was certainly out of frustration but

it is what it is the past is the past

we're in a great spot now we've all

i felt i felt like i've got what i

needed to get off my chest and i felt

like it's

it's been reciprocated well and it's

come back you know

there's the other side has come back as

well so i'm in a great spot and i'm

excited to come back and that's what

that's what we're at we're focusing on

the positive side of it

and we're focusing on the future

obviously the the next question that

makes the most sense is

how would you describe your relationship

with dana white now

me and dana i've always had a great

relationship throughout the years i

i believe it's more even more so than a

fighter promoter

you know we've gone and we've done

amazing things together obviously it's

high stakes high pressure business

uh you know we were at loggerheads

probably the most we've ever been in

2020

i felt some things were wrong i don't

you know that were done towards me i

don't some things wrong for sure so you

know it is what it is we've we got it

off our chest and

you know we're back to where we're at

and i'm very happy with that i've got a

lot of admiration for dana what are you

doing in 2020

against all odds was quite admirable and

you know i would have loved to be a part

of it more

but it is what it is i i'm happy that i

started it

started the year launched it and i'm

also happy that i

that i got all the records of the year

so you know

we came through it and we're in a great

place now and you know here we are

there's many many great things ahead

and so you know he said also recently

that you're in a great place do you feel

like that storm is behind you know i

think you're referring to maybe the the

dms

which is something that he he didn't he

didn't like he didn't appreciate you

releasing yeah

you know it wasn't you know i i i the

worst thing i don't know about that now

you know but it

i was more at that time when i was

putting that out obviously it was

frustrations because i was campaigning

for a fight and it was like i wasn't

campaigning for a fight and i was a bit

upset with that

so you know but then me putting them out

was it was around the time diego had

given me a lot of respect and uh

in in the media and he had just had a

fight and a victory

and i wanted to show my respect and say

diego i am actually looking for a belt

against you all so i have no problem

competing against you

you know i understand diego maybe on the

tail end of his career and and this time

but it wasn't like it was just a one and

all it was like it was part of a

collection of belts i was looking for i

wanted activity i must you know

and i'm a competitor and a competitor

needs activity

so it is what it is it went the way it

went and

you know all all in the past once we got

to the fall that's when

you know this fight with dustin started

to percolate

it didn't really seem like the poirier

rematch was

on the radar and and you even said in

the past like you know you beat

aldo in 13 seconds you beat him in a

minute 46

it's kind of hard to replicate that

performance so you were looking for new

options

and it kind of really started online

right with the the offer to do the uh

the sparring match for charity in dublin

and then just all of a sudden it's like

okay we're talking about dustin versus

conor two from your perspective how did

we end up

with your return fight being against

dustin poirier of all people

you know it went the way it went and i

was just i was

just trying to get some competition

going something something popping

you know i mean i was i was trying i was

finding it hard to get something going

and

you know i went about it the way it went

i went about it and i got it going

they set up this great event for from me

here in in fight island

and i'm very happy with how it came

about i'm excited to get in and compete

against dustin i think he's i think he's

atop this division for sure

you know he has not get wins over justin

uh you know

he beat hooker he's you know he's a

phenomenal uh

he's a former champion in the division

also so

i'm excited i'm happy to be back at 155

pounds also

it went perfectly well and i'm very

excited to be back just about there

just on the cusp of it i i saw you say

recently that

you're going to knock them out in less

than 60 and i and i find that

that proclamation in particular to be

very interesting because that would be

less than

obviously the first fight do you feel

pressure to do something even more

spectacular than the first fight you

need to finish him quicker than the

first time around

you know it's certainly it's certainly a

different belt when you face a man twice

right

it should be it should be a more

difficult bout to face a man a second

time

so in that scenario i must do it better

and i'm going to aim to do it better and

i'm i'm

highly confident the shots i will need

to land will be will be

will be hit home inside that first 60

second mark

if dustin can withstand them um more

power to him i know he's hoping it's a

war and a drag that wore back and forth

i'm actually excited about that also i i

wouldn't

i wouldn't be against that i'd actually

i'd actually love that i would actually

relish a war

with dustin so if he can if he can

withstand

the shots and get a pop and let's get it

going let's stand in there and let's

fight

so i i just foresee i just foresee

my shots landing early and that's it you

would prefer a war over

a 60-second fight

uh yeah i probably will to be honest i

probably would

you know i it's yeah i would i want to

get i want to compete i need to i want

to rack up my

rack up the clock you know get get some

time in there

and what's a war to him and what's a war

to me are two different things you know

it's

if he can last he can last but it's it's

not

you know it's it's going to be a small

one for me to be honest i really you

know i know this is a good

a good fighter but i'm the double

greatest

the whole mood of this fight the

build-up of the fight drastically

different

than the first time around no trash talk

there seems to be great mutual respect

you're

even pledging to donate to his charity

the good fight

foundation uh what do you make of that

you know i spoke to uh

ally quinto when this fight was first

made he said oh dustin's already lost

the fight you know he's kind of just

happy to be there

and i've heard this from other people

i'd like to fight ally or quint at some

stage

i'd like to fight allah i i don't know i

just like to fight him

i'd like to fight ali said a few things

and you know i actually like alex he's a

funny guy

yeah real estate agent and all i think

that's even funny in itself

and i you know his team he has his

little team longo and those guys i i'd

like to fight al

er but as far as them i'd like to fight

them all to be honest i don't care

this is the thing with me and all these

other guys wins and losses and all this

it means

nothing to me if you're scheduled to

fight a man

and you've gone through build up and

there's there's history and all of this

a fight is a fight and fights must take

place some of these

fakes you know you know if you look at

like the tony and khabib fight

that that's scheduled to fight five

times and that that's a every fight is

different regardless of anything every

fight between every man is different

and the fights are to take place they

must take place you know what i mean you

can't scurry away and not not not not

not get the fight scene that you were

supposed to fight that's my opinion of

it

and you know i don't care how many wins

or how many losses you have it means

nothing to me i thought

i fought unbeaten everything in in

different sports and all

you know i would fight anyone you know

and

if you want to fight someone you're

supposed to fight them they should

happen so

as far as this one being a lot more

respectful and this we're more mature

myself and dustin we're both fighters

and we've come through a lot

uh you know he we both are engaged in

much philanthropic efforts i know he

he's doing a great team with the good

fight foundation

and even even you know how could i not

respect dustin moon for that

and two for how we handled the last loss

and how he came back and how he rose up

and became a champion

that's that's admirable in my book and

i'm very excited to get in and compete

with him and you know especially as i

get older

in life i am you know i feel it's our

duty as human beings to give back i

think we've all got to give back in this

in this world and as i'm getting older

right i have so much admiration for the

coaches

and the trainers and the teachers

because if you think about it they

dedicate

they are it's all volunteer work you

know they dedicate their time

to help train the youth and guide the

youth

you know and i have so much admiration

for that i know

growing up i would never really think of

like the coaches or anything

in that in that way that these people

are actually taking time they've got

their own families they've got their own

things

but here they are dedicating their time

to help coach and train

the youth and give them an outlet a much

needed outlet especially in this day and

age so i want to go back and support

that i'm going to support

people to support people you know

support support these these gyms and

these these places and that's

that's what my aim will be for this part

of my life

yeah and i give you a lot of credit for

what you've done with the the sbg gym

um in in in ireland of course one of the

branches of of your team and

and of course with the hospitals like i

said it's as far as

philanthropic work it's been a great

year for you um

and i think people need to recognize

that and give you the proper credit for

that part in the pun

uh because you have done a lot of great

things over the past year for your

community

um getting back to the fight if i can

first time

fighting at 155 since the khabib fight

how do you feel right now as we approach

almost a week out

and and you know how do you think the

weight cut is going to be as we approach

weigh-ins next week

it it has been the greatest camp

the greatest weight uh transition i've

ever

i've ever endured you know and it's not

even enduring i'm just

i'm embracing it my frame is is light

i'm i'm a true lightweight frame now i'm

zippy i'm fast i'm powerful

you know i've maintained i have not only

maintained strength i've actually gone

opens

in strength and power uh the weight is

on point as it's ever been and i'm very

excited you know

heart once you're fully committed things

are easy it's that simple hard things

become

easy when you commit yourself fully and

that's what i've done

so i'm very excited to begin to showcase

myself at 155 pounds

fully focused back in october when

khabib suddenly retired everyone thought

including myself that this fight would

be for the belt it seemed like a natural

this would be for the vacant title

are you surprised and or disappointed

that it's not for the title

not surprised not disappointed i i feel

it should be for the title also

um i mean you know

i feel it should be for the title but

i'm not surprised not disappointed it is

what it is

with the way the year went i don't think

i was going to get i was gonna walk into

a title shot straight away you know so

it is what it is i'm happy to be back

here

and i look forward to getting in and

competing on the night

just curious why why do you think it's

not for the belt you know when cejudo

retired

they instantly made a vacant title fight

why do you think this one isn't for a

belt

um yeah you know who knows you know i

was stripped at a featherweight belt

before even getting an offer of of a

featherweight fight you know i barely

even got the cha i barely even got the

second belt in the octagon

in new york that time you know it is

what it is uh

i suppose habib and and and the death of

his father and you know we

they give they give the the time and

and so on and you know i think that's

admirable also

i think the time is is now though you

know i think this could well

it's well passed and i feel this should

be for the belt if it's not no problem

i'm looking to have an active year i'm

looking to compete

and you know i am the champion do you

know that the unified title was never

crowned

the unified title was never crowned that

time in october 2018

the habib fled the cage and left me

fighting with his family members in the

case the

the the post-fight ceremony was never

never took place so you know i still

feel like i'm the champion here and and

i will go in and prove that i'll prove

that with my performances

and you know time will time will show

the the cream always rises to the top

and the world is about to see it

do you think khabib fights again

i think he's afraid to fight me that's

right i'm sure you know when i don't

blame him

i know everything i know exactly what

the face he i fought the best of him on

that night he fought the worst of me on

that night he knows that i know it his

team knows it

i have the answer to destroy that man so

you know

he can he can pull the wool over over

people's eyes for

only so long so you know it is what it

is i know there's surrounding

things regarding the family and that and

you know if he's retired and that's it i

wish him well and it is what it is but

i i am who i am and i am at the top you

know so

time will show do you think he retired

because he didn't want to fight you is

that what you are

essentially saying uh yes i would say so

another you know i i think his hand was

shown he's not a true fighter in my

opinion you know how could you

how could you how could you walk away

there's so many great fights

to be had the anonymous like think of

the diaz is the fergusons you know

there's so many wild fights the

oliveira's the you know

the rematch against me i think it's just

preposterous to walk away i think

i think he just not only did he on the

bus i think he put

on the chips also i think he showed his

hand but then at the same time you know

there is family issues and you know it

is what it is so

all the best dana white has been very

clear about the fact that he wants to

see the rematch

do you think the rematch happens in 2021

i'm here for it i'm ready for it i would

like it to if it doesn't it doesn't

so i i wonder i wonder i wonder what

he's going to say you know

like i said he can only pull over the

wall over someone's eyes for so long

you know dana probably you know could

have taken

could have stripped the belt from him

that night you know what i mean

all that stuff all that all that uh all

that was

put into him for that event then

the pay-per-view flopped and then a

retirement you know it's

you know how long how long will it last

it doesn't last that long in this

business you know so what have you done

late it's a what have you done for me

lately business

and the clock is taken for sure so we'll

see what happens

is it true there was an offer on the

table for you guys to be the coaches on

the ultimate fighter and then

fight at the end of that dana had said

something to me

you know i i don't think he was going to

be up for it i would have been up for it

no problem might actually i know i know

the ultimate fight is about to take

place

soon i'd be up to come i'd be up to

coaching on that also

you know to showcase a different version

of me from a coaching standpoint

would be an interesting uh an

interesting

uh journey and i'd like to do it so

we'll see what happens

dana did mention it to me i didn't but

i was skeptical where of the other sides

agreement you know you know they don't

want that area let's be real

is it still an option or you haven't you

haven't talked about it anymore i

haven't talked about it since now but i

would still be open to it

whoever they'd wanted against i would

still be open to it

i'm sure look there's so many there'll

be a lot of conversations to be had

as this thing as this thing shapes out

and i'm very excited about it

if it all goes well on the 23rd i would

imagine because you were very

you were very clear that you had the

season in mind for 2020 you wanted to

fight at least three times

could you map out your ideal 2021 for us

can you give us you know just like you

did at that press conference in russia

uh you know towards the end of 2019 you

kind of mapped out 2020 unfortunately

plans changed the floor is yours can you

map out the perfect 20

21 for conor mcgregor

you know i don't that didn't work out so

well the last time so let's just say

competition

that's it just competition is what i'm

after here you know good competition

and and you know that's it get my full

sharpness

although i have been having behind

closed doors competitions i have a 22

foot

full spec ufc cage in my in my house in

my back garden

that i've been having full-on fighting

so i'm i i you know i'm not it's not

like my sharpness is not there but you

know under ozil

it is a slightly different so i just

want to be kept busy i want i want

competition

so i hope so would it be fair to say you

want to fight at least three times

though this year three to four yes

okay and what about manny pacquiao

because you mentioned that last year

when we spoke

and then those talks seemed to heat up

how real

is the possibility of that fight

happening in a boxing ring this year

i i think it's very very probable very

high probability that it happens this

year when i'm not so sure maybe

maybe towards the end of it and

it i suppose it's all going to depend on

what's presented to me afterwards i know

the talks are amplifying

and i am i'm i'm ready for that belt

also you know it's a boxing world title

on the line

i am like i said i've trimmed down to

this frame

and let's see what happens i know there

are many great options that was talked

about in ideas coming back to 155.

you know you got hooker and uh chandler

competing in the coming i'm interested

to see what they

those guys do on the night i know

they're very excited about it and

they're gonna

come for it you've got gaijin oliveira

you've got

you know you've got plenty of options so

let's see what happens

um you know there's a lot of people

coming for you

people calling you out as always that's

that's not a new thing

but i have noticed and perhaps this is a

part of the maturation

that uh you don't always take the bait

anymore maybe four years ago you're

replying within seconds right

someone's calling you out you're

replying but you're not always taking

the bait

these days is there is this a sign of

yeah no i'm certainly in a different

point in my life you know i'm i'm the

whale ariel the whale doesn't

the whale doesn't react to bait you know

the fish react to the bait

so um yeah that's it i'm in a different

point in my life

i appreciate um i appreciate good

competition i appreciate

respect and i appreciate people that are

gonna bring it you know

i'm yeah that's it i am where i'm at i'm

at and

that's it uh have you already talked to

the ufc about and with all due respect

to dustin of course you want to look

past them

but if all goes well is our is there

already kind of like a plan for what the

next fight and when the next fight will

happen

you know there has been no discussions

on that there's been no discussions on

that

so you know like i said it's all i'd

imagine that it will all take place

possibly in the dressing room post fight

okay do do you have an opponent in mind

i

i am the opponent does not matter it

could be

absolutely anyone on the roster

it could be anyone in any sport so

i all options i i am i am available

let's see how let's see how the next

couple of fights and

the next dates and these type of things

play out and

and we'll we'll go with what's what's

the best

you know last year when we spoke uh you

raised a lot of eyebrows when you spoke

about

i'm not drinking this camp i've been

very good and i think we saw the

performance

you know it certainly felt like it all

made sense that you know

the way you were treating your body

taking it seriously it led to a great

performance has it been

more of the same this time around yeah

it has been more of the same you know i

certainly had

you know when you're cutting weight

you've got to you know just to think

some of the times when i was cutting

weight and i was

drinking all drinking drinking my

whiskey heavy

you know and you're unlimited calories

and then you're doing heavy training

sessions it's just

it's not a good mix so i've done it for

the cowboy

cerrone fight when i didn't have to cut

weight this time i i had i had

you know i was i was following a strict

nutrition plan so i've been i've been

off of my liquid

and as much as as difficult as that is

uh but i have been offered throughout

this entire camp now granted i had

a little simple over the christmas you

know but that was very

very small just a little just to wet the

lips

and to see how my creation is blossoming

and it is blossoming

beautifully so i've stayed strict as i

can be

this camp and i'm looking forward to my

post-fight

uh toast my post-fight whiskey i will

raise the glass

you know it's actually early morning in

in abu dhabi as you know the fight will

take place i believe i'll be making my

walk maybe 9 a.m

so i'm going to have an irish coffee a

proper irish coffee after the

the fight and i've been craving pink

usually throughout

throughout you know weight weight

changes or weight cuts

you begin to crave certain foods i'm

create cr i'm craving american style

pancakes

so i'm going to have a nice big plate of

american style pancakes

and a proper irish coffee post fight and

i'm looking forward to that

and speaking of the united arab emirates

um i think maybe

you know there were some questions oh

how are they going to receive conor

given your past with

habib how has it been for you over there

you know my situation with habib is it's

strictly

personal between myself and himself it's

not to do with any

anything else regardless of what certain

individuals try and

try and claim you know i have been

treated very well here i've

the people here have been amazing to me

it's very hospitable

it's not my first time fighting in the

region also i've competed in a man's

jordan before

and i'm very excited to be back it's

been it's been great to be here in dubai

and i'm very excited to get to abu dhabi

and just relish in in the culture i just

enjoyed it

the the experience i'm enjoying it

immensely immensely so far

uh you will be fighting in front of fans

one of the first fights in a very long

time in front of fans

uh but a very small size right 2000 or

so they said

do you like that idea was a part of you

kind of relishing the idea of the empty

arena

yes yes that's that's it because i was

like i almost got it i almost made it i

almost got a silent

arena and i would have loving that

because i had hit

i had hit dana up and i was like are we

in the arena or are we in the marquee

and we were in the etihad arena at the

big gold arena so i was very excited

about that and then i was thinking wow

we're going to be in this big arena and

there's not going to be a there's not

gonna be any crowd it's gonna be

the echo of the shots i was very excited

to showcase my velocity and my power and

my my you know my tenacity in there and

have that broadcast

all across the world and then to also

hear it my own self

um but we almost made it we didn't make

it you know there's gonna be a couple of

thousand fans in but still

my power and a couple of thousand fans

it will still translate it will be like

there is still no one in the arena so

i'm very excited to let my shots fly

on the night and let the world know

where i'm at with my

with my power how do you think this does

on pay-per-view do you have a number in

mind

geez i think it's going to be a high one

i'd say

1.8 2 million 1.6 1.8 maybe

you know we'll see what happens i think

it's going to be a good one though

and yeah i'm excited let's see what

happens

a a blog post a success no doubt it

always is ariel you know that the

excitement always builds around around

it and i'm honored to come back

and entertain the people give them a

good fight a good showcase a good

performance

you know and in the midst of all this

that's going on it's an honor for me to

do that

if it does 1.8 how much do you walk away

with

you know i'll have to check that out um

i'm not hurting for it that's for sure

so yeah

a nice healthy number i think last time

you told me you were

targeting like around 80 and that uh

yeah you know the second pay well

there's the second pay walls and that i

didn't quite get to there i got

i got i didn't get you know i got okay

you know you could there could be an

argument for hey i could be on a little

bit more

you know come considering what i bring i

think that's not

that's not against i think that's not

out of the question

for me you know for me to bring that up

but i'm happy where i'm at i've got my

i've got my

i've got my contract i've got my fights

left and i'm eager to just get get them

going

so i'm happy where i'm at and you know

conor last year when i when i spoke to

you

uh you know i asked you about

allegations and things like that and you

almost got mad at me for asking and i

understand why why you felt that way

but you know we've seen a maturation and

an evolution of your character and the

stuff that you're doing in your

community and whatnot

and it's just amazing those who have

followed your trajectory in your career

it's just really been an amazing thing i

was watching the documentary and just to

see how much you've changed and

you become a father and by the way

congratulations on the third coming

along and the engagement just to see all

this you've allowed us to watch all this

have you learned lessons about you know

not you know having people around you to

protect you and to be

i've gone through some i've gone through

some heinous things

are real against me you know when it's

been it's been

it's been beyond tough you know but what

doesn't

what doesn't what doesn't kill you makes

you stronger you know what doesn't break

you

makes you and that's it i just there was

times i was at my absolute end you know

i just

but i i held firm i had i have my family

around me i have my team around me and

and of course at the support of my fans

and that that were just keeping me

keeping me in there and you know

it made me it made me stronger and

that's it i i continue to go

forward and i will continue to go

forward and that's it you know it's

life is a lesson you know and it's you

know when you get in this spotlight

and um you're in this position it's like

there's a bullseye on your back and it's

kind of hard to take at some st

some sometimes you know but it is what

it is and i live a good life and i'm

very

very happy i'm very grateful to be in

this position

and although there are negatives that

come with it i focus on the positives

and

take all the lessons and move forward

and it certainly shaped me into a better

individual and i'm thankful for that

lastly uh it's great to see connor jr

posing and mimicking you and by the cage

and all that

are you sensing like is this inevitable

is he gonna be

is he gonna be a fighter in about 20

years if he

he will certainly be skilled as a

fighter you know he

he already is skilled as a fighter he's

got phenomenal punching power

he's got phenomenal kicks and dexterity

in his legs

you know my wrestling coach sergey has a

young son albert he was a phenomenal

wrestler

and he he he loves that he loves he

loves albert he's an older kid and

they're always wrestling together so

you know he's gone through all the

disciplines and he's loving them it's

not like i'm trying to put them on to

him

you know as time goes on will he want to

compete will he want to you know

get in and deal with i'm not sure but he

will certainly be skilled to do so

and it's all he sees at the minute he

sees his father wake up

early he sees his father following a

strict nutrition plan he sees his father

go to walk and go to train

he's washed at cage side and you know

i'm sure that's going to have an effect

on him and we'll see

whatever my son or my any of my children

want to do they have my full support and

full backing

and that's it he's certainly a force to

be reckoned with whatever

whatever he decides that's for sure as

is my daughter and as his as will be my

next

child in in the coming months

uh your your fans look forward to these

chats i look forward to them as well

they've become ritual

uh they've been bothering me asking me

if we're gonna do it again knowing that

unfortunately i'm not there um can i

give you this opportunity

whatnot it's the first one i miss

since brimmage i've been to every single

rolled out the most vulnerable
