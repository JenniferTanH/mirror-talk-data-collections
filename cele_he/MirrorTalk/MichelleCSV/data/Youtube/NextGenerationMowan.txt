hi everybody

we are here for the united state of

women now i know you all have had a busy

packed full day very inspiring right and

hopefully our conversation will live up

to the hype but before we begin of

course i want to take a moment to just

acknowledge what has happened in orlando

that even as we gather here today and we

talk about the challenges that women

face we have to remember those that we

lost in orlando as well as those who are

injured and all of their loved ones and

know that we will all continue to keep

them in our thoughts and prayers but the

one thing i just want us all to know

that as tragic times like these in this

country it's time for us to come

together to love each other to support

each other and not see reach other down

so i hope that that is one of the many

takeaways that we we move forward with

and i just love you all for the work the

amazing work you all have done today and

that you do every single day so i'm

going to turn it over to oprah hello

we have oprah winfrey here

and our first lady I of the United

States of America of America is not just

a women yes so I think that the fact

that I've been watching this being

streamed all day and the fact that there

are men here women here of all ages

young women maturing women and all walks

of life is a move in the right direction

would you not say absolutely I'm just

proud of all the work that's been done

here so I agree I agree well I wanted to

start with the issue of self value and

self-worth because over the years I've

interviewed thousands of people most of

them women and I would say that the root

of every dysfunction I've ever

encountered every problem has been some

sense of a lacking of self value or of

self worth and I know that we all we all

know that we live in a world where you

are constantly being bombarded by images

that encourage you to be light literally

and it's a lot to live up to and I

wonder particularly you who've had to

face this as your own woman and as a

candidate's wife the pressure of other

people's expectations and what can you

share with our audience here and online

that would help us stand more inside

ourselves and own that space very good

question well you know one of the things

that I always I tell my mentees I tell

my daughters is that the our first job

in life is women I think is to get to

know ourselves and I think a lot of

times we don't do that we spend our time

pleasing satisfying looking out into the

world to define who we are listening to

the messages the images the limited

definitions that people have of who we

are and that's true for women of color

for sure

there is a limited box that we are put

in yeah and if we live by that limited

definition we we miss out on a lot of

who we are but it it takes it takes

taking the time to know who you are to

be able to deal with the onslaught of

negative messages that you're bound to

get so for me I came into this with a

pretty clear sense of myself and some of

that comes with age some of that comes

with experience some some of that comes

from being fortunate enough to been

raised by a loving mother strong focused

and a father who loved me dearly

so I fortunately came into this

situation with a really clear sense of

who I was so when you hear the smack

talking from outside the world it's easy

to sort of brush that off because I Know

Who I am but when you came in there were

the world's expectations there were

other expectations what did you really

expect you know it's interesting I

really tried not to limit myself by

expectations right because anybody grows

up thinking I'm gonna be a first

absolutely not

yeah you know and as you all know when

Barack was talking about running I was

like are you crazy I mean would you just

like chill out and do something else

with with your life so I was working

hard to try to get him to do the other

thing so whatever that was so yeah

absolutely it wasn't something that I

could have planned for could have

expected for myself but one of the

things I knew because people asked all

throughout the campaign what are your

issues are gonna be what are you gonna

be like his first lady and I said I have

to wait until I get there

to figure out what that's gonna feel

like for me right I specifically did not

read other first lady's books because I

didn't want

to be influenced by how they define the

role I knew that I would have to define

this role very uniquely and specifically

to me and who I was so I came in

thinking about who I wanted to be in

this position who and who I needed to be

for my girls first of all so you

remember you know Malia and Sasha were

little itty bittys when we came in the

office I mean it still moves me to tears

to think about the first day I put them

in the car with their Secret Service

agents to go to their first day of

school and I saw them leaving and I

thought what on earth am i doing to

these babies so I knew right then and

there my first job was to make sure they

were gonna be whole and normal and cared

for in the midst of all this craziness

and then I started to understand that if

I was gonna protect them I had a

number-one protecting myself and protect

my time so I knew going into this role

that I didn't want to waste any time

that anytime I spin away from my kids

and I actually took this on even before

I became first lady even as a lawyer as

a vice president at a hospital one of

the things I realized is that if you do

not take control over your time and your

life other people will gobble it up if

you don't prioritize yourself

you constantly start falling lower and

lower on your list your kids fall lower

and lower on your list so by the time

you got here you knew how to do that I

knew how to do that I think that's one

of the number-one issues with women you

know I never in all my years of

interviewing I've ever heard a man say

you know I just don't have the time I

just don't I don't you find a way to

know they don't have to balance anything

yes sorry you know and I hope that that

is changing but so many men don't have

to do at all

so how did you figure it out you know

I've read the story I'm sure many of

you've heard the story of early on you

were going to a job interview and you

took Sasha with you - yeah yeah I we

never heard did you get that job I did

okay and I was

vice president of community outreach for

the University of Chicago hospital and I

got that job because I didn't compromise

because before getting working at that

job I was working as an associate dean I

had had Malia Barack was in the US

Senate so I was basically you know

mothering part time on my own having I

had a full-time job so I tried part-time

I've talked about this before I tried

part-time because I thought I have to

figure this out I have to be able to

pick the kids up I've got to be able to

do all this so try part-time the only

thing I found out from part-time was

that you just get paid part-time because

I was still doing a full time job I was

just cramming it all into the few hours

that I was there and driving myself

crazy so I had vowed that if I continued

to work that I would never settle for

part time I knew what my time and energy

was worth so when I went into that the

president's office to interview for that

job I thought I have a little baby I

don't have babysitting so here we go

we're all gonna go in to see the

president because this is who I am

yeah and I said and if I take this job I

need flexibility and I need full pay so

if you want me to leave my baby and my

kids then you're gonna have to pay me

because I'm gonna do the job that was

never a question you know I could

deliver but I wasn't I knew then I

wasn't going to sell myself short and I

had the leverage at the time to make

that decision well that comes from a

sense of and you said you arrived here

knowing who you were I think that is the

journey that is the journey and there is

a question from a farm fresh cow farm

fresh gal she must have our own garden

hope like we do yes and farm fresh cow

says as a woman leader in the corporate

world I feel like I have to be brave a

lot and what you just described was

brave any advice or tips on bravery

that's a good question

gosh I don't know if I ever I don't ever

view it as bravery yeah

you didn't think that was brave saying

look I'm gonna be paid by time right I

just I just viewed it is I'm I'm not

gonna be taken advantage of

you know I just I am just not gonna keep

you knew your value that's new your

value I was just saying that to a friend

recently and then goes back to knowing

who you are and I think as women and

young girls we have to invest that time

and getting to understand who we are and

liking who we are because I like me I've

liked me for a very long time so for a

long time I've had a very good

relationship with myself I know and we

like we all like ourselves out here but

you gotta work to get to that place and

if you're going out into the world as a

professional and you don't know who you

are you don't know what you want you

don't know how much you're worth then

you have to be brave and then you have

to you know you have to count on the

kindness and goodness of others to

bestow that goodness on you when you

should be working to get it you're on

your own could you deserve it because

you know your own value know your own

value okay so when you're saying I know

who I am and I'm telling you it's the

thread that runs through everything it's

the thing that allows you to stand in

your own truth and one of the things for

years that my Angelou used to say to me

is baby you need to know that you alone

are enough you alone are enough so how

do we get there

you were there you've loved yourself a

long time what is that process I think

it's different for everyone and I can't

say that I you know I've loved myself

for a long time but there was a journey

to get there and it's you know some of

it starts as a young young girl when you

you know confront your first bully the

first time somebody calls you out your

name as we would say you know the first

disappointments and failures that you

have how do you deal with that what

support systems do you set up for your

self I always tell young girls surround

yourself with goodness you know I

learned early on how to you know get the

haters out of my life you know you got

to just sort of surround yourself with

people who uplift you who hold you up

and for whatever reason while I was

lucky I had people like I had parents

who held me up yeah I had a father they

have good parents all right

they come into the world with a strength

yes and an advantage that was an

advantage but if you don't have that

parent that mother that father then you

got to find it you got to find those

people because they're out there I tell

my mentees all of their there is

somebody out there who loves you and who

is waiting to love you and you just have

to find them and that means you have to

make room for them and if you're

surrounded by a bunch of lowlife folks

who aren't supporting you then there is

no room for the people who do love you

you mentioned a moment ago the haters

how do you handle the haters

particularly in this office where haters

have to be handled politically correctly

and with discretion and I know so many

people are faced with it we know this

about social media people say just the

meanest things and you're faced in your

life with people who can tear you down a

lot the haters when it can raise social

media they're just times I turn off the

world you know they're just sometimes

you have to give yourself space to be

quiet which means you got to set those

phones down you can't be reading all

that stuff I mean that's like letting

somebody just walk up and slap you you

know you would never do that

you would never just sit there and go

slap me in the face and I'm good with it

no you know so why would you open

yourself up to that so that's one thing

with social media and I don't read that

stuff I learned that early in the

campaign I couldn't keep reading stuff

about my husband and what people thought

and thought and you know because I knew

who he was I knew what was going on in

our home in our lives so I didn't need

to read about it from somebody else but

the other thing that I have found

particularly in this job that it's

people won't remember

or what other people say about you but

they will remember what you do so my my

strategy and I've always been like this

when a teacher would come and tell me

that I couldn't do something I would get

so much satisfaction proving them wrong

I'd be like okay all right oh you don't

think I'm gonna do X Y & Z well I'm

gonna be the best X Y Z you can imagine

so when it came to this role I just said

you know let me just be first lady let

me wake up every day and work hard to do

something of value and to do it well and

to do something consequential and to do

something that I care about and then let

that speak for itself and that would

shut up the haters because I would have

a whole portfolio of stuff that defined

me because it's what I did not what you

called me so the best revenge is success

success and good work yeah you don't

have to say anything to the haters you

don't have to acknowledge them at all

you just wake up every morning and be

the best you you can be and that tends

to shut them up you know I've always

thought too that the best success comes

when we you when you can actually shift

your paradigm to service and obviously

you are in a position of public service

was it a conscious intentional decision

to sort of sit still be with this place

and then allow your passion to fuel your

interest allow your passion to lead you

to all the things you've been able to do

with international girls education with

health and wellness was that that's a

conscious intentional decision

absolutely because in this war

particularly when you're in public

service your first lady the president

you're interacting with the world you

know people can

smell in authenticity you know they know

when you are not what you appear to be

and that was always something that I

said in this role that I want people to

know me know Michelle Michelle Robinson

Obama not the first lady but I'm

wherever in every interaction I have had

with anybody who's had some connection

with me I have tried to be authentically

myself and in order to do that I learned

that I have to do things that I

authentically care about because if I

fundamentally deep down have a belief in

the cause and I it moves me that I'm

gonna be excited about it it's gonna be

that excitement is gonna be conveyed to

the people that I'm trying to reach it's

not gonna be a heavy lift you know

that's why people say how can you speak

in front of all these people and do this

every day look I get energy from people

and not everybody in politics in in

public service or people people Barack

and I really do we are we are energized

by the people we meet you know by the

military spouses that I meet out there

I'd pick working with military families

because they moved me

I met them out on the campaign trail and

I didn't know that there were millions

of military families out there serving

and sacrificing in ways that we take for

granted in this country and I vowed then

and there just from meeting them that if

I got to be first lady I would try to be

that voice for them I would try to shine

that light on them so that came out of a

direct passion for who those people were

and what I learned about them and I

remember when you all first arrived to

the White House you said to the country

that this is your house and we're gonna

open this up as your house and so when I

saw all those Girl Scouts out on the

lawn I went y'all really did open up the

house yes yes that's been some of the

most fulfilling things we've been able

to do in in the White House it's really

bringing people here who would never

ever get to set

on that lawn and walk into those doors I

tell my mentees all the time you know

one of the things I want them to take

away when they come because they come

regularly they come at least once a

month then we sit down and we talk and

they have seminars and I want them all

to know you walk into the White House

every day and you walk up to the First

Lady of the United States and say hey

Michelle what's going on and if you can

do that you can do anything if you can

exist in this space at this time in this

moment yes and there is no class that

you can't handle there's no school who's

rejection will make you fold or make you

crumble you've been here you know and

I've watched so many kids come through

those gates and really be in that space

picking you know tomatoes with me in the

garden getting to sit in and have

tastings at the state dinner being

invited to watch Hamilton I mean just

watching their eyes just experiencing

things that really only the privileged

get to the experience but having it be

kids and people who would never believe

they would set foot in that you see them

get empowered oh yeah

transformed in the process how many kids

you think their worldview will never be

the same and that's the least we can do

as president in first lady I think

that's the obligation of anyone who

lives in that house do you how do you

feel you know I always feel that until

you take your last breath you're always

growing and that every experience that

you encounter in your life just all of

you being together here today and being

in a room with people who are

like-minded who share the same vision

all of that is so stimulating you leave

here and you feel like you couldn't be

better and and do better what has the

experience or how has the experience of

being first lady you know actually grown

you wow it's so many ways I mean first

of all there is absolutely nothing I can

do

I mean cuz you walk-in that's right yeah

that's right we've been in the

mountaintop hard climb but we made it so

you just you know again you begin to

understand how much you can you know how

much you can tolerate how much growth

you can have how much potential there is

how much opportunity there is to help

people how fulfilling it is I mean

that's been the thing that I've learned

that oh it feels public service

I left the practice of law to go into

public service for selfish reasons I

wanted to be happy and feel good every

single day I wanted to wake up inspired

and ready to do something greater than

myself and that's what service and

giving and you know that's what this

room means to to so many and I just want

to make sure that when people leave here

they don't go back into their isolation

that they don't go back to their phones

looking down because this relationship

isn't enough you know you need to have

people in your lives that you're

connecting with that you're helping I

mean there's there's nothing that makes

me feel better than knowing that I

helped to change somebody's life Oprah

you know this more than anyone else and

if you're doing that every single day

the haters the doubters none of that

matters because you are getting so much

by the work from the work that you're

doing well you know I figured this out

early on in the show I had read this

quote from dr. King one of my favorite

quotes from him that says not everybody

can be famous but everybody could be

great because greatness is determined by

service and I literally shifted I used

that quote to help me shift the way I

saw the platform of television instead

of like oh I'm on TV how do I use that

platform as a platform of service is

amen is what I did yeah yeah we know and

you did that pretty well but when you

think about growing and being empowered

yourself it is what you've been able to

do for other people that that leaves you

the fullest yes that absolutely that is

that is really the thing so I don't know

I you know I don't sort of my growth is

incidental it is the it's it's the lucky

gift I get forgiving you know and like

you said I'm still growing you know we

are all still growing I I used to tell

some of the young people I work with way

back in Chicago days that I used to hate

the the question what do you want to be

when you grow up because it assumes that

at some point you stop becoming and you

just are something and that would be a

sad thing you know to think that this is

it

and that's one of the things I've

learned that there is there's so many

phases to life that this is just this

even as big as being first lady and

living in the White House has been this

is still just a portion of a very bigger

journey that I have yet to know the

outcome and I won't know it until I'm

laying laying down it's just

ever-evolving and I think that that

reality that this experience has helped

me to see that that these are just

phases you know and this has been a very

interesting phase and a very impactful

phase but there's more to come I love

you saying that I'm not through wait

though oh okay

so yes I believe in service I believe in

helping people I want people to feel

fulfilled and empowered in their life

but still some days I think it's just

cool to be me

and I think that to some days it's just

cool to be Oprah yeah no I want to say

so I want to know what are those days

when you just say there are so look at

me in the White House yeah just setting

up here you know there are a lot of

those moments you know Prince and Stevie

Wonder singing in the East Room just may

may he rest in peace I mean those rare

gifts of entertainment that the kind of

music we've been able to bring into the

white house you know sitting with the

Pope watching my mother and my

daughter's talked to the Pope that's

like look at you know dinner with the

Queen of England you know you try to

play these moments off like oh yes yes I

know what I'm doing and inside you're

going oh good lord

yes watching my husband walk off a

marine one and go to the Oval Office is

life

and and you know he's got that wok right

I know he's got the swag did he always

have that swag or has he gotten swaggy

er no he was very swagalicious look I

told people this from the very start

when I started running Barack Obama who

is exactly who he says he is we both are

that's what I've been trying to tell

people and no surprises we're telling

you who we are and no tricks up our

sleeves we're regular folks we care

about people we care about family we

want to do well we want to make our

country proud we don't want to waste our

talents just making money for for

ourselves Barack Obama hasn't changed

you know not as a person because he is

an authentic man who came in and he's

gonna leave that same person so it's not

the it's not the office that changes you

it's just it amplifies who you are I

think I said that at the last convention

being president doesn't change who you

are it reveals who you are and that's

something that we should all remember

this is a united state of women there

are a lot of cool men out here I love

the president give it up for the

brothers it's not a cool man out here

for them for the men out here I love the

President's speech saying you're looking

at a feminist what can men do leaving

here be better

be better at everything be be better

father's good Lord just being good

fathers who loved your daughters and are

providing a solid example of what it

means to be a good man in the world and

showing them what it feels like to be

loved that is the greatest gift that the

men in my life yes

gave to me and we've talked about this

the fact that I've never experienced

abuse at the hands of any man in my life

and that's sad to say that that's a rare

reality so men can be better at that men

can be better husbands you know which is

be a part of your family's life do the

dishes

you know don't babysit your children you

don't babysit your own children you know

be engaged you know don't just think

going to work and coming home makes you

a man being a father being engaged all

that stuff is important be a better

employer you know when you are sitting

at a seat of power at a table of any

kind and you look around and you just

see you it's just you and a bunch of men

around the table on a golf course making

deals and you allow that to happen and

you're okay with that be better be

better be better and be better I love

that just be better I could go on but

I'm not you you get the point fellas

right fella what are you gonna be you go

there you go

so here's the question that comes up

over and over and over and we talked a

little bit about it this idea of balance

is that a false notion for women because

can we really are we ever gonna have it

all I used to say you can

at all you just can't have it all the

one time or is that a is that a false

notion look I I am always irritated by

that you can have it all

statement and I grew irritable occasion

the older I got as you're trying to have

it all yeah and you're beating yourself

up right and feeling less than because

you aren't having it all because it is

uh it's it's a it's a ridiculous

aspiration especially if you're looking

at everybody else's Facebook page Oh God

everybody has it all everybody's lying

they're lying

y'all need to stop lying be real about

the fact that you know no one gets

everything that was one of the first

rules you learned as a little kid you

don't always get your way come on people

you don't always get what you want all

the time and that's true in life so what

I've told many young people is that you

can have it all but oftentimes it's hard

to get it all at the same time I believe

you know so it's just a manager a matter

of managing expectations so for me for

example you know when your husband is

President of the United States and you

have children something's got to give

you know I I've made compromises in my

life in my career but I've also in

exchange gained a wonderful platform to

do some great work who would have ever

imagined that we would make the inroads

we've made on healthy eating and

changing the way our kids are fed in

school and you know yeah I can point to

so many things that I've had I've been

able to do if I want to be heavily

involved in my girls lives that means

that sometimes I have to put some things

on the back burner to give them what

they need so it's it's hard to have it

all but that's where you go back to

knowing who you are and knowing that you

know you're really living through phases

and if you don't if you're compromising

through one phase of your journey you're

not giving it all up you're just you

you're compromising for that phase

there's another phase that's coming up

where you might be able to have more of

what you thought you want it you know

you get to know yourself a little bit

more so so no III don't want young women

out there to have the expectation that

if they're not having it all that

somehow they're failing life is hard but

life is long if you maintain your health

which is one of the reasons why we talk

about health talk about taking care of

yourself because you want to get to the

next phases in life where you can do

more of what you want to do at any given

do you want to be wherever you are right

now and just like you say I'm not

through no you're not through not

through so 5,000 women and men in this

room thousands and thousands of others

streaming us online hey hey everybody

streaming what is the one thing because

I think it's really easy when you come

to a conference like this and you get so

inspired and you see Marlee and Michaela

those young women and you see Billie

Jean King and Gloria Steinem and Sandra

Rimes and amazing Gary Washington you

see all these women and you're just like

I just want to be more of a woman and

you you you you you get you're gonna be

over stimulated what is the one thing

you want us to leave here with what is

the one charge or one offering what do

you want to say it's hard to think of

one one thing okay a couple but the work

always continues I mean and by that I

just mean we're never done we can never

be complacent and thinking that we've

arrived

now as women and because I hear this

from young women some of the some of you

young women who aren't feeling the you

know the the pains that many of our

predecessors have felt you think well

there aren't any problems women's rights

we got this all figured out

I'm already equal I'm oh I'm good

now just like oh just you wait you'll

feel it so the work continues and for

all the young women in this room all the

young men we can never be complacent

because we we have seen in recent times

how quickly things can be taken away if

we aren't vigilant if we don't know our

history you know if we if we don't

continue the work so my hope is that

people leave here inspired and ready to

do something you know again remember

it's not what people say about you it's

what you do so the question is what are

you gonna do you know how are you gonna

be better what are you gonna change in

your office in your life in your

relationships what are you gonna change

in your family dynamic and how are you

gonna empower yourself with the

knowledge that you need to know what

work needs to be done we can't afford to

be ignorant we can't afford to be

complacent so we have to continue the

work yeah I think that's powerful

because the question that you just just

offered to us is what did this mean and

what can I do with what I have received

from all of the stimulation all of this

energy what can what can I do that's the

question you were talking about the next

phase I heard you say that when you all

are done we saw your new house when

you're we're neither conforming or

confirming or denying okay which okay

when you all are done okay when you're

done and you move out of the white house

I've heard you say that you look forward

to riding around what the wind is down

are you still gonna be a Michelle Obama

yeah we're gonna know who you are and it

won't matter how many baseball caps you

put on we're gonna say hey Michelle Amos

yeah I get that yeah so what is the what

is the one thing that you think you

wanted you really want to do and can we

go shopping

you're a girl let's go shop is go shop

you and me that will be a scene you know

it's what what do you want to go

shopping with me go shopping with us

yeah it's it's really the the little

things I mean and you feel this you know

Fame can be confining you know and then

you start missing the little things you

know what do I want to do I want to walk

out I want to open my front door without

discussing it with anyone and I want to

walk out that door and just walk just

want to walk by myself or with a

semblance of feeling like I'm by myself

because that's what you learn how to do

it's like I'm alone with 800 people

walking behind me but I've learned how

to provide I'm by myself but I do I want

to walk down a street I want to sit in a

yard that is not a national park you

know I I do want to you know drop in on

into target I want to you know I do I

want to go to target I've heard so many

things have changed you know I tell my

friends they're gonna have to give me a

rien tree training yeah like okay what

do you do at CVS now how do you check

out you know it's like I've been living

in a cave but it is it's the small

things you know fresh air you know in

the white house you can't open a window

Sasha opened her window once they were

calls shut the window never opened again

so it it's the little things that you

know you you you the things that we all

take for granted a ticket you know I

won't even ask for anonymity but you

know because I think that's forever

gone

but one of the things that I've learned

is that if you just flow into a pattern

of life with people they give you space

to come in that's happened at my kids

school and that place is where I go and

work out you know once people get used

to the fact that you're gonna be there

it's late then it's sort of like it's

over it's like you do it a few times

it's like it's the first lady you know

so I I hope to find a way to seamlessly

work my way into a normal life and it's

gonna take time but I'm gonna slowly

it's gonna happen and we're gonna go

shopping we gonna shop we're gonna shop

in and you will leave here most proud of

you know what truly I am most proud of

my daughter's you know I mean I can I

could go down the list of my initiatives

and we have done a lot changed the way

our kids e we're supported military

families we made that conversation part

of the community the work that we're

doing on girls education will be

something that I do for the rest of my

life this is all work that will continue

it is there those problems won't be

solved in my lifetime but raising two

girls like I said at the beginning when

I sent them off in the car that first

day and they were so little and the the

bulletproof glass was so thick you know

I thought oh my god I just want them to

grow up feeling a sense knowing that

they're loved by us feeling confident

feeling a sense of normalcy feeling a

sense of obligation to do something

outside of themselves just being good

people and we just you know went to

Malia's high school graduation and we're

watching Sasha move her way through high

school and I am very proud of those two

and how they've managed this situation

and how they have continued to be

themselves regular little girls just

trying to figure it out and I'm as all

mothers do you breathe that sigh of

relief that you didn't mess up your kids

and I'm everyday I cross my fingers and

hope that I'm doing right by them and

I'm providing with them with a good

foundation so that they can be great

people so thank you and I just want to

say the way you handled this office the

way you carry yourself have presented

yourself to the United States of America

and the women of the United States of

America and men of the United States of

America reminds me of a line that Maya

used to say it's actually in the

beginning of one of her books she says

you make me proud to spell my name

Michelle Obama and I would

like to add to that I would like to add to that

is Oprah Winfrey you
