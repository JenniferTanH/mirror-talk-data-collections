first question is

and it's the works in the present seem

to speak of what it is to see a moment

not just it's rendering and it's

allusion to photographic dialogue but to

understand this potential dialogue from

the 50 of the camels position and its

potential for serial investigation a

transversal of time order and inevitable

ways of seeing these occurrences with

it's sort of Kwazii cinematic device

could you possibly elaborate on your

views of a momentary fragment for us

somewhere they questioned something

something something so that's cheating

something sent you something more mature

right yeah well my complete for going

back to the question I guess I've guess

what i'm getting at to paraphrase

question i'm not living need my cake

looked in good now I guess what I'm sort

of hinting out about the sort of thing

is uh you know using sort of there's a

sort of cinematic feel to some of the

work in the present which is taken in

part by each fragment II on each moment

that is sort of separated by another the

next moment so it alludes to this

passage of time and how we sort of read

an image were especially a photographic

image and I think we did sort of tend to

think of photographic dialogue is one

image you know when everything that's

around it cinematically offers such

different information so when I say

momentary Fred I'm interested in this

idea how you use a camera from different

moments to do more elaborate on

longer position what a moment actually

is in photographic terms and do you feel

that something that is in an errands of

work I mean is that part of what your

reaches for the present from the state

is definitely a part of the the what

intrigued me interrogation of that David

Sharma just sent me an interesting

article from the New Scientist recently

on how we as sentient beings how we

define them now the present the moment

and I recommend someone to read that

article with it basically it seems that

we have and now two to three sections

and that is that are ongoing time is two

three maybe four seconds is what we

define now is obviously any now energy

becomes past but for us to process for

on the neurological of brain functions

our senses process it lasts about 23

seconds and that's where anything is

that is usually interval of time

anything from from sort of one second to

three seconds in most of the images in

the present you know which we're trying

to discuss what what is the present what

is the what is them now what is our

awareness of it in that way the film

side of the question you're getting at

this is the cinematic side of that I

guess you could ask that about shimmer

as well could a would ask that about

shimmer as well and so it was sort of

longer

investigation of that and I've said this

before but it partly has become it's

become something as easy to focus on

since digital's come to photography

because you tend to look at stuttering

sequences on screen next next next flick

flick flick my god like like a film

editor sitting as a editing table

nudging through the frames the point

where they're going to make the cut of

course that was always there and film

photography that they had it but they

had it on a contact sheet you know they

took many pictures in all this stuff

Katya press only and you look at the

contact sheet she took a lot of pictures

off the same thing it wasn't just the

one and but it just was the in terms of

process looking at a screen being able

to tap them about on sequential e go

through things just help to clarify

those ideas and if I'm recognize it soda

library on the potential of see reality

and you're the way that image is collude

in shimmer possibility for example

suggests a sort of fabricated see

reality of images and moments working

together but each photograph is also

seeing Santa matically as difference to

the audience's perception of each

individual fragment so each image has

character within a longer sort of

sequence or see reality to the to the

overall work so the question being do

these images when displayed in this

manner in particular presented discourse

on the idea of see reality and

perception within the overlord overall

keys yes kind of and I would add the

word consciousness in there a sort of

awareness and copy of awareness or

consciousness of the moment arriving

enveloping you and gently departing as

part of that is the stuttering moments

that you are talking about their form

sort of little nodal points or links you

know along that way in that thing in the

process of recognizing the value of

something the beauty of something the

simplest heating a piece of chicken at a

bus stop or smoking a cigarette you know

cutting the grass or walking shopping

home just recognizing that and somehow

within the work there is also I hope a

sort of instructive quality to it

affected in sense of by defining and

photographing those moments of awareness

those

you know points-- looking at someone's

hands looking at their feet looking at

the rodent problem back to their face

again you you help people appreciate the

process of cognition you know and that's

very vital useful for all of us you know

so isn't it's about it so it's in that

sense it is educational asics am rather

late because it is obviously it's more

than that it's a work of art but there

is an educational or instructive quality

to earth like this is one way to see you

know this is one way to perceive life

and that can't be anything but useful

absolutely I think with within the CEO

talked about for the graphic died when I

don't see sometimes difficult to get

outside of the medium when you talk

about these things but photography for

me by and large has always had this sort

of you know the fixity of being a

singularity and when he started

stressing past that again stuttering

moment thing you know where you've seen

the different maybe that's more what i

mean by cinematic seen different angles

focus points I think that's when you say

education I think to sort of sort of get

people through a moment from different

images within that moment I think that's

quite powerful I don't I don't think

that in terms of perception how we even

sort of deal with photography that is

something that it gets taken for granted

yeah you know that's that's really a way

of you know a way of seeing this sorry

pops key would probably yet entitled it

and we become complacent about the power

and meaning of photography because the

single instant has become so overused

and you know exhausted in some ways it

shouldn't be in these are putting these

refreshing there's no I've got no

problems with this tall and as yet makes

CD images myself most of the time but it

is to be helpful in in refreshing that

you know in refreshing that that value

and imported photography you know as a

medium then great it's definitely an

expansion I think for me that's what's

one of the most important aspects that I

take away from your work is to sort of

teach people that it's not just this

thing but neither is it killing but

driven absolutely neither is it

something still so it isn't the people

who seem to say think I've moved two

steps forward why don't I you know start

jogging in a in a there's a little thing

is still avoids narrative so the boys

storytelling of always all the problems

that come with that with chaining the

world down to a rather simplistic you

know clanking

for you know choo choo train pulling

along telling you a story and it avoids

that which totally did get stuck into

back in the 1950s you know and

thankfully escaped from again but uh you

know so I don't wish to take it across

the video or filmmaking that way

something quite different quite unique

it's also quite a bit different than

what you think about here was a picture

post is that the full story too many

storytelling and but it's difficult to

story photo slower yeah those narratives

were all woven together with different

single pictures is completely different

to what you're proposing when we look at

having open-mindedness about either the

quotidian or the moment within and in

observing it perception again observing

it from a different sort of sort of way

that was exactly a question right that's

right so we get to the next book okay

this is an important one in particular

for display because your display

methodologies incredibly important one

thing you will evolve show

chillin and I think that was shimmer

fire to fight I have this right shimmer

possibility the arrangements the idea of

seeing through the use of display the

process of editing might be must be

quite expensive from the series in the

exit exhibition you had a bob can give

us some insights into how you use a

space display the nuances of the work

how much goes into how to place those

images from floor to ceiling and he's

against Evan I'm so little about just to

correctly that of the ball was in the

main gutter puppet is just the presence

it wasn't pronounced downstairs yeah so

it's just that this new york street

scene set up house where there's some

old film camera pictures but there was

both notion mother it I mean I made up I

created a framework of rules for myself

you know giving me obviously the dip tix

you know a sequence to the court Cryme

Tyme very straightforward in Western the

near reading of left to right when it

was the same exact this is not the right

word but passed and Senate sex set of

players within the frame and they're

just rearranged slightly like some had

drifted out to focus and a new doesn't

come in they were just arranged

horizontally linear fashion when I was

standing the same place and the whole

cast of people had changed but something

you know like adding a postman had been

replaced by a UPS delivery man in

exactly the same positioning they

couldn't see the person anymore then I

slackened vertically so when there was

no concurrency between the imaging

there's no snow I did oh that man there

is neutral that

or this woman is now over here when you

couldn't see that I put them vertical

when you could see it I left horizontal

so that was the simplicity of my little

have made rule so don't know when you're

always disbanded in a sense of time

that's what he snapped we couldn't even

identify just by looking that it was a

certain matter how much time had passed

i stacked vertically I think if you

break that was just because it had to

cut space but yeah the low they were

hung low to the floor towards you make

that flow from the usual of the concrete

of the floor and getting in a gallery or

museum into the sidewalk itself into the

pavement as they say in England just a

tablet languages which is a very nice

effect I like that but at the same time

the pictures one quality of the

photographs as they are the sort of got

that marginalize was there very sharp

medium format digital pictures on the

hook so they sort of achieved this

quality of verisimilitude that a lot of

drivers have chased for a long time ever

dreamed with film being able to wander

around with a large format camera and do

bangkok street photographs freeze in the

world but having every every tiniest

little hair and poor being shown and you

can

with medium format digital that you

could not get you couldn't walk around

with a four by five yeah working order

focus and our way and so once I was

slightly boss by the fabrication or so

down low to the floor can do have a

normal life people actually see that

more no sir no sir no do you think do

you think with that that's an

interesting confident picked up where

this is kind of a banal question of tech

or something but the sort of what we

have now for technologies and you're

explaining in other areas on the face

sort of standing on a picture with

medium format digital and we kind of in

terms of optics or perception

potentially entered into the sort of

hyper reality of looking at images when

you many we don't see that way you know

we don't we just look at a scene we

don't see like that when you get into

aggression on how we see I mean it is

congregated as we see we we see in

shallow focus you know we don't see in

deep focus you know I'm if I'm looking

at you I'm seeing your sharp but the

background is blurred if I focus on the

wall behind you you can return to blur

but take that with most cameras and

people often you know they optically

make sure that everything's in focus so

we've the deep focus is actually an

optical trick worth of certain cameras

and lenses you know it's not so how

received but then you can flip its head

and say anything I choose to look at

will come into focus you know it's where

I choose aliyu you're in photo so i

choose over the background you that's

the coming focus so their photograph

that where everything is in focus is

actually equally bad if you could argue

now I if I choose to you know come walk

closer to you I can see the pores on

your face to get back to the Arctic

point new to me or hear me I can see the

hairs and boards which you choose to

walk up to a photograph question you plz

patent laws so therefore that level of

and to use the word here consult ability

you know in a photograph is actually

accurate in some ways because yes it may

be excessive in terms of the new

technology and digital but it means that

if you choose to want to go and look at

something like that you want to go look

closely like you can life you can do it

you don't hit a wall of grain and poor

resolution you want to go right up to

them stick your nose in each room

picture and see how many high lashes as

best as you more or less over to do it

towards the topic of perception an early

night the white sort of pictures and

it's a system that alludes to blindness

for me it's events a bit attentional

attentional your newsfeed before there's

no pacity of human sites in a sort of

milky iris a blindness which is if maybe

they understand which in terms of

American socio political economics deals

with the idea of the blind eye which in

America in particular treats the the

disparity of classes very particularly

an American Way so when you implement

this you know this white printing if

that's very call it that I'm assuming

that's part of a sort of potential

a metaphor for them for the work and and

how we get this idea of displaying the

blind item will be ours through a

photographic thing about having it

question is a sort of larger

socio-economic issues I think that's a

big part of I imagine I that serious

work yeah yeah I don't want to reduce

these are all very good and accurate

points you're raising I know it's not

like there is one key that you know yes

it's about blindness and it's only about

not because it is obviously principally

you know when the principal concerns is

is the psychological or willful

invisibility and blindness or

invisibility of the poor dispossess in

the United States and it does that is

obviously one of the key things but also

in other ways about the landscape of

America you know so why should I insist

it's just about this one thing and say

that those pictures of houses and the

suburban white out things and the

inner-city da creatures are also about

the landscape as they are there's also a

scientific value when we consider the

American night images sort of looking

into this idea of rhodopsin rhodopsin

being a biological pigment in

photoreceptor cells of the retina

they're extremely sensitive to light

enable envision in low light conditions

exposed to light up in yet pigmented

medial photo bleaches that's where they

use photo bleach

sort of wording it takes about 45

minutes to regenerate fully in humans as

you investigative phenomenon of relapse

and in terms of future making or no no

it doesn't surprise we say they're nice

as what's interesting about that is very

much mirrors work the way the digital

photo sites work you know if they get

hit with lights they think they feel

they're considered little wells that

fill the delight and at a certain point

therefore if they've been hit good light

and they have to be refreshed and the

camera has to reset itself you know the

very sight and how how refresh rate can

happen or how I'm burnt out it becomes

we will see an old TV cameras that were

the filming life of a sudden again

blinded by glare and you see it taken a

few seconds for the site to reset which

is very similar to one of the ways i

stumbled across that way of working was

walking out of a movie theater in mid

afternoon fire one of the side doors you

know those emergency exits in Memphis

and walking out into blinding sunlight

and coming from a darkened you know our

half two hours in a darkened room out

into you know Memphis brilliant middle

name sunshine was completely

overwhelming and you have that optical

burn out for the rhodopsin that either

it was my rhodopsin was for English am

leading regeneration and come where we

squint your eyes in C and he can't he

can hardly see at the same time working

out and the Sun staggering across the

car park in front of me there and

they're realizing this is a pretty

amazing visual experience you know

something that could perhaps easily

fairly easily be imitated in a

photograph photographic representation

sort of value based systems led by

perceived notions of truth in a document

form what is your position on the

validity of such arguments for momentary

truth in photography do you believe in

photographic representation of for

photographic relativism is largely

meaningful deposited leak illusion I

think we believe in multiple truths

really any moment and that photographs

suffer when they're chained down to

illustrating a single truth you know a

single dogmatic position my life which

doesn't believe that he can't you can't

do something useful when you do do that

but they often suffer from it the more

I've gone on with the trophy the less

useful i found it to chain my work to a

single intention or value that i set up

and maintained you know

so the trophy that interest me arch I

struggle to make myself it does have

multiple readings and multiple truths

within it you know and it grows and I've

been around long enough to know I look

back at work which I thought was about

one thing has become about another you

know or another quality of it the beyond

caring issues which should probably the

most dogmatic ones i did of unemployment

offices in in England during the time

mrs. Thatcher seemed to be about one

single thing and now they've almost

become about that they've become about

multiple other things they've become

about that era did not only about

unemployment at that exact time but

about that era about the 1980s they've

become historical artifacts rather than

angry screed against Thatcherism and

unemployment so it's it's often limiting

to taiyou down to a single you know

viewpoint of this is one single truth

one single version of reality you said

that our lives are not made of disasters

in car crashes there a humdrum and a

cotillion to which you though when you

need

let's set the tableau of a scene exert

some life into a grand scale and

photograph and photographs either by

serious or scale the size of things that

say do not in effect magnify and

embellish the quotidian reality into a

sort of realist history painting favored

by me Laker bay and so on so that the

non-rotating and the magnificent or a

sublime are in fact something we react

to when we see the photograph printed

large or in a scale to become to me for

the scaling of your images they go sort

of from this quotidian into the sublime

sort of territory I think the best

example of that children has is the

pictures and burn age pictures I did

which aren't in this pho course but of

young people in clubs and bars in Europe

jr. 20 years ago and those are very

casual snapshotting pictures you know

very hairy with often with so-called

errors in them you negative out of focus

or blur or lights you know not color

corrected red eyes sometimes and they

will blown up very large you know bigger

than life size and pieces of I think

they're like 60 x 80 inches or something

like that in the frames maybe a bit less

and I guess part of what you are trying

to do at that point is take the mundane

the overlooked the vernacular snapshot

picture and printed beautifully large

frame very carefully and you're saying I

know this looks like an ordinary

amateurish badly focused picture the

look at the fact that I printed this

vehicle of the fact I presented it taken

a lot of care a lot of effort more

energy to complete this and surety of

this size and scale there is something

worth looking at worth considering about

life however every day to how much this

doesn't seem like a professional

photograph it does speak about our lives

and who we are our condition so I think

a lot of them message in large-scale

photography or told me that seeks to you

know seeks to stun you with in some ways

that list is to take you out of that

comfort zone where you can place a

little candid snapshot we expect it to

be you know four by six black and white

and you might value that and love it and

feticide then that's great but when

you're taking a contemporary picture

knowingly about the quotidian Lee every

day something that is easily overlooked

that we wouldn't or most people would

not get the camera out about you have to

somehow make you a Zeta no this is not a

mistake it's not an accident it is

important look again size scale sequence
