I get my sense of spirituality through

connection and what Twitter represents

is spiritual to me tapping into the

consciousness the larger organism

whether it be the plan at the universe

the social consciousness is what drives

me there's a lot of power to seeing you

know how people think in ways that make

us feel great and also things that are

super uncomfortable because we need to

be able to ignore in person or have a

conversation about it and there is no

other path towards evolution and making

something better unless we can talk

about it that's Jack Dorsey and this is

the retro podcast

the rich roll podcast hey everybody how

you guys doing what's happening my name

is rich roll I am your host this is my

podcast and today my guest is Jack

Dorsey jack is the co-founder and CEO of

both Twitter and square and somebody who

I think it's fair to say quite

incontrovertibly has become one of the

most influential figures of the modern

age somebody who has made this crazy

indelible impact on the cultural

landscape by really helping shape the

way that we communicate as a culture

Jack has been doing the podcast rounds

lately he's had recent appearances on a

wide variety of shows including sam

harris two appearances on Joe Rogan Ben

Greenfield the other day and several

more and I listened to all of them and I

realized that jack is a polarizing

figure for many but on a personal level

I have to say I found him to be quite

transparent somebody who has been open

about Twitter's failures the challenges

that he and his organization have faced

continue to face as well as incredibly

composed under the pressure of being

held accountable for his platforms

shortcomings and my sense is that his

response to many of the hard questions

that are being posed to him that have

been being posed to him on all of these

podcasts and interviews have left a lot

of critics feeling unsatisfied and I

guess what I want to say is that if you

are such a person one of these people

then I'm not sure this podcast is gonna

change that view because my interest was

less on retreading the territory that

was explored at length on Rogen nor was

it an attempt to hold him to account in

the way that Tim Poole did on Joe show

instead or rather my intention for this

conversation was simply to better

understand this human behind the curtain

in other words what does it actually

feel like to be

at the helm of one of the largest and

most powerful social media platforms on

the planet what is a day in the life of

jack dorsey looked like and what daily

self-care practises does he employed a

mitigate the stress of his

responsibilities and just how did this

young man blaze such an incredible

extraordinary entrepreneurial path it's

these kind of questions that inform how

I approached this conversation I first

met Jack about two years ago and because

he had tweeted out a few episodes of the

podcast I knew he was at least an

occasional listener of this show so when

I found myself in San Francisco I deemed

him to see if he wanted to meet up and

he invited me to square the square

headquarters and what I discovered when

I met him was a person quite different

than what you might imagine he was

sitting on an open staircase by himself

with a cup of tea at the far end of this

giant open floor plan office space he

told me he doesn't even have a proper

office and I just found this person to

be very soft-spoken kind curious and I

guess I realized that that this is

somebody who is an animal altogether

different from the typical alpha startup

CEO mold and I liked him instantly and

although our encounter was brief Jack

left me kind of intrigued I wanted to

better understand who he is and what led

him to this rarefied air and really what

makes him tick so when he began showing

up on all these podcasts I reached out

to him he invited me to his home in San

Francisco and and this is where it got

really interesting unsurprisingly he has

a beautiful home it's very well

appointed but what was surprising was

its modesty considering his essentially

unlimited resources it's very minimal

almost Spartan there's no entourage it's

no private chef he cooks his own meals

no you know there's no Lamborghini

collection there wasn't even an

assistant there was just Jack completely

unpretentious barefoot excited to show

me his Inn

at sauna is cold plunge the kitchen

counter where he works from a tunnel a

couple days a week you know all in all a

man who is very intentionally and

mindfully stripped excess materialism

and distraction away from his life

somebody who prioritizes solitude

contemplation meditation he meditates at

least an hour a day and a whole wide

variety of self-care practices all

designed to optimize deep thinking and

equanimity including the fact that he

walks five miles to work every single

day and I guess what I'm trying to say

is I found his intentionality that he

brings to his life is discipline his

curiosity his presence of mine I found

it all admirable he's a truly truly

fascinating guy living a very unusual

life so this conversation is really an

exploration of that life we do cover how

Twitter was conceived the

responsibilities of logistics the

challenges involved in shaping and

policing the behemoth platform that sees

about 500 million tweets every day and

how he envisions the evolution of this

platform the impact of Twitter on

culture and how he would ultimately kind

of close a conversation with how he

would disrupt and innovate the podcast

space and his answer is very interesting

on that point but mostly this was just

my attempt to understand Jack and some

of the habits practices and strategies

that he employs including the opposite

of meditation intermittent fasting so

many more things to navigate his most

uncommon life as one of the most

influential figures of our time final

note because it took place at Jack's

home we did not video this program and

you might hear a little crackling in the

background it's because we were sitting

at the forefront like next to his

fireplace so we had a live fire as we

discussed it it was all very nice so

this is me and Jack Dorsey

thank you for inviting me to your home

thanks for taking time on a Saturday

Saturday afternoon it's raining outside

we're sitting by a crackling fire in a

code who we are in the cloud I feel like

I'm in Big Sur overlooking the ocean

here so if you hear waves crashing or

seagulls or the crackling of the fire

over here that kind of just should

create a visual palette so where we are

right now and we just did a little

meditation five-minute meditation to set

the stage which was great

I feel good feel good me too so I think

that's a natural segue into talking a

little bit about meditation in your life

I know you've been meditating for like

twenty years and it's something that is

important to you so what is what is the

practice look like for you yeah I um I

started playing with meditation about 20

years ago it wasn't that serious and I

think the the the most I you know I

actually practiced within that time

frame was you know probably 20-30

minutes and wasn't really aware of a lot

of the theories and some of the the

focus that I needed until about two

years ago when I went to my first event

possum of course I went to this little

town just south of Dallas and did a ten

day silent meditation retreat and it was

one of the hardest but also one of the

most rewarding things I've ever done and

one of the practices of impasto is to do

one of these retreats every year but

also to carry through with your practice

you do two hours a day one hour in the

morning one hour in the evening before

before bed and the I mean what it's what

it's done for me is is really just a

sense of clarity certainly certainly

want to focus certainly one of

recognizing when I'm reacting to some

which has this you know momentum of not

feeling necessarily in control but as I

did it you know at the end of last year

I just went even deeper into that

clarity and was you know instantly

reminded of the year prior and you you I

had this experience where I just felt

like I was picking up where I where he

left off and that was really powerful to

me so for me every single day it's a

time to build self-awareness and that's

what it comes down to yeah it's

something I've been interested in doing

for some time yet I have yet to go -

yeah attending one of those retreats

they're scary yeah well I know it I have

plenty of friends who have done it and

from what I understand it's it's around

that day five day six area that you get

into you know that make-or-break period

where you start to freak out Dave for is

really hard because you go into this

mode called strong determination and up

until day four you're basically focusing

on your breath and it's not just the

concept of the breath it's actually the

physical sensation of the breath it's a

physical sensation of the breath on your

upper lip and through your nostrils and

that was a huge unlock for me but on day

four you go into the impasto training

and strong determination which means

that you are encouraged not to move at

all

you you you know you're sitting in a

lotus or a half Lotus position and you

shouldn't be shifting around or moving

your posture and then your way

whatsoever and that becomes extremely

challenging but also a good reflection

into what the practice actually is

because you'll at least for me my

experience was you know my legs were

just killing me i the the urge to move

is is almost unbearable and through that

through observing that pain and choosing

deciding not to react to it you apply

that concept in that methodology to

everything to emotions to physical pain

to mental hardships and and being able

to recognize it I'm on it and train it

you know for those next few days is uh

is is really powerful but day six was my

worst day the morning I was a you know I

looked I you meditate with other people

but you know you're not allowed to talk

you're not allowed to read to write to

do any physical exercise to look anyone

in the eye

it's the conditions are such that you

feel like you're on a retreat by

yourself and on day six I cannot kind of

looked around in the hall and everyone

just looked like a Buddha base they all

they all look like they were they were

already enlightened it I got it I heard

out I don't get this I like I I'm not

I'm not getting it but at the end of day

six you do these discourses at the end

where there's some insight into the

theory and and a little bit into the

practice and something the teacher said

just unlock something for me so the last

meditation of the day at 9:00 p.m. or

8:30 was um was one of my best and I

walked out and I just felt so much peace

and so much joy and I cried and then I

fell asleep and I walked back up at four

in the morning and was back into the

pain back into not understanding what I

was doing which again is part of the

practice where you you you can't hang on

something you can't react overly to

something that's negative and you can't

react overly to something that's

positive either you want have a calamity

between in in in in the entire spectrum

right and something about becoming an

observer of that pain or that discomfort

or that jubilation creating some

distance between yourself and that

experience I think is where the

teachable moment where you can kind of

mind that equanimity absolutely right

yeah absolutely and you know it's just

ten days of working from 4:00 in the

morning until 9:30 mm-hmm focused

entirely on that in real

you you won't get it right away and it's

just this that the most important thing

is is the is the practice of it not

reaching any particular milestone or

state it's just that constant practice

so you stepped it up this year and you

went to Myanmar you know to do as

opposed to Texas for another silent

meditation retreat and on your return

from that experience you decided to

share this and in a threaded tweet what

your experience was and that like became

like a thing there were a lot of people

that jumped on you for not addressing

the atrocities of the government when

you know I it was interesting because I

read it and I I felt like you were just

sharing this experience that you had it

was it was certainly in a political you

know motivation behind that but I guess

when you're jack you have to be much

more mindful about yeah you choose your

words and and how you decide to describe

these experiences yeah I am so after my

first meditation in Texas first I met

you know this amazing teacher there and

that Goenka know not going to go Inca

passed away I ever maybe maybe even ten

years ago and so he has all these

assistant teachers that lead you through

the the courses and I met one of the

assistant teachers and became friends

with him and you know I was talking

about going you know doing where should

I do my next meditation and we discussed

Myanmar Burma because that is where

Kalinka is from that is where a lot of

the practice that I was practicing has

been kept in a very pure form in terms

of the the writings but also the the

physical practice and after my first

meditation in Texas I had one tweet and

I just I didn't feel I was ready to to

talk about it I didn't feel it was

appropriate because I don't I didn't

feel I had experienced enough to the

depth that I I could communicate in a

way that resonated with people

mm-hmm but after this after the second

retreat in Myanmar I felt I felt more

ready it was um it was completely

different I mean it was I went in a day

before into into Myanmar I immediately

went to the center and we started

meditating and I I left two days after

and I I was there as Jack not

representing square or Twitter I was

there to focus on myself because I think

one of the most important things I

believe that I have a responsibility to

both our employees and also the people

that we we serve on on the on the

platforms is self-improvement constant

self-improvement I've identified this as

at least this practice is something that

makes me a lot stronger a lot more

resilient a lot more aware and able to

approach my work with a lot more clarity

and discipline so I went because of the

you know the the practice is lineage

within within that within that country

and within that people and within the

culture and wasn't really thinking

enough about the surrounding

circumstances of the country and the

people and you know I think the the

misstep was not even addressing that

focusing entirely on meditation that was

my intent which was to focus this

entirely on my my experience and if it

resonates with people it does if it

doesn't it doesn't and you know I think

it it did resonate with folks but there

was there was an ask to just be more

aware of the surroundings shine more

light on that and and I I get all that

that the benefit is I did have a lot of

social groups reach out to me

immediately after and folks come to me

to at least

converse about you know what is

happening and what has changed and there

are multiple atrocities within the

country not not just the one that it's

tend to be focused on yeah yeah so I've

learned since you know a bunch of the

dynamics and and and you know some other

ways I might be able to help but I'm

still I'm still and uh I'm still in the

learning phase where you know just where

can I actually apply myself and and and

help and and drive more the conversation

within the within the country so it

touched me and it it's something that I

will definitely be top of mind for for

quite some time but I think it was but

it was important for next time yeah it

was important for me to also see that in

person and experience in person rather

than read it through text Sarita through

the the major media channels and see the

people and one of the biggest surprises

I had was every single monk I saw every

every nun I ran into had a had a cell

phone and Facebook is the Internet

it's similar to you know when back in

the day when AOL was the internet for

many people it wasn't about a web

browser it was you know the way in was

was AOL and and Facebook was that for

for nearly everyone in the in the

country you didn't you don't see URLs

you don't see website addresses you see

Facebook pages and it's just so dominant

and I didn't have that understanding and

I don't think I would have the depth of

understanding unless I actually went

there and experienced it myself

and what do you extract from that the

fact that you know Facebook is the

internet they're like what you know what

is that vote for the future what does

that mean having um having grown up with

the internet in st. Louis Missouri I was

a hacker early on and in my life you

know 12 13 14 and save us had this

thriving

hacker community and it was a you know

it had a lot of the punk ethos had a lot

of the technology through later had a

bunch of the hip-hop ethos in terms of

just questioning everything working in

public sharing everything sharing all

the mistakes not being centralized at

all

I think there's elements that are that

are certainly dangerous to that I am

definitely skeptical of centralized

organizations even my own even Twitter

and square you know I think the internet

more than anything else has allowed us

to remove so many barriers and

boundaries that can tend to be

artificial and and and this promise of

at least providing the framework and the

infrastructure

towards a understanding of a of one

humanity like we have the technology to

do this and it started in 1979 and the

ideals just get stronger and stronger

and stronger so starting with a more

decentralized medium and and you know

the recent flow towards more

centralization such as Google and

YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and

square is something I'm very very

cognizant of and also i I don't discount

the the power and and also the

skepticism and lack of trust that people

have in organizations like ours so I

think on the positive it does breed a

healthy skepticism and distrust which i

think is useful to push companies like

ours to be a lot more open and pushed

towards more towards more Internet

ideals but there's certainly a hard road

to get there but I I would want to see a

place like Mia Mar to have more entry

points

than just Facebook obviously right at

the same time they've gotten a lot of

people on who were not on before and and

on the network and I think we have to

weigh the trade-offs of you know that

getting people on the on-ramp into this

global network and and the custodian

that does it and then hopefully hold

organizations like my own to account in

terms of making sure that they see all

the pathways in and out and and have

optionality right

I feel like this you know desire to hold

yourself and and your companies to to

account for this is sort of part and

parcel of this you know for lack of a

better phrase like podcast or that

you've been on lately

you know out of the blue all of a sudden

you've made yourself available to talk

to all manner of people you've been on

tons of shows no no no I don't know a

lot I mean you did one yesterday crypto

one yesterday I know you've done Sam

Harris Joe Rogan I think you're going

back to talk to Joe you did Bill Simmons

clearly there's a conscious decision

here too to step out and share your

perspective in a transparent way and my

sense of this is that you've done that

with a large degree of equanimity

I think the equanimity was seen in that

exchange with Kara Swisher where you did

that experiment and conversation by

doing it on Twitter you maintained your

cool under fire like I in that I saw

meditation coming to the front in the

way that you managed all of that but

just the fact that you're making

yourself available for these

conversations I find interesting and so

I think the first I have two questions

on that the first is you know what is

you know what was behind this decision

to do this and and you know right now

yeah I I mean I have a I've had a few

goals with us one I'm a student of

conversation and Twitter's purpose in

the world is to serve the public

conversation and in the

light I am aware that I'm absolutely

terrible at at it and I am vibrator that

why do you say that well I you know I

was um when I was a kid I had a speech

impediment and I went through a lot of

speech therapy I couldn't pronounce most

words I just sound like gibberish was

coming out of my mouth and to some

people that still may be the case but I

I really hold back because of that

awareness that I was dysfunctional in

some way in communicating with people

and I became extremely shy I've always

been an introvert meaning that I get

most of my energy from solitude versus

actually works getting a lot of their

energy from being around people so I die

naturally at that predisposition towards

being more quiet and being more in

solitude but that really pushed me into

a very very shy place where you know

even conversations my parents and

brothers were were somewhat limited and

eventually I realized it in fifth or

sixth grade and I just said like I can't

function like this and they joined the

speech club and I joined the debate club

and I did the things I just freak to

freak me out but that's still that's

still lingers you know I still AM hyper

aware of how I'm talking and you know

just a little bit of uncomfort in my own

skin and conversation but I wanna I

think I think my the characteristics

that have made me realize some of the

milestones I want in my life and some of

the excess success I've realized is that

I will put myself in very uncomfortable

situations I will be patient with myself

and I will learn super fast so I I felt

number one that podcasting was a great

way to do that it's something I'm a huge

consumer of I you know my walks in the

morning it's

what I listen to it's it's when I take

the most joy in and in the morning and I

just get so much so much out of them

that I also wanted to understand the

format much more directly and then

second we we don't talk enough out in

the open about what we're seeing how

we're thinking why and we do that in you

know articles and and the traditional

press but there's something about

podcasting to me that just allows much

much more nuance and just some time to

breathe and and I think the thing I

enjoy certainly compared to Twitter

we'll talk about the irony that that

that you're gun-shy about conversation

when you know facilitating conversation

is the core you know foundational goal

of Twitter itself I yeah I don't know if

it's the gun shy that I feel I just I

know that um I know I want to master it

and I I wanna I want to get really great

at it and I know I have a long way to go

not just in conversations like this but

also personally as well if I could study

one thing that also serves my company

given our role than amazing

so I you know I I think the the thing I

love most about podcasts going back to

my introvert misses conversations like

this where you can actually hear the

silence between thoughts and like just

the the amount of time that people take

to think and there's just so much

fatality within that silence that I find

intriguing and interesting and there's

just a rhythm that I'm trying to

understand and and in a master as well

so so that's a big part of it a lot of

it this year has has you know honestly

been you know somewhat reactive people

we've we've we don't have a strategist

in terms of like who we've been talking

to who I've been talking to

a lot of folks have been asking me for

quite some time and I pushed it off and

just been kind of going down the queue

and and and I'm also you know happy to

meet a bunch of the folks that I listen

to all the time like I'm I'm going to be

going on Ben green fields pretty soon

and I listen to every single one of its

podcasts and and I think I learned so

much from him and I so I'm excited

personally just to just get into it with

him I have no idea what we'll talk about

because he is so health health focused

it's gonna be so I would imagine be

really granular on like your date you

know daily practices yeah which I'm also

excited to talk about because I don't I

don't get to talk about that a lot with

the exception of my friends and some of

my co-workers who just think I'm the

weirdest person in the world well we're

gonna get into it a little bit probably

not to the extent that Ben well but I

think that that you know your

observations are correct I mean in many

ways I see podcasts as an antidote to

what ails Twitter because it provides

that space for nuance and I think

anybody is hard pressed to walk away

from a conscientious mature mindful

long-form podcast between two people

even if you completely disagree with

that person's worldview it's almost like

because we're empathetic creatures were

able to see the shared humanity and I

think that's something that that that

Twitter just isn't built for yeah ways I

want to you know I want us to figure

this out cuz I I think I don't think

it's just voice or video that creates

empathy I'd text certainly can create

the same I think we have not unlocked

that from an experience standpoint from

a pacing standpoint I think we've

provided exactly the wrong incentives on

the on the service and what I mean by

that is when you open up the app what

are we inherently telling you to do

implicitly you know what what are you

what are we getting you through the

arrangement

of the buttons through the numbers and

the metrics that we provide we're giving

people guidelines in terms of what they

should optimize for and I think right

now they're completely wrong like you

know we we made a decision quite some

time ago to make the size of your your

follower count bold and big on your

profile page and we have this like

button

we have retweet we haven't really opined

on the ordering of those of those

actions and and what what that means so

when we when we built this you know we

we discovered these features and these

gaps and then we put them on the

interface and I don't think we gave it

enough consideration because we didn't

have we didn't have this focus on this

on this purpose of conversation there

was some of it was reactive to our peers

some of it was looking at good ideas

over there and putting it in in our

service but we're taking time now to

step back and say like how do we truly

serve a public conversation not just

people posting not people posting quick

takes or hot takes or outrage but like

how do we how do we incentivize more

contribution that is healthy to the

network and and and this is a concept

that we're really spending a lot of time

thinking about is this concept of

conversational health and what that

means and it's one of the reasons I'm

I'm fascinated for my own personal

health and why I get into all the

practices like meditation that I do is

because I feel that there is something

to being able to understand when a

conversation is healthy or not and I

know it because like we've all had we've

all had conversations that feel toxic

and you just want to walk away from it

we've had conversations that feel really

empowering and inspiring and you you

wish they lasted for hours and hours and

hours and if if we can if we can feel

that I feel we can also quantify it

enough

that we can understand at scale what

these things look like and and what what

actions have the greatest potential to

create more of them and so right now

we're just you know we're in this phase

where we're trying to understand what it

means to measure whether an online

digital conversation is healthy or not

and so what are the technological

parameters by which you would adjudicate

the health of a conversation we're we

started with probably the best way to

articulate this is is the body metaphor

and you know we we have all these

indicators of health on our body one is

you know just the flush nests of your

face the other is your body temperature

and you know this internal body

temperature should be a should be 98.6

Fahrenheit and if it's above that or

below that it indicates that something

is out of balance it doesn't say what

but it indicates that probably something

is in out of out of imbalance and we

built this tool called a thermometer to

measure that indicator and then based on

that reading we can start diagnosing

solutions and you know I I could read

that your your temperature is really

high and I can give you a glass of water

hot water with lemon in it and say based

on all of our experience I don't know

all of our research if you drink this

there's a higher probability that it

will bring your system back into balance

at least this particular indicate

indicator faster than this red wine that

I'm about to Andrew and then you have a

choice do I

do I take this or this red wine which

based on all of our evidence all of our

research all of our experiences creates

a probability that probably extends the

amount of time that your system is in

balance so you can you can push that to

the digital and then it's you know it's

what are the indicators of

conversational health so we have four

stakeholder indicators that we've shared

with the world that we're we're working

to understand

how to measure right now like we're

working to build the thermometers for

these indicators number one is shared

attention how much of the conversation

is attentive to the same things versus

on disparate things

number two is shared reality are we is

this you know is this conversation

sharing the same facts or are they

different facts like an example as a way

of judging how siloed a certain

conversation exactly like so it's not to

find truth it's not to find what is

factual or what is not factual but just

like what facts are people using and

what percentage of the conversation is

using this fact basis versus another one

so a recent example is you know the

round earth versus the Flat Earth right

conversation so 99.999% of this

conversation is using a fact that the

earth is round whereas where as a small

percentage he's using a fact that the

world is flat so healthier conversation

will be sharing more facts mmm so that's

number two number three is receptivity

so how receptive are the participants to

engaging in a civil way and debate and

dialogue and finally is variety of

perspective is it a high variety of

perspective or is it a filter bubble or

echo chamber and these four ideally as

they go higher conversation is very

healthy so you want you know presence

and attention you want to be sharing the

same facts to have a debate around them

you want both to be receptive if you

want a variety of a opinion and

perspective so that we can build off

each other and and and so that we can

iterate but we also realize that if you

do something to increase one it might

have a negative impact on another so you

know you might increase variety of

perspective by bringing more

perspectives into the conversation and

by doing so you might decrease shared

reality or you might decrease shared

attention so just like the temperature

of your

there are other indicators of health

that have some sort of connection and

while your your body temperature might

go into balance other indicators like

the flushing that your skin might get

aggravated more so then how do you take

that information that you aggregate and

build tools that facilitate conversation

to move in that direction I mean that's

that's the you know the hard part yeah

so so so an example is you know one we

need to identify if these are the right

indicators we do so by actually building

the measurement tools to get it somewhat

of a baseline measurement and we're not

doing this alone we're doing it with

external parties as well

researchers MIT cortical labs define the

first four indicators and they're

actually doing it not just for Twitter

but for talk radio podcasting as well to

measure that the percentage of

conversations there and as we build in

understanding baseline of the other

measurement then we can start deploying

solutions and we can watch how it

deviates from the baseline so an example

of a solution might be we have all these

people sharing links sharing articles

and I might share an article from Fox

News or New York Times and I might share

that article and have my own kind of

view on this like saying a tweet of this

article is spot-on or this is completely

off the mark and this all the reasons

why one of the things we experimented

with is when we see those articles

shared to bring up other tweets that

might have different perspectives as

indicated by the text that they're

sharing on top of the URL and you know

you you might you might then see for the

same article for the same link to

different perspectives on it and there's

some research to indicate that that

emboldened people into their views

there's other research to indicate that

that elites

gets people thinking about what their

viewpoint means and and how that evolved

so that that's just one experiment and

the way we can run that and then we can

look at how it affects some of those

metrics at scale we're super early on in

this another one is a the brexit

conversation you know the only tool that

and this kind of gets to the core

fundamentals of the service we only give

you the ability to follow an account so

if you were a vote lever you're probably

following folks like Boris and and Nigel

and and related accounts very very few

people and they're mainly journalists

follow accounts that have a completely

different perspective than themselves

very few people watch CNN and then

immediately flip to Fox News

mm-hmm just to get the other other

theater and and the other movie that's

that's playing on this on that on the

same reality so if you follow only those

people you're probably only getting

reasons to leave but if you were to do a

little bit more work and you saw the

vote leave hash tag vote leave trending

and you tap into that you'll see 99% on

conversation reasons to leave but you

might see 1% of reasons to stay and in

that key in that case at least there is

some potential to see a different

perspective and sees diversity of

opinion but we make that so hard for

people you can't follow a hashtag today

you can't even get into that

conversation where there is even an

element of variety of perspective so

those are the things we're looking at if

we allow someone to follow a hashtag or

follow a topic does that increase

variety of perspective does it increase

shared reality does it increase shared

attention or does it diminish those

things

yeah it's that extra step that you have

to do right now I mean if you go to

what's trending and you click on a

hashtag you're gonna see in general my

experiences you'll see a smattering of

different perspectives on that issue but

if you could follow an issue with an ad

like at you know issue X and then your

feed would be propagated with different

person

Actives on that issue it would break the

chains of the silo effect that's

creating so much toxicity but I think it

also it it means that you have an

optimistic perspective on the

malleability of a human of a human

psychology oh yeah I mean that because

people are bringing in a lifetime of

experience that has formed a certain

perspective and just because you're

gonna pepper that feed with a smattering

of different views doesn't mean that

it's gonna change that person's

worldview totally maybe it shouldn't I

don't know and I don't know if that's

your responsibility but certainly there

is a you know a level of toxicity right

now on on your platform that I know

you're endeavoring to address but these

are very difficult problems to overcome

yeah and I I don't think it's our

responsibility to change their view I do

think it's our responsibility set up the

circumstances where if they choose to

look outside their own view or to add to

their view or challenge their own view

that it's easy to do so right now it's

extremely difficult and and and we saw

this in 2016 2015 leading up to the

election

this you know this MIT cortical lab put

out a put out of a infographic that

showed you know a number of the

journalists on the Left

left end of the spectrum we're not

following folks on the right whereas

folks on the right were following folks

on the left and you see these huge

siloed concentrations of people on the

Left who are just feeding themselves

with stories around what's going to

happen whereas folks on the right and

the spectrum work we're seeing

everything and these are just

journalists these are journalists right

and journalists by and large are gonna

be people that are more likely to follow

a difference of opinion typically but in

leading up to the u.s. election

according to the graph they were not

right they were certainly not enough and

I mean to me the most dangerous thing

about what we've done as a service is to

incentivize more of these echo chambers

and filter bubbles and not give people

tools to at least change the probability

that they would see more right and and

that I think you know can embolden a lot

more toxicity can embolden a lot more of

the bad faith actors who intend to

disrupt which we saw certainly leading

up but but you know Twitter will be 13

years old in March and we've we've

probably seen this throughout our

lifetime and a lot of it has to do with

you know we've we made a system that

people have figured out how to how to

game and and we we haven't had enough

punitive actions with the exception of

this very binary decision of leave up or

take down and and that that very binary

action is just not enough it's not

nuanced enough especially if you take a

broader view on humanity and you believe

in the concepts of rehabilitation or

redemption or you know at least showing

people you know the path towards health

and greater participation in the in the

same sense of like giving people the

choice of drinking the water or the wine

when they're sick we we don't do that we

you know we have this very very blunt

tool of leave up or or remove mm-hmm at

the same time the acceleration with

which you know sophisticated well

financed entities are weaponizing the

platform is only going to increase and

you know I think there's an analogy to

doping in sports in the sense that you

know the doping the sophistication of

the doping is always a step or two ahead

of the policing body's ability to detect

right so the entity is always playing

catch-up to what's ahead

and it seems like that's a similar game

that's afoot here totally in in the

technology world the metaphor would be

security so right now I forget the exact

quote but Edgar Allen Poe brought this

up quite some time ago where you know he

he believed he was able to build a

cryptographic puzzle that no one could

crack and quickly learn that anything

that one person can design another

person can break down right and security

probably at a surface level is

considered to you know your your goal

might be one of perfection a cure a

purely perfect system that no one can

break into but the reality of it is the

mindset should be one of constant

observation learning and improving you

you want to taste stay ten steps ahead

of your of your attackers and the way

you do so is by really looking at

patterns of how they are testing the

system and attacking the system and when

you find them iterate a few steps ahead

and then share all your findings so the

whole community can get much better and

you you just take out that that one

potential potential vector so so on that

rubric how would you grade Twitter's

performance on that very human very poor

because I think for the majority of our

lifetime you know we were fairly

mechanical and our approach to

technology we were not utilizing machine

learning and deep learning to lift some

of the burden certainly from our own

folks who have to enforce all of our

rules but also lifting the burden from

the victims like our our system right

now it's just not fair you know our our

system works entirely on if I'm a victim

of abuse I report that someone just

harass me or docks me or whatnot and

then we entirely dependent upon

reporting yeah we do not scalable it's

impossible

to monitor that not scalable but

ultimately not fair why should the

victim have that burden and so we we

weren't able to even consider removing

that because we just weren't as

sophisticated with machine learning and

deep learning as we are now so now our

number one goal along this health factor

is proactive monitoring of our systems

so that we can catch some of these

things before someone even has to report

it and there's a variety of tools that

we can use to enforce whether it be

asking people to remove tweets temporary

suspensions all the way to the to the

worst option which is you know a

permanent suspension which ultimately

you know over time we we shouldn't feel

great about like we we weren't able to

rehabilitate we weren't able to

incentivize and show people why healthy

approaches and behaviors and

participation would increase their reach

or increase the value they got out of

the service so so that ultimately is

where we want to get to but we're right

now we're focused on number one like how

do we this is another thing I don't

think our industry does enough of is we

haven't really admitted the connection

between the digital world and the

physical world and there's a lot that

happens on Twitter that I think we could

scope entirely to online and we'd miss

everything else that's happening offline

or wedded those offline ramifications so

meaning things like daxing or we're

talking digital harm really becomes yeah

helpful reality so that so the number

one thing we want to protect now is

someone's physical safety so it sounds a

little bit odd for a predominantly

digital company to say that we should be

focused on protecting

equal safety but it has real

manifestations someone daxing which is

sharing private information about

someone's physical location or phone

number or email address puts a person in

you know of some physical jeopardy

safety jeopardy and at least raises the

potential so could we can can we

recognize when those when those

occurrences happen in real time and and

prevent it and if we can do that and

that's a tightly scoped problem then we

can extend it to more and more of the

cases that we see every single day

especially what women on our platform

experience on a daily basis and so we

want to get to a something that is

really measurable that has impact on you

know someone's real-world physical life

and then tie it back to what we're doing

online and I just think as an industry

we need to focus more on that connection

between the physical and the and the

online and and and and show the show the

progress we you know we we talk a lot

about this but we we we really have to

show it so now that we have a lot more

sophistication around machine learning

and artificial intelligence we can

automate a lot more of this but a big

part of us progressing in the right way

is scoping it so that we can really make

the problem very very small get some

sort of success or at least a path to

our success there and then and then

brought it out right so you've been

going on all these podcasts and talking

a lot of people about these problems and

and and how you're attempting to you

know wrap your brain trust around how to

solve them and the early stages of

actually solving them do you think that

like like what's your sense of how this

campaign is going like is this working I

I mean I don't know I don't know that it

is and yet let me just say this and then

I'll let you talk I have this sense that

you're in an impossible situation

because

you're coming on or you're coming on

line and you're talking about these

things and I feel like you're being very

transparent and very earnest about it

and very thoughtful but you're not

giving people that answers that they

like the answers are just not inherently

satisfying right or or the time line is

off or something and so people are left

feeling like they're not getting a

direct response like you've been accused

of being evasive I don't think you're

being evasive

but perhaps people are just wanting to

see the results more quickly like how

are you thinking about this or what's

your sense well this is going first and

foremost we have to realize that we have

to we have to show not tell and my goal

here is not to my goal here is not to

first of all I don't consider this a

campaign you know I yeah I I think it's

important that we have conversations in

public and that we we show our thinking

and we I I want to I want to bring up

ideas in public that people can push

against and I want to hear the feedback

and I want to I want to get the reaction

because it'll make our answer is much

better and while people might not be

satisfied with the level that they're

currently at in terms of abstraction we

have to start there to get to something

tangible and real and I think a lot of

people fairly come at this as

specifically why haven't you banned this

one person or why haven't you take an

action on on these particular things and

it's the answer is it it's not one case

these these are extremely extremely

challenging and a lot of it has to do

with the context of the conversation and

just as an example there are particular

racial slurs that are used in a way that

are harassing of folks and meant to

silence a voice or to get a voice off

the platform and in other communities

and contexts they're perfectly okay

an example of this is you know we have

we have a bunch of gamers on on Twitter

and every day we have an exchange

between two people saying hey rich you

know I'm I'm gonna kill you tonight and

in one context that's a violent threat

and that is something that we would act

on in another context it's a game and

what that person meant was that I'm

going to kill you in this game tonight

so those are the sorts of nuances that

we have to pay attention to in the

context we have to we have to actually

look at the context of the relationship

between the two people and how they're

engaging so in the old days we were

fairly mechanical and that we looked at

the specific words and content being

used now we have to shift to look at the

network we have to look at the actions

on the network act the behavior on the

necks to contextualise that against the

history of caspase

exactly and and we have a number of

other occurrences where we get accused

of taking content down or permanently

suspending someone because of something

that they said which seems completely

innocuous but what was happening in the

background was they had 17 accounts that

they had control of that were all in

unison in a coordinated fashion

attacking one particular account with

the intent to silence or trigger this

person or they we ban them in the past

for a particular activity and then they

are trying to evade our brand ban which

is against our Terms of Service so

there's a lot on the surface but there's

even more underneath that has to do with

behavior conduct and activity that is

against our term service that we take

action on and where we have failed

mm-hmm

people is explaining the reasons why we

take action yeah it's as if it takes

place in a in a black box yeah and in

some cases that's because there might be

private information that even either a

victim or a a bad faith actor might

compromise them in some way and in some

cases it might be

active investigation so there's even

nuance in how transparents we can be

around the actions or we take on the

platform so but then the reaction to to

the consumer is that it looks haphazard

and it looks random it looks random and

right and and and what the attention is

all on these specific case studies like

whether it's Alex Jones or Jake wall or

you know these specific individuals that

get a lot of press and attention for

their you know behavior on your platform

I'm I'm curious as to like how under

what circumstances does one of these

case studies like rise to your attention

as somebody is running two different

companies and has a tremendous amount of

responsibility for you know keeping both

of these you know ships Square and

Twitter running in a certain direction

you know I can't imagine that you can

roll up your sleeves and get too

involved in specific scenarios but I

would imagine from time to time it does

require your your attention in your

discretion as to what to do yeah so to

start with the principles of my approach

and how I think about this number one is

I want to build a service and a company

that outlives me that doesn't require me

being there - that doesn't require my

attention so by definition that means

that we distribute nearly all of our

decision-making and to me you know one

of the things that I look for is like if

if I have to make a decision I see it as

an organizational failure you know it's

it's something that for whatever reason

and it's likely my fault you know I I

haven't set up the right organizational

structure I don't have a team dynamic

that can work through debate or

disagreement I I haven't presented or we

haven't presented the problem with the

right context or maybe we're going after

the wrong problem so it's all my fault

ultimately but if if I have to make a

decision I think there is something

wrong with the organization and and it's

not that's what I need to fix it's not

making the decision that's fixing

exactly that so

my role then and my second principle is

I need to ask questions in terms of how

we're making this these decisions and

why we're making these decisions and

raise the bar through my questions raise

the bar in terms of how we're thinking

about our customers the people that we

serve secular trends that are happening

whether they be societal or cultural or

legal or technological and then do we do

we have a broader context that is

cohesive across the company and also our

peer set so in cases like Alex Jones or

Jacob recently I was notified that we're

taking action it wasn't brought to me

with a question of like should we do

this or not

uh-huh I was notified that we're taking

action and often times I ask well why

did we take this action what evidence do

we have to take the action or in the

reverse I see I see something that's on

the platform that looks like we should

have taken action but weed in it and I

send that to the team and say what's

going on here and again this points to

our failure in terms of the dependency

on reporting in that you know we only

see what's reported so sometimes I see

it and I ask the question and that kind

of serves as a report but there is no

case at my tenure as CEO that I've made

a decision on one of these cases or

reversed a decision by the team I have

asked a lot of probing questions in some

cases those questions lead to lead to

really looking at our process if it does

I make damn sure that we admit when we

make a mistake and what we've learned

from it within the bounds of what we can

share obviously usually around privacy

or legal standards so that I think that

I believe is my role and and again it's

all against this prints

of like if I'm not here if I die

tomorrow the company needs to be able to

continue and we have to build this into

a framework not into people we have to

think about systems not in these single

points of failure in humans and we you

know we were we just have a lot of work

to do that and building into the

algorithms and the machines and even

when we do that even then when we move

more towards a world where algorithms

are doing more of our work there's some

significant issues one our algorithms

right now can't explain why they make

decisions they make they don't that's

that's highly problematic extremely

scary especially I know you're you're

wearing an orange I'm wearing my ring

you know people wear Apple watches and

the Apple watch every now and then will

tell you when to stand you know if if we

don't if we start offloading more and

more of our decisions to these devices

and we don't understand why they're

making the decisions they're informing

us to take and they can't tell you why

and they can't tell you why then it's

really really dangerous so we need to

invest in explain ability this is a

field of research in AI that it's quite

fascinating we need to invest in

removing bias from machine learning

models and and artificial intelligence

which which we are doing but these are

these are very very early things but

even you know even as we move more of

these enforcement actions and policies

to to algorithms

people need to be able to see why the

actions taken are taken and if they

can't see it they won't trust it so we

you know we have a few operating

principles as a company one we believe

you know our purpose is serve the public

conversation our desire is to promote

health in that public conversation too

we want to earn trust and earning trust

comes through a variety of methods

transparency reliability consistency so

that we don't appear random

deliberateness when you read our rules

you understand them and you can see why

we acted in the particular way we acted

based on the rules or why our algorithms

did do the very same thing so you know

we're just putting these principles in

place we're just building these models

we're investing in research areas like

explain ability and and and and bias in

ml but you know it it is going to take

some time and that's not satisfying and

I think people get frustrated because we

talked about it but I I want to talk

about it I want to share some of these

ideas I want to share where we are in

the journey alright I want to show the

map and like where we've come from and

where we're trying to get to and in

pointing where we're trying to get to

open a dialogue so that people can

really push back on us and and say

you're you're going in the wrong

direction and here's why and you should

consider this other this other path

that's the power of our service you can

see how people are thinking about any

topic Under the Sun and you you get the

sense of global consciousness

immediately so we also have to take

advantage of that as well yeah I

appreciate the transparency and and I

think the openness and the willingness

to entertain pushback speaks your punk

rock roots a little bit I feel like from

a PR publicity strategy it might have

behaved you to to be like introducing a

new feature to Twitter to address these

things and then sort of said here's

here's the first of many things to come

but we're introducing this new thing and

this is because of this and it would

have given you a little bit of

insulation

I think against you know people that

feel like you're you're you know they're

that there's a lot of talk but the

challenge with that I agree with you I

mean that would feel good but the

challenge with that is like there's

there's not going to be any one feature

that like makes one significant dent

this is going to be a constant or unless

you finally allow people to edit their

dream but I might not get into all of

that I might have some things I might

help some things but it's um if we if we

put too much weight on any one

particular feature I think it's doomed

to fail like a lot of this work has to

do with

constantly iterating our models you know

learning and real-time at scale

observing just this model of observing

learning and approving is something we

want to move are our issues in the past

is we've just moved too slowly on that

on that mindset

whereas we on that model we were able to

much much faster because we've improved

dramatically our infrastructure we've

got a lot more sophisticated about how

to apply technology in the right way but

I I definitely here I definitely hear

the call and there are certain features

like like edit or you know putting all

the conversations of the service or

giving people more control over who can

reply or how they moderate comments

within the reply is you yeah media plays

or mute I think it's gonna turn off any

reaction to sweet like way that you can

turn comments off on YouTube and we're

experimenting with all those but all of

them have another side right you know

that you know recently we we tweeted

about we are experimenting with people

enabling giving having more control over

the reply so one of the things we're

we're testing is like if you have a

tweet and some Jarek replies to you

giving you the ability to hide it and

not delete it but hide it which kind of

moves it over to another call it tab

that allows outside observers who are

not you know you or that require to

actually see that you've moderated that

reply but for your own conversation you

can be the host of that conversation you

can you can edit it you can curate it a

bit more you can't delete the tweet from

the platform but you you can push it to

the side and which forces people to do

some work but also how it gives them

some visibility into what you moderate

and the reason why this is important is

because a lot of what's been great about

Twitter have been activists and and

whistleblowers and journalists who you

know a powerful figure might tweet

something and then you see an immediate

reaction in terms of well actually

that's just not true that's not factual

like you know I'm sure you probably

Ellie seen or heard about everything

that was going on in the in the fire

festival and one of the things that you

see within the documentaries is the

activity by the social media managers to

delete rapidly all the comments that

call it out as a fraud and if we just

allow it pure deletion of tweets because

you as a person to like them then we you

miss a huge opportunity to to call out

and to and to speak truth to to power in

a way so any near these goals to

overcome tribalism and the siloing of

information that that contravenes that

what's important so there's a feature

like that that is big and will have

impact on someone's individual

experience but it comes at cost and we

need to mitigate the cost that it that

it brings with it in in this case you

know diminishing the potential for echo

chambers diminishing people to to share

different facts and or you know speaking

truth to power there's a certain

inevitability to Twitter I think you've

even tweeted like it's if if Twitter

wasn't invented then you know Twitter

would have been invented right like that

that that were of the moment where

something like this would have come

along had it not been for you and biz

and EV but I'm interested in in like

what the internal experience has been

for you because I look at you I look at

biz I don't know F but between you and

biz like you guys are I mean biz was

designing book covers like you were you

know into fashion design and I was

Oliver botanical illustration and punk

rock and I mean like to really

inherently creative people I mean you're

not graduates of Harvard Business School

graduates at all yeah right like that

it's it's so improbable and in certain

respects beautiful that this creation

came out of came out of this you know

special group of people who at the time

intended it to be a

a means for for people to to connect

right to just share information about

their lives and Twitter has since become

something else entirely

in certain respects means still retains

that aspect of it but you could have

never predicted what it has matured into

and I'm interested in how that feels

like to be sitting you know right in the

middle of all of this having to make

these kinds of decisions that we're

discussing today and and and try to

navigate this you know behemoth in the

right direction

what does that like I mean it one it it

feels amazing I mean I think my my

co-founder have said it said of

perfectly recently you know he said you

know we often apt we often talk about

everything that could have gone wrong

with Twitter to not enable it to

continue to thrive and to be useful to

people but just have to pay attention

the how much had to go exactly right for

this to happen and you know we're all um

we're all pretty quirky and and and and

fairly weird and you know and I think

the the best aspect of Twitter is a it's

it's a little bit it's a little bit

weird it's a weird little thing and you

know we we built this because we wanted

to use it and and that was the intention

we wanted to use this technology in this

way and and it was just you know I I

wanted to be able to go off anywhere and

and share what I was seeing sure what

was happening and I wanted to be able to

follow biz and see what he was thinking

and see what was happening and then I

think the most beautiful thing about

Twitter is that people showed us what

they wanted it to be and you know I

think being able to be observant enough

to really listen to what something wants

to be to me is true creativity and I you

know we we had the

amazing fortune in that we were able to

build something that felt very

foundational but was ultimately a

discovery that I mean we discovered

something essential something very very

low level and because there was so low

level because it was so essential

because it was so that you know this

core foundational layer people built

social norms on top of it and the first

such norm was using the apt symbol to

refer to another person which you know I

took my laptop one day and I went to

stacks in Hayes Valley which is a brunch

place and took four hours over over a

waffle and some coffee and any time I

saw in that symbol with a name I would

link him and then we turn that into a

replies slash mentions page and suddenly

conversation was born on the platform we

saw you know a few people using it but

that usage grew and grew and grew we

implemented it so everyone could use it

and that made it more accessible and

then everyone started using it same

thing happened with a hashtag chris

messina started putting this you know

hash slash you know a pound sign next to

a word to tag by keyword and topic what

his tweets were about and we found a

search engine called summize we acquired

them because they were recognizing all

of these hashtags and linking them to

here's all the tweets that match that

hashtag and suddenly you had not

conversation between two people or

multiple people but you had conversation

around the topic and and that just

opened another aperture and then you

know Tim O'Reilly you know started

really pushing this concept of okay I'm

following these people and all these

people are following me and I want the

people following me to see what see this

one tweet from who I'm following so I'm

a rebroadcast at which he called a

retweet and yes and again he starts

the RT yeah and then we implemented the

RT away by making it a button and then

everyone started doing it and that

created spread and network effects and

contribution back to the conversation so

everything that has made twitter twitter

has come from the people using it there

was not invented in-house and some would

argue that we don't really invent

twitter we only discovered it and I

would agree with that you know I think

we tuned in to something that was

interesting that was intriguing that we

didn't know what it was going to become

and in the same light people figured out

how to game it too and and that's right

this is a living breathing organism

right that that you know could also you

know become a virus yes absolutely it

could be at least at least so we're

happy you have a pathogen yeah yeah at

least at least the pathways and the

vectors that it provides can carry both

positive and negative attributes and you

know I was I was watching SpaceX Dragon

launch yesterday last night and I you

know certainly taken aback by the

accomplishment but also taken aback that

like we can be in this like big virtual

conversation together I don't know any

of these people but one of the screen

shots I took was you know you know the

the rocket it was in the t-minus 10 and

I was watching through Twitter and I

just started seeing all these tweets and

periscope comments saying you know

congrats or you know good luck from

Mexico good luck from India good luck

from from Japan and like wow okay I just

couldn't couldn't even imagine this in

the past like have one single plane

where anyone around the world can and

can just share how they're thinking and

wish wish well upon one another

but the flip of that is you you know

like any tool you can figure out in a

way such that you can use the vectors to

be more destructive and to be

distracting and to divide which i think

is antithetical to the base technology

but it doesn't mean that we should

assume that it'll just work itself out

we we have to actively maintain and and

and and garden there's this conversation

and you know that the challenge is no

one's done at the scale before so we

have to learn it you know we have to

learn it in real time and part of the

conversations like this is like I want

to I want to share that I'm learning it

in real time we're learning it in real

time and we're gonna make a ton of

mistakes in the in along the way but

we're going to do it in public and we're

going to admit when we're wrong and we

just haven't done enough of that in the

past on this idea of doing it in public

you know failing and succeeding in the

public eye how do you just as a human

being

deal with the reaction that comes with

every single thing that you tweet like

do you like you put a lot of thought

into what you're putting out into the

world do you not read your app mention

like how do you do it like knowing that

every city every time you tweet

something at least with respect to

what's going on at Twitter that you're

gonna get like there's gonna be a

certain percentage of people that are

gonna want to say not nice things like

how do you insulate yourself how do you

see that and take it to heart but also

protect your own you know emotional

well-being yeah I mean and this is where

the meditation practice has helped me a

lot is just not constantly allowing

myself to be reactive to whatever comes

in front of me this is that the less

control I have over my own well-being

and space and and and mindset the less

effective I am in fixing our issues so I

I approach it number one from that

mindset of like I want to I want to go

into the arena and experience everything

that people are thinking because I

the only way for me to really move

forward is to at least see it ideally to

acknowledge it figure out what I can

learn from even the most negative like

what's the question behind the question

what's the statement behind the

statement what realizing also that you

know people have a lot of a lot of fear

of companies like ours and and and me

you know running companies like ours and

they have a lot of distrust and

expressing that comes out often as anger

and it comes out as hateful and it comes

out as you know something that would

otherwise set me off but even that

expression even them doing that might

disarm a little bit I'd I think you know

with the rest of online there's there's

very little consequence to doing

something like that and it's easy to be

behind a keyboard and and say things

that you know some people say but I do

think that there is a health aspect in

enabling people to express themselves

but they certainly do not have a right

for us to amplify that or to guide it to

a person who wasn't open to accepting it

and and and that's where the mechanics

of the network failed today like it

there's just so many open doors that

people can take advantage of like

replies like trends like search and you

know there's there's some power in those

doors being open but if you don't feel

you have enough control over them or

your own experience and you just can't

give up why it won't this isn't useful

to me and like ultimately you know as we

think about health we need to we need to

realize two things one we need a we need

to protect someone's physical safety to

the best degree that we can being an

online platform and then number two we

need to protect people's right to freely

express themselves and we do believe

that's a

Global right and we do believe that

people weaponize it and they in the game

it and their intent is to silence one

another and I think everyone on the on

the free speech absolutist side would

agree that they prefer everyone to be

able to speak and part of that agreement

is making sure that people feel safe to

do so in the first place so we have to

guide all of our rules around those

those concepts and principles in terms

of you know what is impacting someone's

ability to freely express themselves and

and and then third realize that you know

the the conversation to have is around

attention and amplification and

recommendation that's where Twitter's

true power is and that's where I think

we should be held a lot more accountable

publicly is what we recommend what we

allow to be amplified what we do with

people's attention which is you know a

scarce resource and something that our

business is built off of and what about

capturing the in speaking about

capturing people's attention and

maintaining it how do you think about

the addictive nature of not just your

platform but these social media

platforms in general you know we're now

in this era where we have people like

Tristan Harris speaking out about the

erosion of you know our analog lives as

a result of our you know are being held

hostage by our devices on actually

tomorrow I'm getting a guy in the

podcast called Cal Newport I wrote a

book called deep work and he's got a new

book coming out called digital

minimalism that's all about you know how

how we can have healthier relationships

with these devices while respecting the

you know the addictive nature and what

and what they truly are and he talks a

lot about and Tristan talks a lot about

how so much energy

is put into trying to maintain that

attention on the platform like is that

like what's going on at Twitter with

respect to how you've architected the

platform for that purpose yeah I mean I

think this goes back to the the

incentive conversation like where we're

incentivizing a lot more kind of social

status than we are utility and I think

there is deep deep utility within

Twitter you know it's the the fastest

way and most influential way to get your

thoughts to the world that there's

nothing faster I think it also I find

out what's going on and a figure out in

jail time yeah into you know it's a

fastest way to tap into a global

consciousness like there's nothing

faster it's not segmented by groups or

communities or run on it everything is

on the same plane and there's a lot of

power to that but at the same time you

know we need to make sure that we're

aligning the incentives of the network

towards that rather than you know coming

up with the best tweet that has the most

likes because you're the most outraged

or you have the best hot take without

any sort of consideration around what's

actually happening or you know like an

event just unfolds you quickly fire

something off

it's outrageous as hell which really

spreads it throughout the network and

and then you know two hours later you

realize what you just said was a

complete distortion of reality because

something new breaks around the event so

you know I think we need to make sure at

least in the conversation utility aspect

that were were were incentivizing you

know the breadth of the conversation the

the timeline of the conversation the the

fact that people can go back it goes

back to what I hope to do with these

podcasts like you know I started some

with this year and like Bill Simmons and

and maybe I was really terrible and

maybe you know as people progress

through the year with me maybe maybe

they see you know my conversational game

gets more stronger

and much more authentic and much more

real and and more open that that would

be my hope so the same thing I want to

have happen on Twitter where you can see

learning you can see development you can

see iteration and and the beauty of

conversation versus a post his

conversation evolve it iterates and it

grows and it goes in directions and it's

very fluid so we need to show more of

that but in terms of the addictive

natures of the technologies yes I think

we're we're making at least from an OS

level or we're making the right first

steps which is giving people the data so

you know iOS and Android both in the

base operating system now allow you to

track how much time you spend on

particular apps or how much you use your

phone and you can see it I think it's a

novelty right now I don't with the

exception of potentially people's kids I

don't think people are actually

utilizing that information in a way that

is changing their behaviors at least

that's my own experience I I look at my

screen time and it hasn't made me make

any other new decisions you shared it

though you share it you shared your

screen time on Twitter before yeah yeah

to generate a conversation about it but

like it hasn't

there's no again it goes back to

incentives there's no incentive for me

to change right now like you did I just

don't see the like at least within that

view it's not presenting to me a path as

we talked about earlier weather the

water and and the line it's not

presenting necessarily upfront a

solution that points me in a direction

that has more you know fulsome human

connection why don't one of the things

we at Twitter are our main Twitter

account at the company we did this

little thing yesterday where we tweeted

get off of Twitter go tell someone that

you love them better to do it in person

and one I love that we do stuff like

that because you know I I don't want to

be afraid of telling people to get off a

thing right off it and like Kara Swisher

is rolling our eyes right now

I know and - well that's that's that's

her prerogative but like I think you

know if you look at the replies to that

tweet it's amazing and and if you know

if we if we can do whatever we can to

encourage some fundamentally different

human connection great but in every one

of those moments we get to learn and it

might have you know it might have seemed

a little bit I Roley or stupid or

whatnot but I don't want us to be afraid

of stuff like that at that level because

I we get to learn from those

opportunities and based on those

learnings we get to challenge our

assumptions but I you know it the world

we want to get to is and I've said this

on other podcast is I want I want people

to walk away from Twitter emphasis walk

away from Twitter feeling that they

learn something and right now I feel

walk people walk away from Twitter

feeling outraged or feeling overwhelmed

or feeling like they don't know what the

next step is or what the thing why the

things even valuable so if we can direct

a lot of our efforts towards like you

know I put down the phone and I feel

like I learned something and you know I

want to I want to build on it in this

way and then share back the progress

then we've we've done the right thing

and I I know that feels far away from

what people perceive of Twitter today

but it's there and it does happen in

small amounts like a it's really a

function of like what Twitter you follow

you you follow Health Twitter you learn

untell enough stuff you you you know

Rhonda Patrick found my fitness you then

Mercola you know just you know all along

the spectrum of health from the very

extreme to you know more the mainstream

to to the other end of it I learned so

much from those conversations on the

service yeah I would agree with you

there's a lot of

pretty vile arguments going on around

diet though you can fall into that

rabbit hole as well yeah and I would

just say you know sort of you know

respecting the challenges of foot and

and the problems that you're facing that

on a personal level you know Twitter's

been an unbelievable resource for me I

feel like I'd built most of my career on

the shoulders of Twitter because it's

allowed me this unbelievable ability to

directly connect with all these people

that I respect and admire and have then

been able to meet in real life for

purposes of this show but even even

before that like it's been a tremendous

value add in my personal experience and

I would take that you know with

everything else that it has and you know

now there's all these other social

networks and I get a lot more traction

on other ones but Twitter's still like

the first one that I go to in the

morning when I have my social media time

it's like Twitter first I want to see

what's going on right now

yeah and that was a that was a big shift

when I came back to the company and

almost four years ago and in that like I

think we were we had my mind set too

much of chasing after the people that we

don't have like trying to increase the

pie size of the pie as quickly as

possible versus focusing on the people

we do have I'd you know and we have some

of the most influential people in the

world using us in a while it might feel

I mean it's it's certainly smaller than

others it drives culture it dries

conversation and we don't even know how

to count the impressions that tweets get

we can't count tweets on CNN being

screenshotted we can't count the tweets

being shown within newspapers so the the

you know just the impressions that has

around the world is significant and what

we need to focus on is making sure that

for the people who do love us that we're

giving them opportunity to love us more

and such that they want to they want to

talk about the value they're getting out

of it and back to your point you know

it's a it's a cost-benefit analysis like

you know there's certainly cost to

Twitter and we're seeing you know more

and more than like people being fired

/ tweets they tweeted 10 years ago and

not being able to clarify what they

meant and you know we also see a lot of

benefit in terms that they've built

their networks or careers their

understanding their practice by engaging

in these communities we you know we have

a woman who was in the Westboro Baptist

Church who was using Twitter every

single day to spread hate against the

LGBTQA community and you know four or

five very patient folks on Twitter who

are engaging her every day every day

showing her different perspective and

she left the church because of that and

she credits a lot of that to those

conversations on Twitter and just

showing her a different perspective and

she's working on getting the rest of her

family out of it she was born into that

church so we don't do a great job at

telling all those stories as well but

they're real and they're impactful and

they're meaningful and we you know we

need to optimize for for more of that

occurrence realizing that there's always

going to be negative approaches and our

role is like we we can't amplify that

like we we we need to make sure that

people have control over the experience

and if they choose to see everything

that's there right in their choice but

if they you know if if they don't you

know they should be able to have a

conversation they want to have and be

the host that they want to be what do

you foresee for the future as we kind of

uh sure in this post privacy you know

culture and world that we live in where

were seemingly all gonna be held

accountable for things that we said or

did that were documented on Twitter and

other platforms you know ten years ago

20 years ago as culture shifts are we

all just going to be you know put on

trial for these things like we're in a

very weird awkward in-between phase

right now trying to grapple with this

issue and we you know

in canceled culture right now holding

people you know hands to the fire for

for things that they did you know quite

some time ago and I see that only

becoming more problematic in the short

run until we figure out as a culture how

we're going to manage this kind of thing

yeah you've you've talked about you know

Carol's concept of growth mindset on

yeah on your podcast and if we you know

if we have a culture that cancels people

on mistake there is no opportunity for

growth mindset there's no opportunity

for learning there's no opportunity for

evolution so I agree with you that we're

in a weird state right now I think as

more people experience this and more

people see that there is potential for

learning there's potential for a

rehabilitation there's potential for

redemption I mean we're not just seeing

this online or you know we're seeing

this in the prison systems in the United

States we're seeing this in like the

conversation around infractions around

like you know canis cannabis sales in

the past and what it now means that it's

legalized within the state and you know

the hundreds if not thousands if not

tens of thousands of people we put away

because of that very thing and and just

like the momentum of the framework and

the system that doesn't allow for

redemption or rehabilitation so this is

much broader than online and it's much

broader than the conversation I think

we're having and I don't think we're

allowing ourselves to connect all the

dots and I don't think were we're

allowing our our culture and our society

to even have the chance at learning or

growing if we if we can't sell everyone

out there there's just no learning and

eventually you're gonna trip up yourself

and if you're not giving someone else to

benefit out no one's gonna give you the

benefit out either and I I think that

experience will be had by a lot of

people certainly all the younger folks

and more and more of an of an older

generation and as long as we have that

open dialogue and show that's okay we're

good

but you know as Twitter we could also do

some things like where we're you know

we're thinking about this feature to

allow people to go back and clarify

tweets and what that might look like is

you might have said you might have

tweeted something five years ago about

diet and someone might unearth it and

say you know you know rich you believe

this and before this you believe you

believe this and suddenly today that

older tweak it's all this traction and

you can retweet it and and then suddenly

you might be known as the person that is

completely inconsistent or in your views

so you can imagine a feature where you

could immediately go back clarify that

tweet when you do so it's kind of like a

quote tweet a quote a retweet with

comment and by doing so by clarifying it

you're not allowing the original tweet

to be retweeted without the

clarification so anytime someone

retweets that original tweet the

clarification comes with it so at least

people have more context and and things

like that might make an impact they may

not at all

but we should test so it's also like a

lot of work right like I'm not I'm not

gonna go back to 2008 and read all my

tweets and whatever I said you know no I

figure out what needs clarification to

someone like bringing something in the

past stuff you can immediately go to

that tweet clarify it and then and then

the record is straight at least in your

experience so walk me through a day in

the life what's it look like for you now

use two days a week you're here at the

house right yeah I I've been I've been

working from home two days a week which

I you know is it time for me to read to

write to consider and this gives me a

lot of the free time that I need to to

think the the other days are just back

to back back meetings and and and my

life is in little little boxes and

Google Calendar but every day I wake up

usually between 5:30 and 6:30 and I

immediately start with a cold shower

that that is my that is my my immediate

caffeine in the morning and it's kind of

like this one of those small wins where

I feel like I already won the day if I

can go straight into cold water and have

the mental capacity to do so them and

the and it just feels I can take

anything and just wakes me the hell up -

so like right away before coffee before

any yep I go straighten in a cold shower

and there for like you know a minute to

five minutes and then I go into this

room and I release it here and I met at

8:00 for an hour and I do have in pass

on a based practice and and after that I

get ready and I usually turn you know

turned on my phone at that point to see

if there's any emergencies I I keep my

phone either in my kitchen or my closet

not next to my bed I you know I turn off

all the notification notifications

during the night and I don't really

check it into about you know 7:00 to

7:30 and when I'm walking into work I

leave the house around 7:30 and my my

office is about five miles away and

takes me now about an hour 15 minutes an

hour 20 minutes to to walk and no matter

unless it's heavy rain I do it you know

and any time I'm going in the office I'd

I walk and sometimes it's really cold

here and you know that the calls has

been as 39 but it gets my blood going

gets my mind going and I was in a

podcast I listen to audio books I

sometimes I just think sometimes I take

phone calls I walk super fast if you

ever see me on the street I like

ridiculous because it's just like you

know almost almost jogging but um

interesting same route every day same

same route every day sometimes I'd even

adds time so I feel like I found the

optimal path to to save to save time and

I kind of I've shifted my entire outfit

to this walk like I wear all black

because you if I sweat you can't see

anything

you can't see any stained if it rains

like he can't see any of the the wetness

and I wear these running sandals because

they're the fastest that they enable me

to move the fastest they're faster than

running

so they're called earth runners earth

runners calm they they're made up in

Sonoma I think they may be in San

Francisco now but they're um super

simple like you know if any of you or

you read Born to Run you know all the

running sibling side room Fivefinger

type shoes well they're pure their

prayer sandals so like they don't have

any of the articulated toes or whatnot

so it's a you know it's open Tarahumara

yes the Tarahumara sandals and so I

usually wear those everyday which have

been called out as well and press like

I'm wearing I'm wearing these sandals

and ever exposing your my toes to got

the CEO of Goldman Sachs

I'm like man should I not expose my ugly

hands either like what I think can't be

can be human here so we I so I I walk in

with those and that iterated from

sneakers and I just tried to find the

fastest way to be in and and then like

you know I wear wear these black jeans

and this sweater that keeps me warm and

you know I just wake up put these on and

and go and then I look fist

I don't need breakfast I have one meal a

day so I go I have that's every day

every day yeah with the exception I'd I

started experimenting a little bit

recently where on

well I'll finish the rest of this so I

go into Twitter first um my first

meetings usually at 9:00 I have meetings

until about 2:00 p.m. and then I walk

across the street to square I usually

stay until about 6 or 7 I take a lift

home I don't walk back home I try to eat

dinner at 6:30 around around 6:30 or

7:00 not too late I go into the infrared

sauna which I really love I do a workout

I do

vii work out through an app sometimes

they do multiple circuits of that and

then and then I eat and then I I kind of

wind down at 9:30 try to be in bed at

least by 10:00 and then go to sleep I

try to get 9 hours of sleep that's been

hugely impactful or a ring to keep me

accountable to it but so I I learned the

one meal a day thing from from wim HOF

you know two years ago and I I loved

learning through experimentation and I

love experimenting on myself

and I've always been this way I was I

was vegan for two years it was it's very

hard to be vegan st. Louis Missouri at

least when I was I was I was right now

you're in San Francisco I know I know I

know I will reboot this I I so I love

experimenting I've always experimented

with my diet I book always experiments

with health practices some like some

have been really informative to me and

very healthy some have not but the one

meal a day thing I I just thought was a

really interesting challenge and I just

I heard it on the podcast I think it was

with him in Tim Harrison magicite I want

to try that and I after a week of some

pain I noticed I slept much deeper and

during the day I was so much more

focused so every day I I fast for 22

hours I have you know I have dinner

within two hours and I have a really

really big dinner and and recently over

the past few months I've been breaking

that by by having as kind of a reward

for making it through the week on Friday

morning I go to Blue Bottle coffee and

they get one of their waffles which is

amazing in the morning and and then I

was your big cheat that's it that's a

cheat and I won't what I've been doing

recently is I won't eat until Saturday

dinner so and it gets tended fast

because I've been playing with even more

extended just pure water fast that the

longest I've done is three days and it

it is trippy like the the amount of

focus I have on day three is like crazy

I was not expecting that

and I would eventually like to go beyond

that just to see what see what happens

but I have to package it into these

weekends because I don't trust myself

enough to not balance it with my my day

to day work and everything going on at

the office and went on so yeah when when

I learned something on a podcast like

like yours or you know something that

like you know David Goggins is doing and

I I try it I try it for like a month and

if I like it I stick with it and I just

want to constantly experiment and that's

that's why I dropped out of school

that's why I cuz I I was learning so

much more about experimenting myself and

I I don't know any other way to learn if

I accept by tinkering and playing and

and trying new things and realizing

early on it was a little bit too

haphazard now I like really if I'm gonna

try something I'm gonna dedicate months

to it and like a common practice and I

have a lot of patience as a

characteristic and I have a lot of

discipline and like I can really stick

to something I say I'm going to do so

that is a practice I also been

journaling since I was very young

mostly you know through through my phone

but before that was written journalism

sometimes online that's where a lot of

the ideas from tour came from was live

journal I just had journaling in public

which was like scary scary idea to to be

like what's the edge of honesty that you

want to be open about to other people

that you don't know and you can follow

you and I you know I experimented with

that everyday at Twitter as well and

like some of that was me sharing my

meditation and the Amara is like look

I'm oh I'm aware of what this might be

pursue independent of like what's

happening within me Ammar a tech guy in

San Francisco of course he doesn't

meditation

of course he's going to tweet about it

of course like he got bitten up by

mosquitoes is gonna show that off like

it's so Silicon Valley episode tonight I

get that that's the thing that kind of

like I I'm cognizant of like I'm just

playing into this stereotype but I don't

care I get value out of it and I I know

I'm gonna get some of that back and I

know I'm gonna get other things back and

I don't want to be afraid of at least

creating potential for someone else who

might be on the edge of trying something

like this to like take the step or for

it to resonate in such a way that they

develop some questions in their mind and

because I would want that I won't I get

so much out of people being open and

sharing and even though that they might

play into a stereotype

it helps me evolve and grow so I need to

model that behavior as well and I what's

learning unless you share it well I

think look there's certain aspects of

that that are you know stereotypically

Silicon Valley asked but I think what

distinguishes it is the the self-care

aspect of it to me stands a little bit

in in contradiction to this this you

know hustle porn culture that I think is

also pervasive in Silicon Valley where

you got to work twenty five hours a day

and and you know sleep is for when

you're dead and all of that for you to

kind of say look I'm sleeping eight or

nine hours a night no no I have the aura

screenshots living you know a relative

me show me around your house like it's

very there's a there's a minimalism

aspect to it like you live you know for

you know compared to the way that you

could live you're living a relatively

you know simple stripped-down existence

yeah I mean I and how does that inform

like your thinking and your equanimity

and how you you know the creative you

know impetus that you bring to business

I the philosophy that I've always that

has always resonated

with me inherently and naturally and

feels like I was I was born with was is

this essentialism like what is

absolutely essential in my life and even

if you ask my parents you know when we

moved into a new house and my you know

my parents came from nothing they barely

even graduated high school st. Louis

Missouri didn't go to college were very

upset when I didn't finish college

because I would be the one person my

family did you so but you know when we

would move into a new house I always

chose the smallest room and I always put

the least amount of stuff in it and I I

appreciate I appreciate this concept of

like I want to figure out how to unlock

everything I'm born with because I know

that's all I need

all I need is everything I'm born with

like I I don't need any of these objects

I don't need any of these technologies I

think I think of Twitter as insanely

useful but I think of most technologies

as a crutch to point back to what we're

inherently capable of and in Twitter's

case you know I think it represents the

global consciousness I think it's the

closest thing we have to tapping into a

global consciousness and to be able to

not just see what people are saying but

what they actually think the sentiment

behind it and I inherently believe that

we have that power internally and I I

believe that Twitter's one of Twitter's

role is to remind us of the potential

and you know if meditation can get me to

a point where I can where I can

experience that and feel it would you

know which which it hasn't some way it's

and got me more in tune to my instinct

into my into my gut and like my feelings

and I proved I I mark those moments of

instinct and I I marked them with enough

weight mental clarity and weight whether

it be through journaling or just

considering it deeply that when the

event does happen that I had an instinct

about I can tie it back right now that's

cool and that's and that has that has

shown me like this these technologies

you know

these rings that we're wearing they're

just reminders to me and crutches of

what we inherently are born with and

have the natural ability to do so and

they're mirrors and if we can approach

them in that light instead of something

that drives us which I think you know

Tristan you know accurately articulates

if we we will be able to develop a

healthy relationship with them we're

going to start any new technology we're

going to start by a codependent

relationship and then when when you get

aware of the power and you get to aware

of the reflection the reflection is what

becomes the interesting part and it's

reflection back on you and your

consciousness in your awareness and

anything that builds self awareness any

practice I mean any tool any object is

is something that I want to invest in

and and so I keep my life fairly sparse

because I think it'll be distracting

otherwise do you canonize this in any

specific like spiritual perspective that

guides your life I grew up Catholic and

and my parents are pretty devout

Catholics and my uncle's a priest you

know every Christmas we go back and he

says Mass but I was I was the one in my

family that left st. Louis and I was the

one that was never confirmed by choice

and I I get my sense of spirituality

through connection and you know what

Twitter represents his spiritual to me

like tapping into the consciousness the

you know the the the larger organism

whether it be the the plan at the

universe the the social consciousness is

what is what is what drives me and it's

the it's the answer I like to get at you

know and the question that I like to ask

and so that's where I feel like the flow

and that's where I feel most alive is

when I I feel like I can tap into that

and like you know I go down to Big Sur a

lot and

Fixer like we look at this amazing

fortune here in San Francisco being able

to travel two and a half hours away and

go you know to this place that you

immediately feel is mystical because of

the redwood trees on this dynamic Coast

that goes down a thousand feet to the

ocean where you see whales and and and

you just feel this this connection and

this wisdom and I I think that's so so

powerful in such an important reminder

like today is my day where I don't you

know Saturdays is my day where I don't

think about work at all with exception

in this conversation but it's at a

different level I I just clear the day

completely to you know walk outside or

to go down to Big Sur or to be with my

best friends I have dinner with them

ideally once a week and just laugh and

have some wine together and they just

had a baby so that's all another new

sense of joy and I need a lot of that

balance because that that is my

spiritual connection at the moment it's

just like feeling that that connection

is tangible way as possible and you you

know you mentioned you know my path of

like you know think about designing

jeans and botanical illustration and I

took a thousand hours of Massage Therapy

along my path of becoming an engineer

and a CEO because I I grew up writing

programs and it's so damn abstract

you're so much in your head and you're

not using your hands and every time I

realize I'm just like my dreams were me

programming my dreams it's just such a

weird experience where I would have a

stream where I was programming the next

part of my dream and it was so lucid but

it was so it wasn't grounded so I would

always shift towards something that I

loved

like botanical illustration and just

drawing or something that would solve a

need because I was developing carpal

tunnel and I didn't just want to get a

massage I wanted to learn the the why

behind it and then the

annex behind it so I could fix myself

and but all these variations these side

pass these Forks in the road have always

brought me back to building technology

because and added depth and enriched

building that technology because I'd

it's just where I feel my creativity

most yeah I know you had an interest in

public transportation and like urban

planning early days I feel like you

should get together with Elon and solve

the traffic problem wait you guys

together he's trying to get the traffic

to Mars yeah well he's going underground

too that's sure you know that's sure I

can't help but think that there's this

weird meta parallel between like your

own personal path towards broadening

your consciousness and and you know

raising your awareness and and and

growing as a as a human being and the

kind of hive consciousness that is

Twitter and the commitment to kind of

raising the vibration of that like the

interplay between those I think is super

interesting yeah I yeah I think um in

that sense like you know back to our our

conversation around meditation it's the

the observation is not just that we are

external observers but we are part of

this is some of the very act of

observing is changing the system as well

and we we have a responsibility to

really reflect the essentialness of

humanity and and and being that

reflection on the world for all the good

and all the bad I mean that there's a

lot of power to seeing you know how

people think in ways that make us feel

great and also things that are super

uncomfortable because we we need to be

able to acknowledge those things we need

to be able to acknowledge in person

order to have a conversation about it

and then there's no other path towards

evolution and making something better

unless we can talk about it

and and yeah so it's all recursive it's

all recursive and the more I realize how

recursive this world is I think the

better our Nets just get but at the same

time it's easy to go down to a very very

abstract path and I get that and I you

know we have to balance practicality

with it but in that balance is is

something really magical and sometimes

we we discover something really magical

and sometimes we we kind of get to get

ourselves distracted yeah you know this

this nonviolent communication this this

this concept have you heard of and it's

just you know kind of a meditation on

how we how we communicate and utilizing

words like should as as things that kind

of restrict the growth mindset and

immediately going towards solutions in

our speech versus presenting more of

needs and feelings and I you know it

it's amazing how if you just change a

few words in your dialogue it changes a

relationship with the person you're

having a conversation with or gets to

something much deeper in the

conversation so there's a there's a

there's a really good the book is

nonviolent communication there's a

there's a good audio book read by the

author called speaking peace which is

sometimes corny at times because he

picks up the guitar and sings but it's

the substance and the framework and the

system and the science behind it is real

there's a lot of glad it's not violent

in terms of the person that you're

communicating with but also with respect

the self it's mainly yourself yeah it's

mainly yourself saying the word you know

we should cecily violent because it's

holding you to a standard that you feel

you can't meet or you can't you can't

learn from you you can't there's no path

towards towards learning when you set

this immediate expectation but and

that's just one example of the framework

so it's a that that has been fairly

enlightening just I

I love looking at how we use language

and you know one of the things that I've

been over years been trying to convince

both my companies around is like we have

this way this word in technology called

users and way back when when Howard

Schultz was on the square board the CEO

of Starbucks he pulled me aside one day

he's like why do you call your customers

users oh my god

good question I don't I don't know where

it came from but we've always called him

that and then I started researching it

and you know it was it was that it was

coined back in the early 80s when

actually earlier in that in the 70s when

people were using mainframes and it was

to represent an account someone who is

using the time on a mainframe and then

the people who were really good like the

engineers of the system administrators

kind of it developed this level system

of amun super admin and you're a user

and the user is stupid and we can't

trust what they do so it became this

term losers oh you se RS and then when

models like Google came to be they know

you know they had no way to refer to

their that they don't have a direct

customer or relationship with the

exception of advertisers but a lot of

you know the value of something like

Google and something like Twitter is

people coming to pay them with their

attention and that there's no you know

monetary exchange as you would assume

with customers but there is a exchange

of value they're honest in attention so

they called that a user of a system as

well so you use Google you use user of

Google the problem with the word is that

it creates this abstraction layer so we

have you know 330 million monthly active

users on Twitter and once you say that

it's this abstract thing you'd if you

say we have 330 million people

then you have more of this empathy for

or who you're serving and who you

ideally want to serve I look at it

through this different lens as somebody

who's in in recovery we got like a user

as somebody who's an addict

right well that's that's another thing

is it's a very niche as as negative

connotation to the word so and and it

breeds addiction as well so like we're

you know in square we never use the word

user we use customer we use seller we

use buyer as a word we use individual

and it just at least creates more

potential for empathy you know not gonna

do it alone but and I'm trying to get

Twitter more and more there as well mmm

so where do you see Twitter 5-10 years

from now like if you have your druthers

and you're able to implement all of

these changes that you would like to see

you know what is it what does it look

like

um I think number one that we become

known as you know we truly serve our

purpose of serving not the public

conversation but the global public

conversation that the predominant

conversations on our service are the

existential conversations of the planet

and you know in you vols recent book 21

lessons for the 21st century he talks

about some of the existential

conversations being climate change

displacement of work through artificial

intelligence economic disparity these

are conversations that no one nation

state can solve alone it requires all of

humanity to work together to actually

make an impact on great so I believe you

need platforms like Twitter to host that

conversation to arrange the conversation

to enable the conversation to live and

iterate and to evolve and I want to be a

service that people at least have first

consideration for learning from those

existential global conversations and

also being able to participate in them

and we've seen evidence of that so that

that's number one number two in serving

the public conversation

public conversation we have a desire and

it is a desire it you know it it's not

it's it's a responsibility of all of us

in the world but it is a desire for us

to promote health into that conversation

and I want us to be known by that I want

us to be known like if you engage in

public conversation on Twitter you

should expect civil dialogue and debate

and to learn something and you should

you should if you don't know how to get

into a conversation in that way we're

going to teach you and we're going to

teach you through the incentives as well

and and that leads to the third point I

want to have a strong point of view

within the network itself around

Redemption and rehabilitation and

teaching people how to converse like I'm

trying to learn right now like we are

Ultimates as a company we're ultimate

students of conversation and like word

we're distilling all of our learnings

right into the product so that everyone

can benefit from it that sounds super

idealistic idea and again back to back

to the stereotypical Silicon Valley but

like we have to have these aspirations

we're not going to get to 99 percent of

it we're going to get to 80 percent

maybe unless but if we can get to that

milestone I think will improve the lives

for you know a few people at least and

and maybe maybe that spreads and and

maybe that pushes but like I think right

now we're just we have such a binary

view of the world of on platform off

platform instead of like going back to

what we were talking about earlier like

how do we how do we put the growth

mindset into Twitter like how do we

enable people to come to it and learn

from it and that to me is is the is a

potential of technology and I think

we're gonna be taught a lot by people

growing up only knowing that I can have

a conversation with anyone in the world

at any point I think those fascinating

that like my my friend's newborn who's

only four months old

he's growing up in a world where he only

knows touchscreens exist he only knows

that I I could have a conversation with

literally anyone and though in the world

instantly he's growing up to a world

that has a you know growing potential

for a global currency like Bitcoin and

native currency to the Internet that's

not controlled by any central bank or

nation-state and you know

therefore reflects a global citizenship

in a very foundational way that is

powerful and the more we can listen to

that experience of like you've only

known this what do you do with it like

what's the next step on this and is so

exciting yeah it's exciting there is an

idealism that that that is you know

venturing through everything you just

said but it's it's beautifully

articulated and you know I hope that we

see all of that come to fruition you

know I worry about you know the base

nature of us as human beings and this

ticking clock that we're facing with

global climate change like these are you

know pressing matters that need redress

in in the short run unless let's be eyes

wide open about it let's see it truly

and it is there are some scary things

that all these technologies enable but I

don't know any other way to get over

them but sharing them eyes wide open and

seeing them eyes wide open like talking

through them last question

self-serving question because the

genesis of Twitter came out of odio

which was initially intended to be a

sarcastic plot all right come full

circle here we are in the midst of this

Golden Age of podcasting the mainstream

adoption of this of this form of media

is you know penetrating to newer and

deeper levels which is really cool and

exciting and I really you know I believe

in this medium you know as a very potent

means of really having meaningful

conversations and I love it to death but

if you were to start a new company today

to disrupt this podcasting platform or

perfect it or you know solve problems

that you see as somebody who's a fan and

a consumer of vodka

do you have a sense of what that would

look like

yeah I mean I would I would first focus

on starting with the problem of how do

we provide economic incentive but that

to me is like the biggest unlock and I

think right now we only have tools of

attention and advertising and I think

some of the contribution models are just

in their infancy and you know things on

patreon and what Sam is doing in terms

of his own explorations and we have some

you know varying experiments and

decentralization but I would go after

that problem first I would and I would

pair deeply with the podcasting platform

I would I would figure out the economic

incentive first and foremost and that

they be on the same plane and I would

look specifically to cryptocurrency yeah

you know I think there's a lot certainly

in the ability to you know transact but

I think this concept of what an IC o----

and initial coin offering at least

points to it doesn't offer today but at

least points to like someone could buy

equity in your success you know buy

equity and the more reach you have they

actually have economic incentive and

they then because what's interesting

about that is it aligns incentives your

listeners incentives are aligned with

your incentives and that you want to

have engaging rich conversations that

people find valuable and valuable enough

that they're sharing you are rating your

podcasts or whatnot and in IC o---- at

least points to a path towards aligning

those incentives and to me like that's

the unlock is like how do we get

alignment of incentives between

distribution of the podcast and the

economic incentives that that allow it

to grow and to thrive or just maintain

some people don't want to clear the

presents but I want to spend 50% of my

time on this and in order to do that in

you do 50% less of another thing that I

make money for to you know provide for

my family so that's what it all comes

down to so that's number one

is a you know attack the problem of

economic incentives and solve it in such

a way that is on the same surface as a

distribution platform in a second I

would look at is how do we go how do we

look deeper into indexing what's in a

podcast our search tools today are so

weak so weak I mean like I we take a

search voice exactly but we can but no

can alright no one's been ones doing a

filter I no one's built it and the

things I think are exciting like we've

had so many keywords in this

conversation right like from you know

from meditation to impossible to or and

if I could type or speak that word and

find all the conversations about or or

could just pull up the the 30-second

clip of you talking about this and it

would live somewhere on the internet and

be catalog exactly but also crawl

cross-referencing with all the other

conversations around Ora or too so to go

deep in the media to allow that to be

queried and then once you have that then

you can do some cool things like how do

you expand your reach you know that as

you look at the world the biggest way to

expand your reach is translation mm-hmm

so automatically translating no matter

what language you speak I can hear what

I need to hear no matter what language

they speak and and there's a technology

can solve this today but no one's put it

together in one platform so economic

incentives smeared with distribution and

then going deeper into the into the

content and allowing more accessibility

through translation or kind of a the

trio of things I would look at to come

together if I were to create one today

oh do 2.0 we gave up too early we gave

up too early well yeah it was a little

it was ahead of its time but to be fair

it just wasn't where your interests lied

at the time either

that is awesome yeah our interests lied

with like you know one button push

publishing but we were all afraid to

talk it like with our voices where we're

at

we'll be on the keyboard at that time

but we were we weren't podcasters we

weren't like you we we didn't enjoy the

sound not that you voice but it was also

early

it was early thank you thank you so much

it was great we didn't even talk about

square or Bitcoin really or crypto or

anything like that so maybe there's a

lot there talked you into doing this

doing another round to focus on me well

we'll come back after a significant

launch yeah cool um really appreciate

your time thank you super fascinating I

said that that was the last question but

I have one more I've now had I had bids

on the podcast now I've had you I've

been doing this podcast for six years

I've written three books am I gonna get

that blue cheque ever I'm still not

verified I don't know what I got to do

yeah it's we're in such a weird state

with our verification program

not that I don't care but I just think

it's funny yeah no no but let's see what

we can do but we we need to move that

whole program away from like this blue

badge and more towards credibility

around the topic yeah well it the the

idea originally was that it was

legitimizing that somebody you know

actually was who they say they are and

that applies to journalists and

professional athletes so that people

aren't out there mimicking them but then

it became it got co-opted into this

status thing yeah and it's it's also

just to coarse-grain it's at the account

level and so we will want to do

ultimately I was like you know how do we

establish credibility within a topic

space and authority domain expertise

with a pretty credible and my topics I

know you are I know you are and like

right now we just don't have the

framework to our so well check for now

and unfortunately it has created this

like in this to class discussion but

yeah I'm really upset by and I think

it's unfortunate but here it is all

right man till next time so nice stack

thank you brother

all right so that happened I thought it

was pretty cool what do you guys think

it's not often that you get to sit down

with somebody who has literally changed

the world so I just want to again thank

Jack for taking the time to share his

life with me and with all of you guys

and I just got to say that that

experience this experience of spending

basically the better part of an

afternoon with jacket it really did

change me I left his house that day

thinking much more deeply about the

level of intentionality that I bring to

my day you know I'm a busy guy like a

lot of people I'm prone to stress and

anxiety and distraction and I found the

fact that somebody with such an insane

level of responsibility has so

effectively and mindfully stripped away

the non-essential distraction to

prioritize deep thinking and self-care

and truly feed is hunger to be

constantly learning and involving and I

think that's impressive it stayed with

me and I hope it left you considering

the level of intentionality that that

you bring to your daily existence do me

a favor let Jack know what you thought
