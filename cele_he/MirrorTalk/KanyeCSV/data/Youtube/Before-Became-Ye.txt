okay first of all I've got a little

message for you from so that was what

she was saying okay so what is the

answer to that that was one in London as

cool as I do that you you all went

through a lot to get that question asked

so that was a whole lot I went through

to ask that question had I enjoyed

London

coming out just like London it's like

one of my homes I feel like like America

Japan London and Paris it's like my four

homes

I guess it's one way to look at it okay

um actually um I was quite and cuz I'm

not a real hip-hop guy so I was quite

impressed with the new album because

that was more music I will listen to the

electronics I'm a tease child I was into

synthesizer parents and stuff oh wow

great yes thank you I'm glad somebody

likes it other than just me

yeah cuz I get I get a lot of backlash

about this album I can imagine what

should be a read critic who wrote you

should sell headache pills for the album

because he can't stand it

yeah it gives him headaches what let us

know what was the idea to go somewhere

different than you did before I mean

just in life if you've liked the type of

music and you listen to it all the time

you know why not follow your heart why

not follow what makes you happy

I remember went up I made the song

American well I mean the movie American

Werewolf in Paris came out and he had

the theme song I think was by blur

nothing hurts like your mouth my mouth

and like me and my friends used to love

that song so much and it's like we

weren't supposed to like the song or

something cuz of where we were from

wholly like songs like um so kiss me

under the moonlight and I'd like all

these songs with just these incredible

melodies from the 80s and from the 90s a

lot of the 90 stuff the people keep on

saying 80s but they were like these mr.

Jones and me how's it like all these

sweeping melodies in Nirvana and

like that like and I'm like I really

love music and I love to sing songs and

I can make music so why not just make

music I have to stand above it you know

I would hope that all I can do is just

do what I feel is right and believe it

and make the best music I can and hope

that it overcomes every time because

that's my responsibility to keep putting

out groundbreaking music and I think my

music and it's now I just do what I'm

feeling at the time and if I'm tired of

something then I'm tired of and I don't

want to use it and if I'm that tired of

something

do want to use it and I just I just base

it off that like some people don't like

auto-tune but I do so I use it you know

why because my name is on out also you

were like the title of the album you

were using the item and you're from

Chicago where house music was born as

well and the 808 was one of their tools

to make house music

yeah so do you have any memories there

from that time that you were choosing

the a way to use you know it's like that

honors house music a house beat I

haven't quite fully accomplished that

but I'd like to I like to be able to

make an album that's a completely house

but as good as some of the house music

that some of the classics got a house

music hot doom didn't go conquer I'm

doomed

like I want to be able to make music

like that I just have to keep on going

the studio and trying like house music

used to have like these full-on

orchestrations horns symphonies these

scream and chorus lines on top of them

and stuff and they had like beat to it

so I'm just combining like a lot of

different styles of music and I think

because I'm hip-hop I feel like I have

the right to use whatever type of music

I want cuz that's one thing about

hip-hop is like will sample anything we

want just make it hip-hop but now like

more so than being hip-hop music I think

I'm Kanye West music it's like it's

something more than just hip-hop

we had this for ages that yeah but a

good a really really good gangster

record would never get old to me it's

like a great gangster movie they could

never get old I like I couldn't hip hop

I like gangster rappers a lot I've

always liked gangster rap music so I'm

not gonna say that I'm tired of it but I

will say that when I'm in my apartment

just chilling after wrapping all day

every night I don't put on it hip-hop

music I put on like Radiohead

I put on port is it I put on superhead a

tape by superhead videotape put on red

hot chili peppers I put on maybe

something like RV like the dream but I

seldom ly like turn on like the rap

music so the design the mountains how do

you think is a good symbol for the mood

I hear on the record but we'll say a

good moment to record a record that

sounds sad and blue and kind of Moody

was that like for you

well yeah people always asked was a

therapy and even though I scream out I

still feel like I didn't get my whole

point there's no way to express exactly

what I was going through but I think

it's it's always good to express what

you're going through to be expressive

because these songs might help other

people for what they're going through

especially what's weird is like women

really like this out and they connect

with it but men there's nobody who

speaks on a man's behalf of the way we

really feel what's the last album done

by a very like you know macho

guy that expressed feelings and emotion

they talked about heart not just like

sex and pretty girls and cars but

actually like kids and love and family

and success and time distribution

because the greatest thing that a man

has to give to anyone with is their kids

whether it's their wife is time and how

much time do we spend you know chasing

the American dream we're chasing money

and materialistic things how much time

do we actually give to the women and

children and that's what this album more

so than you know what type of music you

know the way I chose to express it that

message is what people need to leave

with the most I think do you think this

message will reach the people yeah I

think so but I think that people will be

dancing to it and everything and they'll

look up and say wow he was really

talking about real things in that like

it's net artificial you know it's not

artificial it's really soulful still

soul food successful and but you said

you feel kind of isolated from what's

important in life do you is that true I

mean do you feel isolated are you

missing something because you're famous

yeah just right now it's just think

about time for like me to have family

and for me to ration my time a little

bit better and spend more time just

focusing on those things I mean does

that mean you really throw your career

and say I stopped my fam new business

now and that's where the extreme isn't

it

are there people who are successful rock

stars to have kids so that doesn't mean

they didn't throw their career away life

is now all or nothing life sometimes is

a ration of this and a ration of that to

make the perfect mixture drink this is

fun one of the most famous singer was

American boy that you did it with

Estelle mm-hmm can you tell us how you

both Matt well yeah through John Legend

because that's John Legend's artist so I

came to the studio and we just listened

to the record and my rap actually was

way longer than that and we had to like

cut it down that was one verse and we

separated it to two verses and cut it

down because sometimes when I hear beat

I just start thinking of so many raps

for it yeah it's freestyle and I just

freestyle maybe like 10 times then I'll

get all my lines that I want to say just

be things that just are on the top of my

mind that I felt like saying you people

yeah used to used to now I don't produce

a lot at all only produce for my friends

like common jay-z don't produce a lot of

songs off people no I just focus more on

my music I just focus more because

sometimes you produce for other people

they're in charge of you know when it

comes out the way it's proceeded the way

people look at it you know when I

produce a song for me it's like not only

do I do the song but also like think

like the outfit that I'm gonna wear when

I do the song you know how I'm gonna

present it to the world and what the

video is gonna look at how it's gonna be

performed so if you produced songs for

people you'd want to artist it takes

that

of care in those records and there's

only a couple of artists in the world

who take that amount that care as much

as I do and some of them have their own

producers so like the killer's producing

themselves but that's the group that

cares that much by the way did you like

the latest Kazama

I've been listening to it I'm liking the

stuff I'm here and what do you think

last week I think it's a weird mixture

off I mean big off Talking Heads then

they have the Grace Jones piano in it

and then another song it's a weird

journey I think it's not doesn't sound

like one cohesive thing yeah you know I

think good this this album I just drop

is my most cohesive sounding album and

any of my albums like really sounds like

all these songs belong together whereas

some of my other songs albums you could

tell they will record it at completely

different times and kind of just placed

together yeah all right your father was

a black panther - this is that do you

have something a uribl do you rebel side

oh yeah I definitely think I'm right

well I just stand up for what I believe

in

that's it it's like that's what my

parents saw me and uh you know I make my

own mind up and then I I stand behind it

whatever it is you know particularly you

know I might not have it on top of my

mind now's like something I want to

rebelled against but whatever it is

whatever I believe in I'm standing up

for

I mean you raise your voice a lot you

you were talking about homophobia and

hip-hop you were saying things about

because we nothing that happened yeah

and so are you a political person I've

known a political oh I'm non-political

and politically incorrect

I'm not into politics either your honor

no not at all no yeah it's just that

politics are hobby for some people like

watching sports watching politicians

watching the news talking about it what

do you think about this what do you

think about that what do you think about

this what do you think about that I

don't get into it I like looking at

clothes and art and movies like in

making music so fine we have youth

magazine a teenager magazine Bravo and

this last week they put Obama in and I

mean America's far away so and why

should driven kids care about it he's a

pop star means answer he say he's a pop star

they put pop stars in that magazine

Obama is the most popular person on the

planet he's a pop star that's why they

played it the pop magazine okay

yes quite important you know with the

way I'm raised and the idea that it's a

place on earth that can allow something

like that to happen it's so incredible I

can't even see that happening in other

countries you know so it's just amazing

moment of time a moment of time makes

you believe that anything is possible
