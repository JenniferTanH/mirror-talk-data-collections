[Laughter]


good to see you again man

good to see you thanks for having me

it's uh been like a year

it's been like a year believe it or not

you look exactly the same

and the studio looks exactly the same

you might be on another part of the

world

no one knows yeah it's just uh

my my apartment that i rent you know i i

don't like to give out a lot of

information about where i'm at and that

kind of stuff so it's

very smart a plain wool that i've got

the lights down low so it looks kind of

a

a nice gray at least i think it's nice i

think it's beautiful

it looks amazing uh first of all

congratulations on the recent ruling

was a ninth district court of appeals

is that what it was it said that what

you exposed

with the warrantless wiretapping was in

fact

illegal and there are many people that

are calling for you to be pardoned now

yeah it's so much has happened this

ruling this is actually not the first

time

the federal government has uh or the

appeals courts have struck down

uh some of the federal surveillance

programs as unlawful

um but this one is really important

because it happened uh from an appeals

court it wasn't from a single judge it

was from uh

a panel of judges um and

what they had uh ruled was that the

nsa's bulk collection

of americans phone records uh was

illegal

and this is the very first um sort of

mass surveillance program that

i and the journalists um really that the

news was broken back in 2013 so this is

a huge victory for

privacy rights uh what it means is

there was this provision of the patriot

act like remember the patriot act

remember like

a zillion years ago i do everybody was

laying out patriotic patriotic your

friend alex jones you know i think

he was worried about that it's a

terrible name the there's a real problem

with that name

because if you're against the patriot

act it's like against

babies it's like like this is the

pro-baby act but meanwhile pro-baby act

they get to look through your email

you know what i mean it's like the word

patriot is attached to that in a very

disingenuous way like calling that

the patriot act is it's really creepy

that they could do they should have like

a number like bill a1

yeah you know you know what i'm saying

so you can debate the merits of it it's

just so much propaganda

attached to that name like the patriot

act

this is one of the funny things because

it should be a warning for anybody who's

in like

you know just anywhere in the country

and they hear on the news they're

talking about like the save

puppies you know act uh there's actually

one that's

uh been they've been trying to push

through recently

which is basically outlawing meaningful

encryption from the major internet

service providers like if

facebook or google for whatever reason

got out of bed in the morning and they

actually wanted uh to protect your uh

the security of your communications

uh in a way that even they can't break

like right now

uh google and facebook they do a great

job

keeping other people from spying on your

communications

but if google wants to rifle through

your inbox right if facebook wants to go

through all your direct messages

and give that to the federal government

like you tap one button and boom they've

got all of it happens

every single day well

companies like facebook have recently

realized this is a real problem for them

uh because first off they get all these

censorship demands

um that you've seen uh where like

there's

de-platforming requests and it happens

in one country right like if the u.s

government is allowed to decide what can

and can't be said by this person on this

platform

or uh the u.s goes look we got a court

warrant

they said uh a judge said we think this

person's a criminal we want you to hand

over everything you have on this person

and they do it right facebook does this

well guess who's next right the russian

government shows up at the door the next

day the chinese government shows up the

door the next day

and if these companies don't play ball

they get shut down in that country they

can no longer

no longer operate and so the idea that a

lot of them have

uh that they've considered and this has

actually

become a bigger thing in the covid

crisis where we start talking about like

contact tracing these companies want to

know where everybody is at all the time

so they can hand this over to medical

authorities or whatever

there's this idea called end to end

encryption

which what it means is that when you

send a message

you know when billy sends a message to

bobby billy and bobby both have the keys

to unlock that message

and it could be sent through facebook it

could be sent through google it could be

posted you know on a bulletin board in

the town square

but without that key which the people

who run the bulletin board

right the the people who own the

bulletin board google facebook

they don't have that key only the phones

at the end the laptops at the end the

people

on those they're the only people who

have the key so if somebody comes to

facebook and says we want to see that

information

facebook hands over the encrypted

message

right and facebook goes well here you go

here's our copy but we can't read it

you can't either now you've got to

actually do some work

on the government side and go get that

key yourself

and then you can read it right but we

can't read it

congress is trying to stop the basically

proliferation of that basic

and encryption technology and they're

calling it like the

child online predator act or something

like that

where they say it's all about protecting

uh the

posting of like child exploitation

material and really

really horrible stuff but that's not

actually what the law is about

the law is about making it easier for

spies and law enforcement

to reach deeper and deeper into your

life with a simple warrant stamped by

any court

the funny thing is this never used to be

uh the way law enforcement worked in the

united states

i mean when you hear about a warrant

what does that mean to you what can the

cops get with a warrant

well usually i think it means that they

can come in your

house and search right the the the real

issue with

warrants in when it pertains to

encryption like when you're talking

about the child

safety act or whatever they're calling

it

anyone would say yes we have to stop

child predators

but the problem with having the ability

to use something like that to stop

child predators in my eyes i i start

thinking

well if i really wanted to look into

someone what i would do is i would send

them some malware that would put

child pornography on their computer and

then i would have

all of the motive that i need

to go and look through everything like

say if they're if they were

a political dissident if they were doing

something against the government

and you were someone who was uh acting

in bad faith and you decided okay

we want to look into this guy but we

don't have a warrant what what are the

laws

what what can we get away with it well

we have the child endangerment act

and so because of that we're allowed to

peer into anything

but we just have to have motive so we

have to well

do we have motive all you'd have to do

is and we we both know this

it's very easy to put something illegal

on someone's computer if they're not

paying attention

it's very easy to install like you could

send someone a text message that looks

like

a routing number for a package they're

going to get they click on that

and then you what is that um what the

israelis have uh pegasus

right yeah you you've read up on this

yeah so

well it's uh it's from brian fogle's new

film the dissident which is

uh about jamal khashoggi's murder and

how

the saudis used that to use they

actually

tapped into jeff bezos's phone and

that's where

all of this is the suspicion is that

that that's where all of those

uh national enquirer photos came out and

all the attacks on him

because they they had access to his

actual phone through this so someone

could easily

get into your stuff if you're not paying

attention

and then they could use you know

whatever

acts they've come up with whatever it's

the patriot act or whatever act

where they could just get into

everything you're doing look at your

whatsapp messages look at your

your facebook messages it's real sneaky

and it's it's dangerous

it's it's a dangerous precedent to set

yeah i mean there's a lot to this let me

go into some of that in a little depth

so you mentioned the nso group in their

their pegasus malware set

and this is very much a real thing like

you're a well-read guy um

this is like

this company uh the ceo's name i think

is shalev julio

um is uh run in israel it was previously

owned

uh actually by an american venture

capital firm i believe they've been uh

re-bought out

but it doesn't really matter their

entire business

is preying on flaws in the critical

infrastructure

of all the software running on the most

popular devices in the world

the number one target right is the

iphone and this is because the iphone

as secure as it is relative to a lot of

other phones

is a monoculture right like if you if

you have an iphone

you get these little software update

notifications all the time that are like

hey please update to the

the most recent version of ios and

that's a fabulous thing that's a

wonderful thing for security

because the number one way that people's

devices get screwed if it's not just

through user error

right like you entering your password

somewhere you shouldn't it's like a fake

site

it looks like gmail but it's not

actually gmail you just gave the guy

your password now he uses your password

to log in

but to actually break into a device is

that it's not

patched right patch means getting these

uh

security updates these little code

updates

that fix holes that researchers found in

the security device

well apple's really good about rolling

these out all the time for everybody in

the world the problem is

basically all these different iphones

right you got an iphone 6 you got an

iphone 8 you got an iphone x you got an

iphone you know

three whatever these are all running

a pretty narrow band of uh

software versions and so these guys go

if they want to target for example

android phones like google phones like a

samsung galaxy or something like that

there's like a billion different phones

made by a billion different people

half of them are completely out of date

but

what it means is it's not one version of

software they're running it's like 10

000 and this is actually bad for

security on the individual level

but it's good for security in a very

unusual way which is the guys who are

developing the exploits

the guys like this nso group who are

trying to find ways to break

into phones they now have to have like

50 different handsets running 50

different versions of software they're

all changing they've got different

hardware they've got

different chip sets for like they've got

different like all kinds of just

technical variables

that can screw up the way they attack uh

your phone and then when they find one

it only works on like this samsung

galaxy

line it doesn't work on like the google

pixel line or it doesn't work on like a

nokia line or something like that

whereas they realize if they find a way

to attack an iphone

which is actually you know this is

difficult this is really difficult stuff

now it works against basically every

iphone

and who has iphones all the rich people

right all the important people all the

lawmakers all the the guys who are in

there

so they've made a business on basically

attacking the iphone

and selling it to every two-bit thug uh

who runs a police department in the

world

you know they sell this stuff to saudi

arabia they sell this to mexico

and there's a group of researchers in

canada uh working at a university called

the citizen lab

and uh these guys are really like the

best in the world at tracking what

nso group is doing if you want to learn

about this stuff the real stuff

look up citizen lab and the nso group uh

and what they have found uh is

all the people who are being targeted um

by the nso group the classes of people

the countries that are using this

and you know it's not like the local

police department in germany

trying to bust up you know a terrorism

ring or something like that

it's the mexican government spying on

the head of the mexican opposition

we're trying to look at human rights

defenders who are investigating like

student disappearances

or it's people like the friends and

associates of jamal khashoggi

uh who was murdered by the saudi

government or it's

people like dissidents in bahrain and

these

like petro states uh these bad actors

nationally will pay

literally tens of millions of dollars

each year just to have the ability to

break into an iphone for a certain

number of times because that's how these

guys uh do it they sell their business

plan they go

we'll let you break in any iphone uh

just by basically sending a text message

to this phone all you need to find is

the phone number or a person who's

running an iphone

uh and we will exploit something uh

which will give you total if that

happens to someone

i'm sorry but if that happens to someone

could they

just get a new phone and does the

exploit is the exploit

specific to their account or is the

exploit on the

the physical phone so the question or

the answer to this is it really depends

on the exploit

like the easiest uh forms of exploit or

rather the easier

types of exploits are where they send

you a text message right and it'll be

like an imessage or something like that

and it's got a link in it that'll be

like oh gosh terrible news you know your

buddy's father just died

um and we're making funeral arrangements

are you gonna be there

it's the day after tomorrow and when you

click the link for the funeral

arrangements it

opens your web browser and the web

browser on your phone

is always the biggest most complicated

process in it right

there's a zillion lines of code in this

as opposed to an instant messenger where

there's fewer lines of code in it

and they'll find one thing in that where

there's a flaw

that lets them feed instructions not

just to the browser

but basically escape the little sandbox

that the browser's supposed to plan

that's supposed to be safe where it

can't do anything too harmful

and it'll run out of this sandbox and

it'll ransack

your your phone's like hard-wired

operating system uh the the system image

it'll like give them uh privileges

to do whatever they want on your phone

as if they are you

and then as if they have a higher level

of privilege than you they have system

level privileges

to change the phone's operation

permanently right and this

is the problem is on the phone you can

replace the phone

right and they'll lose access to that

but if they've already used that

to gain the passwords that you use to

access you know your icloud or whatever

when they have controlled the phone

they've already got your photo roll

right they've already got your contact

list they already have everything that

you've ever

put in that phone they already have all

your notes they already have all your

files they already have everything

that's in your message history right

they can pull that out

immediately and now not because they

have

you know all your contacts and things

like that they see that phone stop being

active

they know you've changed your phone

number all they have to do is find the

new phone number and then they can try

to go after you again

the benefit is uh with that old style of

attack

if you get that message and you don't

click that link you're

somebody in a vulnerable class right

you've had these kind of attacks

answered before it looks suspicious

you don't know who this person is the

number isn't right something like that

and you save that link you don't click

the link you don't do anything with that

link but you send it

to a group like citizen lab uh they can

basically use that link to

basically use uh like a dummy phone like

a sort of a trojan horse to go to the

site

that would attack your phone and catch

it and this is what the

sort of process that all of their

research is based on

there are other different types of

attacks that actually don't have these

defenses against them that are far

more scary but the bottom line is can i

stop you for a second

what is citizen lab citizen lab you just

said yeah the citizen lab is the name of

this research group at the university in

canada uh who basically studies

state-sponsored and corporate malware

attacks against civil society

it's ron run by a guy named ron dieber i

believe

you guys will have to fact check me on

that one i think he just published a

book

actually or is publishing a book about

all of this

but it's really they are the the world

leaders uh in my opinion

in uh basically investigating these kind

of attacks and exposing them

it's true public service um

let's go back to that one thing i asked

you about warrants and you talked about

the fact that like people could plant

evidence on things and then get

motivation

or um rather they could show probable

cause

right to the court to then investigate

you um and then they can get everything

and you said you know

you thought that uh a warrant man they

can go and search your house and this is

the kind of thing that we you know

modern people are used to thinking of in

the context of a warrant

cops go to a specific place looking for

specific things uh that are elements of

a crime

now you know you you've heard all these

things where like

cops find a way to like stop somebody

and they like are like oh i smelled pot

or whatever and they try to you know

toss their car or whatever

or plain sight doctrines where they open

the door and the guy sits down talks and

they go

you know i see a bong or something you

know that's paraphernalia you're going

to jail

but uh until i think it was 1967

warrants in the united states could only

be used

to gather two things they were called

the fruits and instrumentalities

of a crime which meant even if the cops

knew you did it

even if cops knew you you know rode the

subway or worked for this company or

whatever

they couldn't get all the company's

records uh they couldn't if they existed

uh get all the emails that you ever

wrote they couldn't get

your friend to turn over like an

exchange of letters that you had with

this person

the fruits of the crime were the things

that they gained from it right if they

robbed the bank

the cops could get the sack of money the

instrumentalities were the tools that

were used right like if you

used dynamite or a crowbar or a getaway

car

they could seize all of those things uh

but

the idea that the cops can get

everything

the idea that the fbi can get all these

records you know

all of these things your whole history

is very much

a new thing and nobody talks about that

today

we we just presume it's normal we

presume it's okay

but between 1967 and today think about

how many more

records there are about your life and

how things

like how you live private things about

you that have nothing to do with

criminality

and everything to do with the intimacy

of of who you are

and the fact that all of that now today

is exposed and not just to

let's say you love the us government

let's say you you know you

you are like throwing cookouts for your

local police department

but every other government in the world

too

and we really need to ask ourselves how

much

information uh do the authorities of the

day

need to do their job right how much do

we want them to have how much is proper

and appropriately

and necessary and how much is too much

and if we decide the cops shouldn't have

this if we decide the spies shouldn't

have this

well why in the hell should facebook or

google or somebody trying to

sell you nikes why should they have this

yeah um and what's the answer to that

they shouldn't yeah i mean right but

nobody wants to go backwards

once you have gained a certain amount of

access and you could

justify that access like we're stopping

crimes like the patriarch

and then which later the patriot act two

which was even

more overreaching once they have that

kind of power

they never go you know what we went too

far

we we have too much access to your

privacy

and even if you've committed a crime we

shouldn't have

unrelated access to all these other

activities that you're involved in

yeah and i mean that's exactly the thing

about the whole save the puppies act

right if it's got a name

like that you gotta be like no there's

something doesn't smell right here this

is

this is this there's something bad in

this and i mean

this so this gets back to uh

that uh initial topic of

uh what what did the court decide right

so we had the patriot act and the

patriot act was this giant law

that had been been written long before 9

11.

it was just sitting on the shelf uh and

the department of justice the fbi

they knew they couldn't pass this they

knew nobody would live with it

because it was an extreme expansion of

government authority

and then 9 11 happened right and that's

really where it all started to go wrong

that's where we got the rise of this new

authoritarianism

that we see continuing in the united

states today right like

if you think and you know like you have

problems with

what's happening under donald trump but

you also had problems under like what

was happening with obama and the

expansion of the war on whistleblowing

uh you had problems with the way drone

strikes were going out of control

you go well really where did this all

start right where did it start to go

wrong

personally i think 911

was where we made a fundamental mistake

and that was we were so frightened in

the movement because we had had such an

extraordinary and rare terrorist attack

uh succeed which by the way could have

been present

prevented and i think we discussed this

in the last episode

the congress you know they were they

were just terrified they said look

intelligence services

cops fbi whoever anything you want blank

check here you go

that was the patriot act and at the time

groups like the american civil liberties

union

they were like uh

we are worried that this goes too far

because god bless them that's what the

american civil liberties union does

and one of the provisions that they had

a problem with was this section 215

of the patriot act uh

which i believe they were calling at the

time the library records provision

and what it said basically this tiny

little little uh phrase

in the law said the fbi can basically

get

any records that it deems relevant to a

counter on terrorism investigation under

a warrant

and the worst thing the aclu could

imagine

was that these guys would go to the

library and get what kind of books

you're reading and like oh

shock horror this is the worst thing

these guys could do

and so they protested then they lost and

this passed and it went on

and lo and behold 10 years later

we find out in 2013 they had used uh

this provision

that people were worried about just

going after individuals library records

to instead get the phone records of not

an individual not a group

but everybody in the united states

who was making calls on u.s

telecommunications providers delivered

to the nsa daily

by these companies right so no matter

who you were no matter how innocent you

were

the fbi was getting these because they

said well every phone call

is relevant to a counter-terrorism

investigation and the court went

finally you know this is seven years

after 2013.

then with guys that's too much if your

definition of relevance is basically

anything anywhere all the time is

relevant to a counter-terrorist

investigation

the question is what then is not

relevant

what is the limiting principle on this

what where is the end

and this is a very important thing

because even if it's not enough right

even if this doesn't shut down all the

programs the program was actually

already stopped a few years ago

because of previous court decisions and

changes in law

the fact that the courts are finally uh

beginning to look at these

the the impacts of these sweeping new

technologies that allow

governments to see all of these

connections and interactions that we're

having every day

they're finally putting limits on it and

that is i think transformative

uh it is the foundation of what we will

see in the future will begin to

be the first meaningful

guarantees of privacy rights in the

digital age

now that you have been uh at least

according to

this court exonerated or justified

what what happens to you and

what happens to what they've been doing

and how how much of the breaks do they

hit on this

like how what changes does anything

change in the government's sweeping

surveillance

it's it's a great question i mean you

would think

uh when

you get a court not even a first level

court but an appeals court

that looks at these issues you know

they're talking about serious stuff

they're talking about counter-terrorism

investigations by the way in the same

thing

uh in the same decision they said the

government

has been arguing you know for 20 years

now these programs were saving lives

they were stopping terrorist attacks

they said uh

you know first they said mass

surveillance had stopped 54 terrorist

attacks in the united states

then they dropped it to seven and then

they dropped it to one

and the one terrorist attack uh or uh

terrorist conspiracy whatever that they

said it did stop

was this case that was just decided

and the court found and this is

important after

looking at the government's classified

evidence so this is not just the court

deciding on their own

this is the government going look here's

all the evidence that we have

the top secret stuff the stuff that

nobody can see please don't

you know say our program is ineffective

or whatever the court looked at it

and they went holy crap it did

this invasion of hundreds of millions of

americans privacy

happening over the span of decades did

not make a difference

in this case they said even if

or even in the absence of this program

if it hadn't existed the government had

never done it

they still would have busted this ring

because they were already closing in on

them the fbi

already had all the evidence they needed

to get a warrant to get the records

through traditional means

and the fact the government had been

saying congress had been saying for

years and years and years that this

program was necessary

uh the governor the court says that was

misleading

which is legalese for saying the

government's effing liars

on this uh so that raises the question

of okay like as you said

well what now how does this change

everything well it does mean the

government has to stop

doing this particular kind of program

directly but that program had already

shut down

and the government has a really great

team

of lawyers uh for every agency right the

doj has got lawyers the white house has

lawyers the fbi has lawyers the nsa has

lawyers and the cia has lawyers

and the only thing these guys are paid

to do all day

is to look at basically these legal

opinions from the court

that says all the ways the government

broke the law and go huh

is there any way we can just rejigger

this program slightly

so that we can dodge around that court

ruling

to go all right you know uh the abuses

are still happening

but they're happening in a less abusive

way and and then it's business as usual

so this is always the process um

with the court's uh ruling against the

government this is not an exceptional

uh thing in the case of the you know

it's nsa and cia

what happens is when the government

breaks the law

as the court has ruled them to do last

week

there is no punishment right there is no

criminal liability

uh for all the bastards at the head of

the fbi the head of the nsa

um who were violating americans rights

for decades those guys don't go to

prison

they don't lose their jobs they don't

even see the inside you know smell the

inside of a courtroom

where they're the ones wearing handcuffs

and because of that it creates a culture

of unaccountability of impunity right

which means with each generation of

government officials they study this

they study the cases against them they

study where they won they study where

they lost

and what they do is they try to create

exactly what just happened

which is a system where they can break

the law

for 10 years you know 2001 uh to 2013

basically

and no one even knows that it's

happening classification protects that

right

then eventually it gets exposed there's

a leak of course somebody blows the

whistle on it right

it becomes a scandal the government you

know they'll disown this program they'll

change the law there

but somebody like the aclu

will sue the government and so the

courts will finally

be forced to look at these things but

the wheels of justice turn slow right

the government will try to put the

brakes on it um

the plaintiffs the civil society

organizations that are suing

will have to gather evidence it's really

difficult to do because the government's

not providing anything it's all

classified

and then basically it takes another five

years another 10 years for the court to

get to their verdict

and then we have it but then nobody goes

to jail right nobody actually faces

serious consequences who is responsible

for the wrongdoing

and so the cycle continues but having

said that

like it might feel disempowering might

people might go oh we can't win

but this is in the context of a system

where we lack

accountability where the government does

have a culture of impunity

this is what winning looks like because

things do get better

the problem is they get better by

decades they get better by half

centuries and centuries

if you look at the united states you

know 200 years ago 100 years ago

things were objectively worse on

basically every measure

the fact that we have to crawl to the

future

is a sad thing when we know it could be

fixed

very quickly by establishing some kind

of criminal liability for people like

james clapper the former director of

national intelligence

who lied under oath to congress and the

american people saying

exactly this program didn't exist

the nsa wasn't collecting any

information on millions or hundreds of

millions of americans

when in fact they were doing that every

day

obama did not fire him right obama did

not charge him obama let him serve out

the end of his days and then retire

happily

but it's not an obama problem right

we see the same kinds of abuses

happening under the trump administration

we saw the same kind of abuses

happening under the bush administration

and the only way this changes

um materially is if our government

changes structurally right and that's

kind of the issue that i think everybody

in the country sees

when you look at the economy when you

look at all the struggle when you look

at all the class conflict and divide and

the political

partisanship that's happening today

the problem isn't right like about this

law or this court ruling or this agency

it's about inequality of opportunity of

access

uh even of privilege right i know people

don't like talking about that

it's uncomfortable for people like oh my

god you know are you like whatever

but the reality is we have a few people

in the country

you know the jeff bezos the bill gates

that own

everything like 10 people owning half

the country

and half the country owning nothing at

all

and this applies to influence

right when you have that kind of

disproportionality

uh of resources you have that kind of

disproportionality

of influence your vote means less your

ability to

change the law means less your access to

the courts

means less and that's how we end up in

the situation where we are today

that's very disheartening well it

doesn't have to be because the important

thing is we can change it

can we though i mean like what can we do

and what can anybody change this point

to stop this overwhelming

power that the government has to

invade your privacy and to all the

things that you exposed

when you talk about how the particular

program that was in place has been shut

down but all they do

is manipulate it slightly do it so that

you can argue in court that it's not the

same thing

that is a different thing come up with

other justifications for it

and withhold evidence and then drag the

process

out for years and years and years and to

for you to be so optimistic is really

kind of spectacular considering the fact

that you've been

hiding in another country allegedly we

don't even know you might be in ohio

we don't know you know we don't know

like but but

but you are essentially on the lamb and

for exposing something that has now been

determined to be

illegal so you are correct when you go

back to obama's hope and

uh what was his uh his website

hope and change hope and change a big

part of hope and change

was protecting whistleblowers do you

remember that and that was all

deleted later later on they were like

yeah let's go back and take that [ __ ]

out we didn't know i didn't know what it

was like to actually be president back

then i was just

trying to get in there but the hope and

change stuff was still

there when you were being tried was

still there when they were chasing you

and and and trying to find your location

when the guardian article came out the

hope and change [ __ ] was still

still online yeah and that's the fact

that you're so optimistic

even though you've been [ __ ] over

royally i mean you are

in my opinion you're a hero i really

think that

and i really and i really think that

what what you exposed

is hugely important for uh

the american citizens to understand that

absolute power corrupts absolutely and

these people

had uh the ability to look into

everything and they just still do

they have the ability to look into

everything you're doing and

the fact that through these years it

literally stopped zero terrorist attacks

zero so this sweeping

overwhelming intrusion of your privacy

had no impact whatsoever on your safety

well it wasn't about safety it was about

power right

they told us it was about safety that

was

again it's the save the puppies act um

if you uh

if you see government saying all these

things are for safety they're protecting

you

and they never establish the efficacy of

it

the chances are there it probably isn't

effective

because you know the government leaks

all the time um you know if they say

uh we saved this person we did that you

know whenever they're being criticized

they go on tv and they

very seriously go oh that's classified

and you know we can't expose that and

you never hear of the successes we do

because it's so important that they stay

secret

look i worked for the cia i worked for

the nsa that's [ __ ]

um when they do something great you know

it's on the front page of the new york

times by the end of the day

because they're fighting for budget

they're fighting for clout they're

fighting for authority they're fighting

for new laws not constantly

uh and so there are no real

accomplishments that are

in the shadows that they just don't tell

us i mean very rarely think about when

we got bin laden

right you know obama was like i want a

press conference within the next

20 minutes and again this is not to bag

on obama

any president would do this um that's

just

how it is now of course there are

some uh secret successes but it's about

stuff that no one cares about it's stuff

that wouldn't win the political clout

it's like

they gained an advantaged negotiating

position on the price of

shrimp and clove cigarettes which was

actually one of the stories that came

out of some kind of

uh classified disclosure that i think

was from from wikileaks

that kind of stuff it actually does

happen right

but we're never having a conversation of

do you want to give up

all of your privacy rights so that we

can get better prices on shrimp and

clove cigarettes

like that would be a very different

political conversation than

do you want to give up all of your

privacy rights because if you don't your

children

will die and you know

you know it saved the puppies right

exactly save the puppies 20 20.

um so this

this thing you ask about uh you know me

and

optimism like i have been criticized

relentlessly

uh for being a naive optimist right um

and my answer is that you don't

do what i did unless you believe that

people can do better

i took a very comfortable life you know

i was living in hawaii with the woman

that i loved i had to do basically no

work but go in the office and read spy

feeds about people uh you know all day

long

um and i could have done that you know

for the rest of my life quite happily

would have been great

um i set that on fire because

i believed that what i saw was wrong and

i believe that people deserve to know

about it and i believe that if people

did know about it that things would

change

i did not believe it was going to save

the world i did not believe

i was going to get you know a ticker

tape parade and a pardon you know be

welcomed with open arms there's actually

if you watch citizen 4

which is the documentary from 2013 where

i was meeting with reporters

laura poitras had the camera rolling in

the room when we talked for the first

time

um i said you know the government's

gonna

say i harm national security i put

everybody in jeopardy they're gonna

charge me under the espionage act

uh and they really did try to destroy my

life they tried to put me in prison

forever

and to this day they are still trying to

do uh

the same thing that's just how it is you

know this wasn't like

even though even though yeah even though

the the most recent ruling has showed

that you were correct

and what they were doing was illegal and

you exposed a crime yeah well i mean

this is this is a

a continuing story in 2013 uh

you know when this first came out uh

president obama went out on stage uh

you know because he was getting singed

in the press

and said uh you know uh take it from me

nobody is listening to your phone calls

uh even though nobody says just metadata

yeah nobody said they were

listening to your phone calls it wasn't

like they had headsets on

uh you know 300 plus million people in

the united states

you'd have to have computers do that um

but what they did do was they collected

the records of your phone calls and to

an

analyst an intelligence analyst that's

more very valuable

than the transcripts your phone calls we

care less

about what you said on the phone then

who you called

when you called them what else you were

doing what your phone was doing right

the websites that you would access the

cell phone towers they were connected to

all of those things that metadata

creates what's called the social graph

your pattern of life

it says based on when your phone becomes

active in the morning when you start

calling people when you start browsing

when you check your

you know twitter feed you're scrolling

on instagram whatever

that's when you wake up when it stops

that's when you go to sleep

we see where you are we see where you

live we see who you live with

all of those things right that's just

from metadata you don't need the content

of your communications i don't need to

see

what picture you posted on instagram

to know you're awake and active and

you're communicating with this

person uh at this phone this place this

area code this ip address you know this

version of software whether they're

using android or ios you know all of

these

things and now as we get smartphones as

your cars

begin connecting to the internet uh it's

just richer and richer and richer data

i don't know where i was going with that

sorry i got off topic but

um the

the bottom line is things get better

they get

better slowly all right sorry now obama

was saying you know nobody listens to

your phone calls right

that was june 2013. by january of 2014

giving a state of the union address

he went although he could never condone

what i did the conversation that i

started has made us stronger as a nation

he was calling for the end of this

program the passage of a new law

called the usa freedom act another save

the puppies act

uh which was better than the thing it

was replacing but still really bad

um and he did that not out of the

goodness of his heart

he did that because the court in

december of 2013

had ruled these programs were unlawful

and likely unconstitutional

and this is again it's not an obama

thing it's a power thing this is how the

system works right

but year by year step by step things get

better we make progress a little bit at

a time and the fact that

someone is suing the fact that the aclu

is bringing this case and we should

thank them for that

for years which is a difficult and

expensive proposition with no guarantee

of success

means that we have stronger privacy

result rights

seven years later as a result that

doesn't mean

we save the world that doesn't mean we

relax we sit down on the couch you know

there's the golden sunset

that's not how life works it is a

constant struggle

but when we do struggle when we do stand

up we believe in something so strongly

we don't

merely believe in it uh but we risk

something for that belief uh we work

together and we

pulled the species forward an inch at a

time

we move away from that swamp of impunity

and unaccountability

uh into a future where hey maybe not

just a little guy

breaks the law and goes to jail but

maybe

a senator maybe an attorney general

maybe

a president right and that would be a

very good precedent to have

do you wonder whether or not someone

will

use you as a political chess piece

at this point and decide i mean i i

believe if

correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty

sure you have overwhelming support of

the general public

most people believe that what you did

was was a good thing for america

and that you are in fact a patriot i i

think the vast majority people

and the people that i've talked to i

have talked to a few people that

disagree with that

they're misinformed they were

misinformed about what you did and what

information you were leaked or whether

or not people's

lives were put in danger because of that

and i had to explain

the whole chain of events and where the

information actually

was how it was leaked and what you had

done

to protect people there's there's a

could you plea please explain

that because it wasn't just that the

information was dumped

yeah so i mean this is really the

subject of our our our last conversation

goes on for three hours but i wrote a

book

yeah but i just would just so this will

stand alone i'm yeah

i'll go through it so uh the idea and

this is the subject of my first book

permanent record which was why i came on

last year and actually

uh just this week the soft cover came

out so it's more affordable

for people who didn't want to get it

before um

is this story right it's who i am where

i came from why i did this

how and what it meant i didn't just

reveal information i gave it to

journalists right

these journalists were only given access

to the information on the condition that

they would publish

no story simply because it was

newsworthy or interesting right they

weren't going to click bait classified

documents

they would only publish stories if they

were willing to make an independent

institutional judgment and stand by it

that it was in the public interest that

this be known right

and then as an extraordinary measure on

top of that before they publish the

stories right and this is

not me publishing things putting them

out on the internet or blog or something

which i could have done would have been

very easy

uh it's not me telling them what to

write or not to write they're

doing this the guardian the washington

post you know der spiegel

they are then going to the united states

government in advance of publication

and giving the government a chance an

adversarial opportunity to

argue against publication to go you guys

don't get it you know

snowden's a liar these documents are

false or

he's not lying and yes these are true

but these programs are effective they're

saving lives whatever

and here's what we can show you to

convince you please don't publish this

or leave out this detail

and in every case i'm aware of that

process was followed and that's why

now in 2020 remember we're seven years

on from 2013. the government has never

shown a single example of any harm that

has come as a result of the publication

of these documents back in 2013 the

revelation of mass surveillance

and it's that's what i wanted to bring

yeah and i mean

it's unscientific uh but i've seen polls

run on twitter

uh very recently uh in the last few

weeks when this pardon question came out

where 90 like 90 plus percent of people

were in favor of a pardon and that's

crazy

uh even in 2013 when we were doing well

you know it was like 60 percent

um in favor among young people but it

was like 40 percent for older people

but that's because the government was on

tv every sunday you know bringing these

uh

cia suits going uh who were there with

their very stern

faces going oh this caused great damage

and cost lives and everything like that

but those arguments stopped being

convincing when

seven years later after they told us and

the sky is falling

the atmosphere never catches fire right

the oceans never boil off we're still

alive

uh and i i think people can see through

that and that was

again this exactly what you said people

don't know

this history uh that that 10 percent who

are against it

and actually a lot of the 90 who are

even in favor of it

um they don't know the details it wasn't

well covered by the media at the time it

was all about this person said that that

person said that is it true is it false

you know

sort of uh they were playing on

character

they were trying to make a drama out of

it and that's a big part of why i wrote

permanent record

uh and it's been tremendously gratifying

to see

people connect to it and actually this

uh you know i mentioned it

uh we talked on on twitter when we were

talking about the possibility of having

this conversation

and i was like i looked back at our

first conversation we had

and it's had like 16 million views

man that's for a three hour conversation

uh i like set

and then probably an equal amount of

people just listen to it in audio

right and that that was just for one

clip on youtube

there were smaller clips like talking

about cell phone surveillance and that

was like another 10 million views

77 000 comments uh the book on amazon

has

thousands of reviews it's got a 4.8

rating which

like by the number of people and how

it's rated

that's one of the best autobiographies

according to ordinary people the

audience

in like years and to see that after

these years of attacks

to me is evidence that despite all these

news guys

uh at night going well senator you know

uh

no one really cares about privacy these

days these kids with their facebooks and

their instagrams

uh you know people do care

what they're actually feeling is kind of

what you got to earlier with like this

sensation that nothing changes

like even when we win we lose but the

thing is you've got to have

a broader view of time

you've got to look at the sweep of

history rather than the atmosphere of

the moment

because right now yes things are very

bad

and even if you love donald trump

because i know some of your viewers do

you got to admit a lot of things in the

world suck right now a lot of things in

the country

suck right now but the thing is they

only get better

if somebody does the hard work to make

them better

and there's no magic wand there's no

happy ending right life is not that

simple but together

we can make it better and we do that

through

struggle do you

uh has there been any discussion about

someone pardoning you

has there been i mean this was the

question initially that led to this

but i wanted you to expand on what would

actually went down but

has there been any discussion about you

being pardoned or someone using you as

like i said a political chess piece

because you it

would be a smart thing and if anybody

has had a problem with the intelligence

community it is donald trump

i mean he's the only president in our in

any memory

that has had open disagreements and been

openly disparaging of the intelligence

community well that's not true

it was jfk but that didn't go very well

that's right

i forgot about that good point yeah that

that went terrible for him

uh for trump for trump it actually seems

to be a positive in some strange way

um if anybody is going to pardon you i

would imagine

that would be the guy so this idea of

like the political bargaining chip

has actually been used in a different

way uh there was the idea

um and it's funny because this was

actually promoted by all these like cia

deputy directors and whatnot

who were responsible for these abuses of

americans rights

who were writing opinion pieces in the

newspaper and they were like you know

what if vladimir putin you know sends

snowden to trump as like an inauguration

gift

wouldn't that be terrible for him and

they were like intent

you know um but i don't think

when we talk about this stuff uh

i i don't think there's anything i can

do to control one of the things people

have asked is like would i accept

a pardon uh from donald trump and i

think that

apprehends what a pardon is and how it

works

uh pardon's not a contract a pardon is

not something that you agree to

uh pardon is a constitutionally

enumerated power

i think it's article two section two um

where the reason that it exists

uh is basically a check on the laws and

the judiciary

uh where the laws as written become

corrosive to the intention

of them and this is something that i

think actually is meaningful you know

people are like are you gonna ask

uh donald trump for a pardon and the

answer is is no

um but i will ask for pardon

for terry albert and daniel hale and

reality winner

and all the other american

whistleblowers who have been treated

unfairly by this system

the whole thing that brought this up was

two weeks ago some journalists

asked the president like oh you know

what do you think about snowden are you

going to pardon him

and he said he seemed to be thinking

about it he heard i have been treated

very unfairly

that's accurate because it's impossible

to get a fair

trial uh under the espionage act which

is what i've been charged under

and every american whistleblower since

daniel ellsberg in the 1970s has been

charged

under this law the espionage act which

makes no distinction between someone

who is stealing secrets and selling them

to foreign governments

which neither i nor any of these other

people have done

and giving them freely to journalists

to advance the public interest of the

american people

rather than the private interests of

these spies you know

individually and this is the kind of

uh this is the kind of circumstance for

which

the pardon power exists where the courts

and judges will not or cannot

end a fundamentally unfair and abusive

circumstance in the united states either

because they're uh

fearful of being criticized of soft on

terrorism or whatever

uh or because the law prohibits them

from doing so the the problem with the

espionage act

is it means you can't tell the jury why

you did what you did

you cannot mount what's called a public

interest offense

where you say hell yeah i broke the law

i took a classified document and i gave

it to the journalist and the journalist

published it and then it went to the

courts and the court said

this guy was right the government was

breaking the law

in the courts if i were you know in in

prison today uh

as reality winners in prison today or

rather daniel hale

uh who revealed uh government abuses

related to the drone program or

terry albury who revealed

problems with uh racial policies in the

fbi

how they were being abused um when these

guys are on trial

all of that stuff is forbidden from

being spoken

daniel ellsberg's lawyer uh asked daniel

ellsberg

why did you do it in court in open court

under oath you know why did you publish

or provide

journalists the pentagon papers and the

prosecutor said objection objection he

can't say that

and the judge said sustained fine he

can't say it and his attorney looked at

the judge like he was crazy and said

i've never heard

of a trial where the jury is not allowed

to hear

why uh a defendant did what they did

and the judge said well you're seeing

one now

and this is why the pardon power exists

well that's what's so creepy about

something like the espionage espionage

act

if if you can't even establish a motive

you can't even explain

that you were doing this for the

american people that there's a real

precedent that should be set for for

this kind of thing especially

in regards to what you're being charged

with which has now been determined

that you were exposing something that

was in fact illegal

and this is it's it's it's an incredibly

un-american thing it's it's very

un-american

it really is but this is it's

disturbingly so i mean we see these kind

of injustices happening in the united

states every day and it's not about the

espionage act specifically i mean you

see with drug charges you see it with

civil forfeiture

asset forfeiture where like you know

they take an old lady's car because her

nephew was selling weed or something

like that

and there's no way for her to get it

back whether we're talking civil whether

we're talking federal whether we're

talking um

sorry civil or criminal whether we're

talking federal or state

we see where the system of laws in the

united states

is letting people down constantly

uh but the question becomes how do we

fix this how does that get addressed and

you know you can mount a national

campaign you can try to change the law

but as we talked about

before unless you're unless you're jeff

bezos unless you're bill gates that's

very difficult to do

but the governor can pardon people for

state crimes the president can pardon

people for federal crimes but we have

not

developed a compassionate culture that

actually looks at this

like every president has abused their

pardon power

or their pardon authority to sort of let

their cronies

off the hook we've seen this president

we've seen in the previous presidents

sure but it is very difficult to

establish

an understanding among average people uh

that it's actually okay for presidents

to use this power more liberally

when particularly we're talking about

non-violent offenses when we're talking

about things

uh that have not you know uh they're not

that controversial but they are being

controversialized because of the

political atmosphere of partisanship

where everything has to be criticized

for political advantage from one side or

the other everything's become a football

well particularly in your case when

you're talking about polls that show

90 percent of people support you being

pardoned

and this recent ruling that what you

exposed was illegal

i wonder how much the president actually

knows about your case

you know because it's a good question i

mean he's

famous for barely paying attention in

briefings and

you know i mean i just i can't imagine

that in 2013

this was fully on his radar where he

investigated it and read all the

documents and really got

deep into it i i can't imagine he really

knows

everything that went down i bet he

hasn't seen citizen four i mean i bet i

sure i

really you know what i mean

listen if i had his number i really

would um and i i do know

people who know him and i am going to

communicate that

uh after this conversation i think that

would be

i literally think that would win him a

tremendous amount of political favor

i really do i think particularly at this

point in time

where people are really look if there's

ever a time where people are fed up

about the overreaching

power of government it's during this

pandemic lockdown

you know for good or for bad whether

it's incorrect or incorrect

people are very frustrated right now

with power

they're very frustrated right now with

the draconian measures that some states

have put in place to keep people from

working and

and their eyes keep people safe and all

this

would contribute to the motivation

to uh to pardon you because i think that

it would show people that the president

actually does agree that there have been

some overreaches and in your case

not just an overeat but a miscarriage of

justice

a disgusting unamerican overreach

i think when you ask this question about

like

how much does he know about the case

it's fair to say

not a lot because he's intentionally

being misadvised

by his advisors you've had the attorney

general william barr who says he would

be you know vehemently opposed to a

pardon for me

uh his secretary of state mike pompeo

has literally i i think said i should be

killed john bolton at least said i

should be killed

um and you know i i think when this

conversation first came up a couple

weeks ago mike pompeo probably

hid every pen in the white house because

he's trying to make sure things like

this don't happen i think there are a

lot of people

uh who try and control the president

but this whole question about you know

uh

what's right for me uh what's right for

the president in terms of political

advantage

is is the wrong question this is why i

haven't been advocating for pardon i

didn't ask for

a pardon from obama i did ask for a

pardon for chelsea manning

which we didn't get but we did get

clemency uh and that's an important

thing

because what we need

is we need for pardons to be made not as

a question of political advantage

uh but as a decision taken

on uh to further the public interest and

this is why i say

pardon you know all of these previous

whistleblowers uh

uh thomas drake john kiriakou terry

albury reality winner daniel hale

there are many names daniel ellsberg

right he wasn't convicted so he got out

but these people deserve recognition as

the patriots who stood up and took a

risk

for the rest of us that they are look at

the the current cases right that don't

even require an exercise of the pardon

at the party

but julian assange right now today

is in court in the uk fighting an

extradition trial to the united states

for those who don't remember

this is the guy who's the head of

wikileaks right and he really fell out

of favor

in 2016 because he published the hillary

emails and everything like that or

podesta emails

but he's not being charged for that the

extradition trial has nothing to do with

that

actually the us government uh under

william barr

right the current attorney general is

trying to extradite this guy

and put him in prison for the rest of

his life for the best

work that wikileaks ever did that has

won awards in every country

basically around the planet including

the united states

which is the iraq and afghanistan war

logs right

detainee records in guantanamo bay

things that are about explicit war

crimes and abuses of power

torture and people who were killed who

should have been killed violations of

use of force protocols and all of these

things right

and this could all be made to go away if

william barr the attorney general simply

dropped the charges

and he should why isn't he

well julian assange has literally been

tortured

i mean the guy was locked in that

embassy for how many years with no

exposure to daylight just completely

trapped and

you've seen videos of him skateboarding

around the the embassy

he looks like he's going crazy in there

and now he's in jail and on trial

the whole thing is it's so disturbing

because

you know when it boils down to like what

what did he do

that is illegal what did he do that

people disagree with that people the

united states disagree with

in terms of the citizens well he he

exposed her horrific

crimes he exposed things that were

deeply uh that were that the united

states citizens are deeply opposed to

and the fact that that

is something that you in this country

can be uh prosecuted for that they would

try to extradite you

and and drag you from another country

they'd kick him out of the embassy and

bring him back to the united states

to try him for that it seems like we're

talking about some kangaroo court it

seems like we're talking about some

some dictatorship where you know you

have

these uh no protection of freedom of

speech

no protection under the first amendment

no no protection under

the the rights of the press it's just

it's so disturbing that there are

workarounds

for our constitution our bill of rights

that are

with that we all just agree to just

accept that this is happening there's no

riots in the streets for this

there's no no one's up in arms that

they're trying to extradite julian

assange no no

no one i mean it's not in the news like

for whatever reason the mainstream news

has

barely covered it over this uh his

current court proceedings in the

in the uk well i think a lot of this

comes down to the fact that

uh they see julian assange

by this day i mean the a lot of the

mainstream media the broadcast outlets

as a partisan figure now and it's really

sad because

the most dangerous thing about the

charges against julian assange

is if they extradite julian assange if

julian assange is convicted

he's charged under the espionage act the

same act that i'm charged under the same

thing that all these whistleblowers are

charged under

but he is not a source the way as

abusive as these espionage act charges

have run

in the last 50 years is the government

had

sort of a quiet agreement they never

charge the press outlets they never

charge the new york times they never

charge the washington post

they don't charge the journalists they

charge their sources

they charge the chelsea mannings right

they they charge the edward snowden's

they charge the thomas drake's the

daniel ellsbergs

but the press they're left alone they

are breaking that agreement with the

julian assange case

assange is not the source he is merely a

publisher

he runs a press organization people like

oh julian assange is not a journalist

he's not whatever

there is no way you can make that

argument in court

in a way that will be defensible

particularly given what we've talked

about with the government and how

careful they are to avoid

prior uh court precedents and to work

around it and create you know obscure

legal theories

that are legal fictions everyone knows

they're a lie everyone knows these

theories are false

but under the law you know they bend

just enough that they can pass the

argument through and get the conviction

they want

you cannot convict julian assange

the chief editor and publisher of

wikileaks

under the espionage act without exposing

the new york times the washington post

cbs abc nbc you know cnn fox whoever

to the same kind of charges under this

president and every coming president

and i think people don't think about

that

that that is disturbing you know another

thing that's disturbed well

there's many things that are disturbing

about this case but another thing that's

been disturbing was

he was a guy who the left supported

up until 2016 and then it became

inconvenient

right it was great then when he's

dragging yes

clinton it's not so great right right

when

when the the footage was revealed from

the

uh uh i i believe it was a helicopter

that showed it was

uh collateral murder remember that video

that was collapsing out

in iraq yeah it was a very helicopter in

iraq firing on two

reuters journalists uh yes

local militants or something yes exactly

um that was the left's

he was the darling of the left i mean

they were all

free julian assange and it's just it's

so interesting how that narrative can

shift so completely to all of a sudden

he's a puppet of russia

and that's what it became in 2016 and

that propaganda stuck

and people who were pro julian assange

before

now all of a sudden i i've i've seen

these people say [ __ ] wikileaks

you know and [ __ ] julian assange like

that guy he's a puppet of russia i'm

like

like how much have you looked into this

it's amazing

how that kind of propaganda when you

just get

the surface veneer of the the the

whatever the narrative there that is

they're trying to push how well it

spreads

that all these people who were these

educated

left-wing people now all of a sudden

were anti-wikileaks

and i'm like do you not remember how

this whole thing got started it was the

iraq war

which we all opposed do not remember

this whole

[ __ ] lie about the weapons of mass

destruction that got us into this crazy

war and then

julian assange and wikileaks exposed

so much of this and yet here we are

in 2016 it turns up on its head

and now he's a puppet of russia and

wikileaks is bad because

inconveniently the information that he

released damaged hillary clinton's

campaign

yeah i i think a lot of it comes down to

people forgetting uh what principles are

and why they're important yes right um

you can hate julian assange you can

think julian assange is a puppet of

russia you can think he's the worst

person on earth right he's a

reincarnation of hitler or stalin or

whatever

and still realize that convicting him

harms you it harms your society it harms

your children's future

people forget about this and today is a

world where everything's become partisan

but the aclu cut their teeth they they

made their reputation on defending a

nazi march

through a jewish neighborhood

and this is because it's about uh

the right to assembly the right to

freedom of speech you do not have a

right to be free

from offense right there is no uh

constitutional right to a safe space

but that doesn't mean you do nothing

that doesn't mean you have no opinion

that doesn't mean you have no political

power

what it does mean is that you have to

recognize that

everyone has the right to their own

opinion even

terrible opinions what we have to

protect is the speech is the platform is

the assemblies the association is the

process

that allows us to understand and

recognize and identify

when people did break the law when they

did harm others to go to a

fair trial where the jury can consider

why they did what they did

what they did and not just whether it

was legal

or illegal but whether it was moral or

immoral whether it was right

or whether it was wrong and whether they

are the lowest person

you know the the most ordinary citizen

in the country or the

highest elected official hold them to

the same standard of behavior the same

rule of law

whereas today you know we call them uh

public officials and

private citizens but with the all of the

surveillance all of the data collection

uh people in power commercially or

governmentally they know

everything about us and we know nothing

about them

uh we break the smallest law we go to

jail we get a fine we get screwed we

can't get a job we can't get a loan

uh but if they you know flagrantly abuse

their office

their authority uh they get a pass they

go on the speakers circuit you know

it's it's all uh sunshine and rainbows

for them

uh and the way we change these things is

remembering our principles of being

willing to stand and defend them

it's also instinctual for people to be

partisan

and it's tribal it's a tribal thing and

in this day and age people are

rabidly partisan and the rejection of

nuance is so disturbing to me

and it's so disturbing that a lot of

this happens from the left now

whereas the left used to be all about

freedom of speech the aclu is

i mean it's just you you automatically

think of

the liberal people when you think of the

aclu but

the academy just for the record is a

non-partisan organization

yes but supported overwhelmingly

certainly by by left-wing people

um i mean obviously they are nonpartisan

but

but people are so partisan today that

this rejection of nuance

it's it's so it's so easy for people

to look at things as left versus right

and ignore all of the sins of their team

and concentrate on defeating the other

side

and it seems to be a giant part of the

problem today

so much so that people are in favor

a lot of people are in favor of

de-platforming people

that just simply disagree with them and

i want to talk to you about that because

that seems to be a gigantic issue

not seems to be it is a gigantic issue

with social media

whether it's with twitter or youtube or

many things

um in fact unity 2020 is uh something

that

my friend my friend brett weinstein uh

is putting together

this idea that we should look

across both parties

for people that are reasonable and

rational people and look at what

we agree with rather than simply

sitting on on partisan policy

uh on on party lines and only voting

you know blue across the board or red

across the board and

let's look at reasonable people from

both sides whether it's dan crenshaw

and tulsi gabbard or who whoever it is

that are they represent different

parties but they're both reasonable

people let's get them together and have

these communications

they were banned from twitter they were

simply ban

banned from twitter for simply saying

reject

both trump and biden look for a third

choice

so this is not there's nothing offensive

about what they did

in fact they're they're encouraging

choice

they're encouraging this idea that we

don't have to be a two-party system

that in fact even though we have had

libertarian and green parties

we kind of look at it like [ __ ] it's

like a protest

vote if you vote green party you know

you're not going to elect that person

for president

it's kind of like we tolerate it but

when someone like ross perot came around

it threw a monkey wrench into the gears

and became very dangerous for both sides

because the republicans lost a lot of

votes and that's how bill clinton got

into office and george h.w bush

did not get a second term directly

because the influence of ross perot so

they changed

the requirements for getting into the

debates and everything became

very different and very more complicated

after that

the fact that they would that twitter

would be willing to ban

unity 2020 specifically because they're

calling

for people to walk away from this idea

that you have to either vote

for trump or biden and trying to get

mainstream acceptance of a potential

third party candidate

is extremely disturbing but deep

platforming in general

i think is extremely disturbing because

it's a slippery slope

if you decide that someone has views

that are

opposite of yours and they bother you

those views bother you

and you could do whatever you can to get

them off of a platform

it's very dangerous because someone

from the right who gains power or

someone from an opposing party that

gains power

if they get into a position of power in

social media

if they own gigantic social media

company like twitter or youtube

and they decide in turn to go after

people that

agree with your ideology well then we

have a freedom of speech issue

and you're you're literally supporting

the suppression of freedom of speech

if you're supporting deep platforming

people on social media

and i've always thought that the answer

to

someone saying something you disagree

with or something someone saying

something you vehemently oppose

is a better argument that's what they

it's supposed to be yeah it's supposed

to be you should expose the problems and

what they're doing

and i'm seeing so many people

particularly on the left that are

happy when people get de-platformed

and people that just are

just are contrary to their perspective

contrary to their ideology and

it's it's i think it's very dangerous

and it's too easy it's too easy to

accept it's

in this this goes back to what you're

saying this partisan

viewpoint that we have today fiercely

rabidly partisan

in a way that i've never seen in my life

yeah i

i think the question of d platforming

this is one of the the

central issues of our time that's really

overlooked and it's under-appreciated uh

so many people on both sides are in

favor of this

uh when it's somebody they don't like

right

yes

the central issue is this do we want

companies

deciding what can and cannot be said do

we want governments

deciding what can and cannot be said

if the answer is yes uh it is a very

different kind of society than

we have had traditionally i do think we

need to understand

uh where this impulse came from

how it came to be and why it seemed

reasonable and a lot of people

forget this and it came from isis

if you remember the islamic state it was

all over youtube they were all over

twitter they were all over facebook

and they were literally burning people

alive in cages they were beheading

people you know pushing people off

buildings just

horrible stuff um and that raises a

tough question for a lot of these

companies

now it's very easy to make the argument

that all right this is a direct call for

violence this is

literally uh supporting terrorism

um and as a private company we have no

obligation to let people use our

platforms

therefore we're closing their accounts

right we're shutting this off we're

erasing it we can do whatever we want

it's our website don't like it leave

um constitutionally there's no uh

freedom of speech

issue implicated there because the

constitution

restrains the federal government and the

state governments

in certain circumstances not

private companies but

once that precedent had been established

uh that they would do this for isis they

started going well what about these

other people uh what about these things

that could be construed as calls to

violence

okay what if they're not violence at all

what if it's harassment what if it's

abuse what if it's racism what if it's

you know criminality what if it's drug

culture what if it's pornography what if

it's whatever

and there will always be more what ifs

and the categories of prohibited speech

will

constantly expand so we need to ask

ourselves well who is best placed to

make those decisions about what can and

cannot be said

traditionally the

access to broadcast was limited

you had radio you had tv if you didn't

have that you had the soapbox on the

corner

right or the local university uh the

coffee shop

and somebody owned those places or

somebody ran those places

you know the college president would say

this person would be invited to speak

this person wouldn't be invited to speak

um and i actually think it's right and

proper

for people to be able to protest

speakers to say this person shouldn't

speak

at our college but i think the college

itself the institution

has to be willing to make value

judgments about why

they invite certain people to speak and

if that person is very unpopular

speaker if that person is uh

representing a viewpoint that is not

well supported by the college

uh if it's not necessarily what students

want to hear

but the administration believes like the

faculty believes

that it's something students should hear

isn't that why we have universities we

don't go to class

to learn you know necessarily like you

don't go to a literature course

to read the things that you want to read

you just go home and read those yourself

you go to study a curriculum to

something else you want to benefit from

the experience from the perspectives of

others

the question that people have is how

does this expand into the wider audience

right what happens when you move beyond

universities what happens when you move

to news broadcast what happens

when you move to the internet what

happens when everyone everywhere can

broadcast and this is where i think

things get really tricky

not can people say what they want as

long as they're not

advocating violence or whatever i don't

think this should be a difficult issue

but this gets complicated when you

have things like youtube's next video

suggestion

algorithm because the idea of

universal uh speech universal ability to

broadcast

is exactly as you said well what is the

counter for this you've got

freaking nazis on the internet and i'm

not talking

like whatever the guy's got a trump

sticker on his truck i'm talking

goose stepping you know swastika bearing

actual freaking nazi

um you have those people out there on

the internet calling for violence

calling for all these terrible

things and normally the way you deal

with this even in the case of something

like isis

you drag them onto the platform you

discredit their ideas before the world

because if you don't

if you drive them underground if you

make them you know this this faction

that's you know

hanging out at a radical mosque

or you know they're hanging out the

hardware store if they're freaking nazis

or whatever

there are uh places where you create its

own community that is sheltered from

other perspectives

it's sheltered from other ideas and that

is where

extremism thrives where it cannot be

challenged

where it cannot be exposed for what it

really is

but when you've got youtube going oh you

like nazi a

how about nazi b how about nazi c right

these people never get exposed to

counter speech and this is where things

get tricky

well it also gets tricky when you decide

that someone is saying something that's

offensive

and you remove them from the platform

and then you open the door

for other things being offensive things

that maybe aren't offensive to you

the the slope gets slippery and then you

have wrong speak you have

you have newly dictated language that

you have to use

you have new restrictions on

ideologies things you're not allowed to

espouse i mean

twitter will ban you for dead naming

someone they will ban you for life

meaning if you transition to be a woman

and you call yourself edwina and i call

you edward

you i will be banned for life with no

recourse

which is madness it's matt because i can

call you [ __ ] face

and no one has a problem with it yeah

you know what i'm saying i could call

you a terrible i could

i could call you that and there's no

problem but if i

you choose a name that used to

accurately represent you

as a different gender because this is

some new

incredibly important distinction that

we've decided

it takes precedence over everything else

including it's it's more significant

than

insults more significance than a

demeaning of i'd call you a [ __ ]

i could demean your intellect all those

things are fine but if i

choose to call you by a name that used

to actually

accurately represent you when you were a

different gender or when you

identified with a different gender

because of today's political climate

that is grounds for banning you for life

it shows you

how incredibly slippery censorship can

get

because i would have never imagined that

if you said to me 10 years ago

well when someone becomes a transgender

person 10 years

10 years ago if you said this to me if

someone becomes a transgender person you

call them by their original name you

could be banned from social media for

life i'm like get the [ __ ] out of here

they'll never get to that

no one's going to be that unreasonable

that's crazy because you could call some

people so many disparaging and insulting

names but you can't say

their name that isn't even insulting

dead naming that's what it's called so

it just shows you dead naming of today

you agree with that today that opens up

the door for all kinds of crazy [ __ ]

five years from now 10 years from now if

we still get more and more

rabidly politically polarized and

we are our idea of pc culture gets more

and more extreme

you're you're in you're on a greased

hill

and if you decide to give up a little

ground the slide is imminent

i i think this is like you can argue on

that axis

um but i think incrementalism and the

failures of imagination going you know

10 years ago we couldn't imagine this

would have been abandonable offense

is the wrong way to go about it because

if you go back to the founding of the

country

saying you know women should have the

right to vote black people should have

the right to vote you know that was

unimaginable that would get you

equivalently d platform not welcomed to

the the speaking

community or whatever sure but those are

positive and inclusive things right i'm

not saying

uh right i'm associating these directly

i'm talking about the principle here

uh because you can attack these things

in that direction go oh you know this

doesn't seem right but remember it's

twitter making these rules it's youtube

making visuals there's not a court

making these rules

um and anybody technically today can

decide who and can and can't

uh who can and cannot speak on their

platforms the question is

what should we do what kind of culture

should we promote

how should we have these conversations

and how should we make them available

and i think civility is not too much to

ask people generally as you say

you know calling people [ __ ] face or

[ __ ] or whatever is completely normal

um on the internet and that's not really

gonna get you banned from anywhere

uh and now you have all of these

companies sort of uh contorting

themselves to fit into these blocks to

not uh or

sort of anger all of these different

demographics

but if we truly want to have

a global broadcast a public commons the

question

i think that's more important here is

not so much

uh what should and should not be banned

because that's accepting the premise of

banning

it's how do we create an inclusive uh

platform where everyone can talk and

even strictly and harshly disagree with

each other

without it coming down to name calling

without trying to dox people without

trying to

uh basically dog whistle them or screw

them or hurt them or harm them

however now look i am not above calling

people bad names on the internet

i've said terrible things i grew up on

the internet right i was an

[ __ ] right and we all were and the

thing is

the worst things that we say at any

moment today

they are permanent the internet never

forgets right so

when you say these things and you know

there's a young audience

listening right now to to like

everything

um and they think it's cool they think

it's funny or they don't think it's

cooler they don't think it's funny

but they think they shouldn't be the

platform for it they they they're edgy

you know they push the lines or whatever

they get that out there and they start

emulating this behavior they start

saying mean things they start saying

cruel things i did it myself right

not in this context but in whatever the

equivalent would be you know

20 years ago um

and that's there are going to be

consequences for that they're going to

be judged by that

whether they should or should not

whether it is right or wrong because as

you said there's so much tribalism today

and i think we have to create positive

examples i think you're right

the deplatforming is a huge issue it is

a tremendous issue right

but we should think about what it is

that we're actually uh fighting against

and i don't think like trans issues or

whatever uh

when it comes down to basically civility

is the hill to die on because i think

there's better arguments

well i i certainly think we should

encourage civility

there's no no doubt about it what i'm

getting at

is that the idea that you can be banned

for life for that

is it's preposterous i think civility is

one of the most important things our

culture could ever promote

and i and i think it's very difficult to

promote civility online

because the anonymous aspect of there's

no accountability internet interaction

right there's no accountability there's

you're not getting social cues from

people

it's just a completely different world

when you're interacting with people

especially

for kids you know i mean if you had

given me the internet when i was 15

years old i would have said the most

horrific things to people

for sure and i'm sure many 15 year old

kids are doing exactly that right

now i think the more we can encourage

civility

the better we all are in all aspects of

our life whether it's

it person to person face to face or

online

i try very hard to only say things

online

that i would say to someone's face and

if you uh online now

i do not interact with people in any way

shape or form that's negative i don't do

it

i don't i don't believe in it i treat it

the same way

if it's avoidable i avoid it and i i

think that's incredibly important

but this does an important point which

is i mean

what it really gets to the core of the

issue failures of civility

the fact that people say bad things that

people don't have accountability that

there are you know there's a whole

spectrum of people out there

from angels to devils right there's

ordinary people and

even the best of people have bad days

and say terrible things

for sure we're all we do need people to

have some responsibility

for having a thicker skin you know hey

look guys

i've had people literally advocating my

murder right like that just torture and

murder literally

horrible things yeah yeah i've seen it

in years

um and the people that i've blocked on

my twitter account

are the ones who are posting about like

bitcoin scams that are like you know

send me five bitcoins

um i'm not saying this is the example to

emulate

uh what it is though is we have to

recognize

that some people aren't worth engaging

some people aren't worth listening to

um it's a lesson right but that doesn't

mean necessarily that you take their

voice entirely

yes i i i most certainly agree with that

in in terms particularly in terms of

de-platforming my question to you

about this is and i've raised this

question many people and i

really haven't got a satisfactory answer

do you

think that things that get so huge

like twitter uh or facebook or even

youtube

do they become a basic

right is it like the utilities

is it like electricity and water is like

the ability to communicate

online seems to me a core

aspect of what it means to be a human

being with a voice in 2020.

and i don't think it's as simple as

removing someone

from twitter is simply a company

uh exercising their right to have

whatever they want on their platform

i think when it gets as big as twitter

is i think we've

passed into a new realm and i think we

need to acknowledge that whether it's

twitter or youtube or facebook or what

have you

i mean and i think it should be very

difficult

to remove someone from those platforms

and i think it should

probably involve some sort of a trial i

mean this is much

uh this is a really really tough issue

it's much larger than just d

platforming because what we're really

talking about is the internet is a

public utility

right the internet is water and power um

and its ability to shape culture right

right

um when you talk about something like

you know twitter and the size

when the president is basically

directing uh policy

from twitter uh it's clear sometimes

threatening countries

that is our laws were not

designed with that in mind and

unfortunately we have a legislature

that's just fundamentally broken

uh this gets back to the the electoral

system which you talked about earlier

you know most countries in the world

have a wide swath of parties they're not

this two-party binary system where it's

just

two groups largely new corporatist

groups that are just handing power back

and forth the president changes

but the actual lawmakers the actual

structure behind the president the

advisors

are largely from the same cohorts

we we don't have that

legislative we don't have that

governmental structure

that allows us to adapt in a way that

truly represents i think the broadest

spectrum of public opinion

in a way uh that allows us to respond to

changes in technology in a meaningful

way which is what's left us stranded

today

where these companies are are sort of

deciding things for themselves it's

because there is a vacuum

uh of legislation

now there's a question do we want

legislation people on

different spectrums from authoritarian

to libertarian here will go we want lots

of legislation we want no legislation

um but there is a push and there has

been a push in congress for

years actually since the 90s uh with the

communications decency act and the first

crypto war

uh where the government was treating um

the ability to encrypt your

communications to to make them

secret uh or private as you communicate

with people online they were treating

that

as a weapon and saying you couldn't

export this code without getting a

license from the government and all

kinds of craziness

but the communications decency act the

idea that there would be obscenity

regulations the

some years ago you may remember a

scandal involving backpage which was

like a

variant of craigslist that had a lot of

prostitution ads on it

um government has been trying more and

more

uh to say these kind of things can be

done on the internet these kind of

things can be said on the internet these

kind of things can't be said on the

internet

and they have been doing this largely

under the guise i would argue

of the commerce clause right the federal

government where they get the

constitutional authority to regulate

what we say and do businesses wherever

well they go well the internet is global

it's international therefore it's

interstate commerce and so we're going

to regulate this

as if you're you know shipping bushels

of corn from iowa to florida

but it's it's a little bit different

than that and i think

uh what we need to recognize is that the

internet

is a utility and people

uh individuals uh and corporate entities

you should be criminally liable

for the things that they do online that

means if they have caused enough harm

that you're willing to put them in

prison they've stolen from someone they

have

destroyed some piece of infrastructure

they have caused harm to someone

uh you know somebody died or they

plotted a murder or whatever

you take them through the courts you try

them on this the jury considers what

they did they consider why they did they

considered the evidence

and then you you uh let the trial system

the traditional system that we've had

for

thousands of years uh worked this kind

of stuff out or at least hundreds of

years

um but when you get the government and

you get officials in

congress you get officials you know

whatever the local department

of this country or that country you know

russia's got a telecommunications

censorship bureau

china's got one france germany the

united states all of these guys

i have different regulatory authorities

whether it's the fcc in the united

states or ra's comrades or in russia

and you cannot substitute their judgment

for the judgment of a jury for the

judgment of the people and the public

broadly

and i think it's dangerous that we're

trying to

have the government pick winners and

losers when whether you win or lose

determines whether or not you can engage

with the world whether you can have a

public presence uh

on the internet because the internet is

real life

today yeah it is and

could it be that the option would be to

extend

the first amendment rights to the

internet in general

and to if you want to run a social media

platform

you know other than what we're talking

about putting people in danger doxxing

people threatening people's lives

doing things that can cause direct harm

to people but the ability to express

yourself in controversial ways

should shouldn't we extend first

amendment protections

to social media platforms i i think

this is a a much more complicated

question

than it appears because you get into the

whole thing of obligation of service

there is

uh like there was a cause celebrate on

the right

actually that would seem like a similar

issue

i remember there was the cake shop

somewhere where they didn't want to

serve

like a same-sex marriage thing uh and

again this gets back to civility

um but some people are they have a very

strong fundamental

uh belief here that these people

shouldn't be able to do this that or the

other

and if you impose that uh on them that

requirement on them they've got to serve

you know whatever their uh business is

to these people that they don't like or

that they don't agree with there's a

compulsion of service there

you start doing this with the internet

and then there's a completely different

com

country you know let's say there's a

website in belgium

that's now bound by american laws that's

bound by this

twitter can't ban this person even

though uh they're against them

it seems like isn't that a different

argument though because

all these companies were talking about

twitter facebook and youtube are all

based in america

now i agree imposing american first

amendment rights on the country

particularly if the u.s starts changing

laws but this is the interesting thing

about internet companies is they can

right

would that be their loophole yeah would

that be their loophole to get out of

that just selling

right but i mean it's it's more

fundamentally

um we have to recognize either as a

society we can compel

people to standards of civility

or we can't and we need to decide uh how

we handle that because that's what all

of these tie around

right um and i think we have

forgotten uh in many ways just

we're not teaching people the golden

rule well enough because we are all

angry

we are all in competition and the funny

thing is

uh the guy on the right who's poor and

living in a trailer

uh is not much different than you know

the hippie on the left who's

scrounging out of dumpsters you know uh

and and raising their black flag to go

to a protest

they act like they could not be more

different but their economic

circumstances could not be more similar

and the reality is

it's you know the the government uh the

the lawmakers and the business owners

that are setting them at odds and we are

all getting lost in our own ideological

differences

uh and losing sight of the things that

actually tie us together and that if we

worked together maybe we could change in

a more meaningful way

and the more people you meet the more

people you talk to you more you realize

how malleable people really are and

about how

so many of these ideological

perspectives that they they so

rabidly subscribe to they've adopted

because it

allows them to be accepted by their

community by whatever

neighborhood they're in or whatever

group of people they hang out with and

they choose to

adopt these uh these ideas about how the

world is and

so many of those people just don't

experience people that are

are different from them i mean that that

is the case with racism that's the case

with homophobia that's the case with

many

of the issues that people have with

other folks is that they just don't know

people from those other groups and they

haven't experienced you know

they haven't walked a mile in their

shoes as it were i

i think civility should be encouraged as

much as possible

also though i'm a comedian and i

i talk a lot of [ __ ] and that's in in

the sense of humor

like you can miss and it's been done

against me many times

where they've taken things i've said in

jest and put them in quotes

completely out of context and it looks

horrible

because that's not what it that's not

the way it was intended

and it was intended in humor now if you

do have

laws that not just encourage civility

but uh mandate civility you're gonna

have a real problem with humor

because you're basically gonna cut cut

the ankles out of comedy

um not that i'm saying that all humor

has to be mean and vicious it doesn't

but some of the best is well it's also

about saying things that can't be said

you know yes yes saying things that

can't be said

um i i think there's a there's a giant

problem

with uh online censorship today i i

i think it's one of the biggest problems

of our era and i do think it is because

there is a massive slippery slope um and

i do

uh agree with you about the cake people

you know that that was a

a big issue was that cause celebrate the

right of these people they should have

the right

a lot of people felt to not make a cake

for someone who is doing

who is doing something they think is

immoral right being

uh involved in a gay relationship but

there's also the problem

of sensationalizing these things because

the people that

did find those people that didn't want

to make those cakes

they went to a bunch of people that

agreed to make the cake first

they went and tried to find someone who

didn't want to make that cake

and then they turned it into a big story

now even though i

i just think i mean i think you should

make a cake for gay people because

there's nothing wrong with being gay

but i think the people that made that

decision to not make that

i feel bad for them i feel bad that

they're they're bigoted in that way and

that it's

such a foolish thing to care who

someone is in love with whether it's the

same sex or an opposite sex

but also i think it's weird that someone

wants to go around and try to find

someone who won't make a cake for them

who wants to go from cake place to cake

place to cake place

until i go aha i found a bigot like and

then make a big deal out of it like you

know you're you're searching for

victimhood

i mean there's an argument that that's

uh

i mean that that's one way to look at it

another way to look at it is that's

activism

uh they're searching for injustice

right yeah i agree yeah this is the

thing like

what is right and wrong this is this is

what people forget uh

is changing constantly when we're

talking about public opinion because

public opinion

is changing constantly and this is why

doing right by people it's so sad that

we've lost sight of this

uh basic impulse to do unto others as

you would have them do unto you

uh yes

because when you talk about the internet

when you talk about de-platforming when

you talk about humor

as you said you know people are going

back and they're looking at your jokes

they're putting them in quotes there's a

different context you're being attacked

by it

uh something you said uh looks bad

there's there's things that

uh you've said things that i've said

things that the person listening right

now have said

that they believed that they meant

that they said ten years ago that they

said one year ago that they said three

weeks ago

that they no longer believe that they've

abandoned that they've been persuaded

otherwise

they've changed their mind on and this

was one of the central themes in

in the book permanent record um

is we are no longer allowed

to forget our worst mistakes

right they're there they haunt us

they're used against us they're

weaponized

uh and this society has become aware of

this and activists on all sides have

become aware of this

uh immediately they use this to try to

attack people on the other side of any

issue

that they don't like to go after their

credibility to go after their character

and what we are losing in that

conflict and this is a rational strategy

on the part of both sides

in the moment because they realize there

is a real political advantage to be

gained you can get people cancelled

uh very easily nowadays but the the

thing is

when we make everyone

we pin everyone to their worst moment

when we do away with the concept of

forgiveness we we do away

with the potential for growth for change

for persuasion

and this gets back to those those rat

holes of

extremism on on uh youtube

on twitter on everywhere else where they

start

self reinforcing uh and eventually

reaching the bottom of the hole

at the worst of the worst with everybody

else who's been canceled too

and part of that is because they can't

climb out or they think they can't climb

out

and there's a question how do we resolve

that

one of the nice things about the the

pre-internet society

was as bad as you were as ignorant

as uh a racist as exploitative

as whatever you don't like right as that

person that character was

they could find something new they could

read a book they could meet someone they

could change their mind

and even if nobody in their town would

ever forgive them rightly

in some cases because they had done

something truly terrible something truly

unforgivable

they could leave they could move to a

different town they could move to a

different state and that history

would not follow them they could

reinvent themselves and they could

become

someone truly honestly better

instead of being married to their prior

ignorance

that is a very important thing because

we all

are in a constant state of growth if

you're not you you're really making some

fundamental

errors with your life we're all in this

constant state of

accepting and acquiring new information

gaining new perspectives learning from

our mistakes

and if unless you're dr manhattan unless

you're some person who's not making any

mistakes

and you just have this all-knowing

vision of the world you're a finished

product

like please if you are share that with

everybody else

but most of us are not most of us are in

this weird state of being a human being

on earth where everyone is trying to

figure it out in this incredibly

imperfect world

incredibly imperfect society the the

everything from

the structure the economic structure to

the societal stuff everything

down to the very last things

everything's imperfect and the idea

should be

that we're all communicating to try to

grow together

and that we're learning together and

it's one of the more interesting things

about interacting with people online is

that you can

get different perspectives and if you

can let go of your ego

and if you can let go of your

preconceived notions you can learn

things about the way other people see

and feel and think about

the world that could change and enhance

your own

ideas and i think that that's

it's important that we not just accept

the fact

that people are growing and getting

better and improving

but that we encourage it we encourage it

and we reward it

and i i think that's one of the

interesting things that

we're struggling with i mean you see

this in the context of police violence

you you see this uh

in the context of mass surveillance you

see this in the context of cancer

culture you see this everywhere

one of the interesting things about this

surveillance machine

that has been built around us the the

sort of architecture of oppression the

turnkey tyranny

as i describe it um so much is known

about every person

regardless of how innocent or how guilty

they are

it's all in there you know the files are

waiting to be accessed the the data

just needs to be collated it's it's just

waiting to be requested and analyzed and

used

what this means like there there's this

old idea of the panopticon

right um which is you you create

a prison that is circular and

in the middle of it there's this great

tower right that rises way up and at the

very top of the tower

there's a mirrored glass room that the

warden

sits in and no prisoner knows where the

warden is looking because the warden can

see out but they can't see in

and so everyone believes that they are

watched

and so the idea is that no one will

misbehave because they're all afraid

uh that they'll be retaliated against

for breaking the rules or whatever

but what we have seen as this

surveillance machine has been built

is we all realize uh

intuitively and intuitively innately

inherently in ourselves

even if we don't recognize it even we

don't speak to it we witness it in the

news every night

there are records of wrongdoing

criminality in government the highest

and lowest levels of our government

uh corporations and uh

you know prominent uh figures in society

breaking the rules

ordinary people jaywalking littering you

know uh

polluting small-scale petty stuff

all of that somewhere there is a record

of

but in almost all cases it's not

punished

what has happened is we have broken

the chain of accountability between

knowledge of wrongdoing uh

and consequence for wrongdoing and this

happened without a vote

it happened without our participation we

weren't asked uh whether this was okay

but i think in some way that is

beginning to change the moral character

of people and what we need to do

starting with the top rather than the

bottom because china's trying to do the

reverse they're going

all right well there's a simple solution

to this let's just start screwing

everybody who breaks the rules instantly

and immediately

you know you got a social credit score

you you

protested so you're going off to a camp

you know whatever

um but imagine uh what it would mean

if we saw people where

now any official the minute they are

guilty of the slightest infraction

that immediately is exposed in the press

they go on trial they go on all this

stuff they're ruined they're disgraced

um but it turns out every other member

of

congress is going to court in the same

week because everybody is in violation

of something somewhere

we all have some measure of guilt large

or small

even if we're completely innocent

because you know our legal code is so

complex there's no way you can make it

through a week without

breaking some kind of rule about you

can't wear a green hat on tuesday

but if this happened if there was

accountability for

fractions of the rules any time an

infraction of the rules was

witnessed the laws would change

instantly to enshrine the right to

privacy

because the people in power wouldn't

want to lose their position of power

they would not want to lose this

position and suddenly

when they have skin in the game they

would realize oh everybody

deserves this um and i i think there's

just something interesting to that i

haven't thought this out

all the way fully so this could be you

know i

give give me some slack here but i think

this is really what has changed

um we have built a panopticon

but what sits at the top of it is a

computer

uh that computer witnesses

everything we do in reality it's a

distribution of computers

they're owned by many people an answer

to many people

but it does not yet judge us for us

judge us for it and what is happening is

the audience society the people have

realized that they can

see through this computer they can see

through the panopticon from a certain

angle a certain degree in a certain

direction any given time

the cops that have been you know

monitoring all of us for

years right they've got surveillance and

drones and stuff that they couldn't

imagine they

imagined in generations prior but now

every person on the street

has a smartphone with a camera too and

the cops are being witnessed

for the first time and now people are

trying to impose upon them

the same judgment that has classically

been imposed upon

us and this i think is one of the

uh dynamics that the changes that is

leading to this increasing

conflict in society is when you realize

that the people that throughout you know

uh

your generation's youth

were told in hollywood and stories are

our common shared national myths

you know the government's the good guys

the fbi's are going to get the gangsters

and

terrorists and things like that they're

the best of the best the fact that they

are people too

they're not only fallible but in some

cases you know small-minded and vicious

they are political they are partisan

the same way everyone else is people

start

questioning power and how it is used the

basic legitimacy the way it impacts our

lives what the limits of it should be

but people yet have not realized

uh one of the responses to this should

be a limitation

on the amount of power the government

has or rather not just government

but institution institution is a concept

right government or corporation

um the powers of institutions should be

limited to interfere in our lives

instead what they are trying to do both

sides you know blue team red team

whatever

they're squabbling they're fighting over

who has

their hands on the trigger who gets to

aim the weapon

rather than should the weapon exist

are you talking about police violence

when you're when you're saying these

things

that's a part of it yes it's it's every

direction but police

violence is very much the public part of

it we see right now

yeah that seems to be one of the most

complex

uh abuses of power because

the the kind of power that you give

someone when you

allow them to be a police officer is

literally the power to end life

it's not just the power to kick you off

twitter it's the power to decide

this this person who's just a regular

person no different than you or i with

all sorts of problems in their own life

and

stresses and strains and a

disproportionate amount of strain

and stress for the actual job that they

do it means a spectacularly

stressful position to be in life but yet

you give them

the ability to literally with a finger

pull

end someone's life i think that's being

exposed

in a way that we've because of these

cell phone cameras and because of uh

social media it's being exposed in a way

that we no one ever would have ever

dreamed

uh imaginable before and exposing

how almost impossible it is

to have that position as a human being

and

i mean this the position of power

like that over folks and just to have a

regular person with a normal psychology

and

and not some incredibly brilliant zen

master who's

in charge of uh you know overseeing drug

crimes

or pulling people over or or you know

assault or whatever it is

it's it it i don't know the solution to

that

i you know there's all sorts of things

at play

ignorance foolishness racism anger

but at the end of the day it's about a

human being's

ability to have a massive amount of

power by law

over other human beings which is always

going to be a problem

it's just going to be a problem yeah i

mean i

i think we've known about this you know

there's aphorisms that go back a zillion

years you know

absolute power corrupts absolutely um

you know you give a monkey a stick the

first thing he's going to do is he's

going to look for something to hit with

it

but this is also one of the things you

asked earlier about like

how i can be hopeful how i can be

idealistic when i

see the scale of the problems the

challenges the rate against us

when i understand not just that mass

surveillance exists

but i understand the mechanics of it i

understand how systemic it is

i understand the resources behind it

that want to prevent the change of it

and instead want to entrench it and

expand it

to make it more powerful and have more

influence over the direction of our

lives

down to this basic stuff about you know

we are told

the cops are the best among us people

sign up to be cops i genuinely believe

because they want to serve and protect

more so than they just want to be the

big tough cop guy

and some people say you know that's

naive some people say that's petty but i

i think it's different i think the

reason that i feel this way

the reason that i am okay with seeing

how much we

fail uh seeing how much incivility and

violence and

and just ignorance that we have in the

world today is

is i have a lower expectation

of the individual at the moment

but a higher appreciation for their

potential

and the reality is we are all inherently

flawed

i'm a terrible person uh

and i i think in a lot of ways uh you

are not as good

as you want yourself to be but i know

that

i have become a better person with time

you have become a better person with

time i think we all

have and we all can or those of us who

have not

could if they chose to or if they had

guidance or if they had love or

friendship or someone

who cared and directed them and helped

them become better

uh yeah and that's i mean that is the

story

of human history because we were all the

monkey and then we found a stick

uh we could use it to beat somebody or

we could use it to build a bridge but if

you look around at the world today

there's a hell of a lot of bridges

there are in the i think in terms of

police brutality

there's very few reasonable

solutions that seem to be actionable

seem to be something that you could just

put into play

right away in terms of like how do

you how do you deal with these

violent encounters that police officers

often have with people

how do you deal with the ptsd that

i believe a vast majority of these

police officers suffer from

completely stressed out every time they

pull someone over it could be the end of

their life they

might not go home to their families they

really don't know and i think there's

also a bunch of them that

are emotionally and psychologically

unqualified for the job

to begin with and then here we are

uh with these calls in america at least

to defund the police

which i think is even more ridiculous i

think if anything they need more funding

and more training and a more stringent

uh process of elimination of

removing people that aren't qualified

for that job because i believe very few

people

actually are qualified i think there's

great police officers out there i really

do and i think

most of them most of the interactions

that people have with police officers

aren't horrible but there's enough of

those horrible ones that are captured on

video

that we have this bias towards these

negative results that we see over and

over again

and we don't take into account the full

data set we're not taking into account

all the interactions that people have

with police officers because those

aren't documented

what we're getting in front of our face

day in day out are the terrible

interactions and um i don't

see nor do i hear a real workable

way of improving this um you you get

people

that are either calling to defund the

police or you're calling for people to

support police officers that's all you

hear

i i from a few people like jocko willink

you see uh

really great suggestions that they

should be treated the same way they

treat navy seals

where you're spending literally 20 of

your time training

and you're going through psychological

training you're going

through uh actual real world uh

situations where you're you're going

over

what's the correct protocol and how to

handle certain situations

and i i think it's it's

a giant problem in our society today and

i think that's an understatement

that every time someone gets shot that

shouldn't have gotten shot

particularly if it's a person of color

it becomes a

a gigantic flash point uh for our

society

well let me challenge you on that a

little bit because i mean

we can we can have civil disagreements

in the way uh you know that's that's why

we have

discussion i think there are things that

we can do

uh that don't require you know the idea

of shutting down every

police department i i think that's sort

of

far beyond what people talk about when

we they talk about defunding the police

i think

the most common sense uh measure that

is being discussed and it's not being

discussed as uh broadly in terms of like

the mainstream news

it should be is ending police unions

right now why do we talk about that

um this gets back to the same thing that

we talked about earlier with the court

cases and the government you know they

get

caught doing something wrong but there's

no consequence

right and people learn from that each

generation learns from the cases prior

right it's in training and people learn

rules things like that

the reason a lot of police violence

occurs

um even if it's not all it's not again

there's there's no magic wand we wave

that saves the world

is the lack of accountability uh we know

there are cops

and even cops say this right uh there

are cops out there who

aren't good people uh there are cops out

there who have used their authority

uh there are you know really tragic

cases

uh where a cop has done something

straight up criminal

and they have faced no meaningful

consequences as a result maybe they lost

their job

right but if it was anybody else they

would have gone to prison

and so there's a question of how do we

remediate this

in a way that

preserves the legitimate interest of you

know police officers as a class

but it also preserves the rights of the

people who are being policed

in by your own admission at least some

cases

people who are abusing their authorities

and again i'm not saying all cops are

bad or anything like that

but if we recognize there are abuses

and this is a class that is invested as

you said with the power over life and

death

we have to be willing as a society and

the people occupying this position have

to be willing to assume

a higher standard of accountability than

ordinary people right

and if we can agree on that

everything else follows from it i think

we don't want to have

a gun-toting immunized class walking

among us

and i think even you know police

officers

among themselves at least would

recognize this

but it is rational for them to resist

this from the interests of their class

they're in a privileged position

why would they give that up the same way

our spies are in a privileged position

why would they give that up but as a

society

we exist to ask more and you raise valid

points right there's cops out there

go up to a dark car in the middle of the

night they're afraid they're not going

to make it home to their family

that's reasonable and legitimate right

but being a police officer

is a dangerous position that people have

signed up to we give our police officers

every advantage that could be given to

them today

i can tell you from having lived all

around the world uh

there's no cops in the world uh that are

kitted out like cops in america

are like the you know these these guys

look like

you know something from a sci-fi movie

um

and if there is a kind of well some of

them do some some of them

are going to riot and look there's good

cops out there

um i had a lot of interactions with cops

as a young man

uh that were nothing but positive uh

it's not that police as an idea are the

enemy

it is the system that is rotten and i

think even honest cops

recognize that the system is funnily

been mentally broken

the question is not or the question from

their side should not be

can we stop reform because if they are

if that's their position i think they're

doing the public a disservice

and i think to themselves they know

they're doing a disservice

it's how do we handle this appropriately

how do we handle this

in the right way and if there's cops out

there who legitimately have served you

know they've been out there for years

they've been exposing themselves to

danger to keep people safe at night

they've done a good job uh and they

don't want to walk the beat

anymore that should certainly be an

option that's available to them and from

my perspective as not a cop

uh but i think when you look at um

the the state of law enforcement in the

united states that very much

is an option you know do they want to

work on dispatch do they want to work on

investigation

they want to be cross-trained in

forensics there are ways

uh that we can end issues or at least

mitigate

some of the issues that we see with

policing today

uh without saying cops are the worst

people in the world and without saying

you know these guys

should be above the law well i don't

think anybody's saying they should be

above the law but but factually to you

so your feelings

are excuse me i said factually today

like as a matter of fact whether we like

to or not

you gotta admit in most cases cops are

bulletproof

well i don't know i don't think i agree

with that i mean if you you look at what

happened in the george floyd case

obviously

they were caught on camera so we're

we're fortunate we got to

not fortunate but we got to see what

happened

and they reacted accordingly you're

you're

what you were saying before you started

this though was that we need to stop

police unions right and that

but do you think police unions aren't

only

around to protect people from the

consequences of

uh terrible policing they're also to

provide health insurance and and

reasonable amounts this is a great

argument for everybody to have

health insurance oh for sure yeah no i

agree

i think health insurance is a i think

it's a fundamental right of being a

human being in a

in a civilized society i think it should

be treated the same way we treat the

fire department

i think it should be something that we

we all agree we should pay into because

it

benefits all of us i mean i just think

uh

if if we are a community and that's what

uh

really a country is supposed to be we're

supposed to be a large community

wouldn't we want to protect the most

vulnerable members of that community

that if you have a small knit family and

something happens to someone in the

family

everybody chips in to help that person

you know the

that's what i think health insurance

should be i think it should be

an important part of a culture of a

community

of a group of human beings that decide

they're all on the same team

we have to take care of the most

vulnerable people i mean i think that

across the board and i mean

that's really the argument that i'm

making for how we want our police to be

when i say

you know cops are bulletproof i don't

mean in the literal sense there are a

lot of cops who have given their lives

uh to stop very bad people and we should

honor them we should provide for their

families

but the way that we do that is providing

a better society that's more fair to

police

by being more fair to everyone right

as long as as long as we've got any

occupation

that has it it's really this simple as

long as we have an occupation

that is invested with exceptional

authority

they must be investigated invested with

a

extraordinary standard of accountability

it's that simple from my perspective

like it doesn't have to be a terrible

thing it doesn't have to be aggressive

attack but it's this basic principle

today in the world of business in the

world of government

in the world of policing anywhere you

look right it's a common issue

what we have is a disproportionate

allocation of influence

a disproportionate allocation of

economic resources

disproportionate economic or a

disproportionate allocation

of authority without

an equal allocation of responsibility

well i i think we both agree on that and

i think we also both agree that it's not

a shock

that a disproportionate amount of

criminal activity exists in a place

where there's a

disproportional amount of poverty sure

and a disproportionate

yeah i mean this is an and very few

economic

opportunities i mean this is something

people don't that is a real problem

but you're exactly right i mean when you

talk about yes

uh where terrorist movements arise from

when you talk about where

criminal groups uh really thrive it's

where there is poverty

uh poverty breeds desperation

uh desperation breeds anger uh

and resent and and sadly due to the

nature of our species

uh that in many cases inevitably tends

toward violence

uh if we want to solve the uh

uh which are criminality right uh

because people forget terrorism is a

crime

it's very grave crime but it's still a

crime uh we have to go to the core

causes

yeah and you know we were talking about

this previously on a different show

in regards to the way people reacted to

the pandemic in terms of economic

support to businesses and

trillions of dollars that were allocated

to all these various businesses to try

to stimulate them and keep them active

and

and alive and keep people working and my

thought was like

imagine if that same attention to detail

had been to impoverished neighborhoods

if they had decided

like listen there's obviously a

disproportionate amount of crime and

poverty

in these neighborhoods we've got to

figure out a way

to lessen that burden and strengthen

those neighborhoods and

in a real simplistic way of putting it

the way i've always said

if you want to make america great you

want less losers

right what's the best way to have less

losers

have more people with an opportunity to

succeed

more people who grow up in an area where

it's

actually safe where there's economic

possibilities

where you're you're you're given more

access to education

more access to health care more access

to counseling

more access to uh community centers

any kind of support that you could

possibly give people that gives them

more of an opportunity to get by in life

and that this is something that we've

conveniently ignored this this this need

to strengthen

these core and significant areas of our

culture

but yet we do when something comes along

like a pandemic that might close down

business and already thriving economic

businesses

i think we should have put i think a

long time ago we should have put

similar resources and attention into

these

impoverished neighborhoods that have

been impoverished for decades

and a lot of it because of slavery and a

lot of it because of redlining laws and

jim crow laws and

all the things that happen after slavery

there's so many areas of our country

that just don't get better and we don't

do anything about it

and we just assume that these cr these

crime-ridden areas will remain that way

forever

and they send cops there and then the

you you see the videos of the

interactions the cops have with people

and it just creates more and more anger

and more and more frustration without

any real

uh so some sort of uh socially

responsible

action by by the government and some

some sort of a program where it's

explained to people

explain to the general public how this

is going to benefit everyone

that we will have less crime that we

will have more opportunity we

will have more people that are that are

educated and empowered

entering into the workforce will have

more competition they'll strengthen the

country as a whole

it'll be better literally for every one

of us

and that this is something that they

didn't pursue

and they haven't pursued in this country

forever

well i mean this is this gets back to

that the question that i was asking

earlier

it's one that i ask myself you know when

you look at all the problems of today

and you know for for somebody who's

focused on privacy and surveillance

issues

it's easy to be reminded every day of

how deep in the hall we are

where did these things really

you talked earlier about like a greased

hill where where did the

incline increase where did things start

to really go wrong

because they've always been going wrong

in in in some area

again that's our burden uh we've got to

make things better because they're never

going to be good enough

uh where we start but in

recent decades things have gone bad and

i think it goes back to patriot act

and you ask about economy you talk about

poverty you talk about

opportunity how do we fix this

everybody is rehabilitating him now as

this you know nice little

old guy painting his feet in the bathtub

uh

but the patriot act george bush in the

iraq war

um and the policy of endless war that is

continuing

sadly today it's a bipartisan thing

continued under obama

continued under trump um

we have spent trillions of dollars

trillions of dollars uh

killing far away people who literally

going by the statistics are more likely

to be non-combatants than combatants i

think

um collateral damage is a real thing and

even if

every one of those people was someone we

didn't like

uh was the level of effort was the level

of resources that we invested in it

uh was the cost to our national

soul worth whatever it is we can be said

to have gained

uh and i think the answer is that we

have been

uh generationally diminished

not by that president alone but by the

policies that that administration

uh popularized that had been embraced

and continued

uh by the administration since until we

learned that lesson

um we you me everyone else will have an

obligation

uh to try and change things to return us

to a better path

i i agree with you and i also think

there's a real good argument

that there's certain aspects of

technology that have been implemented

in in terms of like warfare and how we

deal with terrorism

that you could say short term perhaps

might have eliminated some targets but i

would argue long term

probably encouraged more people towards

radical fundamentalism

particularly drones when i tell people

the

efficacy of drone attacks and how many

people

who are killed by drone attacks what

i've gone into with people that really

haven't focused on it the amount of

people that are innocent that are killed

by drones

and the the vast majority of that being

the case

that when you're dealing with a hundred

drone deaths it might be like

84 of them are innocent like imagine

that being anything else imagine if the

police did that

if you know they prevented crime by

killing 84 percent

completely innocent people you would say

that's insane like we have to stop that

immediately but because it's done with a

robot that flies through the sky

remotely from nevada by some guy with an

xbox controller

and he's launching missiles into some

sort of a

a car convoy that

we've accepted this and i think there's

a real argument

that that is it's being accepted because

of the remote aspect of it

because we don't we don't see it we

don't feel it it seems

distant and even seems distant from the

person that's holding

the remote control they're saying that

the people that are doing that that are

responsible for operating these drones

are experiencing

a new level of ptsd and a very severe

form of it

many of them they're they're haunted by

the idea of what they've done and the

fact that

even though their own hands have done it

they weren't there to see it

it's some sort of a bizarre disconnect

and that they're murdering literally

who knows what percentage but it's a

very high percentage of innocent people

now this gets us back to uh what i was

talking about

in in calling for the pardon of these

different whistleblowers

um this is the core issue of daniel hale

daniel hale is an american who i believe

is still

on trial they have yet to be convicted

but the government is going to

bury this man if they get the chance for

revealing abuses

in the drone program and the failures of

the drone program

uh and this also gets you know you talk

about this question of efficacy and

percentages we we talk about mass

surveillance

uh just last week this was covered

nowhere

in media that i've seen so far in a

prominent way i think the washington

post

uh wrote an article but it you know it

was buried it wasn't like a front page

a1 sort of top of the

fold splash on the fisa court a lot of

people have heard about the fisa court

because the relationship to the trump

thing

um i hope one of your guys who works in

production can pull out

uh you know a headliner front page or

the the the twitter thread

from elizabeth coyteen i think it's at

liza goyten who went through this

it was published and declassified

version of the fisa

uh reauthorization for last year

where the court goes through every year

and the fbi submits this request

for basically a blanket surveillance

warrant that they can use

on all these different people for all

these different um

sort of categories of behavior that they

want to monitor

and the fisa court reauthorizes this

annually um

and in this uh annual review they look

at

is the system functioning is it

effective were the rules broken

uh and uh one of these experts i think

she worked at the brenner

brennan center for justice um

correct me and edit me out if i'm wrong

here but

um there were thousands of cases in the

last year

thousands of cases where the fbi looked

people up

under uh the aegis of a fisa warrant

right and this is like a mass warrant

that's used for multiple people instead

of one for everyone else and we know how

bad

these fisa warrants can be and over the

course of

thousands of cases

the court found that they had been

unjustified

in uh looking up these people's

background in all but

seven cases i think it was seven cases

out of thousands

and this is uh where it's at we have

created a procedural state a

bureaucratic state

an uh automated system

for policing and i mean that broadly

don't just mean you know guys in

in in in shiny shoes on the ground with

a pistol on their waist

uh i'm talking about is it platform

behavior and speech

on twitter i'm talking about is it

surveillance behavior both domestically

against american citizens and abroad

around the world

we are trying to create a system

that observes everyone and judges

everyone in a way that we already know

is not fair it is not used properly it

is not used appropriately it is not used

effectively

and i believe uh does more harm than

good

and why are we trying to create a system

that sees everything we do and judges us

which is effectively trying to invent

god uh

when we know that it is a dark and

vengeful one

we need to think about the kind of

technologies that we are putting in

place

that rule us but we do not effectively

control

well i think there has to be

repercussions

when you're talking about that where all

case seven of them

the court said oh yes the fbi broke the

rules routinely they did it all the time

uh so we're gonna go ahead and

reauthorize this for next year here's

your rubber stamp come back in you know

12 months exactly but what i'm saying is

i think we as a society

need to demand repercussions for these

overreaches

because it's it's it is a violation of

law

and if it's a violation of law with no

consequences then it's not

then they're we're not talking about law

anymore we're talking about nonsense

we're talking about things you could

just get away with it really is it's a

king class it's someone could just get

away with things

what's the law it doesn't make any sense

or a law that's only enforced against

the powerless but not against the

powerful

right particularly if you or me or jamie

had done the same thing we would for

sure be in jail for a violation of

privacy for invading someone's privacy

for for doing something that is against

the law

if we were tried we would be convicted

we would wind up doing time

or pay some extraordinary fine we would

be in real trouble

is my point but they're not in any

trouble at all that you cannot have that

we can't have that in a society because

if you have that

ability to completely bypass

and any liability and any responsibility

for a violation of law then we've

created two classes of human beings

we've created uh human beings that are

the governed

and then we've created human beings that

are the governors and the governors are

exempt

and that's not that's not government

anymore now you're into some you're in a

monarchy

you're in some craziness yeah you're yes

you're rulers

and the ruled and you can't have that we

can't have that because

of what you said earlier absolute power

corrupts absolutely that is absolute

power

there's no repercussions whatsoever for

violating laws that can greatly

impact people's lives in a negative way

that's crazy

you can't have that we can't have that

and we need to agree

as human beings particularly now because

of the age that we live in and the

access to information that we enjoy

we're aware of this acutely it's obvious

it's it's right in front of our faces

and it's one of the many reasons why i

think you should be exonerated

well i think you should be pardoned i

mean you you've exposed this and you've

opened people's eyes to this

the the exponential increase in people's

understanding and appreciation

for that based on your

work and what the guardian put out and

and and

how you exposed all that it's changed

the conversation

it's changing and it needs to be changed

and the repercussions needs to be

changed as well

well thank you you know i i guess

there's not much more

uh to say than that but i hope uh

one day i will be able to come back um

if i want to see you in real life man

i'll come on the show

and be in the same room for once yeah

well hopefully covert will be gone then

well i'll test you first we'll test each

other first yeah yeah um

but listen i said it before i really do

believe this i think i think you're a

hero and i think that what you've done

history will be kind to you you know um

they will look

back on what what has been done to you

and i i think our government is on the

wrong side of history i really do

believe that

and uh i i think if people really did

know

know the facts and particularly the way

you

uh explained it earlier about how the

information was distributed

and and the way it was handled ethically

and morally

you did the best you possibly could have

done with that situation and i think

it's a

it's an incredibly bold move that you've

done and

and i i feel like uh the time has come

i really do and i i hope i hope

i hope trump listens to this i really do

i hope he listens to this and i hope he

he understands also what a a political

piece

it would be i mean this is a a massive

if he pardoned you i think you would be

a a a massively positive move for

his own the way the you know the united

states citizens

view him well i hope

what we see uh under this administration or any other

but certainly we don't have to wait much

longer for is ending the war on whistleblowers

because as much as i would like to come

home as much as i would like to see recognition

uh from the system uh that there are

times when the only thing you can do

is tell the truth and that should not be a crime

it's not about me it's about what

happens to all of us it's what happens

to the system and it's how we restore

or rather realize the ideal of a country

that we were always told we had

uh but in reality we have never been as

good as what we dreamed

but we're getting closer and the way we

do that is by admitting where we werewrong

and doing better thanks so much for

having me on again i

i really appreciate thanks for being on

man those words and that mentality

are what make you a hero and your

actions so i appreciate you very much man

thanks so much stay free brother you too

my friend take care
