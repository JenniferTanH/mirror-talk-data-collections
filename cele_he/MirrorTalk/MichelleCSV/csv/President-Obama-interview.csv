Michelle,"Well, welcome to my podcast."
Interviewer,Thank you so much for having me on your podcast.
Michelle,Just in case you don't recognize that voice...
Michelle,That is my husband Barack Obama...
Interviewer,It's me!
Michelle,It is you. It is you...
Michelle,Like most Americans we've been spending a lot of time together.
Michelle,in quarantine.
Interviewer,"You don't seem to happy about that the way she said it, right?"
Michelle,It's just a fact.
Michelle,There wasn't a judgment. We've been together...
Interviewer,I've been loving it.
Michelle,"Yeah, I've been having a great time. But we've had some."
Michelle,interesting conversations... Cause these are some crazy times.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"We've spent a lot of time talking about, sort of, how do our views."
Michelle,"about community... How do those shape who we are and shape our choices, and shape our reactions?"
Michelle,"So, I thought we'd start with looking at how we've been shaped by our communities growing up. Our."
Michelle,backgrounds are pretty different just in terms of the structure of our upbringing.
Interviewer,Absolutely.
Michelle,That I grew up with as you call it the...
Interviewer,Leave it to Beaver!
Michelle,The Black Leave it to Beaver....
Interviewer,The Black Leave it to Beavers...
Michelle," With a family of four, you know. A father at home..."
Interviewer,Only thing missing was the dog.
Michelle,"A dog, I know..."
Interviewer,Cause Marian wouldn't let you get a dog.
Michelle,I know...
Interviewer,She feels bad about it now....
Michelle,"And now, I got revenge. I've got two of them..."
Interviewer,You do.
Michelle,And I'd have more if it weren't for you.
Michelle,But I grew up with that family of four...
Interviewer,Classic nuclear family unit.
Michelle,Exactly. And you grew up a little bit differently.
Interviewer,"Ah, things were a little crazier on my side."
Michelle, Well I don't know if it was crazy but it was different.
Interviewer,"Yeah...yeah. Look I was raised mostly by a single mom and my grandparents until we then moved to Indonesia and I had a stepfather and then Maya, my sister, was born. And then I moved back to Hawaii and lived with my grandparents for high school."
Interviewer,It wasn't the classic nuclear family. It was a tight knit family. The thing that maybe we did share was my mom and grandparents were similar to your parents in really prioritizing kids.
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"And, thinking that you had to make sacrifices for kids."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And so, we felt loved and supported. And that's obviously where a."
Interviewer,community starts.
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"One of the things we talked about a lot it that, one way or another."
Interviewer,they didn't have to do it completely alone. That there was a neighborhood or a community or....
Michelle,Extended family...
Interviewer,Extended families. Structures around that helped families raise their.
Interviewer,kids in a loving environment. And they didn't feel as isolated.
Michelle,A lot of the way families ran before recently was an economic necessity. You know my parents were poor...
Interviewer,You're livin on the second floor of you aunt house.
Michelle,"Livin on the second floor of my great-aunt's house because that was a way to save money so that my parents... My mother could stay home. And you know, my mom was able to work on the PTA at our public school because she and a couple of other mothers who could afford to stay home, stayed home and they kept their eye on everybody in the school."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"So there was an opportunity because we saved money and we lived small, as my father said, there were parents who could be in the schools and who could be going on field trips, knowing that there were plenty of single mothers or mothers who couldn't stay home. So, moms like mine were looking out for all the kids at Bryn Mawr Elementary School."
Michelle,My dad's city job paid for everything we did.
Interviewer,Yes.
Michelle,And that's not true today.
Interviewer,Couldn't happen.
Michelle,Couldn't happen.
Interviewer,Because of the higher cost of health care...
Michelle,Wage stagnation.
Interviewer,The higher cost of if you want to send your kid to college.
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"So, you get financial pressures on the family. You then have all these institutions that used to be support systems - shrinking. So more and more, people start thinking in terms of..."
Michelle,Me.
Interviewer,Me. And I do things on my own.
Michelle,And not us.
Interviewer,"I pursue a career. I make money. And then, if I'm successful enough."
Interviewer,"I can be self-sufficient and my family can be self-sufficient. Of course, the challenge is that that kind of set up creates a huge separation between people, between economic levels. Ah, you always had separation, unfortunately, around race..."
Michelle,Right. But now you've got separation within race.
Interviewer,Right. Talk about that cause you... one of the things that happens in your neighborhood is... It's not just white folks who move out over time.
Michelle,Right.
Interviewer,"It's also Black folks who have means. They start saying, ""well we want the same thing.""."
Michelle,We want to go out the suburbs.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"You know we saw that too. I mean, I write in my book about."
Michelle,'white flight.'.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"But the truth is, later on down the line in the 80s or so as Black folks earned more money and got professions, the dream was to move to the suburbs."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,That was the dream of middle-class Black folks too. But I also...
Interviewer,Why did your parents not think about that.
Michelle," You know, my parents were uniquely stubborn about the suburbs. You know, they really..."
Michelle,"Number one, my father never wanted to be house poor. Right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"So, there were times that they talked about buying a home. And I remember going to look at some homes and being excited that - Oh, I am going to have my own room. I was obsessed with having stairs in your house.."
Michelle,Along with a station wagon. Because maybe we're gonna have an upstairs and I can have some stairs. I distinctly remember that. But I also...
Interviewer,"So, you wanted some stairs..."
Michelle,I wanted some stairs! And a station wagon.
Interviewer,Cause now that's some success.
Michelle,That's some success right there.
Michelle,That's some Cleaver success.
Interviewer, Did the Cleaver's have stairs?
Michelle,Everybody had stairs!
Interviewer,They must have had some stairs.
Michelle,Everybody! The Brady Bunch had stairs.
Interviewer,All those people. Damn.
Michelle,The Partridge Family. The only people who didn't have stairs.
Michelle,were...
Interviewer,Was y'all.
Michelle,The Jefferson's and the Evan's Family.
Michelle,And the Robinson's.
Interviewer,And the Robinson's.
Michelle,"So I thought, you know, I want some stairs."
Michelle,"But my parents looked and my dad crunched the numbers and he said, ""You know, if I'm putting all my money into a mortgage then we're not going to be able to go on vacation. I am not going to be able to save for your college..."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"And who cares about stairs? And you know, we grew up in the city. And this is just fine. And you need to learn how to live in the city."" And my father was suspicious of the suburbs because they still weren't completely welcoming."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"We had had incidents of going into the suburbs of Park Forest, that were all white. And I write about the incident where somebody scratched my father's car because we were Black folks in a neighborhood."
Michelle,"So, I think they probably felt a level of safety and security staying in a neighborhood that was surrounded by our extended family. As I said earlier..."
Interviewer,Well one of the things when I move to Chicago - and I started as a community organizer - And I was basically working in the neighborhoods that you grew up in.
Michelle,You were there.
Interviewer,"And I remember when I went to start my job - the guy who was training me - he said, ""The first month all I want you to do is just talk to people.""."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"So I would go around the neighborhoods and just talk to people about how they ended up in Chicago. Folks coming up from the South in The Great Migration. Their parents and grandparents. And people would reminisce, and they would say, ""You know, when we first moved here everybody raised everybody's kids.""."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"That was a really common theme. People would say, ""If I was messing up, it wasn't... Ms. Smith down the street, she'd see me messing up. She'd scold me."
Michelle,Yup.
Interviewer,"Then when I got home, I might get whooped because Ms. Smith would have called my mom..."
Michelle,"""How dare you have Ms. Smith calling me and telling me you were on her grass and then you said...And you had the nerve to talk back boy.""."
Interviewer,Exactly.
Michelle,Boy.
Interviewer,"Right, so what you got was this portrait of a village."
Michelle,"Yeah, things were just...it felt easier in those times..."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,To have a family unit because it wasn't just you were supposed to branch out. That success was defined by your ability to leave your nuclear unit and make it on your own... That wasn't how either one of us was raised.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"Every elder lived with someone. They shared expenses, they shared households, they shared the duties of raising kids. So, there wasn't this feeling that you were supposed to do this thing called loving and supporting you family on your own. You know that seems to be kind of a new thing."
Michelle,"And so, it felt like the community, the neighborhood I grew up with operated on that notion. And it."
Michelle,wasn't just up to that parent to provide that stability and that love.
Interviewer,"Your values always start with those closest to you, right? So, my mom deeply believed in everybody being worthy of love, praise, and support."
Interviewer,"I think part of what also happened because I moved around a lot as a kid and I didn't have a big extended family like you did, was my friendships became really important. All my buddies who you still know... Bobby, Greg and Mike - all the guys I grew up with and have stayed in touch with all these years. That was my crew, that was my family."
Interviewer,"It's interesting when I look back, all of us were from broken homes. All of us were working-class to middle-class, at least from an income perspective, but we were going to a school that had a lot a lot of rich kids. We had to share and improvise, right? So, Greg - he lived on one side of town. The school where we went was a lot closer to my grandparent's apartment. So, he'd sleep at either my place or Mike Ramos' place most of the week. And my grandparents fed him."
Michelle,Fed him.
Interviewer,"And Mike Ramos' mom looked after him and made sure his clothes were clean. You know, his dad was working, Greg's dad was a hard-working guy. The point is... to some degree... We built our own community."
Michelle,"You know that at the core of everything you have done politically, what I know about you as a person and one of the reasons why I feel in love with you is..."
Interviewer,It wasn't just my looks... but that's okay...
Michelle,"You're cute you know... But no, one of the reasons I feel in love with you is because you are guided by the principle that we are each other's brother's and sister's keepers. And that's how I was raised!"
Interviewer,Mm hmm.
Michelle,"I mean, my values, in terms of what I think my obligation - my personal obligation -."
Michelle,is that it is not enough that I succeed on my own. I have to care about the kid in the desk next to me at school because he's just as smart but his mom works.
Michelle,"And my father always kind of taught us to take in everybody's full story. Not to judge people, the drunk."
Michelle,uncle or the cousin out of work...
Interviewer,Cause you didn't know what was happening...
Michelle,"You didn't know what happened to them. You know, we weren't special. And as a result, you know if something good happens to you, if you have an advantage, you don't hoard it. You share it. You reach out. You give back."
Michelle,"And I can say that my family, my neighborhood, my notion of community growing up shaped that view and shaped the choices that I made in life as I felt your experiences shaped yours."
Interviewer,"I think I figured out once I got to school that if I am chasing after my own success, that somehow, I am going to end up alone and unhappy."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And that's why I ended up going into community organizing and the work that I was doing because when I thought about how I was going to spend my life, what I looked at was what those civil rights workers had done...And the freedom writers had done."
Interviewer,"And I thought, you know, that looks like hard work but it never looks like lonely work."
Michelle,"Mm hmm, yeah."
Interviewer,That looks like hard and risky work but it never looks like...
Michelle,Selfish...
Interviewer,"Selfish, isolated, meaningless work..."
Michelle,Yeah.
Michelle,"Here you were, you could have done anything because of your academic achievement. Because you were the number one student at Harvard Law Review, the first Black President of the Harvard Law Review, top of your class..."
Interviewer,"Yeah, see that's why you started dating me... you thought I was."
Interviewer,gonna...
Michelle,"Nah, I didn't even... I didn't know all that."
Interviewer,I was a meal ticket. You didn't know I was gonna do some...
Michelle,"Yeah, I didn't know you were gonna be like, ""What?""."
Interviewer,Broke..
Michelle,"You were running away from the money! I was like, ""What is wrong with this negro?""."
Interviewer,"So, but the thing that a Harvard education gave me, the real ticket that I punched wasn't to chase as much money as I wanted. What I purchased was enough credentials and security that I could go do the crazy things I wanted to do in terms of working in neighborhoods, going in to politics, all that. Knowing that I had enough of a floor beneath me that I was going to be okay."
Michelle,And our paths were almost flipped because I was punching the ticket.
Interviewer,"Yeah, you were that Saab driving..."
Michelle,"I was like... That was what I thought. Get out of school, buy a nice car, you know?"
Interviewer,Remember the wine club? Remember that...
Michelle,"Yeah, I joined. Yes."
Interviewer,You were a wine club member.
Michelle,And we didn't even drink wine back then.
Interviewer,"Nah, I don't want to know how good that wine is left either. I was."
Interviewer,skeptical.
Michelle,"Yeah, I never opened the bottle. I just joined the wine club. It seemed like the very professional thing to do."
Interviewer," Yeah, I think I teased you a little bit on that one."
Michelle,"Oh, definitely. Definitely."
Interviewer,The Saab did have heated seats though.
Michelle,"Oh, you loved the Saab. Don't act like... Especially coming from."
Michelle,that yellow car with that whole in the bottom.
Interviewer,"Cause, at that time I was..."
Michelle,"I was like, ""No we are not taking your car my brother, we are taking the Saab.""."
Interviewer,"I was still driving those thousand-dollar, five-hundred-dollar cars."
Michelle,But I was punching the ticket.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,I was on the track. I was checking my boxes. Because I was doing what I thought I needed to do because I was a poor kid.
Interviewer,Yes.
Michelle,"So, I didn't feel like I had the option to just go off and do other things. But I also had a limited vision of what I could be because schools don't show you the world, they just show you a bunch of careers."
Michelle,"But I came to learn the same thing you learned that while working on the 47th floor in that fancy law firm making all that money, that it felt lonely."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"And it felt isolating. And you know, I had this amazing view of the southeast side of city from my office. I could see the lake and I could see all of the neighborhood that had I come from. And I never felt further from that neighborhood than when I was sitting in that office working on briefs and cases that has nothing to do with anything that helped a broader group of people outside of myself."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,And it felt lonely.
Michelle,"And I say this to young people, 'why did I leave corporate law and go in to community service?' the truth is it was selfish. I was happier. When I left that firm and started working in the city, getting out into the broader community of Chicago and seeing the interconnectedness of these neighborhoods by being alive in the dirt and the grit of helping people..."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,I never looked back.
Interviewer,"You know, you're exactly right. I always to say the years I spent."
Interviewer,"organizing, I got more out of it than the people I was supposedly helping."
Michelle,"Really, we were young. We didn't know..."
Interviewer,We were so young. And inexperienced..
Michelle,"We were stumbling around trying to figure it... We can fix it... It's like, 'No, we can't.' We don't know anything."
Interviewer," Right. So, it not like I set the world on fire but I felt like, ""Okay, I got roots here, I've got a community. I've got people whose stories I know, who know me. Who connect me to a larger vision and larger purpose..."
Interviewer,And one of the things that happened as a community organizer in Chicago is there are all these different neighborhoods. And I know you started to feel that way with doing Public Allies.
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"Talk a little bit about how seeing all these different neighborhoods in Chicago and these young people gave you a better sense of, ""Oh, my community is not just the South Side, my community is all these communities'..."
Michelle,"When I left the firm, I went to the city and I got really interesting."
Michelle,insight and exposure of what it's like to work in a government. But then I had an opportunity to run the.
Michelle,Chicago office of this new non-profit that was basically designed to help young adults 18-30 find careers in public service.
Michelle,"I had to literally go into to almost all 77 community areas that make up the city of Chicago and meet with the heads of alternative school programs or, you know, programs working single mothers, or health care initiatives or fairly qualified health centers..."
Michelle,"I learned so much about the non-profit world but more importantly I got out into this big, broad, amazing city that was Chicago. Because when you grow up in Chicago, as you know..."
Interviewer,You don't leave the neighborhood.
Michelle,You do not leave the neighborhood. Some kids never had ever been from... left the West Side to even go to the South Side. There were kids who has never seen the lake... Lake Michigan.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"There were kids who had never been downtown before. That was not an unusual thing. Because of racism, because of segregation, because of gangs, because of a whole host of things. So I was one of those kids, I saw more of the city because I went to a magnet high school..."
Interviewer,And took the bus.
Michelle,And had to take the bus. Take an hour-long bus ride so at least I.
Michelle,knew downtown. But I had never spent much time on the North Side.
Interviewer,You had... You wouldn't go into Pilsen or...
Michelle,"Pilsen Little Village, which is a predominantly a Latino community with all this culture."
Interviewer,"Devon Street, with this entire Indian-American community. It's like."
Interviewer,you walk down those streets...
Michelle,It's just a whole new world. And they were all alive and vibrant. With good people trying to affect their neighborhoods. And caring...
Interviewer,Polish neighborhoods in Chicago. Second largest outside of Warsaw.
Michelle,Exactly.
Interviewer,More Polish folks than Chicago.
Michelle,And for the first time I felt like a true Chicagoan. I felt the 'we' of.
Michelle,Chicago.
Interviewer,Yes. Exactly.
Michelle,"And that was, by far, one of the best parts of my career development was working with that non-profit organization and meeting kids from all over the city and watching them discover each other and discover different parts of the community. And start to find their power and their voice. I mean..."
Interviewer,"And start to find their common stories, that's right?"
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"But I also think that something changed it seems like in the late 70s, early 80s. And I am a little bit older than you - although I look so much older than you."
Michelle, Good one...
Interviewer,Yeah...
Michelle,Point scored..
Interviewer,"Yeah, but I think when we were coming up the culture wasn't beaten."
Interviewer,"you over the head everyday with what you should have. So, you went back to my grandparent's apartment, right?..."
Michelle,"Oh yeah, it looked like my...our apartment."
Interviewer,It wasn't any bigger than the place you guys stayed. I didn't feel.
Interviewer,poor in that.
Michelle,Exactly. As we didn't feel poor either. But you go back to visit.
Michelle,the house we grew up in...
Interviewer,It's tiny!
Michelle,"You think... On my God, we were broke."
Interviewer,We were broke.
Michelle,"But yeah, we talk about this a lot, it's like...The phrase that sticks with me from my parents is 'Never Enough...Never Enough.' Because the minute you had a little bit of something, you know you had a pint ice cream and a chocolate and you asked for strawberry? You'd get in trouble."
Michelle,"It's like, 'How dare you not be satisfied with what you have.'."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"And then we would feel bad. Because you'd think ""you're right... here I am with all this little bowl of ice cream and I am asking for more..."" you know?"
Interviewer,Yes. Before you even finished!
Michelle,Before you even finished!
Interviewer,You haven't even finished your ice cream!.
Michelle,Never satisfied. Never satisfied. And I find myself saying that to.
Michelle,Malia and Sasha.
Interviewer,I know...
Michelle,That's the biggest thing that gets on my nerves. They know it. It's like we're doing something great and you start looking over at the other...
Interviewer,You start looking over to see what else is next...
Michelle,"Never satisfied, you know..."
Michelle,Stuff doesn't make you happy.
Interviewer,"Yes. So, this were I was going to take it."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,"I think that culturally, we become much more focused on stuff and much less focused on relationships and family. And part of being an adult..."
Michelle,Mm hmm.
Interviewer,Part of being a citizen is you give something up.
Michelle,"So instead of that, we have - you can have it all. You know, that's the philosophy. You know even when I talk to young mothers its, ""how do I have it all?"" You know, or young families..."
Michelle,Because the motto has become not that you sacrifice but you should be able to have it all. And how do you get it? And if you're not getting it then something is wrong.
Michelle,"that was the opposite of how we were brought up. You were never supposed to have it all. In fact, if you had it all, you were being greedy."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"Cause if you have it all, that meant that someone didn't have."
Michelle,anything.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"But that's what we're teaching young people. You should, you know, have a career and you should earn a lot of money. You should be fulfilled. You should have your passion. You shouldn't have to sacrifice that much. You should have it all."
Interviewer,And you now have this sense of kind of a cut-throat competition.
Michelle,We're all on our own.
Interviewer,That we're all on our own.
Michelle,And it's a dog-eat-dog.
Interviewer,And it's a dog-eat-dog.
Michelle,It's not us... it's us against them.
Interviewer,"Right, and we are constantly nervous able where we are going to be on this pecking order."
Michelle,Pecking order.
Interviewer,"And that then reflects itself in our politics, right? Because at a certain point, you know, I am going to start thinking about politics in terms of how do I protect me."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,Not how do I look after us.
Michelle,Help the most people.
Interviewer,"Look the good news is that I think everybody's feeling this uncertainty. This anxiety. This sense that what we've been doing isn't working the way it should. Now, I think you have this big contest of competing ideas. On one side is those who just argue that the problem is just 'them.'."
Michelle,Mm hmm..
Interviewer,"So, there nothing wrong with chasing after as much money as you can get, not investing in public goods..."
Michelle,"Because when the problem is them, you don't really have to."
Michelle,change.
Interviewer,You don't have to change. All you have do to is to stop them from.
Interviewer,taking your stuff. And that is one route that our society and our politics could take.
Interviewer,except this time let's do it in a way the genuinely includes everybody. To me that's the better story.
Interviewer,"If you go back to that basic insight, and just widen it and take the blinders of racism, sexism, homophobia... All those things off. And say really our tribe is everybody."
Michelle,Yeah. And how beautiful and safe...stabilizing that would be. We all have each other to lean on.
Interviewer,Yes.
Michelle,"That we don't have to hold up this big, gigantic thing all by."
Michelle,ourselves.
Interviewer,When everyone was looking about for everybody then the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.
Michelle,Yes.
Interviewer,Everybody gets a little bit more. Kids get more role models even if their family is not doing as well. Because there are people with some clout in these neighborhoods...
Michelle,Everybody benefits from that piece of clout.
Interviewer,"Everybody benefits from their ability to advocate, to make sure the resources are coming in. That whole process of lifting all boats comes about from this network of relationships in a community."
Interviewer,"And the good news is, that when you look at all these young people who've been out there protesting in the wake of the George Floyd murder, that's their instinct. It's not uniform, and it could still go both ways in this country just like its teetering one way or the other in countries all around the world. This is not unique to the United States, it's we just got our own version of it."
Interviewer,How do we live together in a world that is shrinking and we are no longer just living in our own individual neighborhoods? Remember you were talking about Chicago...
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Well, now everybody is on top of each other. And you can't just feel secure in your own neighborhood. Either you are going to war with the other neighborhoods or you start seeing that the people in the other neighborhoods are just like you and not as scary. And let's see how we can put this whole thing together. I think that's how young people... that's their instinct."
Michelle,"The only thing that worries me, and I agree in terms of the hope that I feel when I look at young people - just how they were raised, the values, their exposure, the questions that they have, the change in the economy that's forcing them to ask a certain set of questions - that give me hope."
Michelle,"But the thing that I worry is that I hear, I think, too many young people who question whether voting, whether politics is worth it."
Interviewer,"Well, partly because they have been told. The message is sent every day that government doesn't work. They take for granted all the things that a working government has done in the past..."
Michelle,Yeah.
Interviewer,"In some ways, we're still living on the investment that was made by."
Interviewer,that greatest generation.
Michelle,"I always joke, and I've always said one of the challenges of being."
Michelle,"president... Like you don't have a marketing budget, you know?"
Interviewer,Yeah.
Michelle,"There's really no structure to market government, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"The average young person knows far more about the cereal they're eating, and the car they are driving than they do about what government actually does for them because they don't have marketing budgets. There isn't a jingle..."
Interviewer, The only time they know about what government doing is when...
Michelle,"Is when it doesn't work, right?"
Interviewer,So we're getting a good lesson in that right now.
Michelle,Exactly. If people are paying attention and understand what's.
Michelle,missing.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"Not having, you know, a public health system that takes care of people whether you are working or not. That takes care of you whether you have preexisting conditions or not. Unemployment. Social Security. You know all of the things that sort of keep people going when the chosen path doesn't work.."
Interviewer,"And I think you're absolutely right, that the danger for this generation is that they have become too deeply cynical in government. Not understanding that all government is us collectively making decisions together."
Michelle,That community we talked about.
Interviewer,That community we talked about.
Michelle,"Well and we've talked about this, this is how we raised this."
Michelle,"generation. Right, we just..."
Interviewer,We gave lip service to it...
Michelle,"Yeah, well we didn't complete the cycle of the message, right? You know, I think more people in our generation raised our kids to be more open-minded and to be more thoughtful and considerate. We had the words for it, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"When it comes to fathers raising their girls, I do think that the average father today does believe that their girl can be anything she wants to be and they are delivering those messages around the dinner table."
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,There is a different way of parenting. But what we didn't do... We delivered those messages at the dinner table but we didn't take them to the board room. We didn't change our workplaces; we didn't change things outside the home...
Interviewer,We didn't institutionalize...
Michelle,"We didn't institutionalize the values that we'd been teaching this generation of kids. So now, they are growing up. They are leaving the dinner table and they are going out into the world and going, 'The world doesn't look like what I was taught back home.' You know, and this isn't right."
Interviewer,Young people are idealistic as they have ever been. I think they are more idealistic now than they were when I was growing up. The difference though is that idealism that they feel as if they can channel it outside of governmental structures and outside of politics.
Interviewer,"The problem is, again we're getting a pretty good lesson in this right now, there's some things we just can't do by ourselves or even groups of us can do by ourselves. As general proposition we can't build infrastructure by ourselves, we can't deal with a pandemic by ourselves."
Michelle,"We can't effectively educate the public by ourselves, through."
Michelle,individual schools...
Interviewer,"There just certain things that you have to do collectively cause they're too big, they're too expensive. At the end of the day, I think that people are going to be..."
Michelle,You think that they are going to do the right thing?
Interviewer,I think folks are going to do the right thing.
Michelle,You think they're gonna vote?.
Interviewer,You... You know me... I'm just...
Michelle,"You are the eternal optimist. You're the 'Yes, We Can!' man!"
Interviewer," I'm the 'Yes, We Can!' man. I am the 'audacity of hope'."
Interviewer,guy. You know...
Michelle,Yeah. What's the alternative? That's the thing...
Interviewer,And that's the point.
Michelle,Cynical as I can be in this... in the end I... I agree. We don't have.
Michelle,an alternative.
Interviewer,"I think where we disagree is usually you just think things just have to get super, super bad before folks figure stuff out."
Michelle,"Well, I hope we're at that point."
Interviewer,I'm always thinking... You know what maybe we can learn a little bit...
Michelle,No... we'll figure it out before we crash into the Sun.
Interviewer, Before...
Michelle,"We're getting close, Will Robinson, pull out! And it's like, ""Nah, it's not hot enough...""."
Interviewer, Will Robinson... See that's a reference that anybody under.
Interviewer,fifty will not recognize.
Michelle,"Our older viewers will know Lost in Space. That's okay. But I tend to agree. When in doubt, rely on hope."
Interviewer,Might as well.
Michelle,"Because, well as you pointed out as a former president who reads."
Michelle,and knows history. Let's just take moment to pause and think about that.
Michelle,"But as that person, you understand the arc of progress. We are moving toward more inclusivity, more openness, more we-ness. It's not an easy trajectory."
Interviewer,It's in fits and starts.
Michelle,It is bumpy and it is uncomfortable. And that is how change.
Michelle,happens. It's not just one continuous arc...
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,It's up and down. It's cyclical.
Interviewer,Exactly.
Michelle,"Well, one of the things I want to encourage as we come to a close..."
Interviewer,A close...
Michelle,Because I know you are a busy man. But I want to first of all thank you for...
Michelle,What like you had a choice?
Interviewer,"Right, exactly. What are you talking about? Come on now..."
Michelle,But it's been fun to share...
Interviewer,We like talking!
Michelle,"Conversations that we have around the dinner table. Yes, sometimes our dinners get a little heavy. Part of what I hope that listeners take away from this conversation is not that we have the answers, but these kinds of conversations need to happen around our dinner tables and in our smaller communities for us to just sort of understand and to appreciate the importance that community plays on who we are."
Michelle,And that we can't do this stuff and we're not supposed to do this stuff. We weren't built to do this thing.
Michelle,called life in a vacuum.
Interviewer,Right.
Michelle,"It is much more hopeful, it is much more gratifying, much more effective to live this life as a 'we'. And I think as young people listen to this, as they are starting to shape their paths, I would really strongly encourage them to think about building lives that are self-less."
Michelle,"Not just because it's the right thing to do, but it truly is the better way to live."
Interviewer,It's more fun.
Michelle,It's more fun.
Interviewer,"It's more fun and it comes back. Look, I know that this podcast it focused on a bunch of different kinds of relationships that we all rely on. And maybe one thing everybody can take away from this podcast, relative to the other shows and guests that you are going have on is just that you can isolate healthy friendships, marriages, parenting that goes on from the communities that they are in. So, all these relationships are valuable by themselves but they thrive, they prosper when the whole society is reinforcing these relationships. When you and I think about what's the inheritance that we would like to leave Malia and Sasha, more than anything what it would be is that they are living in a country that respects everybody and looks after everybody. Celebrates and sees everybody. Cause we know that if we're not around, that those girls are in a society like that."
Michelle,"Mm hmm, like that."
Interviewer,They'll be fine. Right?
Michelle,Yeah. That's absolutely right.
Interviewer,Okay.
Michelle,Couldn't have said it better myself..
Interviewer,"Well, you could. Thanks for having me. Appreciate ya."
Michelle,More conversations to come...
Interviewer,I'm so looking forward to all the other podcasts and wisdom that will be doled out.
Interviewer,Love ya.
Michelle,Love you.
