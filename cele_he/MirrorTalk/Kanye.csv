name,line
Interviewer,Yeah Kanye!
Kanye,"I figured if we were all quiet, I wouldn't need a mic in here is that true?"
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"What is the number one thing that you guys want to change, because I want you all to ?"
Interviewer, Education.
Kanye,"All right, get up here. . I want you to explain what the problem with education is."
Interviewer,The problem with education is they don't stick up for minorities or people who aren't in ....
Kanye,"Hold on one second. What I want you guys to do no one to clap, no one to scream until she says I am done with my point."
Interviewer,Yes sir.
Kanye, then explain the issue.
Interviewer,"My name is Summer . People who are marginalized in any community, not just necessarily people of color...."
Kanye,"I know that we are trained to emotionally react to the points that are said to say mm-hmm (affirmative) I agree or mm-hmm (affirmative) I feel that. But today, I want you guys to try, not to try, because trying is failing. What I want you guys to do is show how we can have complete silence until she expresses her point completely. And when she is done and says, We have fully expressed ourselves because I don't love the word, I. Which I get the ."
Interviewer,"Okay, so the problem with education that I was saying is, people are marginalized, they're not teaching all of history. They're only teaching it from one perspective, which is a bigger perspective. That's not always the right perspective and I feel like if we're able to include other people into the perspective and into the conversation, it'll teach the generation coming up how to be more inclusive, how to respond to situations. It'll teach people how to love each other."
Kanye,", history."
Interviewer,Is that okay with you guys?
Kanye,Wait a second. It doesn't have to be okay with you guys because I stated that she was going to do that....
Interviewer,Yes.
Kanye,"So, me as the leader of the free world,."
Interviewer,Yes.
Kanye,Inside of the very first rally.  I've made a decision that Summer is going to express her feelings and information on police brutality. Silence please.
Interviewer,"Okay, so my feelings on police brutality is not everyone should be allowed onto the police force, first of all. So many people are on the police force that shouldn't be in the police force. They just want to have authority in action and power. Not only that, what he was saying about brainwashing, obviously he's right. He's Kanye West."
Kanye,"Pause, pause. If you guys want to whisper, go outside and talk. We need absolute silence, we need absolute order. That is the only way for this country to be back in order. And for us to have absolute order, respect, dignity, and honor for those that we showed up in here and that are speaking. Summer is talking right now, if you see someone next to you that nudges you or tries to whisper. Hold your hand and say, this person is distracting me from what Summer is saying right now, and we will have them escorted out."
Interviewer,"So on the topic of brainwashing, just everything brainwashes us now. Social media, if they want something, they can program it into our minds. TV, social media, literally everything and the state of the nation is just it's in complete dismay."
Kanye,Raise your hand silently if you have another issue that you would like to bring up. I saw your hand first.
Interviewer,My name is Lauren McLeod.
Kanye,This is Lauren McLeod.
Interviewer,No.
Kanye,"Did you put the bricks in the street? I'm not talking about the riots, I'm talking about the bricks in the 80s."
Interviewer,Oh.
Kanye,We're ready.
Interviewer,Education is an important topic. Education....
Kanye,We have no microphone.. You got it.
Interviewer,"Education starts everything. Education starts people who are in our police force, in our healthcare force, in our political force. So, if we're not educated properly, how can we live in America if we don't even have the education to live in America. I grew up in Tulsa. I grew up right here surrounded by white people. There's nothing wrong with white people, but you live with a whole different perspective than everybody else. I lived with a whole different perspective than everybody else and we need to change everything, so we can begin to change."
Kanye,"Okay, so I stubbed my toe. Two years ago. And went to the doctor because you know I've got to , I got to take everything quite serious. I'm not just going to take some ointment or whatever, I'm going to go to the hospital. So, when I got there, 5 doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year, they give out awards for people who have given out the most medication."
Interviewer,"Okay, well I have a statement about pride and how it's different...."
Kanye,About pride.
Interviewer,"Yeah, different places in the United States are trying to , truly acknowledge that there is a difference between ways that we're raised and the way we experience the world."
Kanye,"I understand that there was a very, very hopeful moment that you had to experience for four years when I wore the Trump hat for four years. I'm going to explain to you that Democrats ain't get sh** for blacks. And the most racist thing that's ever been said out loud is the idea that if Kanye West runs for president, I'm going to split the Black votes."
Interviewer,We love you Kanye.
Kanye,I almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter.
Interviewer,No.
Kanye,Calm down everyone. Calm down. Everyone be quiet.
Interviewer,"What about women who got raped? What about women with mental illness?  What about our right to take care of a kid? You want them to take care of a kid? Are you, is that what you're proposing? $50,000 a year for what? For a crazy lady to take care of a baby?"
Kanye,"Now everyone be quiet so you can hear us. . Steve Jobs is adopted. You are adopted. You are adopted. It actually, the whole thing is villages. It takes a village to raise a child. No matter how much money you have, you need grandmothers, you need friends, you need people."
Interviewer,Single moms with no family. Single moms....
Kanye,"Exactly. Because the society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a job. . How many people have to drive 45 minutes to get to their job here? So, I moved to a small town in Cody, Wyoming where people can walk. A four-year-old can walk from school to home safely. We, there's a lot of policies that only relate to what Rockefeller, du Pont, and Cotton set up. You understand what you guys are talking... you guys might want to say in front of me, fuck you Kanye. You realize that I am putting my life on the line for the truth. Right now."
Interviewer,Yes.
Kanye,Let me tell you. The Bible says....
Interviewer,The Bible says a lot of things. The Bible says a lot of things. Jesus had 12 male disciples and that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute..
Kanye,"When I said I had... . Amber Rose. People told me to not date this woman because she was a stripper. There was a lot of comparison to Mary Magdalene. We went to the Vatican together and there was a painting by Raphael and the Christian community might not like this, but there was a smudge next to Jesus at The Last Supper. And the person who showed the painting said, that was Mary. And Amber Rose saw that and started crying. She saw that, that the church tried to erase those who weren't good enough as they saw it in the world."
Interviewer,What are you? Nothing?.
Kanye,"I am Christian, but also I am a listener. You cannot lead without listening. This is the reason... What's your name? This is the reason why Georgia, where I was born, must express their self. People saw me put up a tweet where I showed the six month baby."
Interviewer,Why'd you delete it?
Kanye,"Because I was pressured by the forces that were around me. Now what I'm saying is, I've even heard that they can abort a baby up to eight months, but I wanted to show everyone... In the same way when I got into a car accident, and I showed a picture of my face, I wanted to show everyone exactly what the six month baby that is legal to be destroyed in  looked like. And then I got social media backlash. Bot, I backstroke the backlash."
Interviewer,F*** TMZ!
Kanye," quiet down, right? So let's say when the baby is conceived, at that point it is a soul. It is a real, living thing. That six month year old baby, that's a real living thing. Do we agree that that was a real baby? That six month old baby?"
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"Okay, so My Body, My Choice. Say we were to separate with the baby's mama and y'all had an argument, and you got a one year old. Be like, basically um, 18 months older than the tweet I sent out. Y'all get in an argument and she says, My house, my choice. I'm going to kill your child."" You know what I'm saying? Because when a baby is accepted, it is real. It is real at that point, says I. I don't give a fuck if I win presidency or not. You know what I'm saying? I'm not here to ."
Interviewer,When we steal.
Kanye,When we steal. How else?
Interviewer,When we lie.
Kanye,Lie.
Interviewer,Cheat.
Kanye,"When we cheat. When we not love our neighbor. These are these things. Politics, America, Trump, Biden, nor Kanye West can free us. The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land.  a woman who stood up here and we have the perspective of so many women in the world. You get the last word."
Interviewer,
Kanye,"Wait, wait, wait. Everybody, if everyone just got quiet while Georgia talks, this would be over right now. And if this is over right now, guess what else is over right now? I'm over. And if I'm over right now, guess what else is over. The country's over right now. Everyone pay the same respect to Georgia that you paid to me. She openly opened up to you guys, to me, on a platform and said she had an abortion a few months ago. And her maternal instincts were that she wanted to have the baby, but she felt she couldn't support the baby on $9 minimum wage."
Interviewer,I just think my .
Kanye,"Let me explain something to you guys. My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal, but there should be an option of maximum increase for."
Interviewer,Yep. Yeah.
Kanye,"Okay, so tell me this. If you had had the opportunity to be given a million dollars just for being pregnant, would you have considered? And then everybody would start making children? The greatest gift of life? Maybe there would be a million children on this fucking beautiful place?."
Interviewer,I love Michael!
Kanye,"Oh, do we still love Michael?"
Interviewer,Yeah!.
Kanye,Do y'all love Cosby? Y'all love Bill Cosby?
Interviewer,Yeah!.
Kanye,Be quiet. He's talking about opioids.
Interviewer,I want to talk about opioids and .
Kanye,"And by the way, we're getting addicted to the treatment of the endorphins. Hey, how many times y'all looked up what y'all likes are when you post something? That's a form of treatment. Y'all getting treated. In Chicago, we call that getting treated"". When y'all get to comment number eight, who is that person? You don't even know who that person is."
Interviewer,Nobody!
Kanye,"That's the person that's influencing you, because when you hear bad things about yourself, about a photo, it make you want to up the photo. You want to Photoshop it. You want to."
Interviewer,I'm saying we're addicted to the treatment. They're trying to .
Kanye,"What I said, this is the solution to make it more, to have  Okay, Aisha's comment is on gun violence in the United States. I live on a 4,000 ranch and I can shoot AR15s all day, day, day, night without going to jail and it feels weird because I grew up in Chicago."
Interviewer,"I have two questions. Two quick questions. First question, I want you to elaborate on the ."
Kanye,"I will start the meeting once everyone is completely quiet. Two questions. You got two questions bro, put your hands down. Put your hands down. I'm going to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago. These are good questions. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. I hear you questions. I heard you sir. You don't think I know how to listen? . No they know everyone's irrelevant around me. I heard you the first time. No, no. She got some problems. I heard you the first time. No you don't gap me. On God."
Interviewer,Okay first of all i've got a little message for you from so that was what she was saying okay so what is the.
Kanye,Answer to that that was one in london as cool as I do that you you all went through a lot to get that question asked.
Interviewer,So that was a whole lot i went through to ask that question had I enjoyed London.
Kanye,Coming out just like london it's like one of my homes I feel like like America Japan London and Paris it's like my four.
Interviewer,Homes I guess it's one way to look at it okay um actually um I was quite and cuz I'm.
Kanye,Not a real hip-hop guy so i was quite impressed with the new album because that was more music I will listen to the.
Interviewer,Electronics i'm a tease child i was into synthesizer parents and stuff oh wow great yes thank you I'm glad somebody.
Kanye,Likes it other than just me yeah cuz I get I get a lot of backlash about this album I can imagine what.
Interviewer,Should be a read critic who wrote you should sell headache pills for the album because he can't stand it.
Kanye,Yeah it gives him headaches what let us know what was the idea to go somewhere different than you did before I mean.
Interviewer,Just in life if you've liked the type of music and you listen to it all the time you know why not follow your heart why.
Kanye,Not follow what makes you happy I remember went up I made the song American well I mean the movie American.
Interviewer,Werewolf in paris came out and he had the theme song I think was by blur nothing hurts like your mouth my mouth.
Kanye,And like me and my friends used to love that song so much and it's like we weren't supposed to like the song or.
Interviewer,Something cuz of where we were from wholly like songs like um so kiss me under the moonlight and I'd like all.
Kanye,These songs with just these incredible melodies from the 80s and from the 90s a lot of the 90 stuff the people keep on.
Interviewer,Saying 80s but they were like these mr. Jones and me how's it like all these sweeping melodies in Nirvana and.
Kanye,Like that like and i'm like i really love music and I love to sing songs and I can make music so why not just make.
Interviewer,Music i have to stand above it you know I would hope that all I can do is just do what I feel is right and believe it.
Kanye,And make the best music i can and hope that it overcomes every time because that's my responsibility to keep putting.
Interviewer,Out groundbreaking music and i think my music and it's now I just do what I'm feeling at the time and if I'm tired of.
Kanye,Something then i'm tired of and i don't want to use it and if I'm that tired of something.
Interviewer,Do want to use it and i just i just base it off that like some people don't like auto-tune but I do so I use it you know.
Kanye,Why because my name is on out also you were like the title of the album you were using the item and you're from.
Interviewer,Chicago where house music was born as well and the 808 was one of their tools to make house music.
Kanye,Yeah so do you have any memories there from that time that you were choosing the a way to use you know it's like that.
Interviewer,Honors house music a house beat i haven't quite fully accomplished that but I'd like to I like to be able to.
Kanye,Make an album that's a completely house but as good as some of the house music that some of the classics got a house.
Interviewer,Music hot doom didn't go conquer i'm doomed like I want to be able to make music.
Kanye,Like that i just have to keep on going the studio and trying like house music used to have like these full-on.
Interviewer,Orchestrations horns symphonies these scream and chorus lines on top of them and stuff and they had like beat to it.
Kanye,So i'm just combining like a lot of different styles of music and I think because I'm hip-hop I feel like I have.
Interviewer,The right to use whatever type of music I want cuz that's one thing about hip-hop is like will sample anything we.
Kanye,Want just make it hip-hop but now like more so than being hip-hop music I think I'm Kanye West music it's like it's.
Interviewer,Something more than just hip-hop we had this for ages that yeah but a good a really really good gangster.
Kanye,Record would never get old to me it's like a great gangster movie they could never get old I like I couldn't hip hop.
Interviewer,I like gangster rappers a lot i've always liked gangster rap music so I'm not gonna say that I'm tired of it but I.
Kanye,Will say that when i'm in my apartment just chilling after wrapping all day every night I don't put on it hip-hop.
Interviewer,Music i put on like radiohead I put on port is it I put on superhead a tape by superhead videotape put on red.
Kanye,Hot chili peppers i put on maybe something like RV like the dream but I seldom ly like turn on like the rap.
Interviewer,Music so the design the mountains how do you think is a good symbol for the mood I hear on the record but we'll say a.
Kanye,Good moment to record a record that sounds sad and blue and kind of Moody was that like for you.
Interviewer,Well yeah people always asked was a therapy and even though I scream out I still feel like I didn't get my whole.
Kanye,Point there's no way to express exactly what I was going through but I think it's it's always good to express what.
Interviewer,You're going through to be expressive because these songs might help other people for what they're going through.
Kanye,Especially what's weird is like women really like this out and they connect with it but men there's nobody who.
Interviewer,Speaks on a man's behalf of the way we really feel what's the last album done by a very like you know macho.
Kanye,Guy that expressed feelings and emotion they talked about heart not just like sex and pretty girls and cars but.
Interviewer,Actually like kids and love and family and success and time distribution because the greatest thing that a man.
Kanye,Has to give to anyone with is their kids whether it's their wife is time and how much time do we spend you know chasing.
Interviewer,The american dream we're chasing money and materialistic things how much time do we actually give to the women and.
Kanye,Children and that's what this album more so than you know what type of music you know the way I chose to express it that.
Interviewer,Message is what people need to leave with the most I think do you think this message will reach the people yeah I.
Kanye,Think so but i think that people will be dancing to it and everything and they'll look up and say wow he was really.
Interviewer,Talking about real things in that like it's net artificial you know it's not artificial it's really soulful still.
Kanye,Soul food successful and but you said you feel kind of isolated from what's important in life do you is that true I.
Interviewer,Mean do you feel isolated are you missing something because you're famous yeah just right now it's just think.
Kanye,About time for like me to have family and for me to ration my time a little bit better and spend more time just.
Interviewer,Focusing on those things i mean does that mean you really throw your career and say I stopped my fam new business.
Kanye,Now and that's where the extreme isn't it are there people who are successful rock.
Interviewer,Stars to have kids so that doesn't mean they didn't throw their career away life is now all or nothing life sometimes is.
Kanye,A ration of this and a ration of that to make the perfect mixture drink this is fun one of the most famous singer was.
Interviewer,American boy that you did it with Estelle mm-hmm can you tell us how you both Matt well yeah through John Legend.
Kanye,Because that's john legend's artist so i came to the studio and we just listened to the record and my rap actually was.
Interviewer,Way longer than that and we had to like cut it down that was one verse and we separated it to two verses and cut it.
Kanye,Down because sometimes when i hear beat I just start thinking of so many raps for it yeah it's freestyle and I just.
Interviewer,Freestyle maybe like 10 times then i'll get all my lines that I want to say just be things that just are on the top of my.
Kanye,Mind that i felt like saying you people yeah used to used to now I don't produce a lot at all only produce for my friends.
Interviewer,Like common jay-z don't produce a lot of songs off people no I just focus more on my music I just focus more because.
Kanye,Sometimes you produce for other people they're in charge of you know when it comes out the way it's proceeded the way.
Interviewer,People look at it you know when i produce a song for me it's like not only do I do the song but also like think.
Kanye,Like the outfit that i'm gonna wear when I do the song you know how I'm gonna present it to the world and what the.
Interviewer,Video is gonna look at how it's gonna be performed so if you produced songs for people you'd want to artist it takes.
Kanye,That of care in those records and there's only a couple of artists in the world.
Interviewer,Who take that amount that care as much as I do and some of them have their own producers so like the killer's producing.
Kanye,Themselves but that's the group that cares that much by the way did you like the latest Kazama.
Interviewer,I've been listening to it i'm liking the stuff I'm here and what do you think last week I think it's a weird mixture.
Kanye,Off i mean big off talking heads then they have the Grace Jones piano in it and then another song it's a weird.
Interviewer,Journey i think it's not doesn't sound like one cohesive thing yeah you know I think good this this album I just drop.
Kanye,Is my most cohesive sounding album and any of my albums like really sounds like all these songs belong together whereas.
Interviewer,Some of my other songs albums you could tell they will record it at completely different times and kind of just placed.
Kanye,Together yeah all right your father was a black panther - this is that do you have something a uribl do you rebel side.
Interviewer,Oh yeah i definitely think i'm right well I just stand up for what I believe in.
Kanye,That's it it's like that's what my parents saw me and uh you know I make my own mind up and then I I stand behind it.
Interviewer,Whatever it is you know particularly you know I might not have it on top of my mind now's like something I want to.
Kanye,Rebelled against but whatever it is whatever I believe in I'm standing up for.
Interviewer,I mean you raise your voice a lot you you were talking about homophobia and hip-hop you were saying things about.
Kanye,Because we nothing that happened yeah and so are you a political person I've known a political oh I'm non-political.
Interviewer,And politically incorrect I'm not into politics either your honor no not at all no yeah it's just that.
Kanye,Politics are hobby for some people like watching sports watching politicians watching the news talking about it what.
Interviewer,Do you think about this what do you think about that what do you think about this what do you think about that I.
Kanye,Don't get into it i like looking at clothes and art and movies like in making music so fine we have youth.
Interviewer,Magazine a teenager magazine bravo and this last week they put Obama in and I mean America's far away so and why.
Kanye,Should driven kids care about it he's a pop star means answer he say he's a pop star they put pop stars in that magazine.
Interviewer,Obama is the most popular person on the planet he's a pop star that's why they played it the pop magazine okay.
Kanye,Yes quite important you know with the way I'm raised and the idea that it's a place on earth that can allow something.
Interviewer,Like that to happen it's so incredible i can't even see that happening in other countries you know so it's just amazing.
Kanye,Moment of time a moment of time makes you believe that anything is possible .
Interviewer,"Kanye, it's great to be with you."
Kanye,Great to be here.
Interviewer,"And these are two friends of mine. And Kanye has been a friend of mine for a long time. And Jim is, Jim came out of nowhere, and he said, ""I like what the President is doing."" A long time ago we met. Right? And I just appreciated it very much. And, you know, if you look at the employment numbers, if you look at the median income, if you look at every single indicator, we're keeping our promise, Jim. Thank you. And I want to thank you."
Kanye,You stopped the war.
Interviewer,"We really stopped the war. Saved millions of lives. You know, Seoul has 30 million people. You don't realize how big. Thirty million people who are right near the border; 30 miles off the border. Millions of people would have been killed. And I will say, Chairman Kim has been really good. Really good. And we've made a lot of progress. That's nice that you say that, because that's a big, that's a big thing. These folks were covering, they were covering North Korea not, I think not very promisingly. And there were a lot of problems. President Obama said that was his biggest problem. And I don't say anything is solved."
Kanye,"You, day one, solved one of the biggest problems."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,We solved one of the biggest problems.
Interviewer,"It was a big solving. And not solved yet, but I think we're along, I think we're on the way."
Kanye,"Yeah, we have Larry Hoover's lawyer with us today. And it's a prisoner that was focused on, he has six life sentences, and they have him next to the Unabomber doing 23 and 1. That means."
Interviewer,What did he do? Larry? What happened?
Kanye,What prison is that? Name the prison.
Interviewer,"ADX supermax, in Florence, Colorado. They house the Unabomber, al Qaeda operatives, mass killers, Oklahoma City bomber, things of that nature."
Kanye,"And really, the reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around. So there's theories that there's infinite amounts of universe and there's alternate universe. So it's very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I'm moving back to Chicago and it's not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer and having a monolithic voice that's forced to be a specific party. You know, people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrat. I have a, I've had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat. They say, you know, first of all, it's a limited amount of jobs. So the fathers lose the jobs, and they say, ""We'll give you more money for having more kids in your home."" And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the '80s and the '90s, and the prison rates just shot up. And now you have ""Chiraq,"" what people call ""Chiraq"", which is actually, our murder rate is going down by 20 percent every year. I just talked to the superintendent; met with Michael Sacks; that's Rahm's right-hand man. So I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends. But this hat, it gives me, it gives me power, in a way. You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home. And also, I'm married to a family that, (laughs), you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It's beautiful, though. But there's times where, you know, there's something about, you know, I love Hillary. I love everyone, right? But the campaign ""I'm with her"" just didn't make me feel, as a guy, that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman. That was my, that's my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cape. For me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys, non-political, no bullshit, put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay, and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. Because at Adidas, when I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now we have a $38 billion market cap. It's called the ""Yeezy effect."" And I went to Casper. We had a meeting in Chicago. And I said, ""You have to bring manufacturing onshore."" And not even shore; into the core. It's not about the border; it's the core of Adidas. And Chicago is the core of Middle America. And we have to make Middle America strong. So I had the balls, because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, for no, because it's habilitation, not rehabilitation, because they didn't have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone that taught us. They didn't teach us. Exactly, we had no one that ""taught"" us. Right? So it's more important than any specific deal, anything, that we bring jobs into America, and that we provide a transition with mental health and the Amer-I-Can education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he's worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWork has a beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation. There's a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say ""abolish"" with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that's a trap door? If you're building a floor, the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you, accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up, you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship. The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment, and I think the way the universe works, it's perfect. We don't have 13 floors, do we? You know, so the four, the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn't look like the people they were amending. Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read, or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave. Again, so what I think is, we don't need sentences; we need pardons. We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain, it's equal on three parts. I'm going to go ahead drop some bombs for you, 98 percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I'm going to work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent, Tesla, Freud. So he said that I actually wasn't bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name. So all this power that I got, and I'm taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn't be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage. And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That's one thing, I've never stepped into a situation where I didn't make people more money. So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories. We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring, Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota."
Interviewer,Wisconsin.
Kanye,Fifty-three thousand.
Interviewer,Wisconsin. Yeah. Wisconsin.
Kanye,"Yeah. Wisconsin. They have 4,000 jobs. People making $53,000 a year. And one of the things we got to set is Ford to have the highest design. The dopest cars. The most amazing. I don't really say ""dope."" I don't say negative words and try to flip them. We just say positive, lovely, divine universal words. So the flyest, freshest, most amazing car. And what we want to start with is, I brought a gift with me right here. This right here is the iPlane1. It's a hydrogen-powered airplane. And this is what our President should be flying in. Look at this, Jared. (Laughter.)."
Interviewer,We'll get rid of Air Force One. Can we get rid of Air Force One? (Laughter.) No? You don't like that idea.
Kanye,"Well, we're going to have Apple, an American company, work on this plane with, But you know what I don't like about, it's not that I don't like, what I need *Saturday Night Live* to improve on, or what I need the liberals to improve on is, if he don't look good, we don't look good. This is our President."
Interviewer,It's true.
Kanye,"He has to be the freshest, the flyest, the flyest planes, the best factories. And we have to make our core be in power. We have to bring jobs into America because our best export is entertainment and ideas. But when we make everything in China and not in America, then we're cheating on our country and we're putting people in positions to have to do illegal things to end up in a cheapest factory ever"
Interviewer,"I'll tell you what, that was pretty impressive, folks. (Laughter.) You know, I hate to say this, Jim, do you want to say something? (Laughter.) What do you after that?"
Kanye,It was from the soul. I just channeled it.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"I think we need to care about all people. And I believe that when I went on to NBC, I was very emotional, and I was programmed to think from a victimized mentality. A welfare mentality. I think that with blacks and African Americans, we really get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry. We say if people don't have land, they settle for brands. We want Polo-sporting Obama again. We want a brand more than we want land. Because we've haven't known how it feels to actually have our own land and have ownership of our own blocks. So when you don't have ownership, then it's all about how something looks. It's about the patina; it's not about the soul, it's not about the core. So we focus more on, is somebody wearing something; is someone disrespecting so I got to shoot them. Or the idea of someone being racist. You know, we talk about police murders, which we definitely have to discuss, and we have to bring nobility to the police officers and make, the police officers are just like us. But there's this whole hate-building, right? And that's a major thing about racial tension. And we also, as black people, we have to take a responsibility for what we're doing. We kill each other more than police officers. And that's not saying that the police officer is not is not an issue, because they are in a place, a position of power. But sometimes they're in a place of law enforcement. They need to be law-power. It's force versus power. And when you, you shouldn't have to force people to do that. So a lot of times the police officer is sitting there, they're being forced to do this and forced to do that block. And then they force somebody into something and force into something. We have to release the love throughout the entire country and give opportunities. A lot of times it's just the overall lack of reparations that we, at any given point, we say, ""Oh, this is racist. This is racist. This is racist. This is racist."" So we don't have reparations, but we have the 13th Amendment. We got to open up the whole conversation. So, and that's a move. One of the moves that I love that liberals try to do, the liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism, because they know that we are very proud, emotional people. So when I said ""I like Trump"" to, like, someone that's liberal, they'll say, ""Oh, but he's racist."" You think racism could control me? Oh, that don't stop me. That's an invisible wall."
Interviewer,"But you don't think, you reject those who say he's racist?"
Kanye,"On your question, and you had one question; we're going to do it to another question."
Interviewer,(Laughs.) Okay.
Kanye,I answered your question. I don't answer questions in simple soundbites. You are tasting a fine wine. It has multiple notes to it. (Laughter.) You better play 4D chess with me like it's *Minority Report*. Because it ain't that simple. It's complex.
Interviewer,"When would you like, I'm from the *Chicago Sun Times*, sir. I would like to know what you would like to ask President Trump to do for Chicago. You're here to talk about crime in Chicago."
Kanye,"The thing that the head of the police and Mike Sacks met with me last night at the Soho House about was we feel that stop and frisk does not help the relationships in the city. And everyone that knew I was coming here said, ""Ask about stop and frisk."" That's the number-one thing that we're having this conversation about. Another thing is opening up industries. And we've got to get some tax breaks too. Because we're making, we got a Speedfactory in Atlanta, but the shoes are costing us $300, so it's costing us too much to make things. So we need some prototypes here so we can get people back working, so China can't just beat us and Vietnam can't beat us. You got Levi's, the greatest jeans company in the world, making their jeans in Vietnam. So we're going to need to get a few breaks to be able to have some places in my hometown of Chicago, and 2.7 million to the 9 million surrounding suburbs where we can create some factories. Now, I think it would be cool for them to be Trump factories, because he's a master of industry. He's a builder. And I think it would be cool to have Yeezy ideation centers, which would be a mix of education that empowers people and gives them modern information like, sometimes people say, ""This kid has ADD. This kid has ADD."" He don't have ADD. School is boring. It was boring. It's not as exciting as this. We have to make it more exciting. We have to mix curriculums. You play basketball while you're doing math. You learn about music while you meditate in the morning. We have to instate mental health and art programs back into the city. So those are, And also, Larry Hoover is an example of a man that was turning his life around, and as soon as he tried to turn his life around, they hit him with six life sentences. So I believe he's, you say don't tear down the statues? Larry Hoover is a living statue. He's a beacon for us that needs to see his family; that needs to go out and represent. When you have a block leader on every single block, they can own the block as their own. That's something I learned from Jim Brown, from ""Amer-I-Can."" We need to put curriculums for people who really came from the streets, not people who were just trying to set us up to go into a work system or prison system that applies to what people are really going through, which Jim Brown has created."
Interviewer,"What about gun violence? With all the debate about the Second Amendment going on, how do you fix that?"
Kanye,"The problem is illegal guns. Illegal guns is the problem, not legal guns. We have the right to bear arms."
Interviewer,President Trump has said that he favors stop and frisk. Are guys going to be discussing that? Do you think you can change his mind?
Kanye,"Yeah. We're going to discuss that. I didn't mean to put you on blast like that, bro, but."
Interviewer,"No, no. It's okay. (Laughter.)."
Kanye,But this is definitely a.
Interviewer,"Hey, I'm open-minded. I'm here. I am open-minded."
Kanye,Only after him. It'll be 2024.
Interviewer,Could very well be. That's good. I'm glad to hear that.
Kanye,"We have a good, and the thing is, let's stop worrying about the future. All we really have is today. We just have today. Over and over and over again, the eternal return. The hero's journey. And Trump is on his hero's journey right now. And he might not have expected to have a crazy motherfucker like Kanye West run up and support, but best believe we are going to make America great. Now, the thing is my, another thing is black people have an issue with the word ""again."" And I believe, my feeling from that is because I'm going to throw, I'm going to go all the way, (inaudible), because time is a myth. All we have is now. All we have is today. So the word ""again"", it doesn't hurt us because the idea of racism and slavery, different things; it hurts us because we need to focus on who we are now, today, I believe. So I actually brought some hats in that have a bit of a transition. I'm not trying to put you, (inaudible) in the spot a little bit. I made a hat that says ""Make America Great."" Just that. But I would love to see, at the Super Bowl, Trump wearing the ""Make America Great"" hat; Colin making, wearing the ""Make America Great, and showing that we can bend a bit on this side, we can bend a bit on this side, and we can learn how to be malleable in the infinite universe that we are and the loving beings that we are. That we don't have to stick to our own traditions. And we aren't a side. We are one unit. We are one country. We are one moment in history and time. We might have been here before, but right now we're here together. And our greatest value that people have are other people. And we need to stop working on (inaudible). It's like gang again."
Interviewer,Let me ask you this question. You're in the Oval Office.
Kanye,Okay. (Laughs.).
Interviewer,How does it feel to be in the Oval Office?
Kanye,"Oh, it is good energy in this."
Interviewer,Isn't it good energy?
Kanye,It's good energy.
Interviewer,"It's a great place. Jim, how do you feel?"
Kanye,"You said, you said, I guess, you know I love you."
Interviewer,I know.
Kanye,Did I.
Interviewer,"But I don't want to take, I don't want to put you in that spot, but."
Kanye,"No, I'm standing in that spot. I love this guy right here. Let me give this guy a hug right here. (Laughter.) I love this guy right here."
Interviewer,"That's really nice. Come here. That's really nice. And that's from the heart. I didn't want to put you in that position. (Laughter.) But that's from the heart. Special guy. These two are special people. Whether you like it, whether you don't like it, they're special people. And I appreciate it. Jim, Kanye, I appreciate it. So let's go have some lunch. Thank you all very much."
Interviewer,Our first guest is one of the MOST TALENTED MEN IN THE WORLD. HE IS A MULTI-AWARD-WINNING.
Kanye,"Recording artist, fashion DESIGNER AND SHOE SALESMAN. HIS NEW ALBUM IS CALLED YE.."
Interviewer,Please welcome kanye west.  FIRST OF ALL THANKS.
Kanye,"For being here and thank you for THE SHOES. NOBODY EVER BRINGS ME SHOES, YOU."
Interviewer,"Brought me shoes, that's very NICE OF YOU, VERY KIND. I'LL TELL YOU A STORY AND THIS."
Kanye,"Is honestly true. THE LAST TIME, A FEW YEARS AGO YOU SENT ME A PAIR OF YEEZYS.."
Interviewer,I have never in my life had more PEOPLE COME UP AND TALK TO ME THAN WHEN I WAS WALKING AROUND.
Kanye,"In them to the point where i was LIKE, THIS IS CRAZY, I'VE GOT TO GET THESE OFF, PEOPLE ARE."
Interviewer,Chasing me. I'M WORRIED PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BEAT ME UP AND TAKE THESE..
Kanye,Usually people wait i've seen THEM SLEEPING ON THE STREET WAITING FOR THESE SHOES..
Interviewer,Is that for you more rewarding THAN HEARING PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKE YOUR MUSIC?.
Kanye,"Both. IT'S BOTH, YEAH. SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE THE THING."
Interviewer,"You are accustomed to hearing AND YOU START HEARING SOMETHING ELSE, AND IT'S MORE EXCITING TO."
Kanye,"Hear something else. BUT NOT FOR YOU. YEAH, WHEN YOU GO OUT AND DO."
Interviewer,"Creative journeys, it is EXCITING FOR PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE THAT.."
Kanye,"Yeah. ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS."
Interviewer,Possible. LIKE WHEN I STARTED OFF IN CHICAGO AS AN ARTIST..
Kanye,"As a i'm a visual artist, i WENT TO ART SCHOOL. RIGHT.."
Interviewer,And i decided to start doing MUSIC AND PEOPLE SAID IT WOULDN'T WORK OUT..
Kanye,"Then i started producing and SELLING BEATS AND I STARTED SELLING BEATS TO JAY-Z, ROCKA."
Interviewer,"Fella and that went well. I SAID I WANTED TO RAP AND PEOPLE SAID THAT WOULDN'T WORK,."
Kanye,"Producer rapper, it meant you WOULDN'T RAP AS WELL AS THE REAL RAPPERS.."
Interviewer,That started working out. I SAID I WANTED TO DESIGN CLOSES AND THAT STARTED WORKING OUT..
Kanye,What's the next  WHAT IS NEXT FOR YOU? WELL.
Interviewer,Space force? .
Kanye,I would totally be involved. YOU SHOULD DESIGN THE UNIFORMS FOR THE SPACE FORCE..
Interviewer, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD DO IF PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED YOU.
Kanye,"To do that? I'M INTO DESIGNING. YEAH, WHY NOT.."
Interviewer, YOUR WIFE WAS HERE LAST WEEK  SPACE FORCE!.
Kanye,"Oh my goodness. SOMEBODY PUT A LEASH ON HIM, WILL YOU?."
Interviewer,Your wife was here last week. AND SHE'S VERY NICE. AND SHE DID SOMETHING I WOULD.
Kanye,"Imagine you're very proud of. SHE WENT TO WASHINGTON, SHE SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT, AND SHE."
Interviewer,"Actually convinced him to grant CLEMENCY TO A WOMAN WHO GOT LIFE IN PRISON, LIKE REAL LIFE IN."
Kanye,"Prison, for a first-time drug OFFENSE. WAS THAT SOMETHING YOU DISCUSSED."
Interviewer,With her before she did it? SHE'S SUPER PASSIONATE ABOUT IT..
Kanye,And it was amazing for to see THAT DREAM COME TRUE. WERE YOU EVER.
Interviewer,Concerned about her being alone IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP?.
Kanye," PEOPLE GOT REALLY MAD WHEN YOU WERE WELL, SOME."
Interviewer,People were very happy when you SAID YOU LIKED PRESIDENT TRUMP. DO YOU LIKE DO YOU THINK HE.
Kanye,Is a good president? YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ME CAN I ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION?.
Interviewer,"Answer whatever you WANT. WELL, YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY,."
Kanye,"You know. IN THIS WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN, THERE'S TWO MAIN MOTIVATING."
Interviewer,Forces. AND I TWEET ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME..
Kanye,"It's love or fear. AND YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN LOVE. YOU KNOW, MY COUSIN IS LOCKED UP."
Interviewer,For murder. AND I LOVE HIM. SO HE DID A BAD THING BUT I.
Kanye,"Still love him. AND JUST AS A MUSICIAN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, GUY OUT IN."
Interviewer,"Hollywood, all these different THINGS, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE AROUND ME TRIED TO PICK MY."
Kanye,Candidate for me. AND THEN TOLD ME EVERY TIME I SAID I LIKED TRUMP THAT I.
Interviewer,"Couldn't say it out loud or my CAREER WOULD BE OVER, I'D GET KICKED OUT OF THE BLACK."
Kanye,"Community because blacks are SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MONOLITHIC THOUGHT, WE CAN ONLY BE."
Interviewer,Democrats and all. SO EVEN WHEN I SAID IT RIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL.
Kanye,"And i expressed myself, and when I CAME OUT I HAD LOST MY CONFIDENCE.."
Interviewer,So i didn't have the confidence TO TAKE ON THE WORLD AND THE POSSIBLE BACKLASH..
Kanye,And it took me a year and a half TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO STAND UP AND PUT ON THE HAT..
Interviewer,No matter what the consequences WERE. AND WHAT IT REPRESENTED TO ME IS.
Kanye,"Nothing about policies because I'M NOT A POLITICIAN LIKE THAT, BUT IT REPRESENTED OVERCOMING."
Interviewer,"Fear and doing what you felt, no MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAID, IN SAYING, YOU CAN'T BULLY ME.."
Kanye,"Liberals can't bully me, news CAN'T BULLY ME, THE HIP-HOP COMMUNITY, THEY CAN'T BULLY ME.."
Interviewer,"At that point, if i'm afraid to BE ME, I'M NO LONGER YE. THAT'S WHAT MAKES YE.."
Kanye,I actually quite enjoy when PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE MAD AT ME ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS.
Interviewer,"You must enjoy it, YEAH. ."
Kanye,"I actually quite enjoy it. BECAUSE YOUR WIFE WAS MAD AT YOU, RIGHT?."
Interviewer,"According to your song, your WIFE WAS UPSET ABOUT THAT. RIGHT OR WRONG, OR EVEN IF I."
Kanye,"Change my mind about it or THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE, WHICH I'M NOT SAYING I DID JUST PLACE."
Interviewer,The thought out there that EVERYONE'S BAD THINKING SOMETIMES..
Kanye,"Galileo, they went to chop his HEAD OFF FOR SAYING THAT THE EARTH WHAT DID HE SAY?."
Interviewer,The sun revolved around the EARTH? VICE VERSA..
Kanye,Right. SO WHEN YOU HAVE MODERN  BUT THE SUN.
Interviewer,"I'm not concerned about the SPECIFICS, SIR. ."
Kanye,"Right, right.  DO YOU EVER REGRET."
Interviewer,"Anything you say? OR IS IT JUST YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE, HEY, I PUT IT OUT THERE,."
Kanye,"It's out there, there's no point IN REGRETTING IT? I THINK PEOPLE FOCUS TOO MUCH."
Interviewer,On the past and focus too much ON REGRET. EVEN LIKE WHEN YOU DEAL WITH.
Kanye,Schools. LIKE YOU TAKE LIKE THE SLAVE IDEA..
Interviewer,"My point is, i've heard of HISTORY CLASS. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A CLASS THAT."
Kanye,"Breaks down how you, you know, BALANCE A CHECKBOOK OR HOW YOU CONTROL YOUR FINANCES, WHICH MY."
Interviewer,Father never taught me that. AND I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A FUTURE CLASS..
Kanye,So they keep us so focused on HISTORY THAT WE START TO BELIEVE THAT IT ACTUALLY REPEATS ITSELF..
Interviewer,And we become overly TRADITIONAL. AND WE CAN'T ADVANCE AS A RACE.
Kanye,Of beings. WE GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE PAST AND WHAT EVERYONE'S SAYING AND.
Interviewer,What everyone's tweeting. AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO BE FEARLESS ENOUGH TO BREAK THE.
Kanye," simulation. WHEN I SAY SIMULATION, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY SIMULATION.."
Interviewer,"Sorry, i know you guys wanted to CLAP BUT EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO SAY IS GOING TO BE AMAZING.."
Kanye, HERE'S THE IDEA WHY YOU'RE IN A.
Interviewer,"Simulation. LET'S START WITH ACTING, FIRST OF ALL.."
Kanye,"A 2-year-old screams at a RESTAURANT, THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT SCREAMS, TEACH THAT."
Interviewer,Kid how to act. WE'RE ALL UNPAID ACTORS IN SOME GIANT SCRIPT THAT WE DIDN'T.
Kanye,Write. SIMULATION. A 2-YEAR-OLD JUMPS ON A COFFEE.
Interviewer,"Table and someone says, that's a COFFEE TABLE, DON'T JUMP ON THAT.."
Kanye,"So it went from being something THAT MAKES HIM FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN, HE'S GOT HIS CAPE ON,."
Interviewer,"To something where he has to THINK ABOUT IN THE PERSON'S LIKE A FAMILY MEMBER, HE'S 2 YEARS."
Kanye,"Old, doesn't give a  ABOUT A COFFEE OR A TABLE. HE'S STARTING TO LIKE CALCULATE."
Interviewer,All these things. BY THE TIME YOU'RE 40 YEARS OLD YOU'VE GOT A WALL FULL OF COFFEE.
Kanye,"Tables calculating you into CLA TRAFFIC, CALCULATING YOU INTO."
Interviewer,"Your career choice, calculating YOU INTO THIS TOWNHOUSE THAT'S NOT QUITE AS BIG AS THE."
Kanye,Townhouse next and it just never WORKS. THAT'S THE SIMULATION THAT I'M.
Interviewer,Talking about. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY SIMULATION..
Kanye,I think i understand WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BUT I MIGHT NOT..
Interviewer,"But also maybe people don't want THE KID TO GET HURT JUMPING ON THE COFFEE TABLE, YOU KNOW?."
Kanye,We are too protective. WE ALWAYS DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO GET HURT..
Interviewer,Can you imagine me talking to my PUBLICIST BEFORE I SAY I'M GOING ON TV AGAIN?.
Kanye, YOU SHOULD BE WEARING.
Interviewer,A helmet. I'M GOING ON TV BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME..
Kanye,"I love jimmy. WE CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND NOT A DIATRIBE,."
Interviewer,You know. IT'S LIKE WE CAN I GOT THAT FROM SARAH JESSICA PARKER..
Kanye,Is that right? YES. .
Interviewer,Shout-out. SHOUT-OUT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK.
Kanye,Gets missed on tmz is the main THING I WAS STRESSING IS THE IDEA OF TRYING LOVE..
Interviewer,"You know, we're always, you KNOW PUSHING OUT SO MUCH HATE AND LOVE CAN CURE SO MUCH.."
Kanye,"Just to think, am i moving in LOVE? IS THIS OUT OF LOVE?."
Interviewer,"Not out of pride. PRIDE IS A WORD PEOPLE SAY IN A POSITIVE CONNOTATION, BUT IT'S."
Kanye,Actually one of the seven deadly SINS. IT TAKES TOO MUCH OWNERSHIP..
Interviewer,"You can replace pride with love. AND WHEN I SEE PEOPLE JUST EVEN LIKE GO AT THE PRESIDENT, IT'S."
Kanye,"Like, why not try love? FOR ONE PERSON TO STAND UP AGAINST ALL ODDS AND JUST HUG."
Interviewer,Somebody the way that alice JOHNSON HUGGED HER FAMILY WHEN SHE GOT OUT OF JAIL..
Kanye,That one by one by one we can DEFUSE THIS NUCLEAR BOMB OF HATE THAT WE'RE IN AS A SOCIETY BY.
Interviewer,Thinking of everyone as our FAMILY. AND HOW WOULD WE TREAT OUR KIDS?.
Kanye,How would we treat  IPY THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT BUT IN LITERAL TERMS.
Interviewer,There are families being torn APART AT THE BORDER OF THIS COUNTRY..
Kanye,There are literally families BEING TORN APART AS A RESULT OF WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS DOING..
Interviewer,"And i think that we cannot FORGET THAT, WHETHER WE LIKE HIS PERSONALITY OR NOT, HIS ACTIONS."
Kanye,"Are really what matter. I MEAN, YOU SO FAMOUSLY AND SO POWERFULLY SAID, GEORGE BUSH."
Interviewer,Doesn't care about black people. IT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP.
Kanye,"Does, or any people at all? WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK, WE'LL COME BACK, AND KANYE WEST IS."
Interviewer,Here! HIS ALBUM IS CALLED YE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK..
Kanye,Kanye west. WE JUST GOT THIS MAGAZINE. BAZAAR MAGAZINE..
Interviewer,"There you are with the kids. THEY'RE VERY, VERY CUTE. CLIMBING ON YOUR HEAD.."
Kanye,Do you dress them? DO YOU DRESS THEM? DO YOU PICK THEIR OUTFITS?.
Interviewer,Uh-huh. YOU DO? IS THAT FUN FOR YOU?.
Kanye,Uh-huh. DO YOU DESIGN OUTFITS FOR THEM?.
Interviewer,Uh-huh. YOU DO. .
Kanye,Do they love that? YES. DO THEY UNDERSTAND.
Interviewer,"That process, that you draw SOMETHING AND IT BECOMES THEIR CLOTHES?."
Kanye,My daughter went to a fashion CAMP FOR FIVE DAYS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO..
Interviewer,"And i visited her, and we put  TOGETHER WE PUT THE THREAD THROUGH THE SEWING MACHINE.."
Kanye,And it really brought me to TEARS TO THINK ABOUT THE 15 YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON.
Interviewer,"Apparel and for my friend virgil TO BE THE HEAD OF LOUIS VUITTON, FOR ME TO HAVE THIS, YOU KNOW,."
Kanye,"$1.8 billion company out of, you KNOW, A THREAD GOING THROUGH. AND SHE MY DAUGHTER ASKED ME,."
Interviewer,"Daddy, do you have a sewing MACHINE LIKE THIS AT YOUR OFFICE?."
Kanye,And i brought her to my office. AND SHE DID A BUNCH OF SKETCHES. AND MY HEAD PATTERN CUTTER MADE.
Interviewer,Her dresses right there. REALLY. FOR HER..
Kanye,"So she loves coming to the OFFICE AND DOING SKETCHES. BOY, THAT'S SO MUCH."
Interviewer,More fun than my dad's office.  ONE OF THE SONGS ON YOUR ALBUM.
Kanye,"Is about you're in the song, CORRECT ME IF I HAVE ANY OF THIS WRONG.."
Interviewer,You're imagining your daughter AS AN ADULT DATING AND MEN LOOKING AT HER..
Kanye,"Uh-huh. AND YOU'RE VERY, VERY WORKED UP ABOUT THIS.."
Interviewer,Uh-huh. PREMATURELY SOME MIGHT SAY..
Kanye,"Do you think about that? YOU THINK THAT FAR AHEAD? OH, I THINK LIFETIMES AND."
Interviewer,Lifetimes ahead. AND THAT AND YOU ACTUALLY ARE IMAGINING LIKE GUYS.
Kanye,Objectifying do you feel like YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS WOMEN HAS CHANGED SINCE HAVING DAUGHTERS?.
Interviewer,"Nah, i still look at porn HUB. ."
Kanye," WHAT KIND OF STUFF DO YOU LOOK AT, WHAT CATEGORIES?."
Interviewer, BLACK IS MY FAVORITE CATEGORY..
Kanye,You don't have to go INTO THAT. .
Interviewer,"I mean, you can if you want. HEY, I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING KANYE WEST IF YOU."
Kanye,"Can't? YEAH, LET'S HAVE IT. A LOT OF BLACK ON WHITE,."
Interviewer,"Obviously. OH, YEAH. ."
Kanye,"It's mirroring your own self, YOUR OWN SITUATION. MY OWN REALITY.."
Interviewer,Right. IT'S LIKE BUBBLY MASTURBATING IN A WAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT..
Kanye,How do you do that?  I NEED THAT DOUBLE.
Interviewer,I'll show you after THE SHOW. .
Kanye,"No, i don't want to. YOU HAVE SOME REALLY HEAVY SONGS.."
Interviewer,One of them is called i thought ABOUT KILLING YOU. IS THAT SONG ABOUT SOMEBODY IN.
Kanye,Particular? AND IS IT ME? .
Interviewer,"You know, someone e-mailed me AFTER THAT SONG CAME OUT AND SAID THAT THEY HAD THEIR MOM."
Kanye,Had passed away and that they HAD TAKEN 60 PILLS. AND THAT THEY TRIED TO KILL.
Interviewer,"Themselves. AND THEY WROTE AT THE END OF IT, PREMEDITATED MURDER.."
Kanye,"So it's  AND THAT IS A REFRAIN, YOU SAY PREMEDITATED MURDER.."
Interviewer,That came from somebody writing YOU? NO..
Kanye,After the song came out. AFTER. BUT SAYING THAT THIS PERSON.
Interviewer,Taking these pills and trying to KILL THEMSELVES WAS A FORM OF PREMEDITATED MURDER..
Kanye,"Sure. AND WHAT I SAID IS LIKE, PEOPLE ARE SO AFRAID TO FACE."
Interviewer,"What we're actually dealing WITH, WHETHER IT'S OPIOID ADDICTION, WHETHER IT'S SUICIDE,."
Kanye,Whether it's all these things. WE JUST WANT TO LIKE WE WANT TO PUT A PATINA ON IT AND NOT.
Interviewer,Face it. AND I THINK THE BREAK THROUGH FOR THAT ALBUM FOR ME I DON'T.
Kanye,"Do old versions of music, i'm LOOKING TO DO SOMETHING NEW. THE BREAKTHROUGH WAS TO BE ABLE."
Interviewer,"To have a song called i thought ABOUT KILLING YOU IN THIS LIKE SUPER-PC, HOLLYWOOD, YOU CAN'T."
Kanye,"Say nothing wrong day and age. IT'S LIKE, KANYE WEST'S FIRST SONG 80 THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING."
Interviewer,You and take you through the THOUGHTS. THE OTHER DAY I TWEETED HOW TO.
Kanye,Not kill yourself part 1. WHEN YOU'RE AN ARTIST AND YOU'RE CREATIVE AND YOU WANT TO GIVE SO.
Interviewer,Much to the world against all ODDS THERE'S TIMES WHEN YOU CAN GO INTO THAT PLACE..
Kanye,"Correct me if i'm WRONG, BUT THE HOW TO WAS, DON'T BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU."
Interviewer,"Want to kill yourself, right? YES. YEAH.."
Kanye,Good advice. THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE. I WAS INSPIRED AFTER SEEING THIS.
Interviewer,"Alexander mcqueen film. THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING ARTIST THAT KILLED HIMSELF.."
Kanye,He'd always talk about it. HE DESIGNED HIS OWN BASKET. I THOUGHT ABOUT A TOMBSTONE THAT.
Interviewer,"Said are you happy now? IT'S FUNNY BUT NOT FUNNY, REALLY, THOUGH.."
Kanye,"Yeah. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW  WHEN YOU HAVE THOUGHTS LIKE."
Interviewer,"That, you have to be careful and TALK TO PEOPLE. YEAH.."
Kanye,"But you have to be careful  WELL, NOT BE CAREFUL. JUST BE EXPRESSIVE AND."
Interviewer,Understand that all these people ARE SENSITIVE PEOPLE. LIKE YOU GET THESE CELEBRITIES.
Kanye,And they get a bad photo and EVERYONE JUST TEARS THEM ALL THE WAY TO SHREDS AND YOU FORGET.
Interviewer,"This is a daughter, a son, a MOM, A DAD. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK I FIGHT."
Kanye,"For i fight for all of us. YOU HAVE A LOT OF EMPATHY, I GUESS, IF THAT'S THE."
Interviewer,Way you're thinking. I DO. I DO HAVE A LOT OF EMPATHY..
Kanye,"Yeah, all right. >WE'RE BACK WITH KANYE WEST. THIS IS HIS ALBUM CALLED YE.."
Interviewer,"A beautiful photograph. YOU RECORDED THIS IN JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING.."
Kanye,"You put out five other albums WITH OTHER ARTISTS THAT YOU PRODUCED BASICALLY WITHIN LIKE,."
Interviewer,"What, a month-long period of TIME. THAT'S A TON OF WORK.."
Kanye,Are you like are you a WORKAHOLIC? ARE YOU ALWAYS WORKING?.
Interviewer,"No, i actually slept a lot DURING THE PROJECT. WHILE THEY WERE."
Kanye,"Recording? YEAH. I HAVE A TEAM, WE WORKED."
Interviewer,Together. I SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER I GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL..
Kanye,And i would go to amoeba record STORE AND START CHOPPING UP SAMPLES..
Interviewer,"It's very therapeutic because i WASN'T FULL YE I DON'T KNOW IF I'M FULL YE NOW, BETTER OR."
Kanye,Worse or whatever. BUT IT WAS THERAPEUTIC JUST TO LISTEN TO THOSE SONGS AND SAMPLE.
Interviewer,And go back to being 14 years OLD AT MY MOM'S HOUSE. AND BY THE TIME IT'S TIME TO.
Kanye,"Do to put the albums out, we HAVE A WHOLE TEAM AT YEEZY SOUND THAT WILL HELP COME AND DO THE."

Kanye,Right there. I FEEL LIKE YOU AVOIDED THIS ALBUM TITLE..
Interviewer,"Oh, yeah, i don't  I HATE BEING BIPOLAR, IT'S AWESOME.."
Kanye,"I have a theory about you, tell ME IF THIS IS CORRECT. I FEEL YOU FEEL BY BEING BIPOLAR."
Interviewer,"Is part what was makes you BRILLIANT, PART OF WHAT MAKES YOU YOU, AND YOU EMBRACE IT.."
Kanye,"Yeah, i think that's another ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIKE, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO."
Interviewer,"Talk about it? THE FUNNY THING IS, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE ON THE."
Kanye,Internet before. IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY. BUT IT'S NOT AN OPPOSITE..

Interviewer,All the way you know what i wanted to say though just with the humility that god brings.
Kanye,What he says is he says none of that matters right because i i went in from being snubbed by what.
Interviewer,Snub by magazine but i was recognized by god right where you know i would do sunday.

Interviewer,And to be able to still be sensitive enough to cry at the idea of aborting.
Kanye,My daughter and to really and people didn't understand that like they couldn't tap into it because.
Interviewer,They didn't see the the humanity and the love that you're trying to put it forward or you got to put on a front.
Kanye,Because you're cool like i had a friend to say it sound it seems like you're not enjoying it well what's the it.
Interviewer,Because north don't read forbes she just know if daddy is home or not right you know if i'm if i'm away for.
Kanye,Two weeks she's like dad i'm i miss you right it's like our family family is just the the key to the world.
Interviewer,Period from our immediate family to our friends and family our work.
Kanye,Our co-workers and family our city and family our state and family our country and family our world.
Interviewer,That if we just like everywhere you go people say hola hello right niha ma right right i used.
Kanye,To speak chinese school out there right so um it's our culture to say hi see our.
Interviewer,Culture the culture of humanity uh needs to be family a culture of.
Kanye,Family but the design of our cities the design of our schools there's a lot of things designed for us.
Interviewer,To not pr that are designed to not promote family they're designed to create.
Kanye,Uh separation right and in that separation there's uh there's cap there's capital.
Interviewer,Opportunity there's someone's lonely has to go to the bar someone misses their friends has.
Kanye,To go to the the club has someone um and so i really get into the study of.
Interviewer,Like the kibbutz designs right and uh primitive cultures when i'm designing cities it's like i've been really.
Kanye,Going here we checked i see it when we pulled up out there just that the whole vibe of the infrastructure the.
Interviewer,Houses you're building and i'm the guinea pig i'm guinea pig on myself i gotta say.
Kanye,I've lived in every form of home i've lived in china for a year i was designing my.
Interviewer,First two collections that we showed in paris my high fashion collections i was living in.
Kanye,London like right where they were having the riots in london our design studio was was right there i.
Interviewer,Obviously was born in atlanta grew up in chicago lived in new york and lived in.
Kanye,California and now i live in wyoming um it's you know when i came to wyoming one of.
Interviewer,My favorite visuals was seeing a family of three deer right in front of a cabin.
Kanye,That just it felt like it's god right and man and just a simplicity and here it's you know the church is.
Interviewer,Within walking distance some it's one school that i that i had made a donation to with the.
Kanye,The school is inside the church wow i remember when i was growing up there would be times where the school was.
Interviewer,Actually inside of the church when you remove the fear of god the fear and love of god.
Kanye,You create room for the fear and love of everything else right now i'm really into wording things.
Interviewer,In a positive affirmation i i would like to get to a point we shall get to a point where see i said we.
Kanye,Because i intentionally didn't want to say i so we shall get to a point where we can.
Interviewer,Communicate as simple as yoda there's so many words and people get caught up in the.
Kanye,Words and we're having fights over words words but in the future we're going to be having wars.
Interviewer,Over water actual essential let let us pray right that the kids at mit and.
Kanye,The ecologists can figure it out we could figure out so we don't get to that point but just.
Interviewer,You know you start to learn what the essentials are like it's why you could just see a picture.
Kanye,Because like i i've like bought mick mansions and redid them.
Interviewer,And and try to have uh add taste uh still fitting into some kind of a mold.
Kanye,Yeah something some construct keeping up with the joneses yeah somebody else's house is right there so.
Interviewer,My i got to make sure mine is flying in theirs yeah one of the things where i.
Kanye,Disappointed myself is when we went to architectural digest when we put the i've been reading.
Interviewer,Architectural digest since i was 18 years old so it was always a dream of mine to be an architectural.
Kanye,Digest but i always promised myself i wouldn't start buying like million multi-million dollar piece of.
Interviewer,Art sure enough by the time we get there i got this anish kapoor it's this million dollar.
Kanye,Piece of art that acts of a voice so many live  yeah and i'm just but nah it's like why.
Interviewer,You got a million dollar piece of art when there's like homeless people in front of the gucci.
Kanye,Store and it's like i start to you know to get pulled into that and.
Interviewer,This is the reason why um you know creating clothes at the gap where.
Kanye,Everything is affordable yeah under a hundred dollars like old navy prices.
Interviewer,But then having the apple of design the highest we got designers that worked at louie we.
Kanye,Got designers that worked at uh celine so when i was really going on the waterproof bags.

Kanye,Everything we would be in the airport and we saw the shoe by nike called the roche.

Kanye,See the uh the roche anymore so now when i'm talking about bags.

Kanye,I remember how the louis duffel made me feel when i would go to atlanta to work with jermaine dupree.
Interviewer,Yeah and it'd be somebody with like a throwback jersey a rolex a louis duffel yeah.

Interviewer,I definitely should be able to wear jordans man you can't jordans need to be part of reparations you can't tell a.
Kanye,Black man not to wear drawers that's part that's just in our dna any deal.
Interviewer,But you can wear jordans and also you could wear your friend's clothes yeah also that was a.
Kanye,All of this kind of divide and conquer thing mine is better than yours yeah that's why i had to like there was.

Kanye,Is a talented guy and you know he he was coming out uh had something to say about virgil's last.
Interviewer,Show and what happens is a lot of times like i don't know if it's called jim crow but.
Kanye,In the media with black people we're always on our own we can get to a place of success.
Interviewer,And we'll tear ourselves down virgil you spend fifty dollars on man if y'all shut up leave virgil alone.
Kanye,But all of us yeah you me virgil anybody in that position it's always about how we gonna tear each other down so i i.

Kanye,100 million for neighbors if you want right i ain't finna spend 100 million for neighbors.
Interviewer,Right in fact i need no neighbors right there's definitely no i'm dropping here.
Kanye,If i'm dropping that i need i need to have absolutely look so the idea.
Interviewer,Of life there's a there's there's there's some harsh facts that deal with.
Kanye,Um uh the black uh genocide that is abortion and it's happening every day and.
Interviewer,Right now god has given me the information and he ain't gave me no other information other than this.
Kanye,Information and we have this right now so that means he wants me to say this now.
Interviewer,If god didn't want me to run on stage and say beyonce had the best video he would have sat me in the front row.
Kanye,I would have been sitting in the back they would have made it the first award and would have made it so ridiculous of.
Interviewer,An idea because i had never heard of this person before and this single ladies is like one of.
Kanye,The greatest videos of all time so you spoke your mind you spoke your truth i spoke and i i was only drinking.
Interviewer,Hennessy i was about to say you had a bottle of hints because i didn't want to go to the award show because it was a.
Kanye,Setup right now okay so let us get to let's get to life.
Interviewer,Um in 50 years there's 20 there's been 22 million over 22 million 500 000.
Kanye,Black people aborted strategically and on purpose planned parenthood was set up and placed.
Interviewer,In minority communities to kill black people you're talking about.
Kanye,When margaret sanger the originator of planned parenthood at the time because a lot of people when when you.
Interviewer,Say things like that to in their defense they say well planned parenthood today is a different organization but but.
Kanye,Here we go margaret sanger the founder of planned parenthood was an avowed racist whose goal was to.
Interviewer,Reduce the black population in america and she succeeded 80 percent of abortion clinics.
Kanye,In america are in minority neighborhoods over 22 million 500 000 black babies have been aborted.
Interviewer,In 50 years over 1 000 black babies are aborted every day so that means we are.
Kanye,Inside of it as we speak this is genocide so wait we are inside of genocide what about the people.
Interviewer,That are gonna argue and say but you know kanye doesn't have the right to speak on that.
Kanye,Uh because he's not a woman uh the fact that planned parenthood does a lot of amazing.
Interviewer,Things and they're in those communities because they need to be in those communities i have.
Kanye,To go to the word god says he knew you before you were in the womb.
Interviewer,Yup jeremiah 1 5. yeah so i got a one one other statistic abortion is the number one killer of black.
Kanye,Lives in the united states according to the centers for disease control and prevention abortion kills more black.
Interviewer,People than hiv homicide diabetes accidents.
Kanye,Cancer and heart disease watch this one combined yeah combined 3 000 shootings in chicago a year 700 murders.
Interviewer,You got to put that with heart disease you got to put that with hiv you got to put that with diabetes you got to put.
Kanye,That with just accidents and you put that with cancer and it doesn't add up to.
Interviewer,Specifically abortions and if you think about that number 1 000 black babies.
Kanye,Are aborted each day and it's funny because i've sent this to people and people there's some people that say.
Interviewer,Wow that touches me that some people say i feel that and there's an overwhelming amount of.
Kanye,People that i sent it to and their response was thank you for sending that with no.
Interviewer,Emotion with no emotion thank you for sending thank you for why would why would you.
Kanye,Thank anyone for sending you that i didn't even want to have to say.
Interviewer,The information out loud i i but god said yay i need to use you i'm i'm one of the i'm one of the bull.
Kanye,Horns he just been prepping me and he he's been protecting me yeah we've been talking about this.
Interviewer,For years i mean you and i put can i live together my you know and uh.
Kanye,Probably my best record you know co-produced by kanye west uh well most people's records that are.
Interviewer,Co-produced because usually are they that's right no but but we we we joke but in some.
Kanye,This is something that's been you know close to us because we both grew up with single mothers who probably who were.
Interviewer,Putting that i had a non-custodial father that's my dad was very if and also what i want to say is.
Kanye,I love i love my mom my mom and my dad had an agreement that i would see.
Interviewer,My dad every other week see my mom every other week she took a job in chicago because it.
Kanye,Paid more and then i would only see my dad in on spring break and in the summertime.
Interviewer,So same a white organization offered this black woman more money and i saw my dad less.
Kanye,Wow and that i mean and see this is where i see the passion like i said we've both been put into situations to.
Interviewer,Where you know our mothers were young they had us so we we feel a certain way my mom.
Kanye,Was on the way to the abortion clinic you you know yeah our fathers.
Interviewer,Had very similar situations about you know not necessarily being ready or wanting a child in that.
Kanye,Moment but we're here because of that is this the reason why you know is this what you're utilizing your platform now.
Interviewer,Because with the whole presidency thing because that that's the other thing like because people ask me like.
Kanye,You yay's vice president now and what are like like where is the message and is does can you.
Interviewer,Do all of this without the presidency or is this really important for.
Kanye,Kanye 2020 well it hit me to uh to run for president.
Interviewer,Uh in 2015. right we saw that yeah it was about three days before the award show.
Kanye,I was there i was like and and it hit me and it was it was funny to me uh when i said i was like this is it i'm.
Interviewer,Gonna say this and then also when i came up with the name of my party the birthday party.
Kanye,It was funny to me just crazy it was jay-z i was like crazy that's it jesus at the same time.
Interviewer,And you know what made it so i can only give god the glory because of the connection point to the.
Kanye,Birthday the connection point to the birthday party is dealing with life and pro-life.
Interviewer,Because these are kids that now are going to get a chance to have birthdays like for a date for daily mail who want.
Kanye,To tear me down for it all for anyone who wants to tear me down for crying you realize that because of.
Interviewer,South carolina there are people who have decided to have the child.
Kanye,Because they connected and if they were on the fence about it they they never saw anyone in my.
Interviewer,Position take that position and say look at this this is a seven-year-old.
Kanye,Right here and she she might have never made it here and so when i talked to my father.
Interviewer,My father made me apologize to him for bringing this up publicly i've had that conversation with.
Kanye,My father as well he also said you know the abortion culture teaches.
Interviewer,People that a child isn't a real soul and it was my wife that said this is a soul.
Kanye,And the scariest thing is she had the pills you know you take these pills you take them and the next.
Interviewer,Morning the baby's going she had the pills in her hand.
Kanye,And a lot of times people say well this is they want to jump to the most radical reason of.
Interviewer,Why someone would not have a child i said now you know why i said i have a child because i'm still.
Kanye,So mindful as a man about using the word abortion that's how shook we are about using the.
Interviewer,Word abortion that they say as men we should not be able us two men sitting.
Kanye,Here we should not be having a full conversation about abortion well that's a.
Interviewer,That's a strategy to take the male opinion out of any conversation just taking taking the.
Kanye,Leaders and the males out of neighborhoods in the 80s it's like you take.
Interviewer,That opinion because you need both opinions right you need the male and the female opinion and also it's.
Kanye,Both people's child now i can get into you know the funny thing is i.
Interviewer,I posted a picture because i read that in new york uh i heard that they could go.
Kanye,You can abort after nine months but i saw on google they said 24 weeks and i showed a picture on my twitter.
Interviewer,Of a 24 week year old uh fetus would that be the term um and.
Kanye,I got backlash how you gonna put up that abortion tweet and you know it is i was trying to.
Interviewer,Appeal to humanity but we could see in this world by the reaction that people had to me crying.
Kanye,That there is no humanity you could see the state of the world it's a lot of people.
Interviewer,No pain yeah like that's a lot of people so they focus on their pain and like they want to.
Kanye,They want to polarize they want to say this is where you wrong you can't do this you can't do that or.
Interviewer,Ridicule or make fun of it so now since there is no humanity then there has to just be god and man and.
Kanye,You can't serve two masters so who are you working for right and that that's that's the question for the ages.
Interviewer,So the fact that you know you you have such an influence such an amazing power you've.
Kanye,You've proven people wrong time and time again so people take you very seriously when you.
Interviewer,Say these things so when you speak on topics that are polarizing like abortion when.
Kanye,You speak on topics even like the the man's place the black man's place in society when you speak on.
Interviewer,Uh the efforts of being able to say what you want to say um does that ever because i know you're.
Kanye,A man of instinct but does that the backlash that you do receive do you ever get.
Interviewer,Concerned about that because i i don't and i didn't but now when i hurt people with my words i.
Kanye,Didn't mean to do that and that's where i was like all right this is a different energy for me.
Interviewer,Because i used to be like you know how we vibe like say what the hell i want to say but when.
Kanye,People are in pain and then you see people come to conflict because of what you said.
Interviewer,That can't be what you want bro we be having to act like housekeepers in america the most.
Kanye,Influential strongest black voices have to act like housekeepers and what i mean by.
Interviewer,That is and i love housekeepers right the but a housekeeper if one housekeeper speaks up.
Kanye,They're gonna say shut up you're gonna get us all fired that's our position we were brought over.
Interviewer,Here in servitude to this country so as soon as we start to make any moves.
Kanye,If it's not the way that we were told the way that we were bought the way we then then you crazy.
Interviewer,Bro i got snubbed off the forbes list for two years that they said i wasn't a billionaire.
Kanye,How do you jump from a net worth for 240 million to 3.3 billion right unless you've been snubbed and it.
Interviewer,Felt like we're not going to allow people to know that someone that didn't follow.
Kanye,Our rules could actually make it right then god gave increase right you know.
Interviewer,And when i had sunday service when i went to the hospital the first time one of the things i wrote down was.
Kanye,Start a church in calabasas and we sang jesus name to the hills in the center of the city of lost.
Interviewer,Angels well actually in a suburb of the city but that just didn't sound as fresh but.
Kanye,But i i stood in the gap you know we say that we said we stayed and said we standing in the gap and god.
Interviewer,Said i got something for you i'ma have you standing in the gap for for real for real for real.
Kanye,And the funny thing is you know and it's full circle for you yeah yes 27 years right 27 years.
Interviewer,Since i got fired uh at the gap honey let me not even put that out yeah .
Kanye,So you've had those conversations too i see you don't mess this up the shareholders.
Interviewer,Are they they're betting on you so so god had me.
Kanye,Stand in the gap and just much much like david now even if you non-christian you know the story of.
Interviewer,David and goliath but just to get uh and and i'm a new christian you know i'm just a year recent convert.
Kanye,Uh grew up in the church but i'm a recent convert so god had david tend to the sheep.
Interviewer,And when goliath came to town no one had known that david had to fight a lion had to fight a bear and he said i just.
Kanye,Need these three smooth stones because we know everybody knows the story yeah yeah yeah so one of the interesting.
Interviewer,Things is sunday service i actually had to design wardrobe all the time and i spent every dime that.
Kanye,I had for marketing from from yeezy on sunday service wow every dollar i had i spent 50 million.
Interviewer,Dollars last year wow on sunday service if you add up the operas.
Kanye,If you add up the flights if you it was 120 people going to jamaica but the yeast all out of your pocket.
Interviewer,Well to spread the gospel yes you know it's it with the um uh the yeezys they they were selling.
Kanye,Themselves so instead of paying for ads i i invested it in the church i invested in.
Interviewer,Spreading gospel investments like ties to me i invested in saying jesus name.
Kanye,On high yeah and then when people talk about increase bro.
Interviewer,Look how we just hit that bro at the same time that's the zone that's the zone because even a lot of.
Kanye,Interviews you go especially like in a hollywood and a la uh situation um the whole setup of being.
Interviewer,Set up the whole setup is a setup they trying to get something out you they trying to get a sound bite they trying.
Kanye,To say something opposed to being on a vibe somebody stand up you got to tell them shut up.
Interviewer,The whole setup is a setup hey boy get up let up we fed up i'm going head up i'm not.
Kanye,Going to join him this bars he's going crazy right there he's going yay yeah.
Interviewer,But they have it where they'll have a person that's just there just to antagonize.
Kanye,Black people right and we're used to us getting ripped apart so what i'm saying is.
Interviewer,Like we say walter van buren dunker anybody even like black designers i know for me like.
Kanye,Like everybody been jealous of um everybody that's designed a lot of people that have designed this a lot of.
Interviewer,People have been jealous of virgil because he got that spot that's the number one spot.
Kanye,So everybody can be frustrated you know but when i spoke out on twitter that was not.
Interviewer,Christ-like you know that's why i had to go to my wife and say.
Kanye,Um you know i didn't cover you the way the way that i i should have and i even said something because we were.
Interviewer,Listening to a christian a playlist and it was all these like new edition songs stuff i was like.
Kanye,Well she is good at black playlists but you say that and we have a good time man we.
Interviewer,Laugh and stuff but on on quite often we share share scripture and words of inspiration.
Kanye,With each other and one thing that sits on me one time is like i love proverbs and like proverbs 2.
Interviewer,2 says turn your ear to wisdom in your heart to understanding and i feel like that's what.
Kanye,I don't know i tell myself that daily and i feel like i've shared that one with you and and we talk you know cause.
Interviewer,I always say utilize your voice be the leader that you are you've proven people so.
Kanye,Proven people wrong so many times so that they don't understand you so when we seek our.
Interviewer,Own understanding through through the word uh it has to like we connecting in a different way but.
Kanye,Other people ain't going to understand it they've caught they they've called both.
Interviewer,Of us coons they've called us crazy they call these all of these names but when you see like.
Kanye,Two brothers having a friendly conversation i feel like anybody can tap in and.
Interviewer,Understand that yo this is a man who who loves his family it's a man who has passion for.
Kanye,For art for for create creative ideas anything in a creative space but why do you think that you you're so.
Interviewer,Misunderstood when trying to seek your own understanding i just think i say what i feel and i.
Kanye,Keep it real in a phony situation so that looks wrong truth to power that's what that is yeah.
Interviewer,That just looks wrong to people you know like uh let's take when i met with jared kushner.
Kanye,Yeah let's talk about that in colorado yeah cause they said there was a secret meeting that you guys set up in that.
Interviewer,Yeah and ain't no secret he's using you as a puppet that's what they're saying yeah so the thing is.
Kanye,I'm not one of these i'm black so i'm democrat 95 95 of black people.
Interviewer,Are democrat yeah i wanted to meet with bernie sanders before he wouldn't meet with me.
Kanye,Now i'm fine to meet with biden i mean he probably with me with biting right now i would be with anybody.
Interviewer,I love everybody jesus loves everybody i love kamala harris that's a personal friend hu howard you know but uh but i.
Kanye,Understand like these this politics is and you you just want to talk to people who.
Interviewer,Share your passion yeah well you know i met with jared that's a that's a friend of mine i.
Kanye,Knew them before they was in the white house right trump used to go to award shows of.
Interviewer,Puff daddy that is true we all used to put trump in our raps people i was that was.
Kanye,That was the american dream to ball out like trump i always remember who someone has been to.
Interviewer,Me um you see i'm saying like that's why when i had an opportunity.
Kanye,To do nasa's album this person made ill-matic in fact people was bugged out because it was.
Interviewer,Like you could you even gave him a better album than you gave yourself it's like this man nas is like one of my.
Kanye,Heroes right he was one of my father figures right nas.
Interviewer,Was one of he was my he was my brother he was he was a uh uh he was my my stylist from a distance.
Kanye,What fresh cut what what would nas wear how would nasa cut his hair yeah you know uh and so.
Interviewer,When i had an opportunity to make music for him i'm gonna give everything i got my.
Kanye,Grandfather used to say if you're a janitor be the best janitor that you can be.
Interviewer,And what i like about producing is producing has always been a service position to say let me find.
Kanye,Something that's going to be in service to you so let me talk about the jared thing i always feel like.
Interviewer,I keep getting pulled over in my fancy car like when i was 19 i got pulled over for driving a white.
Kanye,Expedition i had braids peli jacket and when my mom uh came to bail me out um i saw on the police report it.
Interviewer,Said cream ford explorer uh that was crossed out and it said white.
Kanye,Expedition so i wasn't even the one they looked they just got close enough yeah and they they.
Interviewer,Threw me in jail okay i meet with jared kushner and everybody want to ask me questions.
Kanye,This is my this is my expedition i'm driving i ain't got to tell you i don't care if we.
Interviewer,Got ice cream i can meet with whoever i want you know why because i'm free.
Kanye,Right and so many black people so many people are just not free right i have the.
Interviewer,Freedom to vote for who i want i have the freedom to.
Kanye,Meet with whoever i want like for me it's like i got friends just like well because of the riots i i know a bunch of.
Interviewer,People that's like oh we like trump now and then after the riots it was like we hate trump.
Kanye,We just got to do everything we get them out i mean it's the protests and all that that's appropriate.
Interviewer,But let me tell you something people keep on saying i think that y'all you and republicans.
Kanye,Are in cahoots and cahoots they saying that they paying you to.
Interviewer,To do what you're doing to be a distraction bro can't nobody pay me you got more money i got more.
Kanye,Money than trump so you doing this praises through god yeah so what is the purpose of meeting.
Interviewer,With jared kushner what is the purpose of you know by the way i don't need no purpose now the thing is.
Kanye,I have a reason that people would like like that man came out with a printed copy because he.
Interviewer,Couldn't get the paperback version of dr claude anderson's book.
Kanye,The power nominee for paranomics and he said so wait jared kushner had power in omics.
Interviewer,Jared kushner talking about black empower comics and had notes red lined underlined.
Kanye,Quoting lines awesome so anybody who's not familiar with claude anderson this is a dude who's been.
Interviewer,Started in education and just been building for the wealth of black people and the empowerment of.
Kanye,Black people closing the wealth gap for so long he's one of the things from power nomics that i.
Interviewer,Always relate to is when he talks about blacks are the only people in the united states that don't have.
Kanye,Communities they're like we occupy residential areas you know what i mean but everyone else.
Interviewer,Has their own community and this is the plan right here.
Kanye,Claude anderson has a four-year plan to rebuilding the black community right that is what we talked about.
Interviewer,That's what you and jared talked about yeah but i don't care if i talked and you got some ice cream.
Kanye,I could get ice cream that's what i'm saying i don't have to justify right none of my actions.
Interviewer,Period yeah you're because you're free you're free i'm not no housekeeper right what what what has biting done for.
Kanye,Me that's so special what has he done for me.
Interviewer,That's so special to make me vote for this man and i don't care about likability right so then.
Kanye,And this is you're speaking i'll be frustrated because let me tell you who the most racist.
Interviewer,The liberal racist when a white person could tell me you gonna split the vote better not step past the line boy right.
Kanye,So now but let me tell you here's the one here's the one deep yeah here's the one so this is what this is.
Interviewer,Where i go to a place and that's why i even i i brought up this book by the the great.
Kanye,Dick gregory god russ is so uh he's our ancestor now but in 1968 one of the most pivotal.
Interviewer,Years like 2020 he ran for president i wouldn't mind the first four years of me.
Kanye,That's what so he that's what dick gregory said and he said to be forced to select between.
Interviewer,A two dominant uh party choice is to have no real choice at all and it's almost that goes back to like.
Kanye,What w.b du bois says there's no such thing as two parties there's just one evil party with two names.
Interviewer,So you are stepping out as pretty much what the declaration of independence says is when you see.
Kanye,A flawed government you gonna speak to it for the people but people are saying you're a.
Interviewer,Distraction and because they don't want four more years of trump maybe you might i don't i i don't but.
Kanye,But you want an alternative of four years of yay is that realistic right now in 2020.
Interviewer,Well god has made unreal things happen i'm here for you many times is it realistic for me to be here.
Kanye,Nah you know you done you didn't cheated death several times you didn't accomplish what most people said you.
Interviewer,Would never accomplish you certified yourself as a multi-genius and a multi-billionaire.
Kanye,We just came up with multi geniuses but no because i had people keep on telling me.
Interviewer,Man it's just rude to call yourself a genius okay how about a multi genius.
Kanye,And that's something people don't understand yay's sense of humor so he like this all the time and they.
Interviewer,Will say oh well there he go acting crazy again and saying crazy things when really.
Kanye,You have a different perspective and you come from it from a place where you're not really trying to this.
Interviewer,That's what i'm going to say like when people all right so look at this right so this i was.
Kanye,Wearing it walking through the domes and the ranch all right but i could wash these off and it'd be.
Interviewer,Brand new yeah box fresh now i i saw people talking after the i just saw black people on tv like.
Kanye,Ridiculing me and dissing me for crying on tv and i you know the whole thing about the harriet tubman.
Interviewer,Thing is we we don't need to tear our statues down.
Kanye,To build new ones because we don't got enough statues that's what it is but the only icon is jesus but what i.
Interviewer,Want to say is those people that's ridiculing me bro yin design this.
Kanye,Come on man so they can't but okay so if they if they ain't make dark fantasy no no dark fantasy.
Interviewer,And watch the throne right and cruel summer talk your talk and good fridays and late registration.
Kanye,I'm just talking about just 12 months i'm just talking about 12 months oh you're right you're right i'm.
Interviewer,Talking about 12 month period yeah i had a friend man i ain't going to go we could edit this out but i was saying.
Kanye,That and he was like man cruel summer's trash i said boy you ever made something like mercy.
Interviewer,Mm-hmm like but that's okay so what about all those people who are saying cause granted all of those are genius.
Kanye,Moves but what about the people are saying you are out of touch so.
Interviewer,That you can't that's the dream come true but as a leader as someone who's.
Kanye,Supposed to be guiding people and running for president they want somebody they can relate to so exactly.
Interviewer,So am i out of touch when i break down at the drop of a dime or the thought of aborting my daughter.
Kanye,But some people can say that's instability some people though oh look yay needs.
Interviewer,Needs help because i would say that the world is what's unstable america is what's.
Kanye,Unstable it would be 100 accurate 22 million 500 000 black people have been executed through.
Interviewer,Abortion culture every so many things that are for the culture do it for the i do this.
Kanye,For christ boy this ain't for the culture this is for jesus christ so what about people saying.
Interviewer,You're a little too religious especially to be running for office uh that's that's what we need.
Kanye,And that's who i am and i always been who i am and it's worked out thus far right and.
Interviewer,I shall be president at some point in our lifetime so maybe not 2020 so what about j 2024.
Kanye,Because now because kamala in there i know you don't like biting but you know that to see a woman.
Interviewer,Operating a black woman from oakland went to hbcu to be in the white house you got to.
Kanye,Want to support that you got to want to see that that's a good thing for the culture and.
Interviewer,You can follow up 2024. is it a good thing for christ what's your position i i don't know.
Kanye,That's a great because when you're a democrat you're not allowed to talk about christ.
Interviewer,Republicans are allowed to talk about christ democrats not allowed to talk about martin luther king was a.
Kanye,Republican right blacks used to be the republicans back then absolutely.
Interviewer,Blacks used to be and if you're a christian you're most of your values going align with.
Kanye,Republicans more now you're such an out-of-the-box type of person and you talk you got your.
Interviewer,Own party now the birthday party why why does this is our party this is not just my party our party.
Kanye,This is our party the birthday party and and and it's funny because it reminds me of one time we was on.
Interviewer,And this is when i got kanye we were young we were one of the recording academy packs both trying to get.
Kanye,Get our grammy grind on and it was a bunch of kids and he was like yo people always treated me.
Interviewer,All my life you know like tell me to be quiet and all that stuff and he was like no.
Kanye,I live my life like it's my birthday it's like you ever go to like chuck e cheese or show biz or whatever.
Interviewer,And they'd be like yo you making too much noise over there he's like i'm supposed to make this look it's my.
Kanye,Birthday and i was like i understand him now like he lit.
Interviewer,You've cheated death you've done something to you you've been that quiet kid in the back so.
Kanye,If i was never married to death how can i cheat we've people don't even know you have.
Interviewer,More than one car accident and things of that nature of like you we've seen you beat the odds many times.
Kanye,In so many ways and so that's why you're so outspoken when i said i was gonna run.
Interviewer,For office and people asked hillary clinton before she ran and they said what do you think.
Kanye,About kanye running for office her response was i wouldn't want to run against him.
Interviewer,Who would and when i said so they're scared of you mainly is what this is yeah because the funny thing is even.
Kanye,Though blacks due to abortion not due to kanye west.
Interviewer,Due to abortion are only we are only thirteen percent of the entire population the entire in.
Kanye,America yeah of the vote you know that 13 can make a difference if you ask lewis.
Interviewer,Hamilton that small percent could be the difference in especially when we have the influence.
Kanye,The influence that you have and do you see that as a responsibility because you're speaking on some heavy topics.
Interviewer,From abortion from economics to these things now you know even more so with children.
Kanye,When people hear you speak they want they want you to to speak in a direction that one.
Interviewer,Gets rid of the oppression that this administration has put upon our community.
Kanye,People live in a sound bite community a sound bite culture where you think one line is going to change everything.
Interviewer,Not no one like do you know how long me and jared sat there and went through.
Kanye,Uh point by point from claude anderson's book and the time i spent on the phone with claude.
Interviewer,Anderson's wife for the time i spent talking to charlemagne about this this is just the beginning of a journey when.
Kanye,We talk about sustainable you know they get all these the democrats are really good at using.
Interviewer,Or the left are really good at using social media to try to cancel people to try to bring them down to try to.
Kanye,Discredit i think it's four d's it's discredit dismiss yeah and i saw you you wrote you.
Interviewer,Wrote to me about that you know the i i feel like i made a steal like i can't even be you.
Kanye,Can't be canceled like i can't be cancer but also like i couldn't be hurt.
Interviewer,I felt like i couldn't be hurt anymore right until you know we we spoke about the.
Kanye,Idea of aborting my daughter and then that's when you got vulnerable like that that's when i was like i had.
Interviewer,To i had to i had to feel that because i feel that people might say i'm out of touch because i'm.
Kanye,Not letting the smoke screen stop my decisions to move forward think about the way the slaves was.
Interviewer,Always controlled it was so many more slaves than the slave master but we were we were brainwashed and we.
Kanye,Still are right and that's in the past statements when you've made statements whether it's.
Interviewer,About harriet tubman or even slavery being a choice that's what you were.
Kanye,Pretty much touching on is like we were brainwashed and we were controlled by the system like carter g woodson says.
Interviewer,Uh once you control a man's mind you don't have to worry about his actions and that's the thing they're not.
Kanye,Controlling my mind so they're worried about my actions and uh and i'm these are not reactions.
Interviewer,God is using me and god covers me and won't nothing happen until he's done with me right.
Kanye,I mean that's evident the fruits of your labor are evident look the um what about the people who say the.
Interviewer,Devil is because the earth is you know the devil's domain and his dominion and all.
Kanye,Of that stuff and he said just like the devil tempted jesus and said you can have all i can.
Interviewer,Give you all of these things in the earth do you see like is because i've seen.
Kanye,That as well as like oh that's the devil that's the devil especially some of them super duper.
Interviewer,Church going type of christians they want to go oh that's not chris they they hate on sunday service they say.
Kanye,Oh no that's the devil that's the world that's secular playing and and and being.
Interviewer,A facade for what christ really is i mean a lot of people got opinions on how to represent christ and some people.
Kanye,They argue about the image of christ because you have an abundance you know what i mean like.
Interviewer,I always said come so you got life and have it abundantly but jesus was me at the same time people were saying oh.
Kanye,God told you this god told you god that how god told you god told you but through me god showed you.
Interviewer,Come on bars god told you before me god showed you hey.
Kanye,What are we talking about and by the way it it even if i had to go through what job.
Interviewer,Went through where everything goes away you know what i'm saying when i when i because and the.
Kanye,Reason why that joe went through that is because he feared all of those things you don't.
Interviewer,Have no fear man i see mandela's prison cell and i'm like.
Kanye,All right we would ever we would whatever we're not afraid of death 27 strong ones.
Interviewer,And for his people yeah we're not afraid of prison we're not afraid of death.
Kanye,We're just not afraid we ain't going that's period now let me explain something about with.
Interviewer,Me i'm a freedom fighter so my comment to harriet tupman or of her was yeah we got clean more.
Kanye,We got to be reminded of how white people did us dirty yeah or how we were slaves or even go to african american.
Interviewer,History museum they don't start off with the african drums it starts off with the slave boats.
Kanye,Because i mean it depends what door you going it could be.
Interviewer,It could be more motivational but they don't they don't they they don't want us to get.
Kanye,I say this all the time you're not wrong when they say well our our culture is much more than slavery and that's when.
Interviewer,We want to talk about you know if we have black history month we need to have black future month.
Kanye,Just like just like that uh you know i make black history every day i don't need them on i would.
Interviewer,We was there when yeah i think you gave me that bar i gave him that seat i told y'all.
Kanye,I told y'all i gave him the bar but in that sense you you've always exemplified that and it goes back to.
Interviewer,Like you know the richest man that ever lived this is this is who if you ever did a movie or.
Kanye,You had irritation you should uh be uh the sultan of mali mansa musa is to this day he his gifts threw off.
Interviewer,The economy in the 1300s just the richest man ever lived richard and jeremy.
Kanye,Was like in the trillions but he was an african in in the 1300s he was explorer all of this type of.
Interviewer,Stuff but they they don't teach us about those type of individuals because they want to start.
Kanye,With slavery because everything looks better from slavery if you start that flavor.
Interviewer,Everything's going to look like that progress don't give you nothing and if you just get a little sip of water.
Kanye,Then you look like a horse with a sugar best water i ever had that's how they be happening so they so.
Interviewer,Why don't so that's the whole thing like they don't they show us that we're more than.
Kanye,Slaves see when people say oh the republicans paying kanye.
Interviewer,That's like you acting like they got more money than me you acted like i could be paid right bro.
Kanye,I saved 100 million in taxes this year right i saved 100 million in tax in taxes.
Interviewer,Right this ain't got numb to deal with one thing i know i know yay for a long time can't nobody tell him.
Kanye,To do anything he don't want to do can't nobody convince him with no money he can't nobody convince him.
Interviewer,It's he's gonna do what he wants to do and it seems that your passion was to show people how much you care.
Kanye,I never did it for the money but the funny thing is people call me crazy and they.
Interviewer,Discriminate against people with mental illness or mental mental health abilities.
Kanye,Right mental abilities because it's actually an ability it's a superpower tell me it's an.
Interviewer,Illness right because i'm seeing the truth inside of a phony world.
Kanye,And then people want to lock her up lock me up they want to lock me up for expressing myself do nothing.
Interviewer,But i don't even do anything but express myself and i'm gonna get hit with the.
Kanye,Needle and and throne you know what would happen if i got thrown in a crazy home.
Interviewer,It would drive me crazy that's normally what happens that's what it like and even the.
Kanye,Infrastructure of what big pharma is and how they you know even from young black boys they.
Interviewer,Always want to diagnose them with something whether they diagnosed me with adhd when i was a kid because they want.
Kanye,To get you hooked on drugs early they want to say that they want to give you put you in.
Interviewer,Special education when really you're just on a different frequency and you're on a different way.
Kanye,So let's talk about that the fact that people have called you crazy do you see that as irresponsible well i.
Interviewer,Just see that that's a new discrimination that people have to understand because there's even people.
Kanye,That are mindful of the word crazy like how post me too men were very cautious in the way we didn't.
Interviewer,We get you got you got to be careful with your compliments.
Kanye,And so now people are sensitive to it and so now whenever i express myself the only problem is.
Interviewer,People will be quick to be like oh he's going through something and then they try to discredit what i'm saying.
Kanye,And we talk about credit a lot of times credit deals with money well i've never cared about money and then people.
Interviewer,Started calling me crazy so then i said you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna go out and just make more.
Kanye,Money and y'all gonna stop calling me crazy because i get to a billion you can't.
Interviewer,Call me crazy yeah and then it was two years where i wasn't called a billionaire and then i came out.
Kanye,Three billion right they even forbes exposed themselves and showed like how i was talking to.
Interviewer,Say y'all can't count right i better count that up count that up again forbes and i really when when bloomberg was.
Kanye,Coming i just thought about nike and louis vuitton i said yeah i bet you i can get forbes and bloomberg.
Interviewer,To deliver the message at the same time like when nike and louis vuitton uh delivered and they did but i that's.
Kanye,Why i like love i love man forbes is some of my favorite white supremacists man they cold bro.
Interviewer,This is about this like my most favorite white supremacist is forbes uh is tell me why yeah because.
Kanye,Bro i just gotta like respect they gangster bro cause they they don't live in 2020 they act like.
Interviewer,It's 18 you know hunted still because they'll be like read the forps.
Kanye,It's crazy racist every time they write stuff and people and people would do articles.
Interviewer,But it'd be like so but now what they keep moving they still in business right so bloomberg was coming and they.
Kanye,Had an accurate net worth of 3.3 billion and forbes.
Interviewer,Purposely landed an article to dispute that and said well the way we counted it's 1.3.
Kanye,And they dropped it at um 505 or something right at the end of the week.
Interviewer,So that would go into to the weekend to the weekend right and that would be the story.
Kanye,That that it was confusion they could just cause confusion that's something the devil could do is like.
Interviewer,Call devil is the author they're confused they they authored confusion they offer and the funny thing is the.
Kanye,Guy will still text me and he'll be talking about his daughter i'd be like tell your daughter you got a cool dad.
Interviewer,And then he'll write an article it's like like you know the funny thing i i was.
Kanye,Going to curse because i'm like  you yay but i really realized just like when you when you say.
Interviewer,Curse what you really do run out of words so let me tell you so i'm thinking people calling me crazy so.
Kanye,I'm gonna show them i'm gonna even show my big bro i'm not crazy i'm gonna show jay-z.
Interviewer,I'm a you know i'm gonna show them that you know that my value that you could be.
Kanye,Diagnosed and people could point fingers at you and you could still be a citizen and you.
Interviewer,Can still have value he said don't let that stigma define who i am i didn't let the stigma define who i was so the funny.
Kanye,Thing is so i'm like boom it's gonna be you know they're gonna.
Interviewer,See that you know i i ate them i ate up all my vegetables i did the right thing and.
Kanye,I got up to 3.3 billion i have all my vegetables look guys i'm not crazy look guys i ate up all my vegetables i got.
Interviewer,Three point three and then it's like that guys i got five billion i have all my vegetables.
Kanye,And then i cried for my daughter and now he's crazy and they said he's crazy again so that.
Interviewer,That made me tell us like forget valuing money in that way because i thought that if i.
Kanye,Would become a billionaire that it could help me beat the stigma but it was because i it's funny because.
Interviewer,I got friends that soon as someone says oh yeah ain't take his meds or this that they could be.
Kanye,Like you ain't need to take your and they can send me and it's literally.
Interviewer,Wow like how people would treat black people 100 years ago wow people who are.
Kanye,Diagnosed can get treated like black people were treated now we're more subtle deep that's deep.
Interviewer,Like nah cause even when you say that because as someone who they've you know.
Kanye,Called me crazy and you know said i had mental health issues and someone who's actually.
Interviewer,Dealt with many people my family and that thing where that stigma that's placed on you.
Kanye,Can drive you to a place of depression or um and who who are they to say.
Interviewer,That you are crazy or who are they to say that you just having a moment and i guess because i feel like i.
Kanye,Know you and i you know i know the the frequencies we be on like it's not about.
Interviewer,Being defined and that's where it even goes back to the the politics like why do we have to.
Kanye,Classify or identify with what you deem to be normal and people all human beings have a.
Interviewer,Opportunity to go crazy without being defined as crazy right like when people.
Kanye,Go to a soccer game they go crazy they go crazy so you put me in certain environments my.
Interviewer,Family would come with me and be paparazzi follow us around and they say what'd they say i couldn't.
Kanye,Do this i go crazy like there's no human rights in the world i couldn't live your life.
Interviewer,That would drive me crazy drive me crazy right and so i saw the other side and come back and.
Kanye,Now it's like a superhero because i really can understand how to use this.
Interviewer,Heightened sensitivity because that's all it is to get more work done think about all.
Kanye,The people who have done great things in history think about einstein yeah was was noah crazy when he.
Interviewer,Was working on the the ark as he said don't listen to him no just keep building your art.
Kanye,Just keep just keep building the ark because by the way it's like even this i i the whole i i speak from the future.
Interviewer,To the future so even right now this is just documentation that might only make sense to some in.
Kanye,The future oh no it's going to be classic it's a classic one right and that.
Interviewer,Because what people always do every time something happens what people got to do go to my old interviews.
Kanye,Because my only my old interviews can apply to now the majority of the things that i'm.
Interviewer,Saying don't even apply to now yay talking to the future he's teaching us from the future.
Kanye,Absolutely if you're living in the president if you're living in the future then the.
Interviewer,Presence is your past my presence is the president kiss my ass bars but that's the thing man like and.
Kanye,And to relate back to the identity of you know because that's the thing everybody want to talk about is what's.
Interviewer,Going on with yay for 2020 is is you've cleared it up with the whole jared thing and that trump's not.
Kanye,Paying you and you're not the republicans aren't using you you're doing this.
Interviewer,Solely for the people can we talk about that next step the republicans and the democrats.
Kanye,They couldn't afford me bro so let's talk about where you put in the money yeah the children man like.
Interviewer,And and i really want you to touch on your your love and compassion like we we touched on the heavy.
Kanye,Subject of abortion but let's talk about the orphanage and the idea of what you want to do moving forward since we talk.
Interviewer,In the future and even while we're sitting here in wyoming or what you really want to do.
Kanye,For what i like about this whole thing is it can be just like how we do a verse.
Interviewer,Because it could be things we kind of hit a point like six seven times in an interview and.
Kanye,You said i might wanna hit that twice yeah yeah and it's other things you can hit it in so um.
Interviewer,We're building plan a and people could say how are you building planet well plan a is exactly what you think about.
Kanye,You know planned parenthood and plant plan b well this is plan a and it's exactly.
Interviewer,What you think that would be that would be given stipends that's creating an orphanage.
Kanye,So right now i'm donating my land to build an orphanage all of these acres that we're sitting on right now.
Interviewer,Yes wow so um and that's an openness for for kids from all over the world well it's just to.
Kanye,Look at orphanages you know we've difficulty yeah we look at them a different way.
Interviewer,Like when i made this foam runner or when i made jesus or mma 808s just to have an.
Kanye,Opportunity i'm a creative that's the way god uses me through my anointing is due.
Interviewer,Creating with these interviews they'd be funny to me though because i get to create in an interview yeah.
Kanye,You painting the picture yeah the interview i i don't know if i you know what people say he's not the.
Interviewer,Best communicator no y'all just don't want to hear what i'm communicating and it's too busy they'll be trying to.
Kanye,Cut you off and get to the point that's why i hear you have an open forum we chop it up like we.
Interviewer,Chop it up on the phone oh yeah and my new thing is just if someone asks me a question don't give away the.
Kanye,Secrets don't give it away then they gonna jump in there and try to.
Interviewer,Try exactly exactly not but man to be able to.
Kanye,I was like like you live i've watched you from from when your career started to where.
Interviewer,You are now and everything you put your mind to everything you said you were gonna do.
Kanye,You did you know what how everything i put my heart to.
Interviewer,Everything i put my gut to if my heart is in it it's gonna work if my mind if it was.
Kanye,Just my mind a lot of times people put their mind into delegation let me delegate this let me not.
Interviewer,Put my heart into that that's that time when you are in front of it it's funny it's like.
Kanye,With my children i have to be in front i have to be there i have to be present not just.
Interviewer,The dad that comes with the cool presents uh i have to be present not just the dad just comes with the cool.
Kanye,Presents um uh a dad or jesse and i have to speak up not just a dad with the cool presents.
Interviewer,Triple entendre for you all one time so because sometimes i've had to speak up i've had.
Kanye,I've had to raise my voice certain times on things that i stood for morally right and it's.
Interviewer,There was a there's a fight for our soul right you know like i struggle with pornography from six.
Kanye,Years old right um so if i see i remember i went to the.
Interviewer,Library and i and i started taking out all the books.
Kanye,That had um you know sexual imagery in it right it wasn't just specifically nudity.
Interviewer,It could be a swimsuit picture that was hype very hyper sexual right bro it was crazy it was.
Kanye,Like half of the library because we'll put like a big coffee table book because it's cool in it.
Interviewer,Right and it was like half you know naked woman on the front and then you open it.
Kanye,And it has naked and we're so used to that kind of culture that we don't realize that sex.
Interviewer,Is a drug right and when you orgasm what is it endorphins.
Kanye,Yeah you're releasing all of you and that endorphin is very similar to the feeling of heroin.
Interviewer,Which is which percocets are also a similar feeling to that so so don't mix it.
Kanye,Right don't have perks and sex and add something to drink you know it's like you don't know which way is up or.
Interviewer,Which way is down right um and that's why like these.
Kanye,Boxers they'll like sustain they'll sustain for six weeks before the fight that just.
Interviewer,To sustain and you know to focus to so they get locked in and they they.
Kanye,They take the that moment to come combat serious so they don't have any distractions yeah and and.
Interviewer,Even with me as a christian it's like i'm i'm a new christian and i and i backslide.
Kanye,And it's funny like the world new world thinking uses the world word karma you christian it's.
Interviewer,Uh you reap what you sow right but karma is new age right that's not the way we even.
Kanye,Uh that that's not the terminology for it and it's fine god snap pet he knows what.
Interviewer,We mean but i remember these times where i was under.
Kanye,High pressures and high tests from from god and it was like i was passing the test.
Interviewer,And i saw miracles happening just amazing things just kept on happening and i said.
Kanye,Well god i know you know the the the form of christianity we believe in we we don't believe in.
Interviewer,Acts so it's some of the acts and i know it's not it's not karma so god why are all these blessings and why all.
Kanye,These miracles happening and i had an explanation from a pastor that me and my friend chris julian had.
Interviewer,Picked up hitchhiking that we um then dropped off and uh gave him some money for something like a.
Kanye,Good samaritan but when when he was talking he was talking about how he backslides.
Interviewer,But what he said is like when when your lamp is clean when your faucet is clean that god can.
Kanye,Perform miracles yeah it's like you are getting in the way.
Interviewer,Of your own miracles don't be enough don't be in the way of your own miracles and every time that i pop off all that.
Kanye,Cocky stuff or we talking that money talk and all that i'm in the way of my own miracles that's.
Interviewer,Why i'd like for us to be able to um to create this in a way where people saw that point there was a point that.
Kanye,Was building up but we started having these sub points to it but the point was saying that how i.
Interviewer,Thought that money was going to validate me and then i got money as soon as i cried for my daughter people said you.
Kanye,Crazy and everyone felt like that was a way to down me and that to really understand.
Interviewer,That that my validation will not be from man and i'm happy that we're as we're.
Kanye,Here as brothers to be to be next to each other we brothers you know.
Interviewer,For real because we're going through a lot ridicule yeah a lot of the similar.
Kanye,Things and i'm happy to just be able to have a conversation because people will say.
Interviewer,Look at this this is the first time that i'm speaking in public since south carolina right and i'm doing.
Kanye,It here right here on your show yeah with another person who hasn't spoken.
Interviewer,Since my own controversy so yeah yeah and it's and to speak if you are a public.
Kanye,Figure speaking in public is therapeutic i use the crowd uh often i use the crowd as my audience that's your therapy right.
Interviewer,And also you use it to try out some ideas right he said let me try this let me see how the crowd responds to.
Kanye,This the reason why i know that i will eventually eventually could be.
Interviewer,Three months eventually could be three and a half years ago four years so um.
Kanye,The the reason why i eventually will make a great president is because.
Interviewer,I'm sensitive i'm here i'm i'm here to serve even as a gemini i feel the energy.
Kanye,In the room i read body language i read this energy and i and i hurt you know the thing is this.
Interviewer,You got that spirit of discernment yeah i i hurt for the country i heard for not just.
Kanye,Black people but i heard for all all people of america and i heard from all people of the world i heard for.
Interviewer,Everyone's children i heard for the situation i heard i heard for illegal.
Kanye,Aliens that that have put in their work for 20 years immigrants yeah it's like there's a.
Interviewer,Nation of immigrants that uh john f kennedy wrote like that's yeah that's what this country truly is.
Kanye,And for somebody that's that would be probably wrapping it up i would want to talk about.
Interviewer,The hurt that is going on in this country specifically and the pain that people are.
Kanye,Experiencing and i feel like that's why a lot of the frustration towards you where they.
Interviewer,Might call us out of touch or crazy or coons or whatever.
Kanye,Term it is when really it comes from a place where there's a lot of pain going on yeah.
Interviewer,Your music has healed so many your your words your you your outspokenness has healed so many.
Kanye,So if they're used to yay healing how in this moment does kanye hill we're building factories we're building.
Interviewer,Farms we're reinstating agriculture talk about the ecology for a minute because people.
Kanye,Like you said dr claude anderson he put us up on game he said right after the civil war during the.
Interviewer,Reconstruction time where some of the best times that's when america was great uh black people.
Kanye,Were over 55 of the farmers in this country and now they're less than one percent.
Interviewer,Like that agriculture is where the where the wealth truly was created for this country until.
Kanye,This day can continue to be that and now you even stepping into that world yes and for us.
Interviewer,Yeah and yeah and for us and us is you know what is beautiful about the black existence.
Kanye,In america it is it it sharpens you just to be a black person in america.
Interviewer,Like i i'm billions i remember spending uh three hours explaining what the white voice was.
Kanye,To my to my wife because for her it's just her voice you know it's just the voice just answer the.
Interviewer,Phone the same way hello but i had to explain that in order to get a job depending if you.
Kanye,Want a job downtown you had to act white and you could lose your job if you acted.
Interviewer,Black but the thing is yourself you that's the thing you're not acting if you act black you're actually being.
Kanye,Yourself so your existence just to be able to pay for your well-being you literally have to.
Interviewer,Act like a white person it's so funny when i go to like a wedding and it'll be a black.
Kanye,Pastor and they'll say he speaks so well he speaks so well that's that chris what what do you mean american.
Interviewer,Like i like did you think he was going to talk but yeah it's like how we supposed to speak.
Kanye,Perfect like i love incorrect english my mom is an english professor i heard her use the.
Interviewer,Word ain't i say don't use ain't mama she said no you could.
Kanye,Use colloquialism correct english is using the english that's appropriate to who you talking to.
Interviewer,This is from an english professor come on now so we are way simpler i play this dictionary.
Kanye,Game where we take a a pocket dictionary and all the people in the room we all get a.
Interviewer,Pocket dictionary we pick a page and you highlight the words that you feel are positive.
Kanye,And you read all the definitions now i want you to read the definition of help you think that help is a positive word.
Interviewer,Right yeah the fourth definition is to avoid because you think that help is a.
Kanye,Positive word but look at how many times where uh look at this even if you meet with a.
Interviewer,An exec in la they'll not give you the deal but they'll say.
Kanye,Well how can i help you help me to like i'm gonna give you somebody else number yeah help me understand.
Interviewer,Why oh yeah or how many times something didn't get fixed but a bunch of people helped yeah right.
Kanye,The word is to ensure and a lot of the words uh ure at the end have a.
Interviewer,A a confidence in it and it uh not it's not a word i don't say confidence they have an assurance in them yeah yeah.
Kanye,They have a future like oh i see what you're saying.
Interviewer,And and people can get to that like you can get into the it has affirmation in it negro negligent.
Kanye,You could do words that have the because the tower of babylon has caused so much confusion.
Interviewer,That's why i love you we're trying to get to god yes and then he said boom we're going to give you all your.
Kanye,Separation yeah so when the pope talks he got to talk in 27 different languages right.
Interviewer,The the this is why i love non-verbal communication and things where you just see it because.
Kanye,You can interpret it for whatever all this senator adams cause you asked me you know what are you.
Interviewer,Doing to heal well i understand words could be healing but i'm not a professional orator.
Kanye,I understand you know books can be healing but i'm not a professional book writer.
Interviewer,You're a professional creative you're a professor exactly i'm a producer but before i was.
Kanye,Producing things that were non-tangible music in a way you get the feeling but.
Interviewer,You can't grab it it's an invisible thing you can't eat music teach come on now you can.
Kanye,Dance for your dinner you could like music could you know it's set up thank you but it's.
Interviewer,A feeling it's a vibration it's a vibration it's a beautiful thing but i've stepped into a place of.
Kanye,Actually learning to build physical things yeah physical things building homes.
Interviewer,Building domes a friend of mine said are you building single family homes i said i'm building single family don't.
Kanye,Homes bars that's how big you were in the verse so um it's that's what i'm doing i'm.
Interviewer,Physically building things like the the thing about this shoe right here it was made in america.
Kanye,And my concept is not that my concept is just local manufacturing especially we post cover.
Interviewer,We decentralize so if you buy this shoe in china it will be made in china.
Kanye,If you buy the shoe in america it'll be made in america it's like the idea for manufacturing is the.
Interviewer,Uh the mcdonald's of manufacturing and this is something that we're in stating in.
Kanye,The gap like i love the movie the founder and i love the scene when they built.
Interviewer,The kitchen yeah that was my these are these moments i i watch the making of of movies more.
Kanye,Than the movies because i want to know how to make them right it's like when you were just.
Interviewer,Talking about hey man i'm an engineer you just kept on saying how was this made because everybody can.
Kanye,Have a sketch it's another thing to materialize it you know you can ask don c he like.
Interviewer,Travel and if you go to an italian uh factory they have a cup sole you put it there.
Kanye,The reason why we up to this point we've had to always collaborate with uh organizations.
Interviewer,Like nike and adidas because they're best of class at materializing this they knew the.
Kanye,Factories and the biggest fight that i had uh was to get my own factory now we have.
Interviewer,A factory in cody but this shoe is made in atlanta georgia but we have a factory in cody that can.
Kanye,Make these eva foam-injected shoes and bring jobs to america.
Interviewer,Truly bringing jobs to america and truly bringing jobs to the community yeah and and redesigning communities and.
Kanye,The thing is they don't give you that credit though yeah they want to they want to write you.
Interviewer,Off when you're actually doing so much work but but i'm predicting the future i'm.
Kanye,Not a i'm not actually talking about the what we're doing right now yeah but but in that in that vibe and as.
Interviewer,As we as we wrap up you know i mean like i said if you drop so many gems it's gonna be an.
Kanye,Outstanding canons class but to to clarify and to clear up some things just based off of.
Interviewer,You running for president right now is that something that you're you're comfortable speaking about because.
Kanye,It is it is unclear and i think that's where people could come up with these theories and what you're really trying.
Interviewer,To do because they're not clear on what your actions are i'm not running for president.
Kanye,I'm walking so that's gonna take a little bit more time so you might not get there at 2020 would you say.
Interviewer,You're walking your way to president we'll take that i'm like spraying the ankle.

Kanye, are when you see him I want a it's gonna make you mad cuz it makes you feel bad about yourself.
Interviewer, cuz you wish that you could be that passionate about anything in your life you see that you like I wish I could be.
Kanye, that passionate but I can't cuz I'm just a sucker I always felt like I could do anything that's the main thing people.
Interviewer, are controlled by thoughts their perception of themselves they're slowed down by their perception of themselves.
Kanye, if you're taught you can't do anything you won't do anything I was taught I could do everything and I'm Calle West.

Kanye, is very like megalomaniac and self oriented to the contrary completely I just want to help from day one I just.
Interviewer, wanted to help it's crazy that we live in a world that if you're super positive and super creative that it's scary so.
Kanye, what does that tell you about the mentality of most people if you're scared of like positivity and creativity.
Interviewer, like there's I have no intent to do anything negative to any way to anyone I won't only want.
Kanye, you know more positive things to have the codes of that go listen to all my music it's the code to self-esteem.
Interviewer, it's the codes of who you are if you're a Kanye West fan you're not a fan of me you're a fan of yourself you will.
Kanye, believe in yourself I'm just the Express oh I'm just a shot in the morning to get you going they say.
Interviewer, people don't stand up and protect their dreams people are too scared of getting you know spoofed in a way and the irony.
Kanye, of it is so many people that are creatives think about a creative person in school when you picture them you're.
Interviewer, probably picturing them all the way in the back of class sketching or maybe getting beat up and I'm the one creative.
Kanye, and this is the reason why I went on stage this the reason why I did this cuz creatives have got beat up my entire.
Interviewer, life and there's moments where I stood up to drug dealers in Chicago and said you can't have my publishing come and.
Kanye, kill me do whatever you're gonna do but you're not going to bully me you're not gonna.
Interviewer, to stop me because my mother made me believe in myself no matter how many people tell me stop believing in.

Interviewer, remember for much more than their bones you know so for when Humanity is going you know what do we give to even this.
Kanye, little planet you know that we're on and what could we do collectively like removing the pride it is.
Interviewer, the glass shattering of the class system which is the new racism class is the new way to discriminate against people to.
Kanye, hold people down to hold people in a place based on where the kids go to school how much money they make but they.
Interviewer, drive where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much you know how much they have in their account for.
Kanye, you know retirement to somehow say that this person right here means more than this person like I know we you know I.
Interviewer, don't treat it you know black lives matter but you know all lives matter like my doorman is more important to me.
Kanye, than any head of any company he keeps us safe my driver keeps us safe and goes to work every day the guy painting the.
Interviewer, windows you know at the house no when we change them from white to chocolate brown you know what the architect.
Kanye, suggested he is just as important as anyone else that walks in the house and grabs a glass of champagne it's no more.
Interviewer, of this separation of what you came from your race financial finance background education talent level beauty.
Kanye, whatever it is that people use to separate so Fusion is the future period the mixing of ideas the mixing of the.
Interviewer, you know the to lunch tables working together you know humanity period man we're one we're one for one people.
Kanye, exclusivity is a new N word not exclusivity am I saying a word right yeah yeah that is the new N word because.

Kanye, exclusivity is a new color people fountain concept and saying we're gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to you.
Interviewer, know drink at the right fountain you know we have to reboot our mentality period of a generation you know it.
Kanye, wouldn't even matter if I saw one sweatshirt you know as long as his interview gets done and kids hear this.
Interviewer, and know this and someone in a position of power or someone else be in a position of power in the future has a.
Kanye, chance to make a difference and that they saw that someone who was at their lowest point grabbing at straws express.
Interviewer, themselves freely and overcame it through all adversary' our adversity means that they can do the same thing.
Kanye, you know I could be vilified or misunderstood and you know like I said it I didn't I didn't come here to be.
Interviewer, liked I came here to make a difference you know not particularly just the sin of young.
Kanye, timeout life life here's some people's job they're very extremely likeable and you know I think I could figure that out.
Interviewer, I think I'm way nicer to people just in general everyone that meet I'm extremely nice but as soon as people start playing.
Kanye, games I stop I stop playing games and at any moment I could hit that yay button uh-huh.
Interviewer, and we can go right back to day one cuz we forget enough and I'm Zen he's getting real quick you know so.
Kanye, but it's all it's all love and great energy and positive image I got scared at the idea you know someone call you.
Interviewer, crazy so many times you start to believe it and I and I almost got scared of the idea of like going crazy in some way but.
Kanye, I wasn't going crazy I was like the only person that wasn't crazy you know I'm saying like the I stand that I just look.
Interviewer, like it is anyone else here seeing what I'm seeing none of you guys are seeing what I'm.
Kanye, seeing or it's just like your Maybach in your house is like that important that you won't move at all.
Interviewer, it's distractions that you won't say anything at all in risk of losing something right you won't say anything.
Kanye, on anyone's we have at this point you know so if you have that ability to do that to see that you know that Walt.
Interviewer, Disney ability in some way you have to apply it none of this was about me having like a bigger house a faster.
Kanye, Lamborghini hey like it wasn't about that it was about these kids having a moment to be themselves to be a stronger.
Interviewer, version you know of themselves I made I make this stuff to empower people I feel like it's so many things that are made.
Kanye, to you know to where the people as opposed to the people wearing it and I asked my assistant one time I was like.
Interviewer, how did these clothes make you feel she said I feel powerful and that's our that's our main goes the song says no.
Kanye, one man should have all that power no one man should have it everyone should have us as a people we can't do it on.
Interviewer, our own that's true we have to we have to understand that we're not each other's enemy we have to stop.
Kanye, discriminating against each other due to class and due to race and due to location of financial you know position.
Interviewer, we have to say wow that is the best version let's use it let's bring it let's bring it to light let's move.
Kanye, forward let's push forward as a civil civilization because we're so jacked up on our.
Interviewer, own egos and so misguided by mainstream you know marketing we don't know what the is real we'd be apt to get into.
Kanye, a fight this quick for the dumbest reason definitely something that's like racially you know this agenda set you.
Interviewer, know it's like you know we it's like repeated against each other we're mentally not in a place to be accepting.
Kanye, to not be jealous in that part of that jealousy and that frustration that that that that goes up across an entire globe.
Interviewer, is due to some of these other high corporation level limitations everybody is being served a nasty lunch food and.
Kanye, like you know you heard the word minimalism a lot on this project even this it's like oh you give us what you.
Interviewer, need may not be what you want give us what we need to proceed no I don't expect to be understood at all okay but.
Kanye, like I don't expect to be I think that there's people who are wired by their parents to understand what I'm saying.
Interviewer, sure and there's people who are wired by their parents to reject what I'm saying you know so many people are just so.
Kanye, obvious they're you realize that when they box me in or try to verbally put me in some type of box of Redonda in.
Interviewer,A box that they're really showing their level of ignorance they're putting themselves in a box and you know people.
Kanye,Can write write write all they want but what are people doing and if there's anybody that's out there doing they know.
Interviewer,How hard it is to actually do and i'm like a motivation of the doers if if everything I did failed which it doesn't.
Kanye,It actually succeeds but if everything i did failed just the fact that I'm willing to.
Interviewer,Fail is an inspiration people are so scared to lose that they don't even try like one thing that people can't say is.
Kanye,They can't say i'm not trying i'm not trying my hardest and I'm not trying to do it the best way that I know how with.
Interviewer,What little information i get i take you know things that people look at as a negative as an inspiration to.
Kanye,You something better i think there's school teachers that are the the exact same mission as as me.
Interviewer,I think there's police officers with the exact same mission as me just help just do everything you got give everything.
Kanye,You got and you know our focus needs to be less about what I like to see is going to be or how we're going to.
Interviewer,Control each other but or how can we can give to each other every time I say something that's extremely truthful out.
Kanye,Loud it literally breaks the internet so what are we getting all of the rest of the time.
Interviewer,I speak to me i don't care about having a legacy I don't care about me and remember it's the most important thing.
Kanye,To me is like while i'm here while we're having fun while we're going to sleep and breathe in oxygen and live in life.
Interviewer,And falling in love and having pain and having joy it's like what can I do what can I do with my voice what can we do.

Kanye,Course the show seems like it costs a lot of money and I know most most hip-hop shows is it's usually you know.
Interviewer,Not that expensive a lot of rappers and not too much of the I say the hoop line you had a lot of hoopla I'm hearing so.
Kanye,So why did you want to take so much pride into the show how long is a creative or more like a Walt Disney or.
Interviewer,Something my rap is just a chamber of my of my thoughts it's something that I really wanted to express as a modern day.
Kanye,You know poet because you know if i lived in the past lifestyle maybe I would have.
Interviewer,To play right or something but in this lifetime to be the most turnt in the most relevant the most relevant is to be.
Kanye,A rap rock star right you know i'm saying you can express you know the highest level and for me I like I came.
Interviewer,From art school and everything i would you know draw out all these ideas and all these concepts and the the more and.
Kanye,More i get to create the younger and younger and younger I feel so you know when I did glow-in-the-dark I felt young.

Kanye,Fantasies and i felt like i was 10 then I like did you know blueprint 3 and was thrown and cruel summer and then I got.
Interviewer,To you know jesus i just felt frustrated usually I would start out with like blood on the leaves I know everybody.
Kanye,Would even like the album or if i did that but I felt so frustrated in the way I've been marginalized and held back why.
Interviewer,Do you feel so frustrated say that a lot like why I remember you from being outside the studio trying to get people.
Kanye,Hear you rap it was a great producer but nobody believed you as a rapper but and then it seems like you got to a point.
Interviewer,Where everybody's loving the way that you rap now you just seem like you're more frustrated you like do you not like.
Kanye,The reception jesus god cuz i that's what I don't I didn't like the hub at all and I was a Kanye West fan yeah.
Interviewer,Jesus was white to me yeah that's great that's great so were you saying I was I was asking about the whole yeezus like.
Kanye,What makes you so frustrated yeah it's not about yeezus it's about you know Michael Jackson was told he couldn't.
Interviewer,Play videos on mtv because he was considered to be an urban artist right so some of I started talking about.
Kanye,Clothing everybody's been talked about urban clothing line what I'm trying to say is like it's 1460 something.
Interviewer,Billionaires in the world i don't know exactly because somebody might have thought of a new tech idea and a.
Kanye,Company's value at what to 1470 billionaires there's only seven black ones and we know some of the most famous.
Interviewer,Ones of like oprah whatever so you know in order to really impact and be in a position of power at this point you got.
Kanye,To be a billionaire ain't about being like you know a superstar I don't know nobody that like sells a lot of like.
Interviewer,Records and gets a lot of radio spins that's actually a billionaire either we get into so so much of like you know.
Kanye,Arguing with each other that we're not looking at the main thing but what I did with use is I took the.
Interviewer,You know the power into my own hand i wanted to remove you know the hits from it I want to remove the course is of.
Kanye,Course blood on the leaves and bound it's got of course you know I like resolved the album and let everybody.
Interviewer,Know it's all good at the end of it but it's not all good you know like I said I'm from Chicago people is dying every.
Kanye,Day and everybody think we're gonna do a benefit concert and help that out but I need to be put in a position to be able.
Interviewer,To apply my thoughts the same thoughts you know before I came in again rappers is killing each other.
Kanye,You ain't heard about that number the first time rappers rapped on a song with each other.
Interviewer,That was a god level all of them with swagger like us after that all the songs is like swagger like us the thing is we.
Kanye,Not each other's enemies i'm showing us how we can work together you know but in fashion or whatever or you know product.
Interviewer,Design they try to marginalize us and say we can only have a urban clothing line or we can only do this and of.
Kanye,Course we're gonna have a urban clothing line we're gonna wear the definite and it's gone now meanwhile Ralph Lauren.
Interviewer,Could build his story up you know i'm saying show his family but you know I'm showing my family and I think actually I.
Kanye,Have a love-hate relationship with the paparazzi but actually I love him because they empowering us they.
Interviewer,Empowering us over you know graydon Carter or Vanity Fair that want to say you know Kate Upton is Marilyn Monroe.
Kanye,Kate upton ain't marilyn rope can't Marilyn Monroe you know that she was controversial she controversial this is.
Interviewer,Reality i'm living inside of a dream world to me don't nothing matter to me except for the people and the way I can.
Kanye,Affect them almost lost my life i lost my mama I went from like you know jay-z being my idol sylla's my idol to him.
Interviewer,Being across the stage on me saw i know that anything is possible and I know when they hold me down my BS meter is at.
Kanye,All-time high but would you accomplish so much what what yeah what like what what they want to help talk man no none.
Interviewer,Of it they want this man to Doulton blows man they waiting for Charlemagne to tap these gloves go at.
Kanye,Your blows this way let's go like to me it seems like you're such a walking contradiction because you'll denounce.
Interviewer,The corporations but then you'll get on stage and say you need Nike and Adidas to back you that makes no sense to me.
Kanye,100% but how can you denounce the corporation say after corporations that you feel like a slave but then ask the.
Interviewer,Companies to back and ain't that i feel like a slave we are mentally enslaved we.
Kanye,Slave to brands we enslaved to like a bin symbol we enslaved chains a woman is enslaved to the concept but diamonds are.
Interviewer,Girl's best friend like girls in london don't even wear engagement ring that's all been programmed at us when we born.
Kanye,We bought we born artists we born free and then we held down by society's perception of us we just don't want to.
Interviewer,Be embarrassed and i took the opportunity to look as stupid as possible I'm saying when I was in.
Kanye,Chicago and watch the throne i was going to change my outfit to some normal leather pants and stuff and they.
Interviewer,Tailored it one was too tight then the next one ripped on me and I felt like God was like nah man.
Kanye,You can't be scared in chicago because it's a bunch of gangsters and that's where you grew up I want you to wear.
Interviewer,That kilt in chicago i want you to release that fear I want you to show as an artist that you could create to the.
Kanye,Highest level you know i'm saying so i got to do with juveniles and corporations with utilizing corporations.
Interviewer,To be in business with you that's what the contradiction I'm gonna confuse I'm not denouncing the corporation I'm.
Kanye,Denouncing people to have the job at the corporation at that time because you know when I wanted to get my deal it was.
Interviewer,An arse that don't work that no more telling me how I needed to work with another rapper or how I wasn't a rapper.
Kanye,By now it's people that's at the corporation's they got the ability in the facilities that if I put my genius.
Interviewer,To it that i can affect culture and a higher way the way I effect it people when I made them Louise and I affected.
Kanye,People when i made them easy so i ain't going at Nike as a corporation I'm going at the people that's running the.
Interviewer,Corporation and i'm saying i'm gonna hit you in the chest until you listen to me because you feel like you ain't got to.
Kanye,Take no meeting with me so i'm gonna turn up and I'm gonna let you I'm gonna show you what we are we were awards e.
Interviewer,We're gonna run over that mountain until you listen to me because I'm influential the reason why I'm influenced the same.
Kanye,Reason why you want me to come to your show or you want me to wear your product is the same reason why you got involved.
Interviewer,Me and you got to cut me in you know i'm saying people got fat without me you cutting me in because we have a.
Kanye,Negotiating lines no she went Nike they said okay cool hey you've been screaming up and down we gonna give you.
Interviewer,A deal for yeezy finally because it was marginalizing me let me only design two shoes of a five year period people talk.
Kanye,About the red october that's the design for three years ago you got any ideas I got you know say so they try to.
Interviewer,Marginalize me and then they say look we're gonna give you four million dollars a year.
Kanye,To design this i said what about royalties they said look you know you not a professional athlete so you don't.
Interviewer,Get no royalties i said look michael i go to any of these readings and play one on nobody I'm a performance athlete more.
Kanye,Than being an athlete i'm i'm wrong i'm like Howard Hughes I'm like David Stern I'm like Steve Jobs if anything that's a.
Interviewer,Compliment to them i'm like michelangelo cuz I'm the new version of that and anybody that backs me he's gonna be the.
Kanye,Medici family that back michelangelo at this point you know I'm saying so when they told me I couldn't get no.
Interviewer,Royalties like wasted you want me to work for Nike for two more years I can't when I tell my daughter in two years now.
Kanye,I've been working trying to make nike still hot and I still ain't don't have you know the backing to really support.
Interviewer,And protect her because she in a position of a level of royalty like like the princess and the princess out in.
Kanye,London but they got more paper they got heritage me and can we on our grind we had to do what we had to do to get to.
Interviewer,This point to be able to support our family but we ain't there yet we ain't financially there to the point to make.
Kanye,Sure that north is safe at all times and that's the reason I'm turning it up right now let me ask you question you.
Interviewer,Mentioned something about you know when you came out doing the record and you said nobody believed in the a nossa.
Kanye,Fight dame was one of those people i believe yeah and we haven't seen you ever seen you never but the first thing.
Interviewer,People said was when damon j split why did you decide to go with J and not dame since he was the one that had your back.
Kanye,With nobody listened and nobody was that was really big brother yeah you know what it was it's because you know last.
Interviewer,Night i think my what people call a rant but I call it a visionary stream-of-consciousness.
Kanye,It was better like right now the more this morning is better because my voice is hoarse the problem is when I get too.
Interviewer,Loud it's just too loud you know i'm saying it but you know people you know coming to studio play their music they.
Kanye,Play it so loud for you they make you think you like a beat you don't even know if you like it now you just like.
Interviewer,Blew somebody ears out and stuff so when I'm talking a lot of times it's like I'm blowing people's ears out my technique.
Kanye,Is too harsh i'm beating it up too harsh and the problem was you know with Dame pitch truth was more accurate and more.
Interviewer,Closer to what mine was but his technique was hard for me as a young kid and stuff I felt like a little bit more.
Kanye,Pressure damon says he was that and jay-z's was a nice guy and also I felt like I had that truth that Dame has in.
Interviewer,Him we the same like me and kami and dan we the same but I wanted to learn this technique that Jay got of being actually.
Kanye,Being likable like when i was doing watching throwing one a main reason I did it was to learn you know Jay's.
Interviewer,Techniques of how you talk to people may not be talking to people the wrong way sometime me too I'll be rubbing on the.
Kanye,Wrong way yeah yeah you guys really like the singer then yes so Jay Z know how to move in a room full of vultures you know.
Interviewer,I'm saying and i as his little brother i needed to learn that technique because I got something that God want me to give.
Kanye,The world you know i'm only doing five one percent one small iota of the work or else he would have killed me in that.
Interviewer,Car accident that's how when they came back from Taylor Swift or else I would've ended up when somebody wanted.
Kanye,Me for my money versus somebody who actually bought me something for my birthday you know nothing you also said.
Interviewer,You don't listen to nobody and these corporations that's older than you yeah that made no sense to me because we.
Kanye,All got a birthday so one day you're gonna get older what if somebody had that same train of thought to you.
Interviewer,I'm saying they gotta listen to me they gotta choose if they won't listen to me but one thing an example somebody gave.
Kanye,Me they said i'm wiser to you on this on that outside you ain't cut no check though if you older and you wise it and.
Interviewer,You should have enough money in a position of power to cut me a check before I get anything to do it with come.
Kanye,On well i'm saying when i gave big sean any advice I gave him a deal first now the thing is if Big Sean come up a trap.
Interviewer,For me and i give him some advice but I'll give him a deal at that point I'm Sonny I'm like take that advice and go.
Kanye,Run with no we ain't jewish we don't got family that got money like that the rapper's became a new family damn.
Interviewer,Created a family at rockefeller and self a family footage young boy from the hood to do a clothing line to do that do that.
Kanye,This whole time he was fighting for jay he was up at the label fighting for Jay and he the one that ended up getting out.
Interviewer,Stayed out of it right now i'm in a fashion world fighting for Kim if we broke up I would be the one that's.
Kanye,Looked like as a i would be the Dame with a situation and she would be the J the situation right there so it's.
Interviewer,A man that's my point to that kind of with all your artists with Big Sean and we push your team with all your artists.
Kanye,I mean it's things that i do sometimes the Charlemagne you don't like are they that open with you if they say you know.
Interviewer,What i didn't like this type of rare when Big Sean was up here and he said he didn't he said it wasn't his favorite.
Kanye,Out this was at least forgotten you drop them from good for a little minute now I never drop them from good mama taste.
Interviewer,Some what everybody make good music on good music Drake on good music rocks on good music if you make good music you.
Kanye,Won't good music this ain't about no wrestling team this ain't no bout a basketball team just ain't me putting on.
Interviewer,A jersey for david stern and going my best and having a mandingo fight in front of the corporation's this ain't.
Kanye,About that this is about us coming together because we have strength as a people but it's not just about black.
Interviewer,People is about all people you know i'm saying I just want to give people advice I inspire Big Sean as much as I spy.
Kanye,Drake you know anything about the the particular stipulations on my contract to Universal I don't believe that I.
Interviewer,Don't believe in you know i don't believe in none of this Nike present themselves is such a big corporation.
Kanye,Right that you in your mind you think Nike is big as Apple almost to the hood Nikes bigs out because it Jordan.
Interviewer,Cuz and because of me and i see because we started wearing the retro Jordans when the soles is falling apart you know.
Kanye,So uh nikes only twenty six billion dollar company apples the six hundred billion dollar company they not the same.
Interviewer,Level and part of the reason is because they too busy trying to compete trying to do the smaller ideas it's only one.
Kanye,Steve jobs you know i'm saying now it's only one Kanye West and I'm just like Steve why do you talk so much about.
Interviewer,Money nowadays man i used to look at you as like a real revolutionary you're real revolutionaries didn't need money to.
Kanye,Change the world malcolm x wasn't rich Martin Luther King jr. wasn't rich like I understand why everything is so much.
Interviewer,About money and stuff too you know because you need product you need to own something to have a voice at this point.
Kanye,Cuz i'm telling you i got oh you don't need to own some have a voice you had a voice when you got on stage and you then.
Interviewer,Said george bush don't care about black people use using your voice you need my voice I've used my voice but what.
Kanye,Happened if y'all don't buy no of the album's that voice people gonna say oh he like Arsenio Hall and he was turning.
Interviewer,Up too much and now you fired but when you got money okay nobody fight you know make me buy your albums the great music.
Kanye,You produce you know makes me not buy your hours just knew not cystic egotistical personality you got that's.
Interviewer,What turns me off makes me i'm not going to show I want him right on by his records exactly but I'm thinking that.
Kanye,Your last name is the guy right absolutely so anybody that's a guy can recognize the God Jesus correct I mean.

Interviewer,My script but i ain't saying i couldn't use no tighten up on that saying I'm infallible that I'm flawless.
Kanye,I'm saying i got a cause and i'm saying that people have been look if you were creative and you design the easy ones.
Interviewer,And the easy twos and they said you can't design nothing else that would be like if I made Jesus walks in a chair I.
Kanye,Couldn't make late registration that would be like if Drake made his first single and they say he could make.
Interviewer,Another single that's how they was playing it and then the point where the Yeezys get such an impact and they say.
Kanye,But you can't even have royalties and we're gonna like but you can't know you got enough money to do it on your own.
Interviewer,Like don seeing his hats done see he makes his own hats on the side it's not distributed amongst alone is smaller you.
Kanye,Can do the same thing i lift the lever pan put the stuff that you created install it people say you could do in.

Kanye,H&m came and beat louis vuitton ass in a matter of short time what they do the reason why we want that so much is.

Kanye,Asking ya say that well that's what i'm asking what what I'm saying is all I care about is God and my family I don't.
Interviewer,Care about what position nobody got and you either helping me or you hurting me like dr. King said when we was dealing.
Kanye,With outward race because it still racism in a corporation there's still your classism segregation discrimination.
Interviewer,People still be a helpful patient's man like dr. King said he said look just because you're not committing the race's.
Kanye,Act if you see erases act and you turn your head that's still racist so you take me as a creative at the end of the.
Interviewer,Day when i'm a glow-in-the-dark and when I made graduation that's the point when I start should I how to deal with Disney.
Kanye,That's the point when i made the first Yeezys I should have been able to make the next ones just like that that's the.
Interviewer,Point when I should have been given the opportunity to create more but they want.
Kanye,To box me into a music box music is fleeting ain't no 50 year old rock star that you.
Interviewer,Care about this is a young man support i got ideas is why all the way Rockstar still prospering.
Kanye,Something like that could still prosper and I can still make money on stage but what I want to give y'all is that.
Interviewer,Feeling of when i was in fourth grade drawing Jordans that I apply to the Yeezys that you can't deny that people.
Kanye,Lined up for that that you can't deny if I had a pair of Reggie's for y'all now y'all with know one thing you do realize.
Interviewer,That's not why we love you we love you because of the music bro you gave us that feeling with albums like college.

Interviewer,Music that's a piece of me that's i have influenced all of that that's a piece of meat and right now my focus like that.
Kanye,I ain't it i ain't not live like like Drake every week and when I hear a language I'm like man I love that you.
Interviewer,Know if you wrote that for me i would have said it but do I feel that way now I feel like what I'm saying I'm bound to.

Interviewer,You're a genius why do you feel the need to tell everybody why why you just don't show improved by actions and deeds and.
Kanye,Not words and looser because when i asked Nike when the Yeezys come out they say we ain't sure yet that's the reason.
Interviewer,I'm doing crowdsourcing a public-opinion to turn up and let y'all understand what I'm going through how much I came here.
Kanye,To charlemagne to god to talk directly to the peoples y'all understand what I'm dealing with you don't get some clarity.

Interviewer,Don't want to do no more songs and that's my prerogative you know say that's my idea that's what I want to do.
Kanye,You can't control me so you know all corporations radio stations y'all can't control me y'all don't understand that.
Interviewer,I'm turn all the way i believe in me just believe in you let me do me you like it.

Kanye,Atlanta right now at the louis vuitton store if you black don't go to Louis Vuitton today that's why you need to.
Interviewer,Take a meeting with kanye west bernard Arnault when Francois Pino offered me a deal.
Kanye,Last year and he took it away then he signed Alexander went to Balenciaga then he sported Christopher cane and I think.
Interviewer,He did something else like that I love Alexander Wang I love Christopher cane but that's only happening one other.
Kanye,Time in history and that's when Jordan was a third-round pick their draft pick it's only happened.
Interviewer,One time my influence i don't see people lining up in the stores anything I dropped people lining up and it ain't.
Kanye,One black designer that make a suit jacket it a one black designer that makes you the self adjacent man from.
Interviewer,Brand joe and he's just left it it ain't it ain't we don't got it like that when I tell you only seven black billionaires.
Kanye,Look at that marginalization and we feel like we're happy because me and Rick Ross got a Maybach I got a sprin outside.
Interviewer,Are a couple of us or they put a black president man let me tell you something about George Bush and oil money and.
Kanye,Obama and no money people want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executed that's cuz he ain't got those.
Interviewer,Connections black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people black people don't have the same.
Kanye,Connection as oil people you know we don't know nobody that got a nice house you know we don't know nobody with paper.
Interviewer,Like that we could go to when we down you know that could just put us back and put us in a corporation you know we.

Kanye,Our store yeah and we we show three hundred and fifty thousand dollars of merchandise in two days we got liners.
Interviewer,I'm starting at the ground i'm using my voice I'm in the middle I'm working with photographers I'm breaking down the.
Kanye,Barriers of just the way people perceive fashion you know I'm saying if you think about an ad you think about an urbanite.
Interviewer,It looked a certain way you think about a Gucci a it look a certain way it's difficult to get the photographer that.
Kanye,Does that to not work with gaga and work with you it took me three years to work with Nick Knight y'all might not like.
Interviewer,That bound video but you like the poster for yeezus you might not like blacks in that video but you like the new slaves.
Kanye,Campaign everything we do is the creative is not going to hit and not gonna connect so like a federal flag too.
Interviewer,Because people are upset about that i'm from Columbia cycle-on with a confederate flag still flies over the.
Kanye,Statehouse lawn i've seen people protest to take that flag down for years it's just like the word you can't make that.
Interviewer,Into a positive a as an artist and in this world we could do whatever we want ain't nothing real this station start.
Kanye,Losing viewers listeners their turn is to like our office for like paper so like that yeah afternoon here I'm saying.
Interviewer,Ain't nothing real it's all iconography that we put a mindset on it people gonna write in the history books about what.
Kanye,I'm doing right now you're gonna look back at 20 years and look at the George Bush moment and look at the beyoncé.
Interviewer,Moment look at a confederate flag moment and look when I turned up and made a bigger corporation than H&M and LVMH and.

Interviewer,Think that you're too materialistic and too worried about those corporations nowadays man now it ain't it ain't.
Kanye,Materialism at all and i'm glad that you keep on because I think it's important for me to simplify repeat so it's.
Interviewer,Important for you to keep asking this question because if somebody's sitting down getting a haircut right now.
Kanye,Confused it's somebody i may have to worry for about a year right now is somebody that don't understand that's.
Interviewer,The reason why i was important for me to come and for you to ask these questions so people can really understand and.
Kanye,Really get it because it's such a futuristic way of thinking you know if you look at an interview for me from ten.
Interviewer,Years ago everybody says i loved that interview people didn't love it back then though because I was speaking to.
Kanye,The future i'm ten years ahead mentally and I'm trapped in today's time and every now and then I crack your.

Interviewer,family man.
Kanye,"It was something that God put on my heart back in 2015, uh, a few days before the MTV Awards."
Interviewer,It just it hit me in the shower.
Kanye,"And when I first thought of it, I just started, like, laughin to myself."
Interviewer,"And it, it like all this, like Joy came over my over my body just through my soul. And I could just I just."
Kanye,"felt that energy. I felt that spirit. So then two days later, I accepted the Michael Jackson Video."
Interviewer,Vanguard Awards at the MTV Awards.
Kanye,"And um instead of performing, you know, my array of hit songs, you know, I gave, uh, just my."
Interviewer,perspective on award shows.
Kanye,But always I knew at the end I was going to tell people I'm running for office. I'm running for president.
Interviewer,in 2020.
Kanye,"And, you know, just to have the it even took heart to say it in that context and people are just like, oh."
Interviewer,like their minds are blown.
Kanye,"And then I was hanging out with different I had different friends that were, you know, some people in."
Interviewer,"the music industry, some people, tech elites, different things like that. And they would really you know."
Kanye,they just really took it as a joke.
Interviewer,And they're telling me all these millions of reasons why I couldn't run for president. I remember.
Kanye,"running into Oprah two days or one day after that, she's like, you don't want to be president."
Interviewer,"And, you know, people just, you know, thought projecting putting this on you."
Kanye,"And I remember saying one of my responses to one of the people that one of the naysayers was, Will."
Interviewer,I'll definitely be a billionaire by that time. And not that that's a reason why someone should become.
Kanye,"president. But as to say, you know. At that time, I was 50, around 50 million dollars in debt, and I knew."
Interviewer,I had the confidence that I would be able to turn that around.
Kanye,"And now, you know, just going into it, I want to give you a that that's a clear answer."
Interviewer,"Well, I know you're saying I don't I don't want to go off into it. No, it's OK. Yeah, well, you basically."
Kanye,"saying is, you know, to set goals in order to achieve them."
Interviewer,"Well, what was Oprah's rationale when she said you don't want to be the president? Like, what was."
Kanye,she saying? Because remember when people were saying that that's our next president. Remember.
Interviewer,"when Trump got elected? You know, they showed Oprah and they were like it was I believe it was like."
Kanye,"NBC tweeted it, this is our next president. Like, they a lot of people wanted Oprah to want to run."
Interviewer,"And they felt like if Trump could win, Oprah could win. When I saw Trump, when I was like, see? You."
Kanye,"can win out, you know, you can win if you're coming from outside of politics. I was young when."
Interviewer,Ronald Reagan was in was president. I don't remember. Ronald Reagan was the governor of.
Kanye,California before he was the president.
Interviewer,"He had actually proven himself as a politician, at least somewhat, which is an idea that people have."
Kanye,"thrown out at me to to be governor of California, to be governor of California."
Interviewer,"Anyone better than this guy to do good, start there, get a shot, open things up again, man."
Kanye,"But I think I think my calling is to be, uh, I believe that my calling is to be the leader of the free world."
Interviewer,"That not I mean, if it's in God's plan, that part of my path is to be the governor, then that's fine, but my."
Kanye,calling is to be the leader of the free world.
Interviewer,"So when you say this, like when you say your calling is to be the leader of the free world, what what."
Kanye,does that mean to you? Does that does it mean do you have a plan that's different than the plans that.
Interviewer,"have been implemented before? Does it mean that you have no idea what kind of plan, like the plan to."
Kanye,"be the leader? Like what would you do if you were the leader of the free world? Like, what would be."
Interviewer,different about the way you would handle things?
Kanye,"Like if that's your plan, like what is it about that?"
Interviewer,"That is your calling? Like, why why would you want to do that, like, what do you want to do differently."
Kanye,"if you were the leader of the free world? Well, well. There was a couple of questions in there, you said."
Interviewer,"wise, you know, why is that you're calling this? People say to me, you know, they'll say, well, music is."
Kanye,bigger than politics or more influential than politics or celebrities or more influential.
Interviewer,"And I thought of it like if I was a pastor of a 100000 person church. But then I was also a captain, a."
Kanye,"sailor. And then we went to war and I said, I'm going to man this ship that has."
Interviewer,"A thousand people, a thousand soldiers on it, because God is calling me. To take this position, even."
Kanye,"though I'm the pastor for. You know, however big my audience is in hip hop, in music or as a just an."
Interviewer,influencer or celebrity or just as a dad and a husband in my house. The world is like. It couldn't be a.
Kanye,better time to put a visionary in the in the captain's chair.
Interviewer,"And that's not to say we haven't had visionary's be before, I'm not coming here to turn down any of the."
Kanye,"other, I'm not here to down Trump, down Biden. I'm just here to express why. Why? God has called me."
Interviewer,"to take this position. So when you say a visionary, you think of yourself in terms of like as an artist, as."
Kanye,"a creator, as someone who has these thoughts that they manifest in terms of music and art, creation."
Interviewer,"design, the things that you do."
Kanye,That's why you think you're different as a visionary.
Interviewer,"Yeah, I. I think that. I think I'm different from I mean, we're all different, so I'm definitely different from."
Kanye,"everybody, we're all different from each other. I mean, I do bump into people that seem to be like the."
Interviewer,same character inside of.
Kanye,"Yeah, it's like other people's before. Yeah."
Interviewer,"People play the same roles, like I just met you before you, that you're just like the head of this."
Kanye,company over here are the same kind of person.
Interviewer,"Yeah. You know, I mean, I manifest, I see things."
Kanye,I'm a great leader because I listen and I'm empathetic and I feel the entire earth and I feel us as a as a.
Interviewer,"species, as the human race, like I did."
Kanye,Sometimes people think a utopia as almost like a negative word.
Interviewer,That's that's like we couldn't have that. But I do believe in world peace.
Kanye,"Like the people hit me with the one of the things Oprah said is she said, you got to bone up on foreign."
Interviewer,"affairs. I remember this, like, because it's Oprah talking."
Kanye,I remember a lot of what the conversation was.
Interviewer,"But that's the first thing she said was, you know, foreign affairs and foreign policies like this."
Kanye,"I think the reason why I say leader and not politician and not even specifically president is, uh."
Interviewer,"This is the time, you know, when the constitution was written that was in innovation. Now the world is."
Kanye,"innovated all around our political system, but we have innovated and simplified our political system."
Interviewer,"So I met with this gentleman, Sam, one of the founders of Y Combinator."
Kanye,So Y Combinator is a a.
Interviewer,"Is a contract that my friend, the head of Dropbox used and that a lot of tech guys use and it's a."
Kanye,"standardized deal. So one of the ideas I had when I was in this process of Innova, I'm not I'm not at."
Interviewer,war with the music industry.
Kanye,It's just it's time for us to innovate and we need to have contracts that make sense with exactly how.
Interviewer,we sell music.
Kanye,"So, you know, people every Vicini and that's like every 20 years, that's like the like decade is ten of."
Interviewer,"seniors, 20. And as you see now, it's like the world has just stopped for a second and there's an."
Kanye,"opportunity to look and say, what are the things we need?"
Interviewer,"What are the things we don't need? So I don't know if you saw when I posted my contract, I had ten."
Kanye,contracts that kept on putting me inside a labyrinth. And there's things that we don't need now. I.
Interviewer,believe that the distribution.
Kanye,"Partner, that the label is like Prince would go and say, oh, we don't need the distribution partner."
Interviewer,"especially if Prince was, you know, really alive and thriving in this Internet era. I'm the kind of person."
Kanye,where I'm not trying to go and eliminate anyone's job.
Interviewer,"So record labels are afraid of saying, OK, we're going to hand over the distribution completely to you."
Kanye,"guys, which is, you know, that's a possibility."
Interviewer,There's a way where both parties can be happy and that these infrastructural partners can be of.
Kanye,"service to the influencer, to the artists like these."
Interviewer,These deals can be.
Kanye,"Flipped in a way that they're just more fair, you know, a record and I just let me just go into this."
Interviewer,specific place with the record labels for a second.
Kanye,I'm talking about this is a confusing thing for people on the outside.
Interviewer,"Yeah. So before when I told my father I wanted to rap, he was very like Laoghaire."
Kanye,"Of that, I'd said this this I heard this business is terrible and, you know, he's right."
Interviewer,"Like people are all seeing things that are wrong inside of contracts, turning a blind eye to it. And."
Kanye,"everyone's responsible. Everyone's a part of it. You know, it's like when the Metoo movement."
Interviewer,"happened, you know, it wasn't just the guys that were getting tagged and, you know, some of the guys."
Kanye,"should have got hit with it. Some guy shouldn't. You know, that's not what I'm here to talk about."
Interviewer,"I'm saying that. In a way, everyone's responsible. Everyone's a part of the problem. That's why I really."
Kanye,"love that Black Mirror episode when, you know, everyone was making comments and anyone that."
Interviewer,"even made a comment, the bees, it was about these, you know, mechanical bees, anyone."
Kanye,And this is a spoiler alert if you haven't seen this episode.
Interviewer,"But anyone who made a comment, the bees came to go get them. And that's the thing about what you."
Kanye,"put in the universe, even a thought, you know. You put that thought into. It's another thing to say."
Interviewer,something negative and put then to the universe is another thing.
Kanye,"To see someone being raped, you know, is the reason why I compare what's happening to in the."
Interviewer,"music industry to me, too, because artists are raped."
Kanye,You've heard that term before. I'm not this is not like this. Not like a new thing that I'm making up. The.
Interviewer,the contracts are made to rape the artist.
Kanye,"And, you know, I put my like I think about. You know, this is like a thought right now, it's like is this a a."
Interviewer,negative thought that I'm putting into the universe?
Kanye,"But I have to say, like when I was going on Twitter, I was thinking about Bruce and Brandon Lee that."
Interviewer,crossed my mind to say I'm this is Sony. This is Universal. And I'm willing to put the blue. Pain on my.
Kanye,"face and go out and do this. Because it's the right thing to do, like music at this point loses me money."
Interviewer,it doesn't make it doesn't make money. It is my my five dollars billion net worth and 300 million.
Kanye,dollars of cash that I see a year.
Interviewer,Music is like negative four million for me.
Kanye,So these contracts for me were kind of like whang grow and heat where this guy had everything.
Interviewer,"But he still said Wango messed up this, this, this heist that we're going to do."
Kanye,"Like I look at the music industry and that music and the love of music itself. But the music industry, I."
Interviewer,"look at it like Wango, like. I blame. You know. The loss of my mother partially on the entertainment."
Kanye,"Industry, the always fighting to. You know, represent, you know, who you are against media."
Interviewer,entertainment industry that's trying to tear down anybody that's not going with the flow. I see.
Kanye,"You know, I've got those kind of reasons personally, but vengeance is mine, said the Lord."
Interviewer,So it's not a matter of going in for revenge.
Kanye,That's just me as a human being where I fall short like I'm not a monk. Can you explain what you're.
Interviewer,talking about with Bruce Lee and Brenda Lee would have lost you there.
Kanye,"OK, so Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee were both murdered. Well, Brandon Lee died in an accident on a."
Interviewer,"movie set. Yeah, you think it was a murder?"
Kanye,"I felt that's a conspiracy, right? The conspiracy was that the Chinese triad killed him the same way."
Interviewer,they killed Bruce.
Kanye,"But the coroner's report was that Bruce died from a reaction to a medication, right?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. I mean, but I think about that any time I go to the go to the hospital, I'm very. You know, I'm."
Kanye,"mindful of that stuff you think about, like Bob Marley. They didn't just JFK or MLK him. There's like."
Interviewer,reports that it was something in his toe or he had cancer.
Kanye,Right. I believe he had a skin cancer. Yeah.
Interviewer,"Like, I went to go. I got a shot in my in my hand because just from text in and out of my thumb was."
Kanye,"like, hurt."
Interviewer,And then I posted so much. You hurt your thumb. Absolutely. Just texting way too much. So I post a.
Kanye,picture.
Interviewer,"Of the screen at the hospital, and then I was asked to take it down. Bye bye. People just call them, I."
Kanye,"forget exactly who asked me, but it was like they got to my management, they get to this and they."
Interviewer,"said, take that picture down like the hospital. It was in the weirdest place, you know."
Kanye,So what did they not like about the picture?
Interviewer,"I think it had like it might have had some information on it that they didn't want to go out, like an."
Kanye,address or something like that.
Interviewer,"And I was just like, but I don't want to go down, go down these rabbit holes. I'm just saying, like."
Kanye,"Michael Jackson not waking up one day, Prince not waking up one day, Bruce and Brandon Lee, Bob."
Interviewer,"Marley, all of these things are have crossed my mind, you know, as I'm going and saying I need to."
Kanye,"innovate with these contracts are not just for me, but for all artists."
Interviewer,"It's not about me getting my masters back. It's about. It's about. Freedom and I say on a new song, I."
Kanye,"say, if I would put myself in harm's way to get my masters, they would put their self in harm's way to."
Interviewer,stay the master.
Kanye,And that there's a complete parallel to the way the music industry works and the way the world.
Interviewer,currently works and the influence that America has on other countries and the way governments.
Kanye,"work, the influence and the way government and the way people in power and control deal with. You."
Interviewer,"know, disaster relief deal, deal with Haiti, deal with the Bahamas, like where is the money going? Why."
Kanye,aren't things being built? And this concept of money.
Interviewer,"Right? I asked myself this. I asked him one week ago, like, how much is America in debt? And they."
Kanye,"were like this many trillion. And then I asked a rhetorical question, but the dumbest question I've ever."
Interviewer,"asked myself, I said, well, you know, how much does the earth cost?"
Kanye,"I think they got a bad question. But how much is the earth worth? Yeah, what is what is the worst?"
Interviewer,What all the things on earth. Yeah.
Kanye,And it's saying we can't buy it. We couldn't make enough money to buy the Earth. Right. So that.
Interviewer,means we made money.
Kanye,So if money is the key to all people's happiness and will solve everything and everyone's doing things.
Interviewer,"for money, let's just make more money. But it's not about making more money. It's about keeping."
Kanye,"poor people, poor and rich, people rich and people keeping people in their place."
Interviewer,And right now we're experiencing the fall of Rome or the Titanic has now hit a glacier.
Kanye,And there's people who would prefer to go down with the Titanic than to get on a lifeboat because.
Interviewer,they don't want to get sea water on their dress or the nice outfit that people are so programmed and.
Kanye,brainwashed into classism and protectionism that.
Interviewer,It's difficult for people to embrace innovation unless it has a tag on it. That's got a name brand.
Kanye,"connected to it that says with this innovation, you will be better than the person, you'll be better than."
Interviewer,your next door neighbor.
Kanye,"You know, when I a Sunday service, I completely stop rapping because I didn't know how to rap for."
Interviewer,"God. You know, all my raps always had, like. You know, like nasty jokes on it and. And then, you know."
Kanye,"I made I made when I when I went to the hospital, I know you want to get into this. When I went to the."
Interviewer,"hospital in 2016, I wrote Start a church in Calabasas."
Kanye,"And as you left from twenty eighteen going into 2019, I said, I'm not going to let one Sunday go by."
Interviewer,without starting this church. And there's people who said it wasn't a church and different things.
Kanye,"But to start a ministry, I'm like the little drummer boy. I'm saying you know this all. I got to bring my."
Interviewer,drum. I might not be well versed in the word and but I know how to make music and I know how to put.
Kanye,this choir together and all things can be made good for God.
Interviewer,So it like quickly became the best choir of all time because all the best singers moved to California.
Kanye,"and now but a lot of them grew up in the church. So it's like the opportunity for you, for them to."
Interviewer,actually get paid singing for God because I would be funding it.
Kanye,And that for me was like a tithe for me to fund Sunday service. And I was four months in before I gave.
Interviewer,my life to God like I wasn't saved.
Kanye,"It's just I had a calling saying, just go make this church and the whole thing, the comparison to this."
Interviewer,"church, to me going and saying, OK, why, why am I running for president, is to be in service."
Kanye,"And that service to my my own ego, you know, I feel like God says to me like, haven't I given you."
Interviewer,enough?
Kanye,"I gave you an ego that helped you overcome all these, you know, roadblocks and smokescreens and."
Interviewer,"people telling you what you can't do. Now, you need to realize when you're doing things for your ego."
Kanye,and when you're doing things for me.
Interviewer,"This is like God, what I feel God is saying to me, because it really irritates me when people say God."
Kanye,told me to tell you.
Interviewer,So I'm very like mindful with this kind of word. And this I'm saying I have a feeling that that's what God.
Kanye,is saying for me to be in service.
Interviewer,"So the ultimate service position is leader of the free world, to be the president of the United States."
Kanye,It's sometimes you see me on Twitter. I say I want all to smoke. I want all the problems because the.
Interviewer,problems are the opportunities. There's an opportunity to solve things.
Kanye,"And Kurzweil, he created the keyboard."
Interviewer,"Well, he he has this video that Mark Romantic, this director that shot 99 problems for Jay-Z, which is."
Kanye,like my favorite like top five or top ten favorite videos of all time.
Interviewer,He also did closer for Trent Reznor.
Kanye,"And I like I just grew up on MTV in the 90s and I love more romantic videos, but he would share he'd."
Interviewer,share little bits and pieces.
Kanye,"I remember Ray Kurzweil talking about the ability for us to have a utopia, but us being led by the least."
Interviewer,noble and the most greedy.
Kanye,But if someone or when someone gets in a position of leadership. That is in service to God and in.
Interviewer,"service to people, period, but immediately the American people I had the joke, I was saying like, man."
Kanye,no one outside of our country should be able to see these debates.
Interviewer,This is family business right here. This is only for America to see.
Kanye,We can't let anyone outside a country see but to be in service. So I stepped away already from my rap.
Interviewer,"career for a year and served God every week, sometimes twice a week, three times a week."
Kanye,Never missed a Sunday until covid.
Interviewer,"And and this is thing there are people inside of the church dealing, doing different things, trying to just."
Kanye,take them out. And God still provided a way for us to keep that boat afloat.
Interviewer,We never missed a we never missed a service.
Kanye,"And then one of my pastors, Pastor Adam, who is the way he preaches, is called expository. It's like."
Interviewer,"one to one by the word. I like all different kind of preachers, but there's some type of preachers."
Kanye,"They they get up, they have the Bible in their hand, and they closed the Bible and then they just talk for."
Interviewer,two hours.
Kanye,And it's and and some do have anointing.
Interviewer,But the expository preachers go line for line. And for me it's like I come from entertainment. I got so.
Kanye,much sauce. I don't need no sauce on the word.
Interviewer,I need the word to be solid food that I can understand exactly what God was saying to me through the.
Kanye,King James version.
Interviewer,"Do this, you know, through this translation or the English version."
Kanye,So Pastor Adams was coming by my spot. I got this 300 acre spot in Calabasas that we had a little.
Interviewer,"house in that I was recording. And I would play this music, these chords that I love."
Kanye,"They're almost like Monk like. And that's going to go on to something to talk about later, because I'm."
Interviewer,"building a monastery, I'm building them a monastery."
Kanye,That will then be the future of monasteries.
Interviewer,"It's like full sustainable energy. Now, he says to me, Pastor Adams says to me, when I was thinking."
Kanye,"about should I rap or not? He said, my son. Just said, you know, I wish I want to hear your rap album."
Interviewer,"about Jesus, a rap album about Jesus, and it was through the mouth of babes like this person. I'm."
Kanye,"going to listen to the kids, bro. You know, I'm going to listen to my daughter."
Interviewer,"I'm going to listen to kids before I listen to, you know, super programmed out adults, and especially if."
Kanye,that adult hasn't done something that I am looking to do.
Interviewer,Right.
Kanye,So it's so funny how people are so like free and almost arrogant with their advice. And I'm just like.
Interviewer,why would I listen to you?
Kanye,You don't even ask me for any advice. I'm the most successful person I know. So the.
Interviewer,So you said my son wants to hear a rap album from you. And that just that was that was the paradigm.
Kanye,shift for me. I use that word alive. I like that. I like paradigm shifts in my favor. The and I I made this.
Interviewer,rap album.
Kanye,"And, you know, for a lot of people, it was the first album that they could play with a certain production."
Interviewer,"level in the house with their with their with their family. Now, you know, you could argue if the watch."
Kanye,the throne production was stronger or better than Jesus is king production.
Interviewer,"But when I go and I like I've been working with Dr. Dre and some of the beats to just be like, you know."
Kanye,the hardest beats possible.
Interviewer,"And it's something that was very spiritual and meditative about the mix on Jesus is King, that it wasn't."
Kanye,hitting as hard as Jesus or hitting as hard as watch the throne.
Interviewer,"It was like, this is how God wanted me to make this make this sonic painting and the way he wanted."
Kanye,"me to communicate. And so we did that album and then we did the Jesus Born album, which also got."
Interviewer,that idea from Pastor Adams and.
Kanye,"I mean, there's people who that's the only album they play and it's just bringing these gospel and I tell."
Interviewer,"you, like my formula for these hymns I'm writing because I'm writing the songs that we're doing at."
Kanye,Sunday Service is basically my book of hymns for the Future Gospel University that I'm creating where.
Interviewer,I've vision and will manifest a 200000 seat stadium circular with 100000 gospel singers.
Kanye,"And people will go to this university and they will train the way, you know, a Russian Olympic."
Interviewer,"swimmer, you know, a picture like they would be in the pool six days a week at least, if not seven."
Kanye,days.
Interviewer,"But for people who sing for the church or, you know, you know, because it's it's a tide is pro bono."
Kanye,All this like people don't practice that as much as we practice going in studio to rap or practice.
Interviewer,playing basketball if we're in the NBA.
Kanye,"So it's making the NBA, so to say, the Coliseum for God and what that if you like her like soccer."
Interviewer,chants and I and just like 60000 pairs.
Kanye,"So I envision that for God, 100000 people sometimes singing in harmony, sometimes in unison glory."
Interviewer,glory.
Kanye,Oh God Almighty. We lift our hands and give you praise class.
Interviewer,"Oh or oh God Almighty, we lift hands and give you pray pitch a hundred thousand people in unison."
Kanye,"And that feeling what that would do for our spirits, our souls."
Interviewer,It's healing.
Kanye,"There's natural forms of healing about our environment, the friends that we're around, what we're."
Interviewer,"wearing, what we're eating, our diet. So Dondi is a design company that that I formed around ten years."
Kanye,ago.
Interviewer,And some of the people that worked at Donder now have went on to become heads of fashion houses.
Kanye,like Virgil's.
Interviewer,They had a Louis Vuitton and he was the head of Donder at a certain point. Another guy that worked a.
Kanye,Dhanda is now the head of Givenchy. So this is like the talent pool. And this Dhanda is basically my.
Interviewer,"version of like a cyber, you know, extension of my brain."
Kanye,Like there's something that I'm thinking of that you can't touch.
Interviewer,But we need to we need to bring it into fruition.
Kanye,We need to manifest it and we have to see how to use things of our past and things of our now to.
Interviewer,create our future.
Kanye,So it's a organization created to guarantee the future of the human race.
Interviewer,Really. I thought about even calling it Edna because I see us all as superheroes. And Edna was the.
Kanye,"designer in The Incredibles, which is kind of almost really similar to Donna."
Interviewer,I'm just seeing these lineups and stuff.
Kanye,"So so now our focus is food, clothing, shelter, communication, education and transportation."
Interviewer,"So at the school that I just created, Easy Christian Academy, you know, we call NASA, we call different."
Kanye,"places about this hydroponic vertical, growing garden."
Interviewer,"And I remember sitting, you know, the idea of the garden is from A to Z. You have to be able to make."
Kanye,"your food right there fully sustainable, right there on your land."
Interviewer,"And, you know, it's a bunch of people like, oh, I made this salad right here. It's like I'm not good."
Kanye,enough.
Interviewer,"You still got to go to the grocery store for 80 percent, 60 percent of your stuff. I remember this one."
Kanye,"You know, this one farmer we had you know, hewanted to build this class for the kids and all."
Interviewer,this I'm going to show the kids.
Kanye,It's like people always make the kids version. I don't like this the kids version thing.
Interviewer,"Like kids need to understand how what of the pandemic was? You know, they lost all their parents."
Kanye,And it was also the kids need to understand early how real life works. So physics is one of the.
Interviewer,anchors of the school that I'm creating.
Kanye,"I remember, you know, the city is all self-sustaining, so it works off of our four main resources, Earth."
Interviewer,"when water and and fire and 90 percent of it is running off of water. What, like aqueducts, like the city."
Kanye,"of Masada. And I was talking to this engineer and saying, I need the whole thing to run off of water."
Interviewer,"And he said, well, we're going to have to use solar power. And I said, I don't."
Kanye,"And please, you know, don't take this as any offense. I don't like solar panels, I feel that their part is."
Interviewer,still of what Edison's idea was.
Kanye,I don't feel like they're really in line with what Nikola Tesla really wanted to do with alternative current.
Interviewer,get into the whole Tesla and what Edison did to take Tesla down and the fact the world would.
Kanye,probably be free by now if Tesla wasn't basically destroyed by the media that Edison control and the.
Interviewer,propaganda that Edison control.
Kanye,So I'm talking to my engineer and saying this needs to run completely with water and I don't want to.
Interviewer,use solar anyway.
Kanye,"And he says, no, I'm saying we're going to use a mirror and it's going to connect to a steam engine."
Interviewer,"and that's going to push the water back up. And I was like after, like, screaming at the guy. I was like."
Kanye,"look, if I had known physics, I wouldn't have been screaming at my engineer. So if we think about what."
Interviewer,"we're learning in school to learn physics, to learn farming, I was I was talking to."
Kanye,"A friend of mine that's a rapper and super super God following spiritual supersmart, and I was."
Interviewer,"showing her the, uh, some of the designs for the monasteries and some of the designs for the fully."
Kanye,sustainable community saw the same thing.
Interviewer,And then it said bioengineering on it.
Kanye,And she said what he is like for her bioengineering has a negative connotation. And my response was.
Interviewer,"isn't like farming and cooking, like bioengineering at the at the simplest form, like we went to going."
Kanye,"from like grabbing apples off of a tree to, oh, we put this boom in the ground."
Interviewer,"Oh. And we could grow this and we could grow this, you know, we could grow this harvest right here."
Kanye,"So it's you know, I want to just simplify and round up the the principle behind the Donder way of."
Interviewer,thinking is.
Kanye,"We've got all this information and all this, you know, the science in the scientific exploration, these."
Interviewer,"things that Tesla never completed, these things that Da Vinci never completed and. We can look at all."
Kanye,of these things and see how do we create the most primitive versions of this to create a fully.
Interviewer,"sustainable ecosystem, which is."
Kanye,"You know what, covid actually helped us to, you know, get closer to our families, get closer to our."
Interviewer,"children, understand like, oh, wow, that, you know, that was mapped out for us to be 50 minutes away."
Kanye,"from our home and our kids school, to be 30 minutes away and to put us in traffic for that amount of."
Interviewer,time.
Kanye,And these cities have been designed to promote industry and just to make more money. They haven't.
Interviewer,been designed to promote happiness. So we're at this paradigm shift in our existence.
Kanye,"You know, it was when when Muhammad hit the market, I think that's who it was and brought money."
Interviewer,"because before it was slave and trade. And this is something, you know, dishonorable men honor."
Kanye,money. I got this bar from Dave Chappelle.
Interviewer,"I'm not trying to, like, steal his bar."
Kanye,"And, you know, we as human beings, this race on earth have like been honoring money. And, you."
Interviewer,"know, money isn't."
Kanye,"It's not even real, you know, it's not even backed by anything I don't want to, like, go too far into that."
Interviewer,"but when you unprogrammed yourself, you see that there's other forms of currency now, like."
Kanye,relationships are a more important currency than money itself.
Interviewer,"And that's what we really saw. It's like the end of the movie. Our existence would be pretty covid postSoviet. And so as the Titanic is crashing and sinking and Rome is falling, there's got to be this new."
Kanye,civilization like the end of where everything starts to light up and it's been under this like dark cloud.
Interviewer,"So, you know, God is using me and he has a calling, you know, in my life to make the world better for."
Kanye,all people like people say is bad people.
Interviewer,There's good people.
Kanye,"No, there's there's people that are possessed that have demonic ways. But we were all children at one."
Interviewer,"time, say some people know they were born bad."
Kanye,"You got to remember, like, say, oh, there's bad people."
Interviewer,"Even even the devil is an angel, a fallen angel, a lost angel like Los Angeles, if you let me."
Kanye,But that's a city of angels. Let me let me let me start from the beginning.
Interviewer,"So you you essentially deconstruct things. So when you say in many ways, when you're describing."
Kanye,"yourself as a visionary, this is what I'm saying is that you're looking at all the systems that are in place."
Interviewer,"whether it's the record industry or the contracts that are wrong with artists, that civilization is set up, I."
Kanye,"think, visionaries to the glossy and too saucy of a title."
Interviewer,"OK, whatever the engineer you are, you're deconstructing all of these things and you find flaws in the."
Kanye,systems.
Interviewer,"So all these systems, whether it's the music industry system, whether it's the political system, whether."
Kanye,"it's the system of gathering food, whether even a religious system, like I remember when you started."
Interviewer,"doing your Sunday service and my friend was like, what is he doing?"
Kanye,"I go, he's going to church, cool again. Like, you don't think that's a look at all these people having a."
Interviewer,great time.
Kanye,You've thousands of people that are chanting and singing along and he's not asking for anything.
Interviewer,"Look, if anybody should be doing something like that, it's him to go because he's making great music."
Kanye,Everybody's having a good time. And what do you get out of that? The best thing that people ever get.
Interviewer,"out of church is a sense of community, a time where you get together and you all agree this is where."
Kanye,are you going to concentrate on good. You're going to concentrate on goodness. You're going to.
Interviewer,concentrate on on trying to find these shared values that are going to help the community.
Kanye,Are you doing this in this mass form? You got the superstar musician who's doing this and this mass.
Interviewer,"form with thousands and thousands of people in these gigantic areas, like that's nothing but positive."
Kanye,So you deconstructed the idea of how how to do a religious service but make it cool. And now you're.
Interviewer,thinking about deconstructing all these different things. You're thinking about deconstructing how.
Kanye,how food is harvested. You're thinking about deconstructing how we make energy. You're literally.
Interviewer,trying to deconstruct and and reimagine the idea of civilization.
Kanye,"Yeah, exactly. So talk me through how this starts with you. Have you were you always religious your."
Interviewer,whole life?
Kanye,"Yes, I was. And then I you know, then I hit high school now."
Interviewer,"So but, you know, when you're a young man and you're you know, you're a superstar musician and you."
Kanye,"know, you live in a wild life, what what was it that led you back to this?"
Interviewer,"Just a feeling in your life that there was more to life, there was more to your position, there was more."
Kanye,"to, you know, this idea of a calling that you felt like you could do more and that it resonated with you."
Interviewer,"more to to to produce these Sunday services and to to start thinking of of life in this. Like, you can."
Kanye,improve things there.
Interviewer,"God, knock me off my horse. God, like, literally called me and said, OK, now I need you. I need you."
Kanye,right now.
Interviewer,"I need I mean, not that God needs needs me. We need God. But he called me to serve him and I was."
Kanye,"tired of serve in the music industry, start tired of serving, you know, filling up stadiums."
Interviewer,"You know, the last concert and last tour I did, we had a floating stage and and actually it was a."
Kanye,"hanging stage, but it looked like it was floating."
Interviewer,"And that's just another thing. That's illusion, where we need to dispel the illusion. I wouldn't even call it."
Kanye,the floating stage today. But the whole thing about is people used to say how lose money on tours?
Interviewer,"Because I put so much into the creative and I and I was like wanted to prove prove to who, you know."
Kanye,"prove to man, prove to greedy people, you know, that I could make more than anybody."
Interviewer,"And that's like the gladiator position that all artists are put into, like we're in the middle of this."
Kanye,coliseum.
Interviewer,Let me show you. I can kill. We're lions and tigers and bears and people more than than any other.
Kanye,"gladiator that happened, so that's what I'm that's what I was doing. And then I remember talking to."
Interviewer,"James Turrell and I was like at the top of my lungs, like screaming about saving, saving ourselves and."
Kanye,humanity.
Interviewer,And the reason why me and James needed to connect. And then I went to my show and then it's like.
Kanye,"my like this like my head popped back in the spirit, jumped out, and I felt like it was like my mom."
Interviewer,talking.
Kanye,"And the last thing I said was, this thing is over. And I'm saying it like I sound like my mom, like Donda."
Interviewer,"Like that's something she would have said if she was in the physical form when she sees her son, you."
Kanye,"know, exhausted."
Interviewer,"Like, I just went through a I had this fashion show."
Kanye,We had this fashion show where we took over MSG and just broke all boundaries.
Interviewer,"So twenty six, 16000 seats and played the new album."
Kanye,"And it was, you know, a thousand black people in the show. And yeah. Like all young thug plugging in."
Interviewer,the iPhone and Travis and Cudi dancing at 50 Cent their Jay-Z there.
Kanye,"Lamar Odom. The first time that people, you know, saw him and walk again was we walk together into."
Interviewer,the into the stadium and he's cammo Yeezy jacket or head to toe.
Kanye,"And the reason why that is so important is like when he was in a coma, I would come by and play him."
Interviewer,"the new music. And once he was out of the coma, he said that he remembered that music when he."
Kanye,was in a coma.
Interviewer,And that was the album I was playing that day. So that's the reason why me and Lamar walked in.
Kanye,together.
Interviewer,"And then the next few months later, I did a fashion show and it started 45 minutes late."
Kanye,"And the media, they just killed me."
Interviewer,"They LeBron to me, as I would say, like when LeBron went to to Miami and they said, you know, who."
Kanye,"are you to have a choice? You know, like what?"
Interviewer,"One of my other heroes, Tom Brady, he he left. I didn't see no jerseys getting burned, like when LeBron."
Kanye,"left. So then less than a week after that, my wife is robbed in Paris."
Interviewer,"And so we we just because I'm in the middle of a tour while I'm doing the fashion show, I'm doing this."
Kanye,So we cancel the tour because it's very traumatic.
Interviewer,"And then, you know, we start the tour back up and we get back into it. And then I just keep on saying I."
Kanye,want to go to Japan.
Interviewer,"I just want to go to Japan, because Japan is like a way that people treat their isn't like this systemic."
Kanye,"racism embedded in every single individual that's inside of the place, like in America, black, white."
Interviewer,anything.
Kanye,"There's a systemic white white supremacy, like when I tag, you know, white supremacy or we say this."
Interviewer,"is like the yes, that is America. That is the world."
Kanye,"Currently, we've been taught that my first superhero was Superman, you know, and my dad was a."
Interviewer,"Black Panther. But, you know, when Disney makes Black Panther now, when you look it up, you don't."
Kanye,see my dad protecting his neighborhood or snatching a mike out of somebody's hand while they're.
Interviewer,"lying. I don't know, you know, like father like son right there."
Kanye,But you see this character that's made for black people to idolize that was designed by a white white.
Interviewer,person and put out by white company.
Kanye,"So it's controlling the narrative to say we're going to show you Harriet Harriet Tubman, we're not going."
Interviewer,to show you Nat Turner.
Kanye,And they do every chance they get Maleficent.
Interviewer,"They called her her race, the people, the Moors and the Moors."
Kanye,"And I just saw it again. I was just like, yo, if you were race are history."
Interviewer,"Like most black people, we don't know where we come. We think we came from slaves. We don't."
Kanye,know our bloodline.
Interviewer,"And we're giving Black History Month. And we take that like it's some gift to us. No, it's a."
Kanye,programming to us.
Interviewer,Racism doesn't end until we get to a point where we stop having it put the word black in front of it.
Kanye,because it's like we're we're putting the ram a little bit lower for ourselves.
Interviewer,"Like it's when I say I'm the second wealthiest black man in America, like, why do I have to say that?"
Kanye,"Because, you know, obviously if we just go on wealth, period, what we call wealth like financial wealth."
Interviewer,"that scorecard, you know, I'll be like I'm the."
Kanye,"On the 17th wealthiest man in America, but we shouldn't have to have a special box, a special month."
Interviewer,"because also what they show in Black Black History Month is us getting hosed down, reminding us."
Kanye,that we were slaves.
Interviewer,"Like, what have we had?"
Kanye,Remember when I cheated on you a month? Like remember when you first found the. I found the text.
Interviewer,"messages, remember? How does that make you feel?"
Kanye,"It makes you feel depleted and defeated. You know, it's no matter what religion you are, what we can."
Interviewer,agree on as it is always now.
Kanye,But now is the shortest moment of our life.
Interviewer,"It's gone in an instant, the longest moments of our life are our memories and our imaginations."
Kanye,"Think about how long a kid imagines Christmas before, I mean, versus how long Christmas really is."
Interviewer,"And when you think back to your Christmas, are you under the table like Jim Carrey and Eternal."
Kanye,"Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, like under a chair? Or are you a giant? Are you a king?"
Interviewer,Are you what? Black what what Black History Month has told you you are.
Kanye,"And this is me speaking to, you know, black people specifically in America that. You know, I know."
Interviewer,"people who would, you know, kill someone and or have a gun or, you know, in their own hood and be."
Kanye,"afraid to go downtown and literally be like afraid of white people, like the most gangster gang of."
Interviewer,gangsters wouldn't go downtown. And that's just a programming. But that program is inside of the.
Kanye,curriculum. It's it's inside of the media.
Interviewer,"And it and it goes to this whole idea of Yae when people say is Jay crazy is a narcissistic, edgy."
Kanye,"egomaniac, edgy, self-absorbed Adjaye, all these no Yae know who he is."
Interviewer,I know who I am and I'm not finished.
Kanye,I'm not fit to bow to to an idea that you want to have me. I am going to be the fool idea that God has.
Interviewer,"of me. And when I do things that are that God don't like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm being the lesser version of."
Kanye,"me. This is where I, you know, in my weakness, God becomes strong."
Interviewer,I have to be the higher me when when people are doubting me.
Kanye,"It's not like me fighting fire with fire and me attacking or as you say, like, you know, stooping to, uh."
Interviewer,stooping to that level.
Kanye,"It's like the devil will use you against you. You become your own, you become your own worst enemy."
Interviewer,And I just went on a riff right there. But the thing is this.
Kanye,"Isn't that what you do, though? Well, yeah. Yeah. One of the things that I when anybody ever talks."
Interviewer,"about you to me, they they say, well, he's all over the place. And I say, I think that he's got a different."
Kanye,power source.
Interviewer,"Like if you look at the way everybody interfaces with the world, if there's a universal power, most."
Kanye,"people have like a 20 watt charger. The way I describe you, I say I think that motherfucker's got like."
Interviewer,150 watt charger and these ideas are just coming at them. So you do go on these rants that.
Kanye,"sometimes need to be dissected into individual things. But overall, you're an incredibly productive. So."
Interviewer,my question is. Why do why do people think there's something wrong with you?
Kanye,"This is but I would legitimately like you've been medicated. They've they've put you away, right?"
Interviewer,"They've brought to you. How did that happen? Well, I'll say these two things, I think. A very three."
Kanye,"dimensionally, I don't think, in the black and white lines that I've been programmed to think in and I."
Interviewer,and I think in full color.
Kanye,"So when I talk, I have to describe a thought in five ways. You know, we enjoy food that has multiple."
Interviewer,"seasoning in it. We enjoy music that has multiple instruments. So when I talk, it's not a rant. It's a."
Kanye,"symphony of ideas. And when you collect him, you say, oh, these are all these things that connect."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"You know, I, I, I just tell the truth. And telling the truth is crazy in a world full of lies."
Interviewer,"That's simply it, but none of the things you're saying are crazy, not the things you said. It's fascinating."
Kanye,"the way you think, because I can see that you're thinking in all these different layers and you're looking."
Interviewer,at things from all these different perspectives and they all come together out of your mouth and like a.
Kanye,"tornado of ideas. Now, if someone wants to just have a conversation with you back and forth, I could."
Interviewer,"see whether the guy's crazy, just doesn't stop his ranting."
Kanye,But what I'm seeing is just you're a very thorough thinker.
Interviewer,"You're thinking of things independently, but you're thinking of things in a massive perspective. Now."
Kanye,who convinced you that? That's it. Have you always been this way or were you less is it was it less.
Interviewer,manageable before? Did you have issues with it before?
Kanye,"Yeah, I believe before I found Christ and gave my life to God, I would try to lean on my own."
Interviewer,understanding.
Kanye,And that's what the universe is. Like a black hole of information would lead by your own.
Interviewer,"understanding, meaning when people, as Einstein said, you're the smartest person, what would you."
Kanye,"like to know? He and his Einstein's response was, I'd like to understand the mind of God. Meaning?"
Interviewer,Meaning God is all knowing and we can only know or see.
Kanye,"And for me, as a visionary, we can only know or see what God allows us to see and what he feels."
Interviewer,We're ready to see and understand to to maximize what our Maslow's hierarchy and chart is. You.
Kanye,"know, what sets our dopamine's what sets our tone is off, what makes us feel good."
Interviewer,"Basically, like, you know, we did a good deed and it's like it was somehow, you know, you know, just."
Kanye,doing a beat for a famous or just doing a beat for a local dope rapper really meant a lot to me.
Interviewer,"When I was 14 years old, doing a beat for just anyone famous that had a major record deal was a lot."
Kanye,"to me at age 19, me being able to, you know, put out my own music and put my own."
Interviewer,"Oh, I was a lot to me at age 24, meaning as I grow, God sets new stages in the game of life for me that."
Kanye,"you get your satisfaction, like Maslow's hierarchy of need is like our satisfaction chart."
Interviewer,What makes us feel whole and accomplished as a as a as a human being.
Kanye,"So as I go through these different levels, there's times where I would use confidence when I knew."
Interviewer,what I was doing and I would use arrogance when I didn't know what I was doing. But I'd rather use.
Kanye,"arrogance than to let someone diminish my idea of myself, because that is what keeps us going."
Interviewer,"Hope actually keeps us alive. Anybody you ask most people is like, do you want tomorrow to come?"
Kanye,"And they say, yes, they have they have hope for it. But I went from having confidence and arrogance."
Interviewer,to having faith. And faith is the opposite of fear.
Kanye,And that created this fearless approach that I have.
Interviewer,And that's what made now has made me the fearless leader that I am that I've like crystallized into the.
Kanye,leader that my mom always knew I would be.
Interviewer,"When kids follow me in preschool, the leader that people saw when we changed the Sound of Music."
Kanye,"the leader, when we change the sneaker industry, the leader and what we're doing with with farming."
Interviewer,"and with with shelters, when I was building, you know, the homeless shelters a couple of years ago."
Kanye,and visiting parks and then going to Skid Row and understanding the the dynamics and empathizing.
Interviewer,with what actual mental health issues are.
Kanye,"Not someone, you know, telling their truth or being exhausted and then being labeled as such like I."
Interviewer,am.
Kanye,"So that's what you felt happened to you, like you were absolute truth and you were exhausted and."
Interviewer,they labeled you as mentally unhealthy?
Kanye,"Yes, absolutely."
Interviewer,Am I saying this right that what happened with you is you feel like maybe or you probably feel like that.
Kanye,having this higher calling and recognizing this higher power was the glue that kept your thoughts.
Interviewer,together.
Kanye,They kept your mind straight and it kept you on a righteous path. So instead of being scattered with.
Interviewer,"all these crazy thoughts and being exhausted and being labeled manic, right. Like we talked before."
Kanye,"and you were saying that they had you on medication, but the medication fuck with your creativity, it."
Interviewer,fucked with all kinds of things.
Kanye,", it blocked my ability to channel what God wanted me to do. But we're all we're all on medication."
Interviewer,right now. Did you use toothpaste with fluoride today?
Kanye," blocks your pineal gland and they put children on it and we put we put our kids on it. You know, it's."
Interviewer,inside.
Kanye,e deodorants that we use is all these things to create like a disconnect to God to serve that.
Interviewer,"'s like, are you serving man?"
Kanye,e you serving the one and only master? But what did they tell you when when they said they were.
Interviewer,going to put you on medication? What did they put you on and what did they tell you?
Kanye,e of my favorite things that they did is they put me on this medication that made me gain a lot of.
Interviewer,"weight. And I said, I'm not going to take this. And they said, OK, we got a medication. You can take."
Kanye,what you don't gain weight.
Interviewer,"d this shows you they were trying to kill a superhero, slowly trying to kill genius, trying to make me."
Kanye,"not feel like I could run for president, make me not feel like I can go be born."
Interviewer,"And Atlanta, grow up on the south side of Chicago, go into music, go and win all these Grammys."
Kanye,"change the sound of Music and look on stage performances, all that, and then still end up in 53."
Interviewer,million dollars in debt.
Kanye,"What music industry has people going to the exact debt, the house that they think they're going to buy."
Interviewer,after the tour is over and it's and it's at strategizes criminals all over everyone's almost accounts in.
Kanye,the music industry.
Interviewer,It's not a safe place. It's a it's a treacherous place.
Kanye,"So with money, sometimes things are filled with money. They're filled with people that are trying to."
Interviewer,"take advantage of other people, steal money. Bees come to honey. So they put they put you on this."
Kanye,"ship because you were exhausted. What did they put you on? You know, I can I can research, I'm not."
Interviewer,"I'm actually forgetting the exact medication that they had, but what did it do? The main thing that it."
Kanye,did.
Interviewer,Is. It destroyed my confidence. It may be this shell of who I really am. It like grade over my eyes. It it it.
Kanye,"made me. It made the Mustang not Buck anymore. Mm. They sedated you? Yes, yeah, and they what."
Interviewer,was the the thought process behind it?
Kanye,We talked to a doctor about this. What did they tell you was wrong with you? They they told me I was.
Interviewer,"bipolar. And I remember going on TMZ and saying, you know, slavery is a choice. And they medicated."
Kanye,"me for saying that, for having that opinion and saying it out loud, but as I put those contracts up, I'm."
Interviewer,saying this is a choice.
Kanye,"As I you know, you didn't mean people being abducted and brought into slavery and put into chains."
Interviewer,was a choice. What you were talking about is people making decisions that would enslave them.
Kanye,"financially and enslave their life. Yeah, it was taken out of context and it was taken in the least."
Interviewer,"charitable way. And they decided to try to say, look at crazy. Can you look at this shit? He's saying."
Kanye,yeah. Then they medicate you. Yes.
Interviewer,And the media is always taking anything out of context that isn't a part of the overall narrative. Yeah.
Kanye,"That because there's, you know, like Hollywood and media has control so much of the narrative and."
Interviewer,"then. He had Silicon Valley, and that's what's so beautiful about one of my heroes, Steve Jobs."
Kanye,because there wouldn't be a Silicon Valley or Silicon Valley wouldn't be what it is today if Steve Jobs.
Interviewer,"didn't make information accessible like this, which is still a bit controlled."
Kanye,"But it feels like Twitter is the the safest fleet, freest mass platform to communicate on."
Interviewer,"And, you know, it's like they mess with Jack because of that, you know."
Kanye,"You know, well, it's still censored. There's a lot of issues now. But I think that's internal. I think that's."
Interviewer,people that are working there that are woak that want to stop people from saying certain things. And.
Kanye,there's a lot of struggles with that today. And it's unfortunate because I do agree that it's an.
Interviewer,"unbelievable way to get ideas out there. Yeah, but it's also it's a new thing and it's mismanaged by the."
Kanye,people that use it often.
Interviewer,They don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it.
Kanye,Every version of anything that man has made will be flawed. Sure. And it has to go through a bunch of.
Interviewer,different steps of evolution. It just has to evolve and change.
Kanye,So why did you agree to let them do this to you? Why? Why did you agree to let them medicate you?
Interviewer,"Because if that is that, look, I'm crazy for sure, but if someone came to me and go, hey, we're going to."
Kanye,"put you on some medication, that medication is going to calm you down, I'll be like. Everything I do is."
Interviewer,because I'm not calm. Everything that I've ever done that's made me successful is because I have.
Kanye,"more energy, is because I have a wildness."
Interviewer,Like I'm not common that down. Like I know how to calm myself down. I can self medicate with.
Kanye,exercise and meditation and marijuana and a bunch of different things.
Interviewer,But I'm not going to I'm not going to take some medication that removes anything that's unique with.
Kanye,you and all these wild ideas that come to your head.
Interviewer,Like very few people could string together these thoughts the way you're describing them today. If.
Kanye,"somebody asked me if there's anything wrong with him, I just fucking he's filled with awesome. Like."
Interviewer,"what's what's wrong with that? If you can keep that together, what you just did, the way you just."
Kanye,"described, reimagining civilization, reimagining church, reimagining the food supplies, there's nothing."
Interviewer,bad about that.
Kanye,This is all very interesting and very good.
Interviewer,"Like I would never say that's bad, but are you this way all the time or is there good versions of Konya."
Kanye,and versions of Cannier where you don't feel like you have a grip on these thoughts?
Interviewer,"You know, what I love is there was a."
Kanye,Some perspectives that people showed. About what a true manic episode really looks like after I was.
Interviewer,in South Carolina and this one guy was talking about his mom. Being in an episode and kidnapping.
Kanye,"his brother and, you know, like proper extreme cases, you know, I cried and was."
Interviewer,"Gut wrenching, like at the I don't even like to say out loud what I what I said on South Carolina, but the."
Kanye,"idea of, you know, I'm just trying to worded in a way that's really safe and covers my family."
Interviewer,"People saw this clip of me crying, some people didn't know what I was crying about, but I was crying."
Kanye,about. That there was a possible chance. I'm just I'm looking at a way to say this. I know what you're.
Interviewer,"going to say, that there was a chance that. You know that we didn't make that Kim and I didn't make."
Kanye,"the family we have today. That's much that's almost like family friendly, you know, way to work that."
Interviewer,And just the idea of it just tears me up inside that I was a part of a culture that promotes this kind of.
Kanye,thing.
Interviewer,Like one of the major statistics on the subject of life is.
Kanye,"That the greatest. Advocates for. The A the award is are men from ages 31 to 37, and that's how old I."
Interviewer,was and I felt like I was too busy. My dad felt like he was too busy for me. And we have a culture of.
Kanye,"that. And they have a child, rebel soldiers that were in Africa that would be doped up and psyched out."
Interviewer,"and made to kill their parents were well, in our culture, we're doped up and psyched out and made to."
Kanye,kill our children.
Interviewer,"You know, we have to decouple the conversation of Planned Parenthood and woman's choice now."
Kanye,"So, of course, I'm Christian, so I'm pro-life."
Interviewer,"And when I go into office, I'm not."
Kanye,"Changing laws, because I realize we live in an imperfect world, an imperfect society, what I will be."
Interviewer,presenting is a Plan A and we've already started to work on a plan to change the connotation of.
Kanye,"orphanages, to change the connotation of foster care and not just change the connotation, you know."
Interviewer,"verbally, but to create places that are to the level of like the Emon, Geary and Disney World, how to."
Kanye,"how to kid, you know, what is this like?"
Interviewer,And we have so much land that this can be created and then spread across the world to orphanages.
Kanye,in Africa and in China and just across the globe to to create these environments that when there's.
Interviewer,"expecting families, moms and fathers, that they feel like there's a place, even if they don't feel well-off."
Kanye,"enough to bring another life into this world, that there's a place to go."
Interviewer,There's a plan A because. Plan B and Planned Parenthood were planned by a eugenics that set out.
Kanye,"and said out loud, I'm doing this to kill the black race and to create population control."
Interviewer,"You know, if we win."
Kanye,"What do you saying, plan B? I mean, the pill, meaning the the morning after pill, you know what I."
Interviewer,mean? Planned Parenthood. Let me let me let me decouple those things. Let me let me talk about.
Kanye,"Planned Parenthood, OK?"
Interviewer,There's the last figure I saw was there were 210000 deaths due to covid in America and everywhere.
Kanye,"you go, you see someone with a mask on. A, they were a culture. I'll say it one time with abortion."
Interviewer,"culture. One thousand black children aborted. A day daily, we are in genocide. We. So more black."
Kanye,"children have died. In the past, since February, then, people have died of covid and everyone wears a."
Interviewer,mask. So it's a matter of where we are turning a blind eye to like the media can control.
Kanye,A lot of times it has control what we care about. I even heard somebody say at one point.
Interviewer,"This is the actual sentence I heard someone say Puerto Rico so played out, meaning there was a time."
Kanye,where people were caring about it and now the media says don't care about it.
Interviewer,"But these people, it still hasn't been solved."
Kanye,"The hurricanes still have hit, the earthquake still hit, and people are still suffering from that. And no."
Interviewer,one has really gone to fix it. And when that 11 billion goes to Haiti and it doesn't get to the people.
Kanye,"You know, the Daily Mail posta a swimsuit pic or something and the deters our energy to what we."
Interviewer,have to do collectively to to to.
Kanye,"To help our brothers and sisters, you know, I look at society as as one body, I want to just go into this."
Interviewer,because my thoughts are like these clouds and Mario Brothers. And I'll jump to this and I'll see.
Kanye,"another one. I'll jump to another and say, oh, yes, I jump to another."
Interviewer,"I need to express this this story. I believe that. You know, love will heal all and we have to look at I."
Kanye,believe I believe that world peace is possible and I believe it's us looking at each other as.
Interviewer,"A moment in time. Time is love, you love the things you put time into. That's why I'm at time is love."
Kanye,"like this is like this intangible thing, this thing you can't grab, you can't just grab time in your hand."
Interviewer,You can't grab love in your hand.
Kanye,But but we feel both of these things are real for us to love one another.
Interviewer,Just as simple as that. Like love will heal the world. This is what is going to take to heal the world. But.
Kanye,we have a competitive spirit.
Interviewer,We like having a bad guy. We like having a competitor. So what we need to do is change the bad guy.
Kanye,"change the competitor, make the competitor be."
Interviewer,"The Roman era, the Roman civilization, make the competitor be the Egyptian kingdom and say, we're."
Kanye,"the first society, we're the first civilization that ever became civil because we are still just as much in."
Interviewer,"the dark ages as medieval times or as Game of Thrones, you know, level, black mirror level."
Kanye,"I know I went past future other dimension for a second, but we kill each other."
Interviewer,We kill each other on social media.
Kanye,"We kill each other in high schools, like in the way that we talk to each other. We physically kill each."
Interviewer,other in our own neighborhoods and outside of the neighborhoods.
Kanye,"You know, this planet when we when we keep turning a blind eye to."
Interviewer,"Our brothers and our sisters and our family, which is us as a whole, as all of humanity, then of course."
Kanye,"it's going to get to the point where there's, you know, homeless sleeping under, you know, a a bridge in."
Interviewer,Calabasas because we ignored the homeless person sleeping in front of the Gucci store.
Kanye,How do houses just look at that visual? It's a homeless person sleeping in front of the Gucci store.
Interviewer,We have builders. We have people who know how to make communities. We have people who know.
Kanye,"how to cook and how to make food and how to. How to bring this food, people are fighting over land."
Interviewer,and not really realizing that we're not we're not maximizing our resources and our existence.
Kanye,We've got genius level scientists.
Interviewer,"We've got people who roeg, you know, people who have broken out of the chains like Elon, like."
Kanye,"imagine if Elon was working at GM on a third floor somewhere, you know, we wouldn't have electric."
Interviewer,cars.
Kanye,We wouldn't have that new Porche hybrid.
Interviewer,"We wouldn't have what's happening with, you know, Hyperloop. Imagine if the guy that, you know."
Kanye,started Airbnb was shut down or the guys who started Uber were shut down.
Interviewer,All of these people who break away and then create the new society and the next frontier of where.
Kanye,we're going.
Interviewer,"People like I've said, like it feels to me like MIT is a place that has to be funded by people who want to."
Kanye,take the smartest people on the planet and make them work on the smallest things that won't change.
Interviewer,anything.
Kanye,And I've talked to people from MIT and I could look at things like this brilliant person.
Interviewer,I was talking from MIT and he was he was afraid. Everything was fear. Everything was about his his.
Kanye,"girlfriend's pregnant. And, you know, we just got a house. And I don't want to do anything to change."
Interviewer,this.
Kanye,And this is like one of the most brilliant people on the planet.
Interviewer,"But if you mix brilliance with bravery that we can ignite something, even this conversation alone can."
Kanye,ignite the people that are going to change the world because there's people who have been anointed.
Interviewer,You can't teach the brilliance and the anointed people who hit the game of life. And they've got.
Kanye,something that they're going to do no matter what school they go to. They know they just know how.
Interviewer,to do it. They know how to do it before they got here and they were going to do it.
Kanye,And these people just need to see what it looks like to overcome. The smoke screens of public.
Interviewer,humiliation of bankruptcy.
Kanye,"I was in debt, the fear loss I lost my mom or the fear of death, you know, what are the fears are there?"
Interviewer,There's a lot of fears.
Kanye,"But the thing is, when you remove, like even in the schools, you remove prayer, you remove God, you."
Interviewer,"remove the fear God, you create the possibility of the fear of everything else."
Kanye,"But watch this. If you. Instill the fear of God, you eliminate the fear of anything else. And it's not that. I."
Interviewer,"am. Fearless I am. Deafly literally, definitely shaking and in so much fear of my father, I fear God and I."
Kanye,"don't fear nothing else. There's some power to that, right, just as a mental management tool, there's."
Interviewer,some real power to that because so many people are afraid of every single little aspect of life bills.
Kanye,and debt and love and relationships.
Interviewer,"And if you have a higher power and this is one of the things that I've always used to make, what's the."
Kanye,main word that you use even for fear?
Interviewer,"This is the main disease that that people use in politics is the main fear, is it? But it's a main word. Is."
Kanye,the disease attacking the world because it destroys it changes your posture?
Interviewer,Does it change your idea?
Kanye,"It's a worry. Yeah. Well, really. Yeah, anxiety. That's that's what it is. Stress like it can kill you."
Interviewer,You can't be free. You can't be afraid to take chances to be worried about stuff like this. Yeah.
Kanye,"So to be able to anchor and eliminate worry and say this, I am walking in a righteous path and I don't."
Interviewer,have to worry about anything.
Kanye,I don't have to worry about going to jail and worry about being killed. I'll have to worry about.
Interviewer,bankruptcy.
Kanye,"I don't have to worry about, you know, humiliation, you know, because this comes this is where smart."
Interviewer,aleck prayers can get you.
Kanye,I used to have this really smart aleck prayer. I said got. Deliver me from pain. And then he took my.
Interviewer,"mom. So it's hard to hurt that much ever again. And created almost like a character like Deadpool, I'm."
Kanye,"like Deadpool, Fagone. Like, there's no noise, there's no human noise that can and, you know, if."
Interviewer,someone tried to like there was there was a friend of mine that did like a really bad move where he.
Kanye,tried to say.
Interviewer,"I was using this this this lawyer, and I was about to work with him and he said the lawyer said he."
Kanye,wouldn't work with you until you get my contract done.
Interviewer,"And I was just like, how do you not know me at all? I'll be the type to cut off. If I move my hands like."
Kanye,"this, I'll cut off my own hand. I come back in the room and be like, Yo, what you're doing here? I."
Interviewer,thought we tied you up like.
Kanye,"And then I go just make like a Luke Skywalker, you know? You know, and this is one thing I want to."
Interviewer,"say, like and this kind of made me mad right here."
Kanye,"The first time you see me get mad in interview, they said that George Lucas's prequels are worse than."
Interviewer,"the corporate made Disney Star Wars. I'll get mad at that, too. Like, that's fucking ridiculous."
Kanye,"Revenge of the Sith. We saw how Darth Vader was made. Yeah, like, I watched that like ten times."
Interviewer,doing covid don't jump in again. I got the high ground. Those early movies were pure.
Kanye,"It were pure. I mean, no, no, I'm saying even the prequels are better than anything that and I'm sorry."
Interviewer,"Disney Star Wars design team. I know you're going to like, put my face up in the, you know, office and."
Kanye,"be like, forget no, man."
Interviewer,This is George. This is his baby.
Kanye,"That thing was set in his heart to show us his children the hero's journey, you know, and these these."
Interviewer,"like, how can we run it back and replay, like even at Disney, you know, there's there's people, you know."
Kanye,at Pixar that have left. People have left. You know where.
Interviewer,"They call, I've got the exact title, but saying, like, every time is a new idea, they call it like an unproven."
Kanye,idea. So they'll get to Toy Story 800000 in frozen trillion before there's a new concept to take a chance.
Interviewer,on.
Kanye,"Yeah, to take a chance."
Interviewer,"And we've been we've been programmed, like when you see the you know, the homes, the style of."
Kanye,"homes that I've been developing, they're far closer to the way the galaxy looks, the way water looks."
Interviewer,the way our makeup in our body feels.
Kanye,"We've been we've been put into these boxes. And that was, you know, due to money, due to."
Interviewer,construction that we have to be in these these boxes.
Kanye,"And we've been stuck in a loop like on Westworld and did not feel like Tandy knew. No, w we're aware."
Interviewer,"she had to use the people that enslaved her, that trapped her to make it to make it out. You know, the."
Kanye,And it's funny when I like the box and what I'm talking about farming. I had a point about farming that.
Interviewer,I didn't finish earlier.
Kanye,"I hired this guy to do the A to Z concept. I made it plain as day, make it so everything we cook in the."
Interviewer,kitchen at the school we planted here and they would just do it to 70 percent.
Kanye,They do it to 60 percent.
Interviewer,"Earlier when I had that point, I went to this whole riff about children need to learn physics and children."
Kanye,need to learn how to really do things and not having to separate thing like we are programmed to lock.
Interviewer,ourselves in a box.
Kanye,And what's amazing right now is. The opportunity and the platform that we have that the world is.
Interviewer,"hurting for everyone, for those that are in power, for those that are inside the program, even those that."
Kanye,are in power are still a part of the program.
Interviewer,"And, you know, I read this this tweet that someone say I finish watching Netflix, what's next? And."
Kanye,that's so true that. We can't even program enough to satisfy ourselves. The program has done Forrest.
Interviewer,Gump has stopped running and just turned around. It's like all of this thing is a setup.
Kanye,"The the concerts that musicians go to where we don't you know, we're not thinking about the fact that."
Interviewer,we're not getting the lion's share of our masters because we're making the money on tour.
Kanye,And then tour has girls and tour has the the the arena singing your song. And I need you right now. Did.
Interviewer,you do good chap.
Kanye,"You know, like with Floyd Mayweather is is such a hero of mine and so excellent because he is a."
Interviewer,champion.
Kanye,Right.
Interviewer,"But then also he wasn't afraid to say, I do my deals, I make my money. And what I like is, you know, he."
Kanye,didn't let the older system tell him how to spend his money or how to show his money. It was up to.
Interviewer,"him because he's the he's his own king. You know, God is the king of us all, but he's his own king. And."
Kanye,"a lot of times in America, we haven't seen we haven't seen kings."
Interviewer,"We haven't seen the the the royal blood in our bone marrow. And the way it comes through now, we."
Kanye,"could show it in. And rap in the way we put our chains on the way we dress, we can show in the way."
Interviewer,"we play ball and things like that, but it's another frontier to being to being a king."
Kanye,"Well, there's also something where you feel diminished in the fact that, you know, that your money is."
Interviewer,"being stolen by people that don't deserve it. So if you have some record executives, if you have some."
Kanye,"people that, you know, have looped you into a fucked up deal and they're making millions while you're."
Interviewer,"making thousands, that fucks with your head. Yeah, it just makes you worry."
Kanye,"Makes you stress, anxiety. It eats at you. It could drive you crazy. Yeah. It could drive you crazy. Yeah."
Interviewer,Yeah. So I still don't understand how they talked to you into medication.
Kanye,"Man, I wish I knew you better back then because I would have just had to exercise."
Interviewer,"I would, I would say what whatever he's doing you can't do like you have to understand that different."
Kanye,people have different amounts of energy.
Interviewer,"They have you have this ability to to have these, like, really all encompassing thoughts where you have."
Kanye,these long trains of ideas and thoughts in your head and you're implementing them. This is all good.
Interviewer,This is this is a powerful thing.
Kanye,And I don't think it's a negative thing at all.
Interviewer,"I mean, some of it comes to, you know, I'm dealing with issues that are not just, you know, black and."
Kanye,"racial issues. I'm dealing with maverick, you know, innovator issues."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Kanye,"I'm dealing with, you know, just as many, uh, you know, issues where there's walls of, you know."
Interviewer,invisible walls and invisible chains.
Kanye,"As you know, Michael Jackson dealt with as a black musician or urban musician where he had to go."
Interviewer,And I'm urban. And he came with Thriller.
Kanye,"He's like, oh, let me go get this person to direct it, which is an easy way to get a movie director. And he."
Interviewer,"change, you know, movies forever."
Kanye,"I'm dealing with some some walls that, you know, people have done to hold back agents of change."
Interviewer,throughout history.
Kanye,"You know, it's like the movie is here, like this part, you know, us talking right now may be a scene from."
Interviewer,"my life's movie, like Tesla was."
Kanye,"You know, a white guy that was a ladies man and he would be going to all the fancy events and."
Interviewer,"everything, and he stopped having sex at age 40 and said, you know, I'm going to focus on it."
Kanye,"And and I mean, he died. He died penniless at the end."
Interviewer,"You know, I'm not going to say like he turned evil, but he's trying to sell a bomb. And he had all these."
Kanye,"like, answers. That would change the Kocherga society, and my best example is like codecs is there in."
Interviewer,"a place where they can barely pull it together now, but they invented the digital camera and they didn't."
Kanye,bring it to market because.
Interviewer,Because.
Kanye,"They had all this film to sell or one of the things is really, you know, that's a challenge for me is, you."
Interviewer,"know, I, I, I designed this thing, this we call it the phone runner, and we built a factory for it and code."
Kanye,"And you can make these in 25 minutes. And what I'm saying about design, I was talking to one of the."
Interviewer,just awesome designers that we just got over.
Kanye,"We got like this. Amazing crew, we got guys that Nike sued us for and one of these guys, I was trying."
Interviewer,"to hire him for two years, he had to we had an he had to go surf for a year."
Kanye,"And Isaan and when he, like, you know, does is as a cad drawings, it's almost like one shot, one kill."
Interviewer,"You know, sometimes you design stuff, you got to do it like five, eight times. Like his first one is so."
Kanye,close to being ready to go to market because he sketches in a certain kind of way.
Interviewer,"And for the longest we said, you know, let's I'm not saying I want to get rid of laces and we still have."
Kanye,shoes.
Interviewer,We sell with laces because this is a popular shoe and people love this shoe.
Kanye,"And it it hurts me. I feel like Steve Jobs trying to, like, remove buttons off the side of the next apple."
Interviewer,"And one of the things that's interesting about this, if you look at most sneakers, if you look at you."
Kanye,"guys sneakers right now, you have a tongue, you know, and it it goes this direction."
Interviewer,This is one of the innovations about this is one reason why this is one of the most important sneaker.
Kanye,"designs, is this goes this way because it's ergonomic."
Interviewer,And I remember putting it on and being uncomfortable with wearing it because I'm so used to like the.
Kanye,way like a Jordan or something fits with my jeans that I remember talking to Kobe and I'm talking.
Interviewer,about having to make sneakers that fit with jeans.
Kanye,"And that was a big thing because, you know, that's what we grow up."
Interviewer,"We go where, you know, cock and eye jeans and Jordans or something like that."
Kanye,"So this also I feel that just the process when I design, I become like a three year old. I have to go to."
Interviewer,my gut. I have to forget everything I know and really focus in to what I feel like some straight Jedi.
Kanye,"Yoda or like, you know, if I grab that water bottle, like, I would have been cool if I just did it right now."
Interviewer,"I should add a magnet on there that you like. Yeah. Oh, this is a wizard."
Kanye,"So, so, so for me, you know, I, I'm going to make this to be twenty dollars and, you know, money isn't."
Interviewer,"real, so that means the world should be eventually free."
Kanye,So I'm going to manifest the world being free.
Interviewer,"My dad, he lives in a diary. He says, you know, anything that you put in the ground grows. So why do."
Kanye,"people still go hungry? And I like that in theory, but I was like, man, farming is really hard, though, man."
Interviewer,"I think, you know, I might go hungry if I have someone to farm this food."
Kanye,"It's like but, you know, back in the days we we had that skill set. Now we're losing these skill sets that."
Interviewer,actually we can sustain off of.
Kanye,"So with this and I love give me guys my riff's, I'm like a human version of Instagram."
Interviewer,"When you look at Instagram, you look at, you know, you're looking like a hundred images a day."
Kanye,"Well, I've got millions of images in my mind and the majority of them haven't been realized yet."
Interviewer,"You know, there's some images that are from my memory, but I got this whole the future that's in my."
Kanye,mind that has to be brought.
Interviewer,"So this is you know, we talk about high culture and shoes being sold on the you know, the resale."
Kanye,market.
Interviewer,"And Yeezy lives in that place. But, you know, I don't like the idea. I don't love the idea that some of the."
Kanye,reason why people buy it is just a.
Interviewer,"For hyp culture or you ain't got this or I got this colorway and you don't have it, that type of mentality."
Kanye,"I'm an I'm an Essentialists, I'm a I'm a minimalist."
Interviewer,"And like, I have to I will bring the the fully A to Z our existence version to existence like Victor Gruene."
Kanye,"design the shopping centers, but he designed for utopian communities and people were like, oh, we're."
Interviewer,just cool with the shopping center.
Kanye,"That's all we want. And these ideas that he had never got brought to fruition, a little bit like Disney."
Interviewer,kind of Epcot Center on like on Victor growing. But these. This next frontier of these communities and.
Kanye,villages of happiness are way closer to a Kenyan village than it is to like a gated community village.
Interviewer,"But one of the things about your this aversion to hype culture, one of the good things about the high."
Kanye,"culture is if people get into your products, they're going to get into you and they're going to get into."
Interviewer,your ideas. And all these ideas that you have will become a part of their thought process. They'll start.
Kanye,"thinking about it and they go, hey, he's got some great points."
Interviewer,"If people really get into your shit, they're also really going to get into your ideas. I think that's one of."
Kanye,the things that make people uncomfortable about you because you have the courage to have all these.
Interviewer,bold ideas and to implement them and to do all these different things that bothers people.
Kanye,And there's a lot of people that don't have that kind of courage and they are straddled down by anxiety.
Interviewer,and they see a guy like you and they try to find flaws. They try to find things that are wrong with it.
Kanye,"instead of looking at the positive aspects of it. The only concentrate on the negative aspects of it, I."
Interviewer,don't think I don't see it that way. I never saw it that way. I would look at that guy if I could do.
Kanye,anything.
Interviewer,"There's people like Tesla and there's people who you know, there's a person who killed animals with."
Kanye,"test, of course, to make people not like Tesla."
Interviewer,The person Edison. Yeah.
Kanye,"Person who made the electric chair be made with the test, of course, so people wouldn't like Tesla."
Interviewer,Tesla still has inventions that haven't been brought to our society that would have brought more.
Kanye,"simplicity and happiness to our society, like the Westinghouse ability to transmit electricity through."
Interviewer,"the air, which is fascinating."
Kanye,I don't know if that would have worked in today's world with cell phones and all the different.
Interviewer,"electronics and even, you know, modern air travel. I don't know."
Kanye,"I don't know what it would have worked, but things would have been different."
Interviewer,People are over designing into industries where they see they can make some money as opposed to.
Kanye,"stepping back and saying, how do we look at the entire Earth as an opportunity to free everyone and."
Interviewer,create happiness for for everyone.
Kanye,"So, like only there's only a billion people on the Internet. You never think about that, the seven or eight."
Interviewer,"billion people on on Earth, but then there's only a billion people that are influence and that are on the."
Kanye,Internet.
Interviewer,"We feel like the Internet is everything is only like 15, you know, 18 percent of human beings."
Kanye,"But in order to make it possible for us to survive, we have to make more human beings. We have we."
Interviewer,have family. We have we have to have food. We have to have shelter that we don't have to have the.
Kanye,"Internet. We don't have to have music. We don't have to have. You know, that's a conversation."
Interviewer,"I mean I mean, it enhances life."
Kanye,"Yeah, it enhances the quality of life is better. But look at the music. Look look at look at the."
Interviewer,information.
Kanye,We're we're we're we're putting in it like I feel bad when I hear rap songs. I feel bad.
Interviewer,"Even the stuff that, you know, I just recently put out, I was like, you know, how you listen to labels?"
Kanye,They The Imitation Man.
Interviewer,"Like, why is that's just I don't like that message because we're all the imitation of our parents in."
Kanye,imitation of this imitation and then imitation of Adam and Eve.
Interviewer,"You know, we're we're we're all the next versions."
Kanye,"It should be the V to V three, like, you know, Michelangelo and Da Vinci had the same teacher."
Interviewer,"You know, there's times where, you know, my like, people who work with me or say like my mentees or."
Kanye,whatever who go out and they'll do something that I wanted to do. And then I'm I'm torn because as a.
Interviewer,"man, you know, I'm I'm I'm jealous and I'm proud at the same time."
Kanye,"And it's like a father son relationship, because sometimes when when the sun goes out and is more."
Interviewer,"successful at things the father wants to say, that's a good job."
Kanye,"But every time the son does something, does a good job, he reminds the father of his failures. Yes."
Interviewer,"So it was just I mean, it's it's a it's a it's a strong dynamic that that's where I have to lean on God to not."
Kanye,"be like, you know, this just like a prick that's jealous of, you know, people who are innovating or taking."
Interviewer,"you know, the goal line, because we got to realize we're in a relay race of humanity at a certain point."
Kanye,whoever.
Interviewer,"You know what what the inventors and the in the past, it is now handed over to the inventors. Today."
Kanye,they hand it over to the next inventors.
Interviewer,The good thing about the walls and the perception and all that is this like smaller barrier to entry.
Kanye,"allows there to be, you know, a Walt Disney and a Steve Jobs and a Henry Ford."
Interviewer,"So what I'm doing right now, there's a there's a there's a real barrier to entry to do into constructing."
Kanye,homes and communities and farm.
Interviewer,"Like, you can't you can't just do it, like how you can just, you know, it's hard for someone to go from."
Kanye,"I'm not saying it can't happen. I'm just saying that is difficult for someone to go from, you know."
Interviewer,programming and putting their music on the Internet today to what it was that Michael Jackson had.
Kanye,to do.
Interviewer,That very entry was so hard for him.
Kanye,"I mean, since this guy was the leader of the Jackson five when he was five, like his entire life led up."
Interviewer,And this is what he focused on. And it made and it was all focus on that. So it made the great Michael.
Kanye,Jackson.
Interviewer,"Now, I want to do this comparison to Disney, Steve and Henry Ford and what is."
Kanye,"It's really hard to make houses, it's it's like a corrupt industry also. You got control. How many times."
Interviewer,have you started in a house and are contractors like start overcharging for stuff?
Kanye,And the budget ends up being twice the amount and it's twice as long.
Interviewer,"Look, if you had a relationship, this is why relationships are better currency than than the money."
Kanye,"If you had a relationship with the contractors, if you were part of their family, your house would be."
Interviewer,done quick.
Kanye,I feel like it's a practical joke on rich people. How long houses take to Bill? I was in the airport and.
Interviewer,there was a first class line that was super slow and there was a coach area with like eight openings.
Kanye,and there was no one in it. And then I hopped out and as other gentleman hopped out with me and.
Interviewer,went to that line and we went through.
Kanye,But the rich people with the Irma's belts didn't want to lose their position so bad that they would rather.
Interviewer,"wait in the first class line than to have the time back and go to that. Now, this gentleman is a surgeon."
Kanye,"that works on people's hearts, do their feet."
Interviewer,"So it's like that kind of engineer's surgeon doctor mentality is like, yeah, I got money because this this."
Kanye,is what I'm doing. But I'm here to serve. And I have a mentality that I'm not better than the person.
Interviewer,"that's in coach, which is the reason why we were the only two that went through that. How do you."
Kanye,segway off of this one? I just go into this.
Interviewer,I even find a question.
Kanye,"What do you think it over there? Oh, no, there's no love in this. Yeah, there's no reason to worry about."
Interviewer,it.
Kanye,Yeah. You have this.
Interviewer,"Do you have a rigid process that you organize your day with? Like, how do you you seem to have so."
Kanye,many different thoughts and so many different things going on simultaneously.
Interviewer,"Like how do you how do you organize your day? Do you have, like, ritual, do you have. Yeah, I drive my."
Kanye,"children to school, I drive my kids to school and I stay at school with them all day."
Interviewer,"And, you know, I'm in the kitchen, like working with the top chefs on the planet to create this, you."
Kanye,"know, these healthy menus."
Interviewer,And I'm working with the farmers.
Kanye,"So the school that I'm at is also it's like this new. I don't want no disrespect, and as I was going to say."
Interviewer,"new NASA, but of humanity, that we're anchoring it around our children. So that's what my day."
Kanye,consists of.
Interviewer,"But then I also, in the past couple months, have been going to Atlanta for two days a week or three."
Kanye,days a week because I'm building this 120000.
Interviewer,"Oh, I'm not supposed to say that."
Kanye,I'm building we're building a soundstage.
Interviewer,But and but it was funny because I go back and forth on content. Should I work in content? Should I.
Kanye,"work in tech? I have all these like website ideas and tech ideas. And sometimes I was like, I'll say I'm."
Interviewer,curse by tech.
Kanye,"Like, I'm not you know, I don't have any curses or God has led to me break the curse and break the."
Interviewer,chains.
Kanye,"I'd rather say I, I don't know if content is my calling, like messaging."
Interviewer,Like let me show you what a school of the future looks like. Let me show you monastery's of the.
Kanye,"future. Let me show farms the future looks like. But we're 20 years past the future, like it's in 2020, like."
Interviewer,we're supposed to be in the future by 2000.
Kanye,So it's my job to pull the future into now.
Interviewer,"And that's something I struggle with when I talk about the different things that I'm doing, getting into."
Kanye,"the idea of doing like content for Netflix or content for Hulu and like what that content, because I."
Interviewer,believe we're in the movie.
Kanye,I believe we're in the game. We're in like Grand Theft Auto was just too many things that align. And.
Interviewer,we're not we can terraform.
Kanye,"What we can do is be like if you're Grand Theft Auto character just started redesigning the world, his."
Interviewer,"self, like painting his own, his own world."
Kanye,We have this opportunity to make life as fun as the second life.
Interviewer,"But if you look at how politics, just general unhappiness, misery, control the speed that contractors."
Kanye,"go, the farmers that wouldn't finish the farm the way we are with each other is why people feel like."
Interviewer,"look, everyone's going to go into like this ready player one second life."
Kanye,And I believe that our first life can be just as imaginative and it will be.
Interviewer,So that's my and I have a bunch of friends that work in the gaming industry and I have friends that.
Kanye,work in the content industry.
Interviewer,"And I'm saying I'm anchoring on real life to make real life as awesome as games, to make real life, as."
Kanye,awesome as movies.
Interviewer,So did I answer the question of my schedule every day?
Kanye,"Yeah, but I mean, you so you just basically go on what you feel like working on. You basically just start."
Interviewer,"your day, you do your stuff with your kids and then whatever these ideas you have, you just nourish."
Kanye,them. You just encourage them. You just you just feed whatever thoughts are in your head.
Interviewer,"Well, yeah, but what I was expressing on that on that last symphony I gave you was this was."
Kanye,"That I do have this challenge, that's where I'm designing I'm I'm actually designing what I'm doing with."
Interviewer,my time saying. Should I be even taking a meeting like when I take a meeting? I know if is a good or.
Kanye,"bad meeting, if someone's talking to me and I just get sleepy, I know that that's not what I should do."
Interviewer,"But if someone's talking, you know, energize."
Kanye,I like saying the word energize over the word excited because this is what they do to this is what they.
Interviewer,"do to all of us to get us excited, excited and anxiety, kind of go together like someone to say, hey, I got."
Kanye,"you a new car and it's across the street and you get so excited, you run across the street, get hit by a."
Interviewer,"car, trying to run to your new."
Kanye,"But if you're energized about having the car, perhaps you look both ways."
Interviewer,"I play this dictionary game with the like this this small Webster pocket dictionary, and we'll go to a."
Kanye,"page and say, go to page with the word help on it. And we say highlight all the words you think are."
Interviewer,"positive. And then we talk about afterwards, why do you think that's positive?"
Kanye,So the word help is like it's like it's like a bad leg on a table.
Interviewer,"You think you could stand on it, but if you stand right there, that table could flip over."
Kanye,"The fourth definition in the word help is to ignore. And it actually makes sense, you know, all like if you."
Interviewer,have a meeting.
Kanye,"Right. Here's the answer. When, you know, the meeting didn't do good, didn't go well, the person says."
Interviewer,"it, then, oh, how can I help?"
Kanye,That means they don't want to do nothing. They're just give you a phone number.
Interviewer,"Right. You know, the word is to ensure and then there's a lot of words."
Kanye,And would you agree that a very powerful future. Sure.
Interviewer,"Pure endure and that goes into like the right, because I'm literally trying to figure out the video game."
Kanye,at all times and see where these things parallel.
Interviewer,"I know this can get into like a riff for people like, OK, yeah, you're losing what you're saying right now."
Kanye,But but look at that. Look at the dictionary. Look at these words. I have friends that English is their.
Interviewer,second or third or eighth language.
Kanye,And they say that English is the hardest language to learn because there's so many words to that.
Interviewer,mean the same thing.
Kanye,It like it tears me to my core that my daughter has to learn to swallow the difference between NATO.
Interviewer,and Teoh.
Kanye,I want to just be like just draw the number two. I just make it like I sometimes I don't know when you.
Interviewer,know the difference. I'm like a terrible speller. And I believe that there's like curriculums that are that.
Kanye,are European curriculums that don't even apply to our genes.
Interviewer,"You know, who we are as a people like African descent people. We don't even talk like that. Like this is."
Kanye,a skill set.
Interviewer,"But I'm still talking white, basically, like you'll see like a black pastor, you know, give this amazing, like."
Kanye,"sermon or like Mary, someone I was at a wedding. And this guy, they said, wow, he speaks so well."
Interviewer,"What do you mean? Well, he speaks super white, like went."
Kanye,"Yeah, that's what the definition of. Well, right. Right. It just sounds that you use and to communicate."
Interviewer,"ideas. Right. Well, that's funny."
Kanye,I bumped into a friend of mine. I actually Matt Williams is that juvenilia. I wasn't expecting to see.
Interviewer,"I wasn't expecting I mean, expecting to see him."
Kanye,I wasn't expecting to see him. And we're at the Mercer lobby. And he caught me off guard and I was.
Interviewer,"like. I didn't use words when when I when I when I saw them, I like almost communicated in a."
Kanye,"different language, like a language, like joy or happiness."
Interviewer,Only 30 percent of our communication is is verbal.
Kanye,"That's why the mask just really throw me off, because I can't tell what someone is thinking and."
Interviewer,"feeling, because a lot of times people don't say what they're thinking or feeling."
Kanye,Right. And I have to decode it with the mask.
Interviewer,"I can only, you know, hear what they're saying. That's the problem with social media, too, right?"
Kanye,"Yes. Things are black and white and things being taken out of context. I mean, that's a reason why."
Interviewer,"people like, you know, love the show, that they're like, oh, we got the yay Joe Rogan."
Kanye,We can hear him going to all of these riffs. Yeah. And we can feel him.
Interviewer,"You could see, you know, how I'm looking. You can see my energy and the way I'm saying it to so and."
Kanye,and you see people sitting down having an actual conversation.
Interviewer,A real conversation. Yeah.
Kanye,"And a conversation where anybody that comes on this show, you don't have like this like sometimes."
Interviewer,"with reporters they have like people, they're media. They have like a complex. You don't have a."
Kanye,complex.
Interviewer,"You'd like your let's first off to get this straight, like if I like, I could whip your ass. I'm Joe Rogan."
Kanye,"I'm a professional fighter. Now, let's start the conversation, which I think is another reason. Like what?"
Interviewer,"Nick Cannon. He's like, man, I married Mariah Carey. I did all these."
Kanye,And both of these interviews have been very positive because people aren't carrying something.
Interviewer,"already, like some form a chip on their shoulder where they got to like every sentence."
Kanye,Sometimes I talk to reporters.
Interviewer,It's like they're saying the thing they wanted to say to this guy in high school that they never got to.
Kanye,complete the conversation and they're taking it out on me.
Interviewer,"I'm like, yeah, I think there's a lot of people that have conversations with people and they want to."
Kanye,"create a viral moment, too, that it's not just a conversation. They have an agenda. It's it's almost like."
Interviewer,"you were talking about the Disney Star Wars movies, that then it's not a work of art. It's it's a formula."
Kanye,like two plus two is four. Let's put those together. We'll make some money instead of the original Star.
Interviewer,"Wars, which was the hero's journey, which was like a Joseph Campbell book."
Kanye,It's like there was a beauty and a purity to it. It's a it's an expression like someone comes up with an.
Interviewer,"idea and they bring it to fruition and then you get to watch and you're like, wow, it moves you. The new."
Kanye,movies don't move you.
Interviewer,And it was a crew of of of leaders of thought leaders that like I was as a Brian De Palma that told.
Kanye,"George to put the words at the beginning, because it's like you really I've been feeling like it's like when."
Interviewer,"I talk up to this point I just been making, you know, and then the toys from Star Wars have now come."
Kanye,"out first, which would be like, you know, like the Jeezy's or something like that."
Interviewer,And now it's making the whole Star Wars in real life like backwards.
Kanye,"Like the product came first, kind of like Disney, like Disney."
Interviewer,He was Mickey Mouse became super popular before he was able to get all of his Imagineer Imagineer.
Kanye,is in.
Interviewer,"I want to point out, you know, when people talk about being, you know, self-absorbed or the center of."
Kanye,"your own universe, what's the main character in Star Wars name?"
Interviewer,"Luke Skywalker, who created Star Wars, George Lucas. But did he write it, but listen to that last name."
Kanye,"Yeah, that's yeah. George Luke. Yes. Yeah."
Interviewer,He's the main character in Star Wars. He gets disaster.
Kanye,And it was awesome.
Interviewer,Yeah. There's there's something about things that are pure. Right.
Kanye,Versus things that are attempting to recreate something that people are going to like. There's a.
Interviewer,difference. And it's in music as well. Right. Like your music resonates with people because it's.
Kanye,"obviously coming from your mind, whereas some people are creating songs that they think are going."
Interviewer,to be hits.
Kanye,They're creating top 40. It's coming from my heart and my gut.
Interviewer,"But when it's the most pure, it's coming from God."
Kanye,And I'm being used as a channel.
Interviewer,"It's like when Tonya Harding hit the triple flip, you know, she had all that skill."
Kanye,"And then at some point it's that Calatrava's, because I'm about to say triple triple Lindy, like is Rodney."
Interviewer,Rodney Dangerfield.
Kanye,But it's like there's these moments where we do things that are seem like superhero level. And I think.
Interviewer,that's what M. Night Chalamont was laying out for us with unbreakable glass.
Kanye,"And what was the other one with the guy with the multiple personalities, just like he's got three of."
Interviewer,"these films that are like showing us, hey, you're superheroes, you can believe it."
Kanye,"The greatest disabler of our of our abilities, our greatest our greatest kryptonite is dout. Right? You."
Interviewer,"know, fear. Yeah, doubt."
Kanye,"Like, why did I, you know."
Interviewer,Like going to why did I register so late to run for president covid like I remember like I had I had the.
Kanye,"virus and I was sitting, you know, quarantined in my house and my cousin text me about being."
Interviewer,prepared to run for president.
Kanye,"And I just completely, like, put it off to the side because I was, like, shivering and, you know, having the."
Interviewer,"shakes, taking hot showers and eating soup and, you know, just like have it."
Kanye,"I don't think it was that bad. I think it was a mild case and it just threw off I mean, threw everyone off."
Interviewer,"It threw everybody's plans off. And then, you know, it was just a calling on my heart."
Kanye,"And I remember talking to, like, really like elitist, you know, writers."
Interviewer,"You know, I was trying to avoid saying a white supremacist, but like elite, like the liberal elites are like."
Kanye,"You know, so, boy, who are you going to vote, you know, like who are you to run for office and why."
Interviewer,would you sign up for office?
Kanye,"You know, if you if you can't even get on ballots that people are saying that to me and I could get on."
Interviewer,the ballot. It's like there's black mothers that go into to hospital and the doctor will tell them that.
Kanye,there's something wrong with their child to get them to. This is happening to this date. And then when.
Interviewer,"people say, you know, are you a are you a pawn like for the Republicans? The reason why I think that."
Kanye,"people are asking me that is because because the Democrats do create black pawns, they do have."
Interviewer,"celebrities that they'll sit down and meet with and say, you're going to be an advocate for the."
Kanye,Democratic Party.
Interviewer,"And, you know, everyone's like, you know, and I'm not trying to take any sides of like Republicans or."
Kanye,Democrats.
Interviewer,"I'm just saying, why were why were people so much thinking that I was like a form of a pawn?"
Kanye,"And then the idea that, you know, liberals who say, like, the funny thing is liberals, I think and I'm I don't."
Interviewer,"know if I could classify myself as liberal, but I'm definitely kind of liberal elite."
Kanye,"I wrote my beautiful, dark, Twisted Fantasy like I've had some of the best writing."
Interviewer,"So that would put me in that class, so to say."
Kanye,"But I'm also just a purist, like I see a Kenyan home and be like, that's beautiful right there. I'm not like I."
Interviewer,got to have the.
Kanye,So the one of the most racist things that liberals who pride themselves on not being racist have said.
Interviewer,to me is like you're going to split the black vote. And that makes it seem like. Black people can't make.
Kanye,decisions for ourselves and that don't know white people know me like I'm only like only deliberately.
Interviewer,"literally make it seem like only black people will vote for me. Right. Think about that statement, the the."
Kanye,"nuance of institutionalized racism. And this would be like somebody from the art world, you know?"
Interviewer,"I mean, they just have a place where no one has really been able to embrace the idea of blacks not."
Kanye,being in a block and staying in one place for blacks out to vote Democrat.
Interviewer,"Yeah, blacks have an opinion like us not being on boards or us being like handlers for other black."
Kanye,people.
Interviewer,"Meaning like if we work at a label, we work at a big corporation, it's our job to go talk to the other."
Kanye,"black people, you know, to calm other black people down."
Interviewer,"But we're working for, you know, Universal or Vivendi or whatever the organization is where, you know."
Kanye,I was thinking about buying my masters and I realized that that was too small of a thought.
Interviewer,"I'm going to buy Universal. Are only a three billion dollar organization, I'm one of the greatest product."
Kanye,producers that ever existed. I'm and I'm a child.
Interviewer,I'm 43 years old.

Interviewer,"Michael Jordan of products. I went to Adidas and we were 15 billion dollar organization, losing two."
Kanye,billion before covid hit our market cap of 68 billion. I went to the Gap and our partner with the Gap and.
Interviewer,our stock jumped 45 percent in two hours. The organization made two billion dollars and two out in.
Kanye,two hours. And now we've double.
Interviewer,"I mean, the gap was Markopoulos lower than it was like three billion dollars. When when when I first."
Kanye,"got there. Now it's like seven, eight billion dollars. And we haven't even released a product yet. But."
Interviewer,"what I loved, I you know, I sat there and I did the deal without getting on the board."
Kanye,And I looked at my cousin and I and I didn't want to sign the deal without being on the board. And I.
Interviewer,"looked down and said, I'm doing this for you. Meaning like, this is part of a relay race. It would just be."
Kanye,"a given that if someone of color was to your position, my position of influence will be on the board."
Interviewer,But Michael Jordan had to break down walls and Michael Jackson had to break down walls for us to.
Kanye,break down the next walls.
Interviewer,"And the next walls are the boardroom, because you know what the boardroom is. It's an opinion. See."
Kanye,"people are fine for us to play basketball and, you know, rap and make clothes, but."
Interviewer,Society as a setup is not really used to are fine with us actually having an opinion and I can.
Kanye,"understand why, because what is our opinion based on if we grew up thinking we were slaves or if our."
Interviewer,"opinion isn't based on, hey, my dad taught me how to run this company, you know, my dad is smarter."
Kanye,"than me and everything he wanted to do, black people thought he was crazy and he had to do it with."
Interviewer,white people who thought he was incompetent because he was black.
Kanye,"And the way these companies and the way the music industry, the way managers and the way society."
Interviewer,generally looks at black people is the way like a misogynistic man looks at a hot lady. Hmm. What can.
Kanye,you give me? What can you do for me? No one misogynistic man. I can look at a hot lady and say. Can.
Interviewer,"you run my company? So, you know, this idea of me, you know, and I got like, you know, I'm building."
Kanye,"my factories, I've simplified the design and I was working with a guy that, you know, that's helping me."
Interviewer,"to, you know, build some of the factories."
Kanye," was an older white gentleman and he just matter of factly says, we're sitting at his house in Malibu."
Interviewer,"'s a nice day. As a matter of fact, he says Adidas will never put you on the board."
Kanye,"d I'm like this this wall has to come down like, how could you not have the guy that has the best."
Interviewer,idea?
Kanye," one of the great things with Universal, one of the approaches that we have is, you know, universal."
Interviewer,en Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre sold Beats by Dre Universal had a chance to buy in to do different.
Kanye,things. They sold it for three billion dollars.
Interviewer,"That was half of the value of Universal at the time of six billion due to the Internet, which the music."
Kanye,industry was afraid of in 2000. Universal.
Interviewer,"Now, I think is worth thirty three, thirty five billion dollars, and now they have another Steve Jobs, you."
Kanye,"know, Howard Hughes, Henry Ford, Disney, Elon kind of character within their midst."
Interviewer,But they're so concerned about the control of the idea of artists because they're using me as like this.
Kanye,artist that has attracted other artists.
Interviewer,"Also, I use them."
Kanye,"I got famous, I made some money. I got to tour, you know, I became this superstar. So we use each."
Interviewer,"other. Now, is it just an adjustment that needs to be made in the relationship?"
Kanye,"And I can make and I will make products that. Will make more money than Universal is worth, but it's."
Interviewer,"not about the money, as I said earlier, it's about the fact that even though my net worth is five billion."
Kanye,"dollars and I'm one of the most famous, most influential God-Fearing Christians on the planet, the."
Interviewer,"I still have to go to this man or this organization and ask him for something, and that is what it's."
Kanye,"about, you can have a company right, when you go into your company, don't think because you got the."
Interviewer,most ownership that you actually have the control.
Kanye,If you don't have the information and the knowledge of how the distribution works and you're not.
Interviewer,"having that conversation, you don't have the control. So what I did in my organization with Universal."
Kanye,"with Gap and with Adidas, I told my lawyers, my managers everything."
Interviewer,No one could communicate with these organizations except for me.
Kanye,"You can give me advice, but they got to talk to the boss, which is me."
Interviewer,"And right there, you start to get the information flow, I guess."
Kanye,Who's my CFO?
Interviewer,"Who, me? So that means I do have the time I do this 10 to 15 transactions, what I do is I pay because I."
Kanye,"had open credit cards, I had checks, you know, I had people flying in and out. I had a consultant."
Interviewer,"agreements like people who weren't on the salary, but they were consultors."
Kanye,"I had, you know, people paying for flights, hotels, cars, food, Netflix, like everything, just running the."
Interviewer,account.
Kanye,"Just even right now, I cancel all my credit cards except for one credit card."
Interviewer,"This is like the Oprah Winfrey moment where she's like, man, when I started spending cash, I was like."
Kanye,"I really realize, you know, how much I was spending."
Interviewer,And I've signed all my own checks. And I think that happens in the music industry is just a lot of.
Kanye,"industries that people tell you that someone needs to do something for you. And it's like, look this."
Interviewer,"Siiri, do everything you know you can do. It's possible."
Kanye,"And it's just when you ask me, how do I delegate my time, it's important for me to delegate my time. If."
Interviewer,I made 210 million dollars last year.
Kanye,"Yeah, I have a lot of maverick ideas. I'm working on cities and homeless shelters and farms and I'm."
Interviewer,reinventing myself.
Kanye,"So a lot of mavericks will, you know, spend their money on their ideas and they'll invest in what they."
Interviewer,see the future is. And I ended up with a net worth of ten million.
Kanye,"I remember, you know, a few a month ago, people were like, you can't show your taxes because."
Interviewer,people won't understand that you're a billionaire if they see that you only needed ten million last year.
Kanye,"And after the Gap deal happened, my net worth went from three point three billion to five billion. And."
Interviewer,I've been asking the people around me to run the story and they were going to run it with Bloomberg.
Kanye,They never ran it. I was not afraid of people looking at me like I was not a billionaire.
Interviewer,"And I said, be honest, show my taxes, show everything."
Kanye,"And then the reports came back, oh, you're worth five billion."
Interviewer,It came from me just being honest when I want to say something about the Gap deal also and.
Kanye,"specifically the name The Gap in my my journey with that, like at age six, I worked at The Gap."
Interviewer,"I always saw the gap as like being the apple of apparel, always had this comparison with Seijas."
Kanye,I always felt like I was the Steve Jobs of the Gap.
Interviewer,"If somehow how clean it was and what Mickey Drexler done all these commercials and like, you know."
Kanye,"at age 16, I was working at The Gap and I got fired for stealing and I was actually still in khakis."
Interviewer,I was still in khakis from my friend. Funny thing.
Kanye,"Look, I stole khakis from my friend when I started doing music at age 98."
Interviewer,"I went and bought a chain. I came home one day, didn't see what the chain was, come to find out my."
Kanye,friend was smoking crack and it stole my chain. So the guy I was stealing for enough stealing from.
Interviewer,me.
Kanye,"But his khakis, I was still in some gap khakis. I wanted those khakis that bad. So then 27 years later."
Interviewer,"you know, I give my life to God and I start doing Sunday service."
Kanye,One of the things that I had to do for Sunday service I got to do that was fun for me to do was to.
Interviewer,design the wardrobe for Sunday service and we would redesign t shirts. And it says in the Bible that.
Kanye,Jesus wore seamless garment.
Interviewer,So we started building T-shirts with a seam was only here are only two seams on the shirt or moving it.
Kanye,around and what the neck was. And I made t shirt after t shirt after t shirt and cristiana we say we.
Interviewer,stand in the gap.
Kanye,"So watch this. This opportunity is presented, and I always had clothes that were kind of chill like they."
Interviewer,"could be at the Gap, they were not overly fashionable."
Kanye,"And God said, you you you stood in the gap. And I'm how you stand in a gap for real, and I'm going to."
Interviewer,"give you favor and increase, and I know some person, I know somebody with all that design and Tshirts who come in handy, I literally was designing T-shirts for Sunday service, like David working out."
Kanye,"in the field, tending to the field. You know, when Goliath came, they wanted one of his brothers in the."
Interviewer,Warriors to to go up against Goliath and his father chose David and David.
Kanye,I don't need all this armor. I just need these three smooth stones.
Interviewer,"I just need you know, this is how I got to see. They didn't know David had had to fight a lion and had to."
Kanye,"fight a bear. So God, by him tending to the feel and humility and in service to God and honor to his."
Interviewer,"family, he was able to have the skill set to take down Goliath. We hit the street. You know, it's a term."
Kanye,"that I had to learn Wall Street. We hit the street like you never, ever saw it before."
Interviewer,"I used to be in San Fran, ask people to invest in me. Nobody would invest in me when I went to a."
Kanye,"wedding in San Fran with all these billionaires and investors, angel investors, you should have seen."
Interviewer,"people's faces. They were like, you jump from the three point line. You ran a stock by 45 percent. You."
Kanye,"see, think about this."
Interviewer,You're going to split the black vote. You can't vote for the you you're only a rapper. You want to. It's.
Kanye,"like all these things that diminish me. Yeah. And now it's like Deadpool, like I came back is like a."
Interviewer,superhero. And I won't let that be the kryptonite. I won't let my own ego be my kryptonite. I won't let.
Kanye,other people's opinions be my kryptonite. I won't let these labels that people put on me be my.
Interviewer,kryptonite.
Kanye,"And a lot of times I don't like to watch these interviews back until about, you know, three, four or five."
Interviewer,"years later, because I'm always, you know, I'm visiting the now I'm existing in the future and visiting."
Kanye,the now when I'm speaking to you.
Interviewer,And they make a lot more sense in the future because I can tell you. But he can show you guys a lot of.
Kanye,stuff.
Interviewer,"I'm telling you, some people are following me. Some people are believing in it, and some people are."
Kanye,just doubting it because they want to put this label on.
Interviewer,He's crazy or it's just a black guy saying it or it's just a rapper. It's just a it's just an entertainer. It's just.
Kanye,whatever it is. So I can say the most wild ideas. I last like Veronica Cornerstone wanting to be an.
Interviewer,anchorperson.
Kanye,"And I remember she says, Iran, I told you I wanted to be. He said, yes, I heard you. I wrote it down."
Interviewer,"Veronica Corticosterone had a very funny joke tonight. And every time I talk, it's like Veronica."
Kanye,Cornerstone having a very funny joke tonight.
Interviewer,"Like when I said I was going to run for president, that was like, OK, go ahead. Would you like to."
Kanye,interject? Do you have thoughts and ideas also that you'd like to have be a part of your interview? Well.
Interviewer,you went from what you want from people mad at you.
Kanye,They're splitting the black vote all the way to the gap and all the way to Veronica.
Interviewer,"I mean, but I then I brought it back. Yes, you did."
Kanye,To the vote to run for president back from to people doubting you and people putting limitations on.
Interviewer,you people to tune in on this podcast to go on the journey with us.
Kanye,"Yeah. Doesn't do or they don't. It's up to them. But do you know, the beautiful thing is you're not."
Interviewer,"listening to these people, these people that are trying to put these labels on you and tell you what to."
Kanye,"do and you're not saddled down by fear, you're not saddled down by doubt. You're willing to take."
Interviewer,"these chances. If you did become president, what would you do that was different? I mean, pretty."
Kanye,"much everything I was just looking at the suits last night, I was like, yo, what would you redesign?"
Interviewer,"I don't wear white anymore. They had a white shirt. You know, they had a like a. I just, um, I would I."
Kanye,"would redesign this, I will, and it's I would it's not as if it's not as if it's just win. Right."
Interviewer,"We've got to start with a budget, I feel like, you know, the fact that I went from being in debt. To to."
Kanye,"begin, I don't even like the way he sounds about it, because we think about Steve Jobs, his money is."
Interviewer,like the least of what's awesome about him.
Kanye,"And the money is just a tool. Like it's like nails, like I got the most now feel like it's scored on the."
Interviewer,"scoreboard, though."
Kanye,"It proves it proves not just value, but it proves effectiveness."
Interviewer,Yeah. And it's like you're crazy to you're right. So it proves in some way that a lot of the things I said.
Kanye,they were crazy. I was actually right about. Yeah.
Interviewer,"Looking at that budget. And I think that that's part of God's like training, like Mr. Miyagi. Paint the."
Kanye,"fence, you know, Karate Kid Danielsson. I own that."
Interviewer,I gave like the full description of the of the analogy just in case people didn't.
Kanye,"What do you think you would do, though, if they come to you with talks about foreign policy?"
Interviewer,People love talking about foreign policy. That's the number one question. But when I talk about the.
Kanye,"budget, you know, this paint the fence, the fact that I had to. You know that I have to understand."
Interviewer,Three hundred dollars million of cash a year that you don't get trained for that. That's like astronaut.
Kanye,training that I have to understand how to have multiple industries that I have to understand how to.
Interviewer,"build and house and provide. You know, I provide people with health care."
Kanye,And I could have I had this idea of doing a zero employee org where I put everything on my partners.
Interviewer,"on Universal, on the Gap, on Adidas."
Kanye,But I believe this is amazing training for me as a black person.
Interviewer,"There's people who who have been raised to respect a penny, but as a black person, I've been raised."
Kanye,to look down at a penny.
Interviewer,But the people who really hold their money respect every penny. They respect the money.
Kanye,"And it's interesting, I had an argument with one of my managers because I made my own travel ban."
Interviewer,"and my organization because, you know, I did when I did a Sunday service a month and a half ago, I."
Kanye,was 25 flights coming in of people I didn't know because there's criminals in my organization trying to.
Interviewer,"kill Bob Marley, not to JFK or MLK me, but deplete my resources."
Kanye,"So I created the shovel to explain that what do you mean by that, what I mean by what criminals in."
Interviewer,"your organization like, what do you mean?"
Kanye,"Meaning there's people that, OK, I fired this one CFO. About three months ago and up to a week ago."
Interviewer,he still had an open credit card because I want to dig lower and lower and go to it.
Kanye,"It's like always like, is this the new person that's in charge?"
Interviewer,"Your money is like, no, I'm the new person that's in charge of your money. That's in charge of my."
Kanye,"money, rather. So."
Interviewer,So that's why you became your CFO? That's why I became and it's it's the best and it's it clears my.
Kanye,thoughts and it really helps me with design.
Interviewer,"It helps me as I'm designing designing what I'm doing at the job, helps me when I'm how I'm designing."
Kanye,the curriculum.
Interviewer,"It helps me and the way I'm designing the kitchen, the way I'm delegating, the way I'm working, the."
Kanye,"way I am and being a better leader, being a better being a better listener. But there was some question."
Interviewer,you had. I had I was answered and I gave it all before you went to foreign policies. I went to the the.
Kanye,"budget where I said, it's like Danielsson painting the fence."
Interviewer,The fact that I've had to really look at and understand that kind of money and this God given anointing.
Kanye,"being a producer, being a head of industry, to be a God fearing and God and a servant of God and a."
Interviewer,producer and had an industry at the same time is literally like the perfect combination for a president.
Kanye,"And to be honest, I'm Laeter."
Interviewer,Like every now and then America has to get America deserves the world deserves a leader that they.
Kanye,can 100 percent trust that.
Interviewer,"Whatever I'm saying to you with the information that I have in front of me, I 100 percent believe that."
Kanye,"like when I talk to the when I was with the president of Haiti and he gave us an island, me and Shervon."
Interviewer,"Pushover, that was early angel investor at Uber and is working on the Virgin Hyperloop right now."
Kanye,really great friend of mine.
Interviewer,He saved me. He had me avoid deals where I was going to give up a percentage of my company for a.
Kanye,third of the value and different things like that.
Interviewer,"So we go to Haiti and the president gives us this island to develop, to make a city of the future."
Kanye,"And also we're going to have the farmers and the people who live there take a percentage, I mean."
Interviewer,take ownership of the land that they have right now.
Kanye,"So when it raises in value, they all eat off of what the ideas. But he said that. The way that he has."
Interviewer,"done business with our president is so straightforward, I believe that I know that me as president."
Kanye,would be the best thing that ever happened for America's foreign policy.
Interviewer,"I've traveled more than any president already, and I bring people together. I put rivals on songs."
Kanye,together to create masterpieces.
Interviewer,"I go in, I empathize when I meet with leaders in Africa, when I meet with leaders in, um, I don't really."
Kanye,have a good next thing.
Interviewer,I want it to sound good.
Kanye,And I named my leaders and I wanted to set fire bit that. But when it's the honesty.
Interviewer,"So when I, when I meet with and when I meet with leaders, I'm not trying to go in there and see how."
Kanye,they can use my Internet. I'm not trying to go in there and buy up their land and develop it and buy it.
Interviewer,up for cheap.
Kanye,"You know, we're going to share information."
Interviewer,"You know, we're you know, we have an idea. We just have a dual citizenship for Americans with."
Kanye,African descent that.
Interviewer,"The ability to create environments in communities completely can change the way people act, you."
Kanye,"know, if people are hungry, they're going to act a certain way and people have food, they're going to."
Interviewer,act a certain way.
Kanye,And people are away from their friends and family. They're going to act a certain way. They're going to.
Interviewer,"need to go to college town. They need to stop by this, you know, frat party and, you know, drink and do."
Kanye,"that. But when they're, you know, but you got to go here."
Interviewer,"So then you could go there. And like, society is all about dismantling the family. I see things being."
Kanye,"more like a kibbutz or, you know, where the family can be as close and where the grandparents can be."
Interviewer,next to the children.
Kanye,"And you know, these ideas I have about how communities should be our world wide, simplified ideas."
Interviewer,"and that they're not based on industry, even though I understand industry, they're based on serving."
Kanye,God and serving families.
Interviewer,"And that's something that everyone across the globe, no matter what. Country in the world, whatever."
Kanye,"continent in the world, all of the moms and dads have something in common, they want the world to."
Interviewer,"be better for their children. We all want the world to be better for the children, and we can show ways."
Kanye,that we are not at odds.
Interviewer,"Think about the world as a giant piano, but we're playing off key. So for a producer to synthesize."
Kanye,"those ideas and not say, OK, we're going to shut."
Interviewer,"I spent time in China, I spent a year in China when I was in fifth grade, I used to speak Chinese like."
Kanye,"Nehama Shishani, like, I don't know a lot of yeah."
Interviewer,My mom was an English professor and I had an exchange program where a Chinese student could.
Kanye,"come to America and she could go to which was there was like Chinese at that time, couldn't come to."
Interviewer,"America as as easily so. You know, there's America's greatest export is influence and culture, China."
Kanye,actually has like imitation Paris imitation.
Interviewer,They probably an imitation calabashes at this.
Kanye,They probably do at this point.
Interviewer,"You know, the artists define culture. That's what makes these artists that made the design. The."
Kanye,Statue of Liberty is the artists that designed the Eiffel Tower. This is the reason why I donated one.
Interviewer,hundred million dollars to James Tyrrell's Roden crater project when I went to this is like the eighth.
Kanye,wonder of the world.
Interviewer,"But I saw spaces that we can exist in that would be helpful for our health, our well-being."
Kanye,"These are healthier places for us to be. We need to be like almost like Terralliance, like our our life is."
Interviewer,like a Shakespeareans.
Kanye,Like Shakespeare has written 30 percent of our language that we use.
Interviewer,"Like I say, like he must have been a really nice person, like de Vinci used to walk away from people."
Kanye,when he would talk to people.
Interviewer,"And that's but that's the reason why The Da Vinci Code and at The Da Vinci Life, because he never."
Kanye,was able to get it across to the to the to the level to affect us for generations to come.
Interviewer,"These people love art, but they want to put art in the box."
Kanye,"We need to surround ourselves with the artist because the artists are the the most connected, the."
Interviewer,"most truthful, and their dinosaur never got killed."
Kanye,Somehow the people who have figured out how to make a real a living off of art is what do you mean.
Interviewer,by the dinosaur?
Kanye,"Never killed meaning? Art class will be considered to be fun like every kid loves to draw. Yeah, right."
Interviewer,"But some people got to grow up and like the artists, right. And so we don't have to. Yes. Like this."
Kanye,"We're all children. We're all if you're if you're alive, you're a child. We're all children in God's eyes."
Interviewer,"And we're all young people like Jesus is old, like he's only, you know, like Adam is old."
Kanye,"You know, if you're alive, you're you're young and we're like children."

Interviewer,Sylvester in one of our lead architects I work with since age 24.
Kanye,He built this home in America with with John Paulson. And he has like this golf course where it's the.
Interviewer,acoustics are incredible.
Kanye,"But it's this part where you can walk along that's 20 feet high. And I said, you know, would you you."

Kanye,So let's talk about like real presidential issues. Let's talk about here's here's some things that just.
Interviewer,"when we talk about this country, here's some things that are that mean a lot to me. One student debt."
Kanye,"I think it's crazy. I think it's crazy that we take children when they're 17, 18 years old. We sent them."
Interviewer,away to college. We make them literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. And then we ask.
Kanye,them to go out into the world and try to manage this money and try to get a job that's going to pay.
Interviewer,them a fraction of what they owe for their education.
Kanye,I think it's crazy. I think we should figure out a way to absolve student debt. I think we should figure.
Interviewer,"out a way to make education, at the very least, far less expensive than it is now. This is this is a big."
Kanye,issue for people.
Interviewer,"I'm I'm completely confident that I will figure out how to get America out of debt, that I have the ability."

Kanye,dream of coming to them.
Interviewer,"They're coming to America like it's the America that I grew up even with, like when Ronald Reagan."
Kanye,was in office. It's like he was hanging out with Michael Jackson.
Interviewer,"And, you know, it's like it felt a plus of the way the media show things like the American dream was."
Kanye,alive and well and even at the same time.
Interviewer,"And the ghetto, it was a living hell."
Kanye,"And we were being, you know, given, you know, bricks were put on the street, bricks are put on the."
Interviewer,street during the riots.
Kanye,Now bricks are put on the street in a these different kind of brick. And there were guns plays and the.
Interviewer,fathers were being taken out of the hood. And this is all this.
Kanye,"So don't let me say, like everything was perfect doing that during that era."
Interviewer,"But the perception right now, perception is more important than it's ever than it's ever been. Like what."
Kanye,"we show, you know, it's just I mean, it's outright."
Interviewer,It's just I don't even want to I don't want to I don't want anyone to dwell on it. Let's keep going into.
Kanye,"what you're saying about the debt, because also I don't have like if you ask me about covid, I can only."
Interviewer,give you my perspective as a civilian.
Kanye,"I don't I'm not talking to these the same people, you know, and also in power, the geniuses I was."
Interviewer,"talking to, my man Fred and my boy Anthony about crypto and bitcoin, you know, the yesterday just to."
Kanye,"be prepped for this conversation and not about the specifics of alternate currencies, which is like AC."
Interviewer,"which is like Tesla, which but the the that my mind just goes on."
Kanye,He's like Riff's right here.
Interviewer,But Jack Dorsey decentralized Twitter two months before it really hit because he was talking to the.
Kanye,Bitcoin guys. And these are guys that really have a perspective on what the true liberation of America.
Interviewer,and humanity will be.
Kanye,"These guys, a lot of that, the specific that he's got. But a lot of the tech guys were able to use the new."
Interviewer,"highways, the new information highways and create the next frontier of our existence. Wow."
Kanye,"The powers of our political system are still anchoring on Electoral College, which was based around."
Interviewer,"slavery, about the idea of slaves being three fifths of man."
Kanye,"And get this. It wasn't even created by pro slaves, three fifths of man was created by the anti slaves in."
Interviewer,"the north as a compromise, and that basically explains the existence of black people in America to."
Kanye,this day. The people that were on our side supposedly said we were three fifths of men. Hmm. The.
Interviewer,"people that were on our side, the people on our side thought of us as three fifths of man, meaning like."
Kanye,"yeah, come work for us."
Interviewer,"But, you know, your three fifths of men sitting have Electoral College and gerrymandering happening."
Kanye,"to this date, where if you have Latinos, blacks, other minorities, they're redrawing the lines to affect."
Interviewer,the vote to this day. That does not relate to the information highway that we live in today that allow all.
Kanye,"these, you know, tech guys to become multibillionaires and lead and and and lead free thought or."
Interviewer,"allow, you know, as best as we could a version of free thought."
Kanye,"And I gave you a symphony, but you see how all this really connects. We're sticking. You know, why."
Interviewer,"don't we just keep why are we when we put the white wigs back on, they still wear the white wigs out."
Kanye,"Yeah. England, they still wear, you know, that's the whole thing."
Interviewer,"Just because, you know, someone's not, you know, wearing a KKK uniform or a white wig doesn't."
Kanye,"mean that they aren't holding on to the very core of the country being, you know, based on and built."
Interviewer,off of slavery.
Kanye,"So when everyone's saying vote in, that's the reason why my Merce's vote, Kanye, because, like. Vote."
Interviewer,"for who? Look, man, if you ain't going to say who you vote, no, I don't even wear the vote t shirt. That's."
Kanye,"so random, right? That's so right. And we have these no vote is like Democrat. And because there's."
Interviewer,nobody is the Trump that's like where's the vote T-shirt? Isn't that funny? It's such.
Kanye,"Well, go ahead. Did you say that? Yeah."
Interviewer,You say vote is mostly vote Democrat.
Kanye,"And if you have an American flag, mostly you're voting Trump like these are these are realities that."
Interviewer,we've sort of accepted and it's subs.
Kanye,It's all the subliminal stuff that's that's based on like fear and control. Even like this. Like this. Look at.
Interviewer,"this. The whole this is the three fifths of man thing. Right, OK. The Democrats were willing to take the."
Kanye,chance. Of not winning as long as the conglomerate could be completely in control of. As a.
Interviewer,"completely controlled you know, I'm saying that Bernie yeah, Bernie would have won, he would have."
Kanye,won this is so I would try that.
Interviewer,"I'm saying, like, Bernie is a hero. Yeah."
Kanye,"You know, and he would be the perfect, the perfect and the perfect person to be the opposite of what."
Interviewer,Trump represents. Yeah. He's an anticapitalist. He's a he's a guy who is a social Democrat.
Kanye,"And you but you know the problem, they couldn't control Bernie because you can't you can't control."
Interviewer,And he's he's been so consistent his whole life.
Kanye,So so what I'm saying is they literally kicked at this. Doesn't say so. It's like they kicked the superhero.
Interviewer,in saying they they want to control.
Kanye,That's the same thing they did with Tulsi Gabbard. But Bernie was interesting because he's this.
Interviewer,"democratic socialist, because he's got these ideas that are scary to capitalism."
Kanye,"You know, it's funny because I created the birthday party, which on the on the next election, what's."
Interviewer,"going to happen is, I mean, you guys got 300 million viewers, you know, after this would probably be."
Kanye,"900 million because I run the stock up and I was a little bit of Bill Cosby in the development, but that's."
Interviewer,exactly exactly so.
Kanye,"So this is a long rant, but I really would like to talk to you about specific things, OK? And it was a."
Interviewer,"beautiful long symphony, but there's a there's a cap on it."
Kanye,There's a pop.
Interviewer,"We don't we don't. We don't. I mean, we're cap here maybe."
Kanye,"OK, and an end note thing, as I said, we get everyone away, but there's a possibility that I could. It's."
Interviewer,"actually technically possible for me to win now, which would be the best option for America."
Kanye,I would I'm on 12 ballots and in 17 states that you could write me in on.
Interviewer,"So if people got up, people that never voted, got a registered voter for me, they'd have to take it, take it."
Kanye,"to the House because. I would you know, I could possibly win. Now I'm definitely 100 percent winning."
Interviewer,"in 2024, and with that thought, I was like, OK, I got the birthday party, but I was thinking. Maybe there's."
Kanye,a possibility I would be. They said that wouldn't happen. I was thinking I would possibly be the.
Interviewer,"Democrat, you know, I don't think they would ever let you in like that, but I don't know maybe who."
Kanye,knows what happens after this.
Interviewer,"Joe Biden, Kamala Harris thing, who knows now knows what they think."
Kanye,"You know, I would be the first. I'm. I'm trying I'm not trying to I'm one of the. First. Super famous."
Interviewer,"public. Black Freewill Servants of Christ, since modern media has come to pass, meaning when I."
Kanye,"when I when I talk, I'm not talking for a conglomerate, I'm talking for myself in service to God."
Interviewer,"That's it, that's it, like I'm not you know, I'll cover my people, cover my family, but there's not some big."
Kanye,"plan or like some practice script thing where it says you go in and you you say this, you do this."
Interviewer,"We've got we want to keep selling Kodak film. So we want to stop, you know, you from bringing out."
Kanye,the digital camera.
Interviewer,"We want to keep, you know, sell this, raise the price of gas."
Kanye,"So we're not going to look to how to safely harness nuclear power to do electric power. OK, go ahead."
Interviewer,Ask another question. I really just I quite love the sound of my own voice.
Kanye,"As you can see, it's fairly it's OK. It's this microphone we start. It sounds great. We so we started with."
Interviewer,student debt and we got on this long symphony.
Kanye,Yeah. Have you given thought into the idea of free education? And particularly here's a big one for me.
Interviewer,as well.
Kanye,"Free health care. I think if we think of ourselves as a country and our country as a community, we're."
Interviewer,"all a bunch of people that are together. If we're going to take care of things like the fire department, if."
Kanye,"we're going to take care of things like the police department education, we've got to take care of."
Interviewer,health care. We got we got to make it so that people get sick. They don't go bankrupt. We got to make.
Kanye,it so that no one has to worry about being taken care of.
Interviewer,And I don't mean to eliminate the ability for someone to hire a private specialist for surgery or.
Kanye,"anything like that. I'm not I'm not saying that, but I'm saying at the very least, we have to cover basic."
Interviewer,"medical concerns for the population. It's just it's a giant part of what it is to be a person, is to worry."
Kanye,"about your your body being broken, to worry about being sick, to worry about what it's going to cost."
Interviewer,your family financially and how it could ruin people.
Kanye,"This is a I mean, this is a huge issue in our country, is medical health. So have you thought about that?"
Interviewer,Absolutely. I hear you and I feel you and I feel what people are going through.
Kanye,"I think that. There is a. It's not just how we treat people, there's preventative measures, yes, that can."
Interviewer,"help us from getting sick, are our diet, are our locations, are the our jobs."
Kanye,There's a lot of that that affects us and puts it in those situations.
Interviewer,"Transportation, you know, like as you go to like autonomous vehicles and tram systems, like just kind."
Kanye,"of, you know, trains that are like floating malls or floating Starbucks or something like moving like."
Interviewer,designing our world to be the world of the future will will help us with health.
Kanye,That's the preventative measures. And then as far as being more inventive in the way we we connect.
Interviewer,"holistic medicine with modern medicine, I believe in both medicine."
Kanye,"I believe in God. I believe in God. And nature, I believe in science and physics and, you know, it's like."
Interviewer,"the first simplest form of bioengineering, I think is farming."
Kanye,And to be able to.
Interviewer,"I have like I talk about the guys at Emit, the greatest scientists in the world, there's people who are."
Kanye,"that are like the islands of the the medical field, but perhaps they're sitting there on the on on the."
Interviewer,"floors, like serving on the front line, fighting covid, where, you know, they didn't have the opportunity to."
Kanye,create people and become a billionaire and go to the next idea or when they present it and want.
Interviewer,"people to invest in these inventions that they have, they haven't had the voice of the platform to bring."
Kanye,this invention.
Interviewer,"There's cures to things like one of the things is the silver bullet, like what I went through with the."
Kanye,medication when they gave me the medication that made me fat.
Interviewer,"But then they said, OK, we have one that doesn't."
Kanye,"We all know what a silver bullet is, a medication. Right."
Interviewer,So it's the it's a medication that goes and just kills exactly what it's supposed to kill.
Kanye,"But for capitalism, that's not the best medication to actually cure people."
Interviewer,Capitalis want to keep people. They want to treat them. They want to treat they want to keep you sick.
Kanye,"because that's how you keep making money to have a guy. Like for me, when I say I put my life on the."
Interviewer,"line, I think about Abraham Lincoln."
Kanye,"I think about JFK to go in and sit and say, you know, the whole thing is now everyone is going to be."
Interviewer,more prosperous.
Kanye,"I think is the word. Now, specifically, are you going to five x your money?"
Interviewer,"Everyone's like trying to you know, it's about prosperity and to be able to really have real."
Kanye,"conversations with the lead heads of like Big Pharma and real conversations with the heads of, uh, of."
Interviewer,"uh, holistic and natural healing to put these people in a room together."
Kanye,People learning to have they're mad at each other. They're afraid of each other. Hmm.
Interviewer,"I donated to a Christian school in Cody and, uh, I also went by and saw this other amazing school in in."
Kanye,"Cody, where they have autistic children and kids with special needs in the same classrooms as other."
Interviewer,as regular kids and.
Kanye,"I just saw this juxtaposition and the head of that that school is a Christian, but it's a state school, so."
Interviewer,"there's no prayer in the school. And then the other school is fully Christian, but it's not a state school."
Kanye,so they don't have money in the school.
Interviewer,And I wanted to have dinner with both of the principals come to find out.
Kanye,"The principal and these guys, they talk maybe at a softball game or some the principal. House is one."
Interviewer,"block walking distance, the principal of one school's house is one block walking distance from the."
Kanye,school or the other principal that were this close.
Interviewer,"Right now we have the solutions, but we all have our backs to each other."
Kanye,We need to face each other like how we're facing each other right now and have these conversations.
Interviewer,The solutions for Utopia are in front of us. But what's holding us back? Fear. People are sitting on.
Kanye,"their money. Really, they're sitting under their money. I know. I may give you a thing. OK, that's it. Next."
Interviewer,Did you get did you get my perspective of the way I approach?
Kanye,You would bring people together to communicate and try to figure out a better strategy for health.
Interviewer,"care. I mean, in reality, some financial realities that have to be in London when you go to the hospital."
Kanye,"No, let me give you the American example, when I go to a hospital, I had something on my foot three."
Interviewer,"years ago. They asked me, you know, do you want to take something, do you want a pill? I said, no."
Kanye,"Five doctors and nurses asked me if I want a pill, this is like worse than when you don't accept water."
Interviewer,"on the plane and they just keep. Like, do you want some more water?"
Kanye,I'll take the water because I don't want to be responsible for the water. Like when the plane takes off.
Interviewer,and it goes like this. And I got.
Kanye,"I told him, I don't want no water. Like, I don't even know my like son said I should drink more water."
Interviewer,"So the so they they there are like people, they have Christmas parties about bonuses, about giving out."
Kanye,"more medication. So when we talk about they do look at this, how much does it cost."
Interviewer,"There's no price on it. Right. We make money. Money is not even backed by gold anymore, so. It's."
Kanye,"engineering, it's where the budgets are going and like it was the best part of one of the best parts on."
Interviewer,the Sixth Sense is when.
Kanye,"When they looked at this video and it was a nanny, they saw that the nanny was like putting stuff in."
Interviewer,the like the porch for the child that it passed. And and then they said the ladies looked at it and said.
Kanye,you were keeping her sick.
Interviewer,"You're keeping her sick like we are sick. We are sick of abortion, culture, sex, culture, capitalism, we."
Kanye,"are sick, we as a people, as a not just the American society of the world, we are sick and we are."
Interviewer,"keeping ourselves sick. We're all responsible, like the Black Mirror episode. We're all responsible in."
Kanye,"some way. We all play some part, like if I go to PornHub and the very next thing and I and like."
Interviewer,backslide and do this because I've struggled with this since I was like five years old.
Kanye,"Right. And the very next thing says something about like trafficking. Then I literally would have to, like."
Interviewer,"put my hand over that part and like, click the thing, I'm going to end thinking that, like, I'm not a part of."
Kanye,"the the bigger conglomerate that we're all, oh, I'm not really a part of the main problem because I'm."
Interviewer,I'm not as bad as that guy.
Kanye,And I'm not looking at this part.
Interviewer,And I'm not like we all play a part of it and we're all sick in some way.
Kanye,"And the world has been designed to keep us sick, like spacial engineering based of faith can save a."
Interviewer,world literally like building will save the world.
Kanye,"Spatial engineering, like engineering, not going to space engineering our spaces. The amount of."
Interviewer,"space that we need, the way that we interact with each other, how close we are to our loved ones, our."
Kanye,"families, how close we are to our jobs. We got to experience a lot of this. Some people it wasn't good."
Interviewer,some people it's better. They connected with their children and their families in a whole different way.
Kanye,Like we're talking this is my thing.
Interviewer,We could talk about all of these important current issues.
Kanye,"There's deeper reasons based on the slave mentality, based on fear, based on protectionism, not."
Interviewer,"specifically white supremacy and racism, protectionism, people just want to protect what they have."
Kanye,"And there's this, like photograph where you're holding the guys at the little girls holding a teddy bear."
Interviewer,"and Jesus has a giant teddy bear behind her, her back, I mean, behind his back."
Kanye,She don't want to give up the small teddy bear for the bigger teddy bear that Jesus has waiting for.
Interviewer,her. There is prosperity for all families here on Earth right now in service to God. There's happiness.
Kanye,"there's joy. It's not a possibility is a probability. Just the fact that God woke me up, got me here safely."
Interviewer,and allowed me to talk to you right now and spark the minds of the people that are anointed to.
Kanye,change the world is already what God wanted me to do if I didn't take a breath after this point.
Interviewer,God had me here for this conversation right now. But I think God has more for me playing out. Think.
Kanye,"they don't come for me to he done until he's done with me, they ain't gonna come for me today."
Interviewer,"I want to make it so small and dissemble and put in a to be like perfect really. They they go, they go."
Kanye,come for me until he's done with me then go come for me until he's done with me and uh.
Interviewer,Yeah yeah yeah. And help yourself. You always create and now. Yeah but do you understand what I'm.
Kanye,"saying. You have to go. OK, tell me what I'm saying."
Interviewer,"What you're saying is that it's, it's your overall philosophy, the way you're approaching life, you're."
Kanye,"approaching life, that there is good for everyone."
Interviewer,"If we all work together, if we all work together in the spirit of the way you think, the spirit of God that."
Kanye,"did not not approach this like with a famine mentality, but approach this like there's enough for."
Interviewer,"everybody. There's an abundance. If we if we engineer correctly, if we think about it correctly, if we all."
Kanye,come together with the spirit of everybody helping everybody. This is the spirit of Christianity. This is.
Interviewer,"the the good spirit of Christianity, not the Christianity that gets despised or disparaged or, you know."
Kanye,"evangelists drive it around in private jets, the spirit of of goodness and treating each other like."
Interviewer,brothers and sisters.
Kanye,"Yes, but this can be done on a national scale. Yes."
Interviewer,"Because those evangelists or the people who spread the word of God, you know, there's people who."
Kanye,"were praying for me. You know, we're praying."
Interviewer,"Like I said, I like to say, OK, yes, I am a genius. But one of my most genius skill sets is recognizing."
Kanye,other geniuses and empowering them and giving them the platform. So the people that I've been.
Interviewer,"praying for me this whole time, you know, for Jay to work for the kingdom, look at me."
Kanye,"Look at me right here, working from the kingdom, not not leaning on my ego, not leaning on anything."
Interviewer,"but leaning on God in this situation, saying, let's, you know, let's rise up together and show people."
Kanye,what it's like to be Christ.
Interviewer,"Like, yeah, we fall short, you know, I mean, people love to like, look at the Christians that are the least."
Kanye,"Christlike to judge Christianity as a whole. Well, a lot of people got jawans in twenty three years old."
Interviewer,and very few of them play like LeBron.
Kanye,"You know, they want to be like like Mike. Yes. But it's very few people that get that close, you know, it's."
Interviewer,"like. Yeah, yeah."
Kanye,What you're saying is beautiful. Yeah. That they do judge the people that fail.
Interviewer,"People always go to the furthest extent, like if you talk about abortion culture, people immediately go."
Kanye,to rape.
Interviewer,But don't do the math on what percentage that is.
Kanye,"And for me, as a as a Christian president, you know, as I said, I go on that I touch on it before I realize."
Interviewer,"we're in an imperfect world. You know, when I talk to my fellow Christians and we talk about meet."
Kanye,"talk about guns, we talk about in this imperfect world, there's a transition between where we are today."
Interviewer,and where we're going.
Kanye,"Yeah, there's a meat industry have a great impact on the ozone from what I hear it does."
Interviewer,And we have to transition. One of the things I wanted it it's a thought that came in. And thank you for.
Kanye,allowing me to give you the thoughts that are coming into my head as opposed to trying to put me on.
Interviewer,"a grid because I'm off the grid, period. The way I think. Clearly, I paint in circles, you know, I don't I."
Kanye,don't paint inside of the lines.
Interviewer,Right.
Kanye,"So I was thinking about I forget the lady's name starts with a T, but she changed the meat industry."
Interviewer,because she was hsp like highly sensitive person.
Kanye,That's and put the the cows in and round beans and.
Interviewer,"That's what I'm doing when I say spatial engineering, that's what I'm doing with our spaces that I'm."
Kanye,"designing with the farms and with the school systems, the unlearned systems to what are the things."
Interviewer,"that you're going to need, you know, in the future. Because 30 years we don't we don't even know."
Kanye,We think probably the things that we're learning in school right now won't even apply to people when.
Interviewer,"they're 30 years old that are learning this stuff, you know, age, especially with technology, especially."
Kanye,with technology.
Interviewer,And the people who designed the curriculums are did what they did way before technology. Yeah.
Kanye,"So, I mean, I was in computer programming when I was eight years old and I used to know how to."
Interviewer,program is how I got into music.
Kanye,"In seventh grade, I had a Amiga computer that had four thousand ninety six colors. That's why I got."
Interviewer,that one. And I would program the different sprites and draw out each of the characters and animate.
Kanye,"them. And I thought that was the next frontier, the like, because I would do like animation books. I."
Interviewer,wanted to be an animator. And then I started doing the music.
Kanye,They had a music program on do the music for the video games. And then I found myself running.
Interviewer,home from school all the way from 91st to 100 nineteenth street to go and just keep programming.
Kanye,the music.
Interviewer,"So this is like third age, you know, 12, 13, you know, programming video games."
Kanye,And that being the gateway into programming music.
Interviewer,"I got a longer story about that, but I know you want to ask me some more serious stuff."
Kanye,"So ding, OK, this is a big one. The military, if you really did become president when excuse me, when."
Interviewer,"you do become president, you're going to have to deal with hostile governments."
Kanye,"You're going to have to deal with hostile militaries and dictators, you know, people in other countries."
Interviewer,"that in other countries that don't have a value of human life. And throughout history, we've had."
Kanye,"immense problems because of that, because of military conflicts. How do you think you will approach."
Interviewer,"that? I mean, you will be the commander in chief of the greatest army in the world has ever known, if."
Kanye,"you're in that position and we have to deal with some sort of a military action with China, would have."
Interviewer,China takes over Taiwan.
Kanye,What if they invade Taiwan? What if something happens with Syria? What if something happens with.
Interviewer,Iran? What if something happens with Russia and you have to make decisions about military action?
Kanye,"Have you thought about this? Yes, I would. I have to say, again, like covid. I'm a civilian and people can."
Interviewer,"have all their perspectives that they could have of what they would do in that situation, but I would."
Kanye,"have the greatest professionals on the planet, the most skilled people that have all the experience."
Interviewer,that would present the information.
Kanye,And I would make the most sound rational decisions. And I would. Follow God's will in my approach.
Interviewer,"To. To dealing with these other countries, to dealing with these other leaders, there's there's."
Kanye,"something about, you know. Our president's personality and. The leader of North Korea's personality."
Interviewer,where there's. There's a level of common respect and and that's the reason why they were able to talk.
Kanye,and we the fear had been taken off of us like people who are.
Interviewer,"God-Fearing. Self-made. Servants of their. People. These these other, you know, scary dictators, they."
Kanye,feel like they're that for their country and if they see. A president that they know is just taking a check.
Interviewer,"or part of a bigger conglomerate. I don't want to like I said, I want to denounce any of the."
Kanye,"Candidates. Then. It's. It's very it's very transactional. It's. As I said, a prayer in this situation, this isn't."
Interviewer,you said a prayer because of what? What what motivated you to say a prayer through? The.
Kanye,"seriousness, the significance of the subject. Yeah, absolutely, we can't we can't jump from jokes."
Interviewer,"about this to, you know, joking about people's lives. Right."
Kanye,We have to completely. Be still in this moment. Allow God to guide our steps and ask the right.
Interviewer,questions. With the highest ranking officials possible. This isn't something that you just wing or that.
Kanye,"you just come in and say, I did a bit of research, I got this like political answer. It going to get a rise out."
Interviewer,of people like this is this is people's lives.
Kanye,"This is. You know, this is a whole different. You know, setting or mood than what this whole interview."
Interviewer,"has has been about, this is."
Kanye,"You know, people are suffering and throughout all sides and in in in Israel and in Nigeria and Haiti."
Interviewer,where we're suffering the police force in in in Chicago and the people who have been harmed by.
Kanye,police and the police like.
Interviewer,"This all is going to take. Serious time like Time is love, it's going to take that love in that time and."
Kanye,"Moments of listening, moments of understanding, moments like when my wife goes and visits people."
Interviewer,"in prison and she hears their stories, she says, I understand, I understand why."
Kanye,"You're into in why you're in that situation, I would have did the same thing in this situation and for us."
Interviewer,"to go to foreign countries and really understand why that they're, you know, that they're in these."
Kanye,situations or why the killing has gone for so long or why the hate has gone so long and why the pain.
Interviewer,"just keeps on. You know, compounding and compacting. There's an empathy that I just have as an."
Kanye,artist that it doesn't become a two plus two equals four situation.
Interviewer,My dad was actually a psychology major and a Christian therapist. And. This therapy we talk about.
Kanye,"therapy, period, it's like. We need healing internationally, not just selfishly, for America. America's."
Interviewer,"number one internationally. We need healing. And. I would lead, I would. I would lead with. With love."
Kanye,"Dignity. The responsibility to our country, the coverage of our families. Of our soldiers. And in full."
Interviewer,service to God and to the American people.
Kanye,"It's the. There's a mode that I would be in in that position, like when I was a producer and I was a really."
Interviewer,young man.
Kanye,"I was running around. Hopping on trains or. You know, Hoppen turnstyles this stuff and like stealing."
Interviewer,"from cars and I mean, that's stealing cars but still in clothes from stores and."
Kanye,"Then I was. Selling music and, you know, going and buying leather jackets and stuff, you know, dating."
Interviewer,"a whole bunch of girls going on tour, and then I had a family and. I had to just a lot of my mentality."
Kanye,and behavior to grow and be the man that I needed to be. Then God called me and I gave my life to.
Interviewer,"Christ. And God is helping you to be the Christian that I need to be, and when it's in God's will that I."
Kanye,"become the leader, I will become the leader that I need to be."
Interviewer,"So right now, as I said, I'm a civilian, but. My heart, my mind and my spirit is in a place where I feel I."
