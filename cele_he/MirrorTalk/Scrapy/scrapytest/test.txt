Boy, this is a long time coming and he really needs no introduction this podcast before we get into who it is. I\'m going to say this surpassed my expectations. I was a bit hesitant. I was like, whoa, this one won\'t be crazy. It was crazy</p>\n<p>Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day What\'s up, what\'s going on man? Good to see you. Good to see you too. We finally did it. We\'re here. We made it happen. We end up building. Yes, sir. So what what are you doing you running for</p>\n<p>but always how I knew at the end. I was going to tell people I\'m running for office. I\'m running for president in 2020 and you know, just to have the it even took heart to say it in that context and people are just like oh</p>\n<p>a that that\'s a clear answer. Well, I don\'t want it. I know you saying I don\'t want to go off with two of no, it\'s okay. It\'s yeah, we\'re basically saying is, you know how to set goals, you know how to achieve them. But what was Oprah\'s rationale, which he said you don\'t want to be the president like what was she saying? Because I remember when people were saying that\'s our next president member when Trump got elected, you know, they showed Oprah and they were set like there was I believe it was like NBC to we did it. This is our next president. Like they were a lot of people wanted Oprah to want to run and they felt like if Trump could win Oprah could win when I saw Trump when I was like see</p>\n<p>don\'t remember Ronald Reagan was the governor of California before it was the president. He\'s actually proven himself as a politician at least somewhat which is an idea that people have thrown out at me, too. You to be Governor, California to be Governor McAuliffe anyone\'s better than this guy. Just do this guy\'s head start there. Yeah shot open things up again man, but I think I think my calling is to be I believe that my calling is to be the leader of the</p>\n<p>to be the governor then that\'s fine. But my calling is to be the leader of the Free World So when you say this, like when you say you\'re calling is to be the leader of the Free World, what does that mean to you? Does that does it mean do you have a plan that\'s different than the plans have been implemented before does it mean that you have idea what kind of plan like the plan to be the leader? Like, what would you do if you were the leader of the fleet of the Free World? Like what would be different about the way you would handle things? Like if that\'s your plan, like what is it about that that that is your calling like, why would you want to do that? Like what do you want to do differently if you were the leader of the Free World? Well, well</p>\n<p>there\'s a couple questions in there. You said why is you know, why is that you\'re calling this people say to me, you know, they\'ll say well music is bigger than politics or more influential than politics are celebrities are more influential and I thought of it like if I was a</p>\n<p>coming here to down any of the other. I\'m not here to down Trump down Biden. I\'m just here to express why. Why? God has called me to take this position. So when you see a Visionary you think of yourself in terms of like as an artist as a Creator some someone who has these thoughts that they manifest in terms of music and art creation designed the things that you do. That\'s why you think you\'re different as a visionary</p>\n<p>as a as a species as the the human race like I did sometimes people think that Utopia as almost like a negative word. That\'s that\'s like we couldn\'t have that but I do believe in World Peace like the people hit me with the all one of the things Oprah said is she said</p>\n<p>Foreign Affairs, I remember this leg because it\'s Oprah talking summer. Remember a lot of what the conversation was, but that\'s the first thing she said was, you know Foreign Affairs and foreign policies like this. I think the reason why I say leader and that politician and not even specifically president is This is the time. You know, when the Constitution was written that was an innovation. Now the world is</p>\n<p>and that a lot of tech guys use and it\'s a standardized deal. So one of the ideas I had when I was as I\'m in this process of innovate, I\'m not and I\'m not in war with the music industry. It\'s just it\'s time for us to innovate and we need to have contracts that makes sense with exactly how</p>\n<p>so, you know people every vicinity and that\'s like every 20 years. That\'s like the like Like decade is 10 of sending as 20 and as you see now it\'s like the world is just stopped for a second and there\'s an opportunity to look and say what are the things we need? What are the things we don\'t need so I don\'t know. If you saw when I posted my contract. I had 10 contracts that kept on putting me inside a labyrinth and there\'s things that we don\'t need now. I believe that the distribution.</p>\n<p>it. And everyone\'s responsible. Everyone\'s a part of it. You know, it\'s like when the me to movement happened No, it wasn\'t just the guys that were getting tagged and you know, some of the guys should have got hit with his some guy shouldn\'t you know, that\'s not what I\'m here to talk about. I\'m saying that in a way everyone\'s responsible. Everyone\'s a part of the problem. That\'s why I really love that Black Mirror episode when you know, everyone was making comments and anyone that even made a comment the bees it was about these, you know mechanical bees anyone in this is a spoiler alert if you haven\'t seen this episode. uh, so but anyone who made a comment the bees came to go get them and that\'s the thing about what you put in the universe even a thought, you know, you put that thought into these mean it\'s another thing to say something negative and put that into the universe has another thing to see someone being raped, you know, as</p>\n<p>to say, I\'m this is Sony this is universal and I\'m willing to put the blue paint on my face and go out and do this. Because it\'s the right thing to do like music like at this point. It loses me money. It doesn\'t make it doesn\'t make me money. It is my five billion dollar net worth</p>\n<p>This Heist that we\'re going to do like I look at the music industry and that music in the love of Music itself, but the music industry I look at it like waingrow like I Blame You Know. The loss of my mother partially on entered the entertainment industry the always fighting to you know represent, you know who you are against media entertainment industry. That\'s trying to tear down anybody that\'s not going with the flow. I see, you know, I\'ve got those kind of reasons personally but vengeance is mine saith the Lord, so it\'s not a matter of going.</p>\n<p>you explain your talking about with Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee like what I lost you there? Okay. So Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee were both murdered. Well, Brandon Lee died in an accident on a movie set. Yeah, you think it was a murder? I felt that the conspiracy right the conspiracy. Was that the Chinese Triad killed him the same way they killed Bruce, but the the coroner\'s report was a Bruce died from a reaction to a medication, right? Yeah, I mean, but I think about that anytime I go to the go to the hospital. I\'m very</p>\n<p>I think it had like it might have had some information on it that they didn\'t want to go out like an address or something like that and that\'s just like but I don\'t want to go down go down this rabbit holes. I\'m just saying like Michael Jackson not waking up one day Prince not waking up one day Bruce and Brandon Lee Bob Marley. All of these things are have crossed my mind, you know as I\'m going and saying I need to innovate with these contracts are not just for me, but for all artists, it\'s not about me getting my master\'s back. It\'s about It\'s about freedom and I say on a new song I say if I would put myself In Harm\'s Way to get my Master\'s they would put their self In Harm\'s Way to stay the master.</p>\n\n\t</body>\n</html>\n'
