in 1989 our first guest went on a

fateful date with a charming Muslim

immigrant from Kenya and had no idea

that it would lead to her one day being

first lady of the United States you can

read all about her history-making life

in this new memoir called becoming

police say hello to Michelle Obama

that gives you

you see

you see

you see well miss you I mean where did

you go yeah we did you back in the old

house how is unemployment going are you

embracing it yeah it's okay and I was

just trying to think of what we've been

doing but truthfully we're boring you

know I we have a teenager at home and

she makes us feel inadequate everyday

low can I tell you how we feel we feel

like you remember the first Superman

movie Christopher Reeve yeah when he

gave up his powers to save Lois Lane's

life and then he was powerless and then

they got beat up in a diner and then he

had to get his powers back to come save

us from Lex Luthor that's what we need

from you and your husband

called the constant we dispense with

that already happily what is he doing

right now like right now what is my

husband yes oh he's probably in his hole

in our new house in his office writing

he's working on his book can I tell you

when I was reading about you mentioning

in your book that his office is messy

and disorganized yeah yeah me licensed

to have a messy and disorganized office

because my wife is that before oh it's a

disaster but now I feel like well yeah

yeah the president does that yeah

putting up it's nice to me and it's

annoying are you sending a message for

your husband through me I wish I could I

really do it appears based on social

media that you are really following

Beyonce around the country going to her

condo is that activity besides your

husband indoors with which celebrity do

you text most often oh I'm not gonna

tell you really and you know it's like

you don't text and tell that's not a

thing I thought you just made that up

what's going on lately because Oprah

kicked off the tour and she was an early

reader I've been doing a lot of texting

Gayle is a worrier

so a lot of times she'll call like what

the oh really

yeah yeah Oh Gayle that's pretty solid

that's - you said Barack is working on

his book right now did you guys ever

have a situation where you fight over an

anecdote like it's like I wanted that

for my book you know I'd since my book

was first he's he lost

and when it caused a rift in your

relationship if Oprah doesn't put his

book in her book club because she do it

with yours it might hurt his feelings

but don't get over it the book is number

one on Amazon that's was it fun to write

the book it was more fun than I thought

because here's the thing rarely does

anybody get time and they get paid to

reflect right that's true and reflecting

I find is very important because the

truth is is that for the last decade

there was no time to even really think

about what just happened to us you know

I did I write about the fact that you

know the week would start something

amazing would happen and then by the end

of the week I would have forgotten all

about that other amazing thing I mean

our days were full we were we were just

inundated so coming out of the White

House it you needed that time to take

stock and say what just happened

what was that yeah and this book allowed

me to do that and to really understand

what those eight years meant to me

personally and how it fit into the

context of the rest of my life yeah

that was something I needed it was

therapeutic for me and such a big part

of your your family your daughters being

so young when how old were your

daughters want on the day you yeah you

started living in the White House they

were seven and ten and I hope I get that

right because that's yeah but they they

lived in the White House longer than

they lived in any house that we lived in

your mom moved in lived there the whole

eight years with you reluctantly but he

locked at least eight what year did she

try to get out how far in oh you know

she felt like by the time she wasn't

taking the girls to school everyday

they were both in middle school she

thought I can go right oh right no not

yet you stay here you stay here so we'd

let her go home in the summer

so you can have a summer break but you

got to come back and I would call her

it's like you're coming back right if

and when Sasha or Malia become president

[Laughter]

you would not move in with them or would

you move in with them to help them I

would you have to man oh if they had

kids yeah well she only my mother wasn't

helping me she was helping her

grandchildren gotcha yeah I understand I

would because they would need the help

did Bo the White House dog know he was

the White House dog you know he acted

like he did he's an odd dog because in

Barack you know he criticizes Bo a

little bit because he had an aloofness

to him it's almost sort of like don't

touch me I am a bo don't you know who I

am I mean he would prance around the

White House he had a schedule both the

dogs did they would get picked an

official schedule yeah I would do a

briefing request for them they they had

to get my permission but I would find I

in my briefing book it would be Ken Bo

and sunny stop by this press event no

there would be a time and I had to

approve of it so they'd get picked up

and they'd hang out with the gardener's

for the day and they were very like when

they were at home they were mommies dogs

but if they were working with the fellas

they would ignore me

it's just sort of like don't buy don't

touch me I'm at work I'm busy one of the

most interesting things I learned from

your book is that the president first

lady family you have to pay for your

food yeah Wow you're in the light go

figure

that is crazy to me well you know it is

and it isn't it's crazy because you

don't know it and most people don't know

what it's like to live in the White

House so you know only 45 families have

done it um but true Brenna's free staff

is free you know we shouldn't be

mooching off of the taxpayers but you're

okay with that yeah but it's a little

shocking because nobody really tells you

this stuff and then they let you get

whatever you want like if you say you

want some exotic fruit yes ma'am we'll

get that right away

and then you get the bill for a peach

and it's like that was a $500 do not

express pleasure for anything until I

unless I know how much it Wow so they're

very responsive at your expense yeah in

all fairness it's like the taxpayers

should you know we want a certain kind

of jam in the or jelly we should pay for

that yeah but if you're going Smuckers

it should be free we're gonna get into

other important things that are in this

book the book is called becoming

Michelle Obama is here with us Michelle

Obama is here but you know I do want to

say mrs. Obama gave you guys a very nice

compliment during the during the break

and and you mentioned in the book that

the first album you ever got your dad

bought you was Stevie Wonder yeah yeah

it's more my grandfather southside

grandfathers outside or eat was an

east-side it was wet it was wet side

that's what me my brother dis

distinguish between my maternal

grandfather and my paternal grandfather

one lived on the south side and one

lived on the west side and he was west

side until he moved to the south side

and became south side you can read all

about it

if you if you wanted to get someone in

your husband's administration fired

Howard

just curious just wondering if there's

somebody that rubbed you the wrong way

would you send them a letter we had

wonderful people in our administration

and you never had a situation like that

one I don't believe that for a second

but we play a game almost every day here

at our show and then my wife and I play

it at home if the game is doesn't really

have a title but it's basically called

what if Obama had done this oh god we

played that at home you do I know I know

you've said repeatedly you will not run

it it run for office but has anyone ever

really like seriously approached you and

tried to convince you to run for office

all the time like I mean I'm talking

about like the head of the committee or

rock or Hillary or somebody like that

who rock keeps those people away from me

he does so yeah no no we've never had

any serious conversations with anyone

about it because it's not something that

I'm interested in or would ever do ever

you said something very interesting I

thought about your husband in your book

is that on high-pressure days he would

be at his most relaxed and he would be

the friendliest on those days why do you

think that is on his busiest day yeah

because that that's what fuels him he's

he's a grinder you know I think and yeah

he may be I think he feels most

fulfilled when he's full when his plate

is full I call him a plate spinner you

know those jugglers that keep spinning

those plates and if one is starting to

wobble he spins it and if everything's

going okay then he'll put another plate

up I think he gets his energy is he

doing that at home now like literally

wet the China right

now he's not doing that do you have a

secret like Instagram or Facebook or

page like what if I told you it wouldn't

be a secret no I don't I don't I'm

barely good at that stuff in any way I

mean I have an Instagram account and a

Twitter account obviously but you know I

I have to get permission to use it I see

my staff they don't trust me with it so

speaking of permission in the book you

talked about three kids one was a girl

named Edie who you fought she was a

bully and you fought her my first fight

first fight then there was a boyfriend

you smoked pot with uh-huh and then

there was a boyfriend that you broke up

with because his his goal his career

goal was to become a mascot for like the

Cleveland Browns or something right yeah

now do you call those people beforehand

or reach out to them in some way to go

guess what no no I did and I didn't use

last names for that reason although some

people will know who they are

Yeah right so it's up to them to out

themselves but but I did give books to

send books to everybody with kind of a

nice note like thank you for helping me

become the dee dee get a book I think so

we're trying to track everybody down

yeah so because these are people you

know this was in childhood this didn't

happen yesterday I wasn't fighting yeah

yeah when I was a little kid so it takes

a second to like find everybody so I'm

not sure if everybody's gotten a book

but we tried to get everybody about you

and then if they call and they want to

fight again yeah then the pay-per-view

yeah right you have to be very careful

when your first lady I spoke to your

husband about this also because he jokes

around a lot but then you realize like

oh I I have to maybe real an end because

the position I have but you're not first

lady anymore I am NOT and as far as I'm

concerned you can cut loose and really

say anything now right

yeah so what I've done is I've got a

sweater made of cards here what have you

done I written some things down and if

you are you've written yes if you're

game for this okay

maybe here are some things that you

could say now that you are just look at

those cards and just read we don't even

look at them just read what I wrote yeah

start with that one all right and look

at the camera right there so we feel oh

look at that what sorry yeah okay yeah

I've I've never eaten a vegetable I knew

it I knew it

there's another that's not true mm-hmm

the whole eight years we were in the

White House who use Laura Bush's Netflix

password there you go

I'm not sure which ones Sasha and which

ones Malia they agree they get so mad

every time I miss their names up I'm

like who are hard to be in a parent the

game that Sasha plays with me is that

when we're with a lot of people she'll

call me mom mom mom and I and I don't

hear and she's like Michelle Michelle

she's like see all right couple more

these are important I stole the phrase

when they go low we go high from the

back of a Snapple cap to more

barry be quiet and hold my purse and

you're fine a racist statement to make

now that you're no longer first lady

Clooney is my freebie Michelle Obama
