Interviewer,Nice to see you Vitalik!
Interviewer,I am still amazed by your quality technical articles on Bitcoin Magazine.
Vitalik,well thank you!
Vitalik,always glad to get feedback so I know what to write more of.
Interviewer,and to absorb all the materials on primecoin within one day and wrote such nice long article.
Interviewer,yup avid reader here and love your articles as well :slight_smile:.
Interviewer,that's an amazing feat.
Vitalik,not many people toe that middle ground line between writing and advanced comp-sci I suppose.
Vitalik,Bitcoin (and coins in general) are like that though; brings lots of things together.
Vitalik,"anyway, I'm a big fan of what you guys are doing here too."
Vitalik,I think you're probably the single most original altcoin developer out there.
Vitalik,"well, there's Ripple too, but in bitcoin terms they're a large corporation."
Interviewer,yup sunny has my vote by a mile.
Interviewer,Thanks really appreciate it.
Vitalik,"so, question 1."
Vitalik,"Who are you? What's your background? Are you Sunny King in real life, or is that just an internet identity?"
Interviewer,"Yeah it's a pen identity, similar to Satoshi's tradition I guess."
Vitalik,any hints as to what you do outside of altcoins?
Interviewer,Ripple is not really a coin.
Vitalik,"I throw it in there because I think it's idea of ""consensus"" is a serious competitor to PoW/PoS, and brilliant if it can be made to work. It has problems though, no doubt about that."
Interviewer,Although I didn't really take that extreme measures so at least some of my friends know I am doing this.
Interviewer,The main reason is that I hope if political climate turns worse in the next couple years that I could still buy some time to make a bit more contributions.
Vitalik,do you think it will?
Interviewer,I did some c programming before and currently work mostly on cryptocurrency.
Interviewer,possibly since the events this year already confirmed my concerns (and satoshi's).
Interviewer,but I think primecoin could also help to bring another positive argument for cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,"yep, I agree."
Vitalik,"I'm staying in Spain right now, and it's interesting how the culture here is much more egalitarian/social oriented than, say, the US would tolerate. Among those who don't like Bitcoin, the two major arguments are (1) early adopter unfairness and (2) mining is wasteful."
Vitalik,you've done quite well in solving (2).
Vitalik,do you have any opinion on the early adopter issue?
Interviewer,if so I think the market is now trying to wrestle with (1) with all these altcoins.
Vitalik,how so?
Interviewer,from my point of view I don't think early adopter is an 'issue' per se with bitcoin.
Interviewer,just like the gold miners and 'hoarders' are not an issue with gold.
Interviewer,although it does appear to me that the market force behind cryptocurrency is different from precious metals.
Interviewer,in the old commodity money gold eventually does dominate.
Interviewer,but it seems much harder for bitcoin to sustain such dominance in cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,why do you say that?
Interviewer,"one observation is that lots of miners and investors are looking at new altcoins hoping to strike it right, even if it is a pure clone without anything new."
Vitalik,"yeah, I'm finding the interest in pure clones very strange."
Interviewer,i guess this has to do with the early adopter issue that you mentioned.
Vitalik,why do you think people care about them?
Interviewer,"That also perplexs me a bit but I think the market is treating the currencies as competing companies, you know like stocks."
Interviewer,But I also found some other deeper elements at work that may undermine bitcoin's dominance eventually.
Interviewer,this has something to do with bitcoin's scarcity and the specialization of mining hardware.
Interviewer,which I think underscores the rise of litecoin since last year.
Interviewer,this I have described a bit in my design paper of primecoin.
Interviewer,basically I think bitcoin's overall security against 51% attack would drop in the future against other competing currencies.
Vitalik,because the block reward would keep going down.
Vitalik,right.
Interviewer,this could become a basis for it to lose dominance in the long term.
Interviewer,although this is still speculation and the process likely is still years away.
Vitalik,question
Vitalik,"it's block reward will likely decrease quadratically (assuming Moore's law) and not exponentially, so it will be slower."
Interviewer,but as a designer I need to be aware of the possibilities so this is part of the reasons for introducing primecoin.
Vitalik,but a hundred years down the line they'll both be very low.
Interviewer,"I think designing for a hundred year is unrealistic, but I do look at 20 years and possibly beyond."
Interviewer,so primecoin tries to weaken the scacity model a bit to compensate for a sustained mining market and higher security.
Interviewer,"bitcoin has a stronger scarcity model than gold, but i think having something closer to gold is good enough."
Interviewer,so both ppcoin and primecoin take this approach with their scarcity.
Vitalik,"the inverse quadratic rule, right."
Interviewer,yeah for primecoin block value is 999/difficulty^2.
Vitalik,question
Interviewer,so when moore's law hit the wall it would become constant generation but still low inflation.
Vitalik,with some fudge factor near the beginning.
Interviewer,this is because I don't like to guess a fixed schedule.
Interviewer,so I'd rather for market to decide when it should become more scarce.
Interviewer,so it's design as more miners and better hardware/algorithm would mean lower production.
Interviewer,the timing is then determined by market.
Vitalik,"well, it's determined by the market in the exact opposite way that, say, gold supply is determined by the market."
Vitalik,gold
Vitalik,is there any conscious reason behind doing it that way?
Interviewer,"not exactly, it actually still resembles gold."
Vitalik,primecoin
Interviewer,"more supply is temporary, just like say the 2nd week of primecoin there are a lot more production than normal."
Vitalik,"well, that was the lag in difficulty adjustment."
Vitalik,which is a different issue.
Interviewer,but for gold mining it just appears on a longer time scale so it's less obvious.
Vitalik,"now, though, my estimate of the final supply of xpm got adjusted down by 50-100 mil after that big spike."
Interviewer,"it's not really different they are connected, for gold mining you are just moving future production to now, it's just over many years so not obvious."
Vitalik,"hmm, that's an interesting argument actually."
Interviewer,whereas bitcoin/primecoin adjust difficulty in a week or two.
Vitalik,I personally have always wanted a coin with deliberately slow difficulty adjustment (eg. timespan of 3-12 months); seems like that would also approximate gold in a different way.
Interviewer,that wouldn't work well because block spacing would be destroyed.
Vitalik,true.
Interviewer,for example several altcoins got stuck at high difficulty after the first few days.
Vitalik,maybe make difficulty adjustment rapid but increase the reward for some time instead....
Vitalik,threre are many ideas.
Interviewer,it's generally agreed now that bitcoin's 2-week adjustment schedule is not suitable for a new altcoin.
Vitalik,"the problem there wasn't the 2-week schedule, so much as the 2016 block schedule."
Vitalik,"if your diff is 10x too high, that."
Vitalik,is 20 weeks.
Vitalik,"anyway, I saw you made an interesting post a month ago on the ppcointalk forums."
Vitalik,http://www.ppcointalk.org/index 7... sg1715.
Interviewer,"yeah this problem was actually hit by namecoin, the first altcoin so they developed merge mining for this."
Interviewer,yeah that's strategic reason for the design of primecoin.
Vitalik,talking about what your strategy with Primecoin was.
Vitalik,"so you think that the proof-of-* mechanism is essentially the major part of Bitcoin that can be improved, and want the community to focus more on looking for and promoting solid alternatives."
Interviewer,"of course first I had to have the idea that a primecoin could technically work, but then i am looking for reasons why we should run two coins so primecoin can be made."
Vitalik,is that accurate?
Interviewer,so that's primecoin strategic reason.
Interviewer,So from late last year litecoin has spectacular rise that made me think about why and the competive position of ppcoin vs litecoin.
Interviewer,it's possible that market would favor something simpler than ppcoin in the shorter term e.g. next couple years.
Interviewer,so primecoin would be a good candidate in the sense that it's designed to have most litecoin's so-called advantage over bitcoin.
Interviewer,yet still being innovative and brings new ideas.
Vitalik,in terms of new ideas.
Vitalik,"I saw somewhere, whether in the source code or the discussions, that you were working on some kind of improved checkpointing system for ppcoin and/or primecoin."
Vitalik,something not quite so centralized.
Interviewer,"yeah its already in primecoin, it's an updated version of ppcoin's checkpoint system."
Interviewer,even ppcoin's checkpoint is not meant to stay centralized forever.
Interviewer,and it's going to work similarly in ppcoin in the future as well.
Vitalik,so how does this new checkpointing system work?
Interviewer,"basically developers can broadcast a checkpoint to the network, and if an user turns on the checkpoint enforcement in the node then it would follow the block chain fork of the checkpoint."
Interviewer,this means that if the majority of network enforces the checkpoints then developer has power to thwart a sustained 51% attack.
Interviewer,while the network is turning into a temporary centralization mode.
Interviewer,although there are built-in checks to ensure even in the checkpoint mode developers cannot arbitrarily abuse his power.
Vitalik,how did the system work before?
Interviewer,in ppcoin right now the checkpoints are enforced by default so users have no say in whether to follow it or not.
Vitalik,"ah, okay, so hardcoded into software essentially."
Interviewer,yeah but it will be switched over in the future.
Vitalik,Although there are built-in checks to ensure even in the checkpoint mode developers cannot arbitrarily abuse his power <- what kinds of built-in checks are you talking about?
Interviewer,the system is designed because threat of 51% attack is real with altcoins.
Interviewer,there is a consistency check with checkpoints.
Interviewer,meaning that developers cannot issue conflicting checkpoints and force double-spending on the network.
Interviewer,"for example, say developer checkpoint is issued on a block with 6-confirmations, then you can treat the transaction confirmed earlier than the checkpoint is safe."
Interviewer,he cannot invalidate that checkpoint and ask the network to go into another block chain fork.
Vitalik,what if a developer sends two conflicting checkpoints to two parts of the network at the same time?
Vitalik,"so half picks up one first, half picks up the other."
Interviewer,that would cause the network to fork and requires manual intervention like restarting or upgrading client.
Vitalik,"okay, makes sense."
Vitalik,"if it was perfect, you would just use it instead of the pow/pos in the first place."
Interviewer,in primecoin user could also then ignore checkpoint and just follow the fork with more work.
Interviewer,"checkpoint is a temporary centralization defense against 51%, not on the same level as PoW or PoS."
Vitalik,"is it a jsonrpc command to do this, or are you planning on adding a GUI as well?"
Interviewer,oh the Qt now has debug window which can do all the rpc commands.
Vitalik,"right, forgot about that."
Vitalik,so what are the next steps / near-term goals in primecoin development at this point?
Interviewer,but if needed we could add it as an option setting.
Interviewer,"I think infrastructure and marketing would be the top priority for primecoin, more exchange support, mining pools and so on."
Interviewer,the team is also expanded quite a bit so primecoin shouldn't lag behind while I work on ppcoin v0.4.
Vitalik,are you planning on integrating the latest btc features eventually? (eg. payment protocol).
Interviewer,sure both primecoin and ppcoin should keep reasonably up-to-date with bitcoin features.
Interviewer,right now primecoin is ahead of ppcoin in this regard.
Vitalik,what is ppcoin 0.4 going to have? The advanced checkpointing system?
Interviewer,"It's mainly a refresh to bitcoin v0.8 features, but there could also be some adjustment on certain protocols."
Interviewer,the checkpoint would be adjusted a bit also but it won't be as decentralized as in primecoin yet.
Interviewer,btw ppcoin now has numerous copies in the market and i have now stopped counting them.
Vitalik,yeah it seems like proof of stake is slowly becoming more accepted.
Vitalik,"also, as far as proofs go, in the ppcoin paper you mentioned a third possibility."
Interviewer,just past several weeks saw at least three copies released in china and went into speculative frenzy.
Vitalik,"""proof of excellence""."
Vitalik,could you elaborate a bit more on that idea?
Interviewer,it's a concept although there is no concrete designs around this concept.
Interviewer,it's based on that a tournament result of some games is difficult to forge.
Interviewer,for example you cannot go to a tennis tournament to win prizes without having some serious skills.
Vitalik,so a coin might have some kind of internal AI tournament?
Vitalik,best programmers win and get to mine some blocks.
Interviewer,so it's a possible candidate to replace the functions of proof-of-work.
Interviewer,Yeah that's the idea.
Interviewer,It doesn't have to be AI it can be done between humans as well.
Vitalik,true.
Vitalik,although coins don't really have a way of distinguishing between human players and bots.
Vitalik,the only challenge I know of that humans are better at is Go.
Interviewer,right and most games AI can play better than human.
Interviewer,I actually looked at Go and I think even for that the network would be dominated by bots.
Interviewer,because there is already very good Go AI and very few pro level Go players.
Vitalik,yeah.
Vitalik,and ideally you do want the system to be somewhat egalitarian.
Vitalik,as otherwise one party might get 51%.
Vitalik,eg. whoever has the best go algorithm.
Vitalik,that's probably the hard part about implementingit.
Interviewer,that's one of its issues because its distribution is a lot more concentrated than proof-of-work.
Interviewer,Vitalik do you sense a general change of attitude toward altcoins?
Vitalik,yes.
Vitalik,I can feel it.
Interviewer,I am actually quite surprised that Bitcoin Magazine carried primecoin the first day since my impression earlier was that there was no interest.
Vitalik,"six months ago, altcoins were almost irrelevant."
Interviewer,and only time i saw anything mentioned was ripple.
Vitalik,consider this.
Vitalik,teleport yourself to Dec 2008.
Vitalik,simultaneously release bitcoin and primecoin.
Vitalik,which one do you think people will like more?
Vitalik,I think primecoin might be the first one to actually beat Bitcoin on that test.
Vitalik,"litecoin was nice, but scrypt is overcomplicated."
Vitalik,"ppcoin is, as you said, too complex."
Vitalik,Ripple is also too complex.
Vitalik,it can only survive because Bitcoin came first to ease people into the idea of cryptocurrency.
Vitalik,I think people are slowly realizing that there are still serious improvements to the core idea of cryptocurrency that can be made.
Vitalik,and at the same time the community got big enough to support them all.
Vitalik,"here in Calafou (place in Spain), ever since I introduced the locals to Primecoin people have been thinking, since we have one example of a useful PoW, what else can we do?"
Interviewer,yeah i got a few messages regarding ideas of other useful work types.
Vitalik,we came up with the idea of an AI challenge-based coin independently too (although no progress toward anything practical).
Vitalik,what do you think are some promising directions?
Interviewer,that's what I hope primecoin would inspire other designers to do.
Interviewer,"I am not sure, there seems quite a bit demand to monetize F@H, and I heard Pande is looking at the matter seriously."
Interviewer,But it's not easy to come up with a proper decentralized design.
Interviewer,"The things is, the innovative systems are quite costly to develop, and the market doesn't seem to reward original ideas that well in the altcoin arena."
Vitalik,F@H?
Vitalik,"ah, folding at home."
Interviewer,So i have seen a lot of such attempts fail because of lack of funding for development.
Vitalik,"yeah, the problem there is how you make it uncheatable."
Vitalik,"alright, anything else you wanted to talk about?"
Interviewer,that's a good chat thanks a lot Vitalik.
Interviewer,yeah we've covered quite a bit.
Vitalik,"alright, thank you too!"
