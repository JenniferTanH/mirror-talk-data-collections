[Applause]

thank you so much

la librarians here guys looking good hi

Carla

hi how are you Oh telling you there have

been many thrills but to be the library

and that's sitting here with you is one

of the most I'm getting a little

compliment but I'm interviewing so I

have to do it you just have to remember

our days back in in City Hall I mean

I've known Carla since I was a baby a

baby professional so you shouldn't be

nervous and what a professional you were

though because with Chicago Public

Library I came back from Pittsburgh and

the library was part of your portfolio

yes it was and it made such a difference

to have somebody that understood

libraries that read and everything in

government like that that was her

that wasn't shade not at all she was

just making a point

that's all because I was coming in from

academic teaching librarians and things

and so so we go way back way back way

back and what what I mentioned that you

like to read it's been a big part of

your family reading oh yeah oh

absolutely yeah we are readers the

Obamas and we started reading to the

girls when they were babies infants

because as a little kid I loved to read

aloud I was one of those kids who would

set up the stuffed animals and the

Barbies and read to them and show them

the pictures and then go back I love the

the act of reading aloud so when I had

kids they just became like my real

babies I could read too so I read to

them all the time all the time I know

every word of every dr. Seuss anything

still by heart and as the girls grew up

we continue to incorporate book as books

as a form of family activities so as

they got older we started reading more

complex books together so Barack and

Malia wrote read all of the Harry Potter

books aloud from front to cover from the

front to the back and then she could see

the movie after they read it so that was

their their father-daughter rituals so

they've seen and I stayed out of that

because you know you want the father to

have a thing that they do so I don't

know anything about Harry Potter because

I wasn't even going to get involved in

that so that's their thing so when Sasha

got older I read Life of Pi with her and

then we saw the movie and we were big

comic family readers so we loved Calvin

and Hobbes we were a big Calvin and

Hobbes family so yeah we read it was you

know it was a part of the the way we put

our kids to sleep at night

you know I I felt that music reading

culture was an important part of their

development to this too you know from

from very early on so we are big big

readers and one of the images that I

know that when you were in the White

House and there would be a holiday time

you would be going and they would be

going to the book stores oh yeah yeah

giving books as gifts yeah that's all

Barack does that's the only place he

knew how to go as president he could

golf and he could get to the book store

I think those were the two things he

felt comfortable doing outside of the

White House but that was an annual

ritual of he and the girls to go to one

of the book stores for the holidays and

in Chicago the 57th Street bookstore you

know that that's bookstore that was our

that was our neighborhood store that we

like to go to so you have bookstores and

in libraries of course we're a big part

of our life big part of my life

very early on too I remember my first

experience with going to the library I

was four and it was like the first

official time I got an ID you know you

felt like big-time person getting

something with your name on it and I

remember going into the library in our

neighborhood was three blocks from our

house and my mom who was a housewife at

the time that's where she would take us

and that was sort of my first major

big-girl thing I could do was get my

library card and stand like counter high

watching them put me into the official

files I felt really important I didn't

know what to do with my library card

because I didn't have a wallet or purse

but I felt really special just to have

it and we would go to the library it was

a community spaces all of you all know

the library for us like for all of you

you see it's a it's a major part of any

community and that was the place for our

family to go to get those early books

Dick and Jane books

barbar the elephant you know you go off

into the chilled

corner where the colorful titles were

and then I thought one day I'd graduate

to going upstairs where the books were

darker and the jackets were maroon or

blue or that was where the serious books

were upstairs did you ever get to go oh

yeah I got up there one day I graduated

but then the library became work

research papers it's a Dewey Decimal

System

it became a little sassy Oh only here at

a library invention what do we get just

a shout out for the Dewey Decimal System

oh I love you all

[Laughter]

so you continued you went to school you

graduate school all of that and then

your life got even busier and how did

you find time to read just for pleasure

and you know we all want to know see

what get a chance to read anything for

pleasure yo yeah yeah there were there

were moments of escape today however I'm

spending most of my time selfishly

focused on my book so that's what I'm

reading y'all and it's almost ready it's

coming and what I've been in I've been

immersed in that process so this year

has been a little tougher for me because

I'm trying to you know stay in my voice

but when I do have time I have one of my

my chief of staff Melissa who by the way

she's more excited to be here than she

was to meet Bruce Springsteen I mean

Melissa went to her is my book

recommender she loves you all and I may

lose her here in this convention center

tonight she might leave me she's been

with me from the very beginning of the

campaign but she is my book guru and I

usually read what Melissa tells me I

should read so she'll pass on she'll

throw some books in my bag or on a long

trip but what have I been reading lately

I mean I have a very eclectic sort of

reading list I've read Commonwealth

that's I love a good story that takes me

outside of myself I love everything that

Zadie Smith has done white teeth

I actually accidentally read what reread

that I read it maybe two years ago and

then I was like it was on my shelf and I

thought I have I read this and I started

reading it and I was thinking I must be

have ESPN or something because I know

what's gonna happen in the next page

this is how my life is that I freeze

past decades I would forget what I've

read but I read it and I realized by the

third chapter that I had read it already

but I finished it because it would say

did you put it down oh no oh no no no I

loved her story telling her characters

just finished reading exit West which

was very good very very powerful the

Nightingale I read just the other day

any shoutouts for the nightingale

Chimamanda Adichie and love all of her

stuff so I mean you know I I love

stories I love to escape for a moment I

needed that escape over the past ten

years

needed to get out of my own story get

into somebody else's story for a minute

and were you able to do that oh yeah

yeah get lost in a book you know I

couldn't read in the White House at

times there were just too much going on

and we were running so fast that

whenever I got a chance to sit down and

pick up a book I would get maybe a

sentence and I would fall asleep so I

literally sitting down I don't know if I

was napping or passed out I did I

couldn't tell the difference I'd wake up

and it would be an hour and I think I

thought I was I asleep that's how the

White House years felt so usually on a

longer trip I could get into a book but

it was you know it was a hectic eight

years now you said pick up a book so

that implies the physical book oh I

already bought you books yeah I'm not an

e-reader I like to have a book in my

hand

yeah I mean even in my writing process I

like to hold it I don't I can't really

edit things on the computer well I feel

like I have to I have to write down my

thoughts I can jot down things on a on

an iPhone but that's hard I have to feel

it I have to still be able to touch it

I'm old sorry

so I we still have a lot of books in our

house and my husband who as you know as

an avid reader and still loves books

around everywhere we've gone he's just

boxes and boxes of books that I can't

get rid of he will not allow me to do it

so we are still a household that is we

have books on shelves lots of books on

shelves now you know as a librarian I

did some research and I understand that

there's a library you actually worked in

a library bindery oh yes I worked in a

book bindery one summer

Bob Goldman's book bindery I did it was

the summer right before I went to

college at a friend's mother who worked

there and it was my first real job

before then I did the neighborhood jobs

babysitting I had a family next to us

that they paid me to do everything for

them babysit trained a dog tutor piano

the Smiths

I loved them they got me through high

school but then I graduated to a job

downtown the bindery was downtown and a

friend's mother worked there and my job

entailed doing one thing a thousand

times every day all day over and over

again so I got to put the little metal

thing in a hole and then pass the

cardboard over to the guy that would

slam it down so my job was to take the

metal thing put it in the hole and pass

it and I was good with doing that for

the first day even I thought you know

I'm gonna and I'm gonna was aiming at

finishing it I thought there would be an

end to it that there were like thousands

of them and I would prove to the bindery

people that I was so fast

so that I can complete it and I would be

done and I just realized it's never over

they just kept coming the little pieces

of cardboard and the little things and

that went on for weeks and weeks and

weeks doing the same thing and I just

thought my god I'm ready for college I

can I can do this but it taught me great

respect for the men and women who do

that work every day that thankless work

that makes it possible for us to have

books and folders and you know I'm I

learned work ethic at the bindery the

the dozens of people in that plant who

came there and they did the same job

every day for years and years and years

you know it reminded me of my father

those those blue-collar workers who

didn't look for passion in their jobs

they didn't have the luxury like we did

to think about doing the things that we

love they had to do things that put food

on the table and that was my first

experience shoulder-to-shoulder with men

and women who were making a living for

their families now you mentioned your

father so many times about his work

ethic and what it took for him to go to

work and and provide and things you saw

it first oh my father Frazier Robinson

man he was you know every value that I

have in me came from my mother and

father and watching them day to day as

most people know my father was a

blue-collar worker worked the same job

his entire life worked at the water

filtration plant and my father had MS

and contracted it at the prime of his

life so I never knew him to be able to

walk without the assistance of a cane

but my father got up every day was a

shift job so you know some days he was

on days some days it was on nights some

days he was on evenings so his schedule

changed and I remember him putting on

his white t-shirt and his blue button-up

uniform and getting his crutches and

making his way out the back door to the

car

to go to his job without complaint

without regret because he was proud that

he had a job that allowed him to invest

in his children me and my brother you

know with that blue-collar salary he put

two of us through college and Princeton

at that and he made sure that you know

and those were we went to those schools

long before they had you know the

financial assistance that puts you

completely through we were still paying

my parents had to pay a portion of our

tuition and he made sure that our

tuition was paid on time we never were

going to be late and not be able to

register for our classes so Who I am

today is so much of it's because of my

parents and that hard work ethic and you

know the values of your word is your

bond you do what you say you're going to

do you know Trust is important honor

honesty you know I saw my father behave

in that way every single day with

everyone regardless of race or station

in life so that's who I think about when

I write my book and I how I carry myself

in the world I do what I think Marion

and Frasier would expect me to do that I

hope to be that person for them

and my mom is out here and your mommy oh

yes she's just calling eight hey mom

sorry and so whenever anything happens

she says this is Robinson

she's models after your mom oh yeah and

how your mom handled all of that so she

your mom was right there with you well

you know grandma you know we couldn't

made it through the white house without

her you know just having her she she had

been helping me long before coming to

the White House because Barack was

always you know he was a state senator

and then the US Senate and those were

jobs that had him away from home usually

most of the week and I still had a

full-time job I was at at any point in

time I was a professional with a big job

of my own and we had two little kids and

we had you know we could afford help and

we had a couple of great babysitters but

you know the time I lost that one good

babysitter and that crushed me like

nothing else I mean when glow when she

said she had to leave because she

couldn't needed to make more money I

thought I was losing an arm you know

Brock was trying to console me and I was

like dude just get out of here you are

of no help to me I need Glo I don't need

you do nothing for me but I remember

that pain and I thought how can I go to

work every day and not know that my kids

are good that there was somebody who

loves them which is not to you know get

on a soapbox which is why affordable

child care is so important because so

many having access to that kind of

security for all the families out there

who don't have a choice they have to go

to work I know that that pain of what it

feels like when you don't know your kids

are good and good not just being safe

but that they're in a place where

somebody loves them and is going to

instill values in the

and is going to read to them and take

them to the library and it's not gonna

just plop them in front of the TV so I

was about to quit working and I thought

I just can't do it I can't keep up the

balance and who stepped in but my mom

who was not yet retired but she would

come over at the crack of dawn to allow

me to go to the gym she'd started

getting the kids ready for school she'd

wake him up fixed breakfast I'd come

back I'd grab him I take him to school

she'd go to work she'd get off she'd

come and pick them up

get them home start dinner by that time

I'd get home I mean we had our routine

down and there's just something about

having your mom in that place where you

know she she will she will kill someone

for her grandchildren so she was the

grandmother at the pick up line she was

going to be the first one at the pick-up

line because she didn't want her little

grandbabies walking around wondering

where their ride was so she would get

there an hour before pickup to be the

first car so that she'd see her babies

and to bring him here

bring him here the you you know you

don't you can't pay for that no so we

brought that energy with us to the White

House and we needed it that kind of

no-nonsense solid tell it like it is

unimpressed with everything kind of

personality that is Marian Robinson you

know she did not want anybody doing her

laundry at the White House she could do

her laundry just fine really was Jo know

she did was notoriously doing we had

housekeepers and Butler's and everything

at the White House and she was like

don't touch my underwear I've got it

too old for that my heart's role-model

and she taught the girls to do their

laundry so they had laundry duty with

Grandma oh so she really helped keep

them grounded because my god yeah she

kept the whole White House grounded she

just kept because and everybody used to

go up to her room the the butler's the

staff they'd just be in there

chit-chatting with her

shooting the breeze getting some wisdom

telling their stories you know she just

had a whole little psych counseling

session up there in her Suites of rooms

but she she kept us humble and focused

on what was important and she was my

sounding board anytime anything crazy

happened over the course of the day the

first thing I would do her her suite of

rooms were on the third floor above us

and I'd go there and I'd sit on her

couch

she'd have on MSNBC or something and

she'd be trying not to talk about what

was on the news until I kind of let her

know that I was ready to talk about it

and she would do what she always did sit

there and just listen and go hmm and

then what because my mother was not

going to solve your problems for you no

you know she was gonna listen and she

would say well what do you think about

that and then you'd figure it out and by

the time you'd leave you figure I feel

great so so much of my ability to get

out there again and again and again had

to do with going up to that little

counseling room and sitting and having

Marian Robinson mm-hmm you'll be fine

just going back down there did she stop

now did she ever tell you you know

you've talked about that a lot what are

you gonna do say that again did she ever

say you've talked about that a lot now

what are you gonna do about it

no she's mom my mother and I write about

this about how I my mother my parents

had a really advanced sense of parenting

at a very early age they taught us how

to advocate for ourselves very early so

her expectation

like you you know how to fix your

problems you know what to do and when

you teach kids at an early age that they

have a voice that's worth listening to

number one and that their opinions

actually matter and that's what they get

day in and day out in their home at the

dinner table two adults listening

intently and asking questions and you

know encouraging kids to contribute that

was the household those were our dinner

dinner tables so that when you came home

from school with a problem you could air

it but you had to go back and solve it

and so at forty fifty years old no my

mother wasn't assuming at all that she

needed to solve any problems that I had

at first lady her expectations were you

will do this and you will do this well

because you know how to do this so there

was never any need for her to even

pretend like she had to give me

directions she knew she had instilled

those values in me when I was four and

five and seven so she had done the work

wonder what a blessing and you mentioned

to the you almost thought about quitting

because you did have it I don't know how

many people realize what high-powered

positions you had as a career woman I

mean to balance that well but before I

was first lady oh yes oh yeah yeah I had

a jobs before I was first lady everyone

pretty high-powered and sometimes that

getting lost executive vice president

I had big jobs I was really I was smart

was continue to be that's why sometimes

when I keep the question how did you

know what to do his first lady yes

that's like whoa okay I went to

Princeton Harvard Lauda was a lawyer

work in the city worked with Carla

working on libraries I worked in

planning and economic development ran a

nonprofit organization was vice

president a hospital I don't know

I just maybe was osmosis

so they're an instinct you were able to

use some of those experiences so yeah

you you know I I didn't come to the

position of first lady a blank slate and

that's sort of what happens in society

with spouse you become a spouse all of a

sudden burn you know and I felt I talked

about this in the book of how I felt

myself becoming a spouse I went from

being an executive to becoming a spouse

where the first thing people would talk

about was what shoes is she wearing and

it's like oh no no people not you're not

focusing on my shoes right I mean I'm

standing in front of like a military

families we were doing important things

but so yes there were moments in my

profession because the the burden of

child-rearing fell on me as a woman you

know there was there was a part of my

trajectory as my husband's ascent got

faster and higher and louder there was

the challenge of how do I make sure that

my kids are saying and I have a career

but then yeah that started very early

those doubts those questions of how do

you balance it all and is it fair that

we're on his rocket ship ride when I

have one too but that's something that I

write about that's what you learn the

balance in marriage that and I tell

young people this all the time

particularly young women is that you

what I've learned is that you can have

it all but you you usually can't have it

all at the same time and that that's a

myth that even having the expectation of

having it all it's a setup

for a young people young young couples

young men and women with children the

notion that you're not successful if you

don't have it all well it's it's hard to

balance it all but if but I started to

learn that life is long and there are

trade-offs that you make and I think

that the trade-off of stepping off of my

path until at least I found a child care

solution that worked for me which was my

mom I entertained the notion of stepping

off of my track because

I felt like I have these two kids and

that is I brought them here so my first

priority is to make sure that they are

okay I can't save the world if I if my

household isn't isn't solid so but the

other thing I learned at that point in

time when I was ready to jump off the

professional track I started not caring

what people thought about me

professionally so I felt more freedom to

ask for what I needed so I wanted up

staying in my career because I had an

opportunity to become the vice president

of Community Affairs at the University

of Chicago the president was looking for

a new person to head that division and I

had just had Sasha she was four months

old and I was like not doing it don't

care don't care about work but one of my

good friends said well you should

interview because this guy is really

different and I was like okay I don't

care so I took I was still breastfeeding

so I had Sasha in the crib but said

we're going to an interview baby we're

gonna go see this man who wants me to

work from him but we don't care we're

not we don't care so we're going and he

needs to see all of me have a baby and a

husband who's a u.s. senator whatever he

was doing at the time it's like you want

you want to hire this well let me tell

you what it'll take

I'll need this much money on the

flexibility I laid down a whole list of

demands that I knew was we're gonna have

him running in the other direction

because I really felt the freedom to be

like well if you can do this this this

this and this for me then maybe I'll

think about it

and he said yes to all the whole list of

all the things I asked for and I thought

wow I guess I have to try this now but

what I learned there is that as women as

individuals you have to ask for what you

need and not assume that people are

gonna give you what you need

and that taught me that I can define the

terms of my professional life in a way

that I didn't feel the freedom to do so

I thought if I'm gonna do this I'm going

to do this in a way that provides

balance and I you know I I told folks

there don't expect me at every meeting

don't expect me to come to meetings

we're not doing anything because I'm

going to the Halloween parade and that's

important and I'm doing my job and I'm

doing it well but this meeting isn't

necessary so I felt that freedom for the

first time in my professional life to

ask for what I need knowing that I was

worthy of it that I that I was valuable

to them even in all my complicatedness I

was still giving them value but I had to

learn to appreciate that value before I

could ask for what I needed

right and not be afraid oh gosh yeah not

be afraid at all that they might say

which is easier said than done so I mean

you know I I understand it is not easy

to tell somebody that you're worth a lot

especially for women we have a hard time

saying that about ourselves that I know

my worth and I can put a monetary number

on it too that there is there that there

is a value to it and that's that those

are kind of things that I'm exploring in

the book as well and I'm not really just

trying to pump the book but I'm I'm

these are what I've been asking about

for the last year I've been sort of

reliving these things and figuring out

what it's taught me so I'm writing about

all that so if I'm if I sound a little

like therapy here where you're in it I'm

in it I'm still in it thinking about and

people and you're having the time to be

able to step back because you mentioned

going and going you didn't have really

time to reflect as things were happy

with no time to reflect in eight years I

mean we did so much so fast and we also

knew we didn't have the luxury to make

mistakes when you are the first

I mean I'm I've lived my life as the

first the only one at the table and

Barack and I knew very early that we

would be measured by

different yardstick making mistakes was

not an option for us not that we didn't

make mistakes but we had to be good no

we had to be outstanding at everything

we did and when you're operating at that

level and your your-your-your trying to

live up to the you know to the

expectations of your ancestors of your

father when you're the first you're the

one that's laying the the the red carpet

down for others to follow so yes we were

moving fast we I I was starting an

initiative almost every year during the

eight years that I was there and when I

started an initiative there was a lot of

work that went into it beforehand

because coming from to this work as a

professional I knew that strategic

thinking about an initiative had to

happen the background work had to be

done we met when we started let's move

before we even launched it we spent a

year meeting with every expert in the

field we had already developed

partnerships before we had even

announced it we had focus groups we were

meeting with legislators and

policymakers so that when we stepped out

into the arena we knew what the pitfalls

would be we knew where the partnerships

needed to be we knew where the holes

were well that that was work that we

were doing at the same time that you're

doing state visits and Halloween parties

and Christmas decorations and so you're

like a swan with the paddling legs

underneath that was eight years of that

so yeah I realized there was time that

something really major would happen at

the beginning of the week let's say you

met the Pope or something like that

let's just say that

you know this is the weird thing that's

kind of stuff we did I met the Pope or

hanging out with the Queen

it's like okay that was my week that's

my life or that was one week - that was

it could be in one week you know a state

visit my first trip to Africa that was

my solo trip involved doing push-ups

with Bishop Desmond Tutu literally and I

was like please get up please don't use

I know no I'm gonna do push-ups when you

come Michel come down so I just looked

around it's like if something happens to

him it's not me well I so I was doing

push-ups with Bishop tutu I gave a

speech to a group of young African women

leaders I met Nelson Mandela we went on

a safari I went to Botswana I you know

that's like four days all of that kind

of stuff would happen in like four days

and then you'd go to the next week and I

could literally forget everything that

just happened the week before because

something like that would be happening

in the next week so to be able to

remember it all to keep it all in your

head

I would find myself forgetting oh yeah

I've I went to Prague I literally forgot

that I have been to Prague and I and I'm

not I I mean we had this conversation

somebody said what do you think of

Prague and I said I've never been to

Prague and my chief of staff said yes

you have and I was like no I have never

been to Prague ever she was like yes and

we went back and forth and it took a

picture of me in Prague going you're

right I forgot all about that

I was there for two days that's how

that's what the pace is you can forget

big major things not because they

weren't important but they get crowded

out by the next series of issues and

demands so I don't know what the

question was how we got on this

you forgot the question I forgot the

question all right so when you think

about all of that and then you have the

two little ones say the two little ones

right oh my kids and so they might have

I never ever got about them and so that

balance and so when people are thinking

about balance and how you do it any

advice for how people can be try to yeah

there's there's a lot of advice for

balance my balance is crazy it's it's

it's on you know because you're the

first lady but you're also trying to go

to the potluck and the soccer game and

you know I tell the story of how Barack

goes went to a parent-teacher conference

and you know he's got a big motorcade

it's big it's a lot of stuff and men

with guns machine guns black you know

sniper gear they follow him everywhere

they're in trucks and they're leaning

out looking at you like I will kill you

because that's their job

but when they're at Sidwell fourth-grade

on the roof of the undergrad the

elementary school even Malia was like

dad come on

you know so everybody was sort of okay

when dad didn't go sort of politely

going dad you don't have to come to the

fall/winter concert you it's okay we'll

take a picture you could take a pass but

I would be there and mom would be there

and you're trying to be a normal parent

in the midst of it you know when you

know you your kids invited over for

sleepover and you have to explain to

them we will need your social security

number and there will be dog sweeping

your house and they're going to ask you

if you have guns and drugs and you'll

have to tell them sorry mrs. Julia's mom

but this is what it means to have such

over but it's gonna be fine

you know don't have fun they but but

kids have fun they learn how to work

past all of that but you're balancing at

least I was balancing not just the the

act of being a mother but being the

first lady of the first daughters who

had their own detail all the time so

imagine trying to go to prom with eight

men with guns and doing anything else

that you're trying to do as a teenager

with eight men with guns Barack and I

were very happy about it

[Laughter]

[Applause]

we were very but she even had to like

learn how to like discipline them

without letting them think that their

agents told on them right so all parents

you understand this so I had to I had a

lie a little bit about where I got my

information from it's like how did I

know that no parent was at that party

Julia's mom called me and told me not

because I got a full report in detail

it's like why are they so dumb not to

know that how do you think I knew their

kid

that's our dads are those are some of

our parenting scenarios so my goal as a

parent was to try to make sure my kids

had normalcy that's a different set of

challenges for the average parent but

here's the thing that I learned one of

the things I learned living in the White

House is that kids don't need that much

you know

if they know you love them

unconditionally you can live in the

White House you can live in a you know

you can you can live in a little bitty

apartment I grew up in home is what you

make of it inside it's that interaction

that you have everyday and it doesn't

have to be perfect it can be broken and

funny and odd in many ways

and you know our oddness was a level of

dysfunction that most families will

never experience but it was odd and and

they kids are resilient they make it

through which is why I think about all

the kids that don't make it through

because it takes a lot to break a kid

you know it takes a lot but there's so

many broken kids which reminds us how

bad we're doing because you got to do

really messed-up stuff to kids to to

send them off they have to come from a

brokenness that is so deep and off and

we have to see that in our children and

understand that when kids act out

there's a reason for it there's there

there's no such thing as bad kids kids

aren't born bad you know they are not

they are products of their situation so

I learned to give myself a break because

my kids are loved and they're going to

be fine and we we mess up a lot we make

a lot of wrong calls as parents but you

know we we we hold them to high

standards as people you know we don't

measure them by things and grades we

measure them for how they interact in

the world how do they treat their

friends how do they treat each other

things like kindness and compassion and

empathy those are the things that we

have tried to teach them over these

years and here's the thing kids watch

what you do not what you say so the

biggest thing that Barack and I could

ever do to be good parents to our kids

is to be good people in the world for

them to see every day so and that is

true whether you're the president in the

first lady or you're Marion and Frazier

Robinson those standards don't you know

they don't know title they don't know

income that's just all that kids need

and we as you librarians know who you're

working in the communities and you see

you're seeing these kids come into your

your doors and they come with such

promised and they they just want

somebody to love them you know they just

want somebody to tell them that they're

okay and that's one of the things I've

tried to do as first lady with kids why

did so much with kids because I always

thought this is the interaction that

could change a kid's life

this one hug this one you are worth it

you never know what what can make a

difference now all of this you're giving

to communities you're giving to your

children and you're giving but you've

also I've heard you say it that

sometimes you have to put yourself first

or not feel guilty about taking care of

yourself

no yes ladies and men too but let's talk

to the ladies a little bit on this one

because we do that right we put

ourselves forth on our priority lists

after everybody else and then we're sort

of aunts and sometimes we're not even on

our own list at all it's so filled with

so many obligations and the guilt that

we have and you know you this is nothing

new but that oxygen mask metaphor is

real you know if you can't save someone

if you are dying inside and that death

can look like so many different things

it can be our you know our self our

sense of self-worth our own physical

health our mental well-being all of that

is if we let that go and we don't

nurture it as women we are not good to

anybody else and I you know I and that

is something to that you have to

practice and that's what I had to learn

I had to learn to learn that because I

didn't see that even in my mother I mean

my mother was one of those who didn't do

anything for herself you know my mother

died her own hair until she turned it

green and it was like mom it's green

it's not working you don't know what

you're doing just go to the hairdresser

and she's like it's fine

it's just green

I can relate to that just green I

remember that you know it's like my you

know so I I grew up with women who put

didn't put themselves first and I

thought I want to show my girls

something else you know I want I want

them to see that being a good woman out

here in the world means that you're

smart you're educated yes you were

gentle and kind and loving but you know

you could you can do some push-ups you

know you can you know you're gonna think

about what you put into your body what

you eat you're gonna take time out for

yourself you're gonna invest in your

relationships with your friends I

thought it was important for me to my

girls to see me having strong

friendships with women in my life so I

have a posse of women who keep me sane

that's what I wanted to know oh yeah oh

yeah and the posse started early in my

life I always had a crew of women crew

girls I had my my lunchtime girls that

we went over to each other's house at

lunch time in grade school and played

jacks and complained about the teacher

and just analyze things watched all my

children then we got ourselves together

and we were fortified and we could go

back in and finish the day that was my

early group but when I went my kids were

young I had a really strong group of

woman still do these women are still a

major part of my life and I could have

gotten through those early years without

him because we were all at varying

stages of our professional careers some

of us were married some were single

parents some had husbands who travel but

every Saturday we would get together and

we started when the babies were in those

cradles and we would just set them down

around each other in a circle so they

could look at each other and then we

talked about everything you know about

are they walking yet are they supposed

to be do all those questions you have as

a new mother and you don't know whether

you're doing anything right it was just

nice to be around a group of women who

knew just like you they didn't know

anything either we were

just messing up and it was okay but we

became our most important confidence as

mothers raising kids and our kids all of

these kids who have come up together are

like cousins and they're they they're

out in the world and they've all done

well which was another lesson that I

learned you can parent all different

kinds of ways there's no one right way

to do it again if there's love and

consistency and a foundation and

security they're going to be okay so we

we started learned to let ourselves off

the hook you know and then we started

doing fun stuff together like we worked

out together these same women I would do

a boot camp with at Camp David I want to

thank these women who would come because

I was trying to get everybody healthy so

like once the season I bring them to

Camp David and we do like these

intensive workouts and I like eliminated

wine and stuff like that until everybody

said they weren't coming unless I put

wine back on the menu so I had to put

wine back on there just to not lose my

friends but we work out like three three

three times a day and the little Navy

cadet kids they'd be like ma'am go lower

on your pushup and be like oh you're

just so cute and don't call me ma'am so

we were getting healthy together and we

started doing a little seminar as we do

each other one of my friends was an OB

gynie so as we got older we would have

sessions on menopause and then we talked

about other things that I can't talk

about here but but that group was that

was that that was my crew throughout the

white house years and that was a part of

that self-care that we all felt good

about and we all got stronger over these

eight years we as women this group of

women

we got physically and mentally stronger

together in ways that I love my husband

you know he is my best friend but

they're more fun sometimes

don't tell him he doesn't know that I

have more fun with them sometimes but

they gave me the kind of the kind of

fortification that I needed and I

encourage young mothers to understand

that you are we were not meant to parent

in isolation and so many young parents

because of you know circumstances maybe

they were transferred they're living

away from their homes I saw this in

military families a young you know

military mom would move away from her

family she'd have kids she'd be alone

and she'd be wondering well why is this

so hard and I'd say because you're not

supposed to do this alone you know

children weren't meant to be raised in

isolation we need community that it does

take a village and so I encourage young

women to build their village if it's not

at home with your mom and your aunts and

your cousins then wherever you are build

that village because that will be your

salvation it keeps you saying and and it

just keeps you in imbalance in a way

that I think we don't appreciate and

what about fun fun yeah I just told you

a bunch of fun we had the push-ups the

push-ups are fun Carla you Shay should

so you wouldn't enjoy like working out

well you keep score that's what you tell

Carla doesn't work out because she

thinks there are scores to be kept

during a workout it's like okay one

pushup for me and one for you well we

had fun oh yeah we had fun we made sure

we had fun and we wanted the White House

to be a place of fun and particularly in

tough times you know and we went through

some tough times crisis shootings I mean

I the the the amount of of grief that we

that that that we had to I wanted to say

we weren't carrying it but we had to

help the country get through you can't

have all crisis you know the country

needs a moment to feel like they can

celebrate in some way shape or form even

in the darkest times so we had Halloween

at the White House and kids came and

they mostly military kids and their

families they would come around the

South Lawn and it was all decorated and

the house was orange and everybody was

in costume and they got to

trick-or-treat at the White House you

know we had any major state event that

we did whether it was a state dinner or

a rival we found a way to incorporate

kids in that so we had a big act

performing at in the evening usually

they'd agree to do a separate

performance or a talk or a workshop with

young kids from from when we'd fly them

in from all over the country so that

there would be kids getting different

experiences so kids sat down and talked

to you know every major star that came

to the White House we did the had the

whole cast of Hamilton come back and

perform and it was a very full circle

moment for for me because we first met

lin-manuel when the very first cultural

event that we did at the White House was

the spoken word event because spoken

word rapped for those of you don't know

poetry you know sort of cool

had never been done in the White House

in the East Room with George and Martha

standing there and so we were going to

do that as the first event so we were

finding some of the hottest young voices

and we did a rope line and this young

kid lin-manuel came up and he and Barack

and I were what are you gonna perform

young man and he said I'm gonna do a rap

about Alexander Hamilton if we were like

you know that's when here you remember

you're the president first lady you

cannot laugh in the face of your guests

and go what are you kidding and then he

went on to perform the first number that

that was the the first number he had

prepared and it was obviously amazing

and so afterwards we were like that's

really good and he said yes I'm gonna do

a whole Broadway show on it and we were

like hey like good luck with that kid

and then it blew up and and we invited

the whole cast back and they performed

first they did a whole day of workshops

for kids from all over the country so

they were doing lyric writing and you

know you name it they were in the Red

Room writing and rapping in the Blue

Room and they were dancing in the yellow

oval and you name it they were

everywhere and then they did the

performance in the East Room with all

these kids who had never gotten to see

the Broadway performance but they all

knew the words so we had fun we had lots

of fun and all our fun always involved

kids because kids are good

they just make everything better and we

wanted to make sure that kids felt like

this white house belonged to them you

know that they felt like when they walk

into it and kids of all backgrounds felt

like this was a place that kids were

supposed to be not like peering out the

front gates but they were supposed to

walk in those doors and experience

everything that was going on in there

and that was I think of all the things

that we did the work that we were able

to do with young people there's a

fulfilling and hopefully the most

impactful work though that we did in

those eight years and they felt like oh

yeah I'm rapping in the Blue Room

rapping in the Blue Room we did a whole

design workshop where kids were draping

with designers and there were mannequins

up in the so we did a whole workshop

Anna Wintour helped to put it together

so we had some of the top designers come

it was sort of a way to kind of give an

A Maj to all the American designers who

would work with me but not to do it and

make it about me so it had to be about

kids so they all came for a day of

working with all these young designers

around the world and they were making

jewelry in different rooms and they came

together for a panel and they got to

meet Diane von Furstenberg and all these

big names came and they spent the day

with these kids and it was about them

but it was also about fashion so those

are the kind of the ways we tried I

tried to think about you know linking

the stuff that people wrote about to

something that was important there's

like okay you like my shoes but let's

teach some kids how to be designers how

do what this craft means in America that

it's a you know that it's not just about

how you look but what you do and design

and all of that was fun fun fun and and

the kids left feeling like hey I've been

to the White House they felt like they

were something special I'm in the White

House doing this we had a mentor program

that we never really publicized but I

worked every year with a group of twenty

girls from the area because mentoring

has always been a big part of my life

and brock's as well so he had some young

men that would come and they'd come once

a month they were usually kids from the

DC area not the top kids but not the

kids struggling but sort of those kids

that are just in the Middle where there

probably isn't a lot of programming for

them and they would be paired up with a

high-powered woman in the administration

Valerie Jarrett was a mentor Cris

Comerford who was the first female

executive chef at the White House who

Laura Bush appointed she was a mentor

and they meet with these kids all the

time but they would come together once a

month in the White House and it was

interesting to see the

transformation when they first start

they were shy they couldn't look me in

the eye you know they were just nervous

you know because it was nerve-racking

you're in the white house you're meeting

Michelle Obama and why were you picked

and you're wondering but we'd spend time

talking and eating popcorn and we talk

about everything and by the time they

complete it usually two years with us by

their graduation ceremony when their

parents would come they felt there was

just a shift in who they thought they

were you know they felt comfortable in

that space in that room with me

they knew that they deserved that for

themselves and it's that process of just

giving them that exposure on a regular

basis saying you are worthy I don't even

care about your grades who are you as a

person and you were worth being talked

to being listened to and they came in

and after while they owned the place

they were taken they didn't even notice

me it's like oh yeah mom that's Michelle

Obama

we're old friends now let me show you

the Blue Room I mean they just they had

a confidence and my belief for them was

that if you can walk into the White

House and look me in the eye and

introduce yourself there is no room you

cannot go in there's no room you can't

go into after that

right right before we started there was

a high school high schooler and she's

here this is her first time with

librarians / hope to recruit her there

she is there she is hi honey and of

course we hope she'll be a librarian but

but any advice you might give a high

score and she said I know about college

and what I want to do and any advice

what how old are you 17 well you're

gonna go to college right okay well

that's the first advice go to college

because you need a college education in

this day and age if you want to be

competitive right but here's the thing

there are so many different ways to get

an education we live in the United

States of America and we have wonderful

community colleges we've got four-year

colleges there's so many ways to do it

there's no one right way to do it right

you don't have to go to some four-year

school and live in a dorm if that's not

your thing it's an excellent experience

if you can do it but you have to get an

education beyond high school that is a

must a high school diploma is not enough

anymore and we want you to be the very

best you can be and be able to take care

of your family and wear nice shoes and

be all fly and have power and all that

good stuff having an education is the

key to that so good that that's my

advice in a nutshell

now

we don't have much time left but I meant

to ask you about the book I'm talking

about you know okay cuz it's coming out

in November these are like you guys

ready we want to be able to book talking

you got to give us a few things so we

can book talking that's what we do all

right oh I've given you a bit few

tidbits but you know if I were to

describe the book it's it it's a real

man ization effort because you know for

me a black woman from a working-class

background to have the opportunity to

tell her story is interestingly rare you

know I think that's why some people ask

the question how did you become here how

did you go from here to there it's sort

of like people think I'm a unicorn it's

like like I don't exist like people like

me don't exist and I know that there are

so many people in this country in this

world who feel like they don't exist

because their stories aren't told or

they think their stories aren't worthy

of being told you know in this country

we've gotten to the point where we kind

of think that there is only a handful of

legitimate stories that make you a true

American and so if you don't fall into

that narrow sort of line it's like you

don't belong but we all belong and I

think my book is just it's the

ordinariness of a very extraordinary

story and and I hope that by telling it

that it it makes others not just black

women not just black people but other

people other women people who feel

faceless and invisible and voiceless to

feel the pride in their story in the way

that I feel about mine the ordinariness

of growing up as a working-class kid

with two parents who had values they

didn't have a lot of money you know I we

grew up with music and art and love and

that was just about it and

were encouraged to get an education you

know I am NOT a unicorn there are

millions of kids like me out there and

it's just a shame that sometimes people

will see me

and they will only see my color and then

they'll make certain judgments about

that and that's dangerous for us to

dehumanize each other in that way we are

all just people you know with stories to

tell and we're flawed and broken and

there's no miracle in our stories it's

just we're living life trying to do good

and that's who this little girl in

becoming is she is becoming a lot of

things in life but the journey continues

and I hope it that it starts a

conversation about voice and it

encourages so many other people because

we need to know everyone's stories so

that we don't forget the humanity and

each other because what we've learned

Barack and I over the course of this

eight years and traveling around the

country is that Americans are good

people decent people really even if we

don't agree on politics and we have to

remember that about ourselves and

understand that that's true not just

here in America but around the world

their own there are no Devils out there

there are no people out there they're

there people who do bad things but all

of us are really just trying to figure

it out and if we've done something

really horrible it's usually because we

were broken in some way and if we

understand each other's stories and we

share those stories that maybe we can be

more empathetic maybe we can be more

inclusive maybe we can be more forgiving

and be more open so I hope that the book

encourages some conversation around

those kind of things and then you'll

hear about the China and my shoes a

couple of nice stories you know Bo and

sunny make an appearance so not to worry

they're there they're still alive doing

well by the way

thank you you got that well I just have

to tell you we are glad that you were

Michelle Obama Thank You Carla and they

are - thank you all thank you for

everything you all do keep doing the

work out in the community we need you

and that was Michelle Obama and dr.

Carla Hayden the librarian of Congress

talking at the American Library

Association's annual conference in New

Orleans in June

well Michelle Obama is currently on book

tour for becoming her memoir which is

the best-selling book of 2018 we're

going to show you several of her

appearances we were only allowed to tape

about ten minutes per appearance here

she is on the book kick off in Chicago

at the United Center with Oprah Winfrey

she made us always feel like the White

House was really our house the people's

house she is your hometown girl from the

south side of Chicago

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

okay everybody Wow United Center have a

seat we're home we're home yeah feels

good I gotta say I gotta say every time

I fly into the city because the city was

a city of so many blessings to me I get

a little lump a little flop and so when

you're flying in now coming home after

all this place has even and nurtured you

what does that feel like oh well first I

try to trace every inch when we're

flying in I try to point out all the

neighborhood's I was like okay that's

Midway I see my high school I think

that's my mom's house Oh see I still

call it the Sears Tower you know I try

to trace the outlines of my city and

find all the neighborhoods that's what

I'm doing I do that every time I'm like

looking it's like there's the lake and

do I see there's planetarium yeah

there's my school I think I could see

everything so yeah I'm tracing my life

over that city and it it always feels

good it really does okay I was coming in

tonight because as I said you I haven't

been here since the Oprah show ended I

was at the United Center and then I came

in it was 1:00 and from the cold

she's like biology but coming in and all

the banners around the stadium for

becoming people lined up to come in I

mean I was thinking about your parents

your father in particular no one could

have ever imagined

from 7436 you could have a new south

snow yes that it would be happening yeah

and of course I missed all that because

I still come in the back way through the

freight elevator by the garbage you got

to see it

Yuki that has been my life you got to

see it on the way out I'm just trying I

mask my sick can't we go out the front

door just so I can see my sign I'll be

like ma'am I'm sorry get in the car you

know I have to say that from the first

page of this book until the last you you

did it

you brought it you opened yourself up

you allowed us to see in and let us

experience the fullness of of you in a

way that I don't think anybody has ever

done before particularly who's been in a

White House and it's why I chosen is it

Oprah's Book Club selection and they

thank you by the way

well you didn't need it but okay

everybody was gonna buy the book anyway

so I understand thank you this is the

truth though anytime you're looking at

life from the outside in it always looks

like life is better over there out there

up there and you and your father used to

do with the family what my father used

to do in the Deuce and a quarter drive

around that aspirational ride

particularly on Sunday yeah uh-huh

look at other rich people's houses

mm-hmm white people mm-hmm yes and the

truth is it doesn't get any bigger than

the White House but what you allowed us

to see is that it isn't always as it

seems and that the White House is really

a paradox I'd like for you to paint the

picture for us of life inside the White

House yes Wow I describe it it's like

living in the fanciest hotel and you

have your elevator that takes you up to

your room

and there's a lobby where all the action

is going on and that's the central floor

what you see on TV about the White House

the state floor that's not the private

residence that's where all the official

stuff goes on with a Red Room in the

Blue Room in the green room and all the

rooms are the old the the East Room that

that's the ceremonial floor but then up

the next floor there are two more floors

that are the residents and those floors

are private to the families who live

there and once you get in that elevator

and you come up to that floor and those

elevators open and there's usually an

older black gentleman in a tuxedo who is

worked at the White House for decades

often through standing there a drink of

refreshment

no no just with a lovely smile okay you

know although you could have them do

that too and any time I never thought of

that

and any time I look down at any time of

the day I'm night can you just say I'd

like some refreshment you know you you

can but then you realize I write about

this yes that you pay for it

right so they tell you you can order

anything and they listen very carefully

because everybody listens to every word

that the president says and I used to

tell Barack don't say you want something

because then we'll have like thousands

of it you know and then we're paying for

it so I know it was a shock if he said

he likes some rare fish he just happened

to say this is delicious and then we get

the bill at the end of the month and

it's like you flew that fish in from

China that fish wasn't that good I said

listen everybody

don't say you like that fish everybody's

just just getting the book today so I

can see the surprise on people's faces

when you hear her say that they had to

pay for it yeah a lot of people think

you know and this is also is sort of an

interesting thing when people would say

that taxpayers are paying for that and

the truth is yes but you know you don't

pay rent and you don't pay for staff but

every thing

every dish every they they would count

the number of peanuts that you eat and

charge it back no so you'd get a bill at

the end of it it's not a you know it's

not at all we lived in a white house

y'all I mean this is not a complaint

it's just something that people don't

understand you pay for your own Charmin

you can pay for your Charmin you pay for

all your guests the food that they eat

Saul y'all came and visited when you

were thinking I'm just gonna take some

put it in the purse I was like we got

the bill no but all the official events

are paid for there's a budget for that

but all of our private meals all of our

entertaining whether we had family over

for Thanksgiving those things were paid

for but you know that's a minor part of

the experience but the house is

beautiful but it is staff and there are

people they are constantly they're chefs

and Butler's and the butler's when we

first came in wore full formal tuxedos

at all times

black men serving people in full tuxedos

who've been there for presidents like

for year after president after president

we loved the staff the butler's are

amazing the whole staff at the White

House is amazing and one of the first

things we did because we were trying to

figure out how do you make this normal

for children you know because Malia and

Sasha were 7 and 10 thank you for that

you know I won't hear the end of that

she's like mom didn't even know how old

we were they were young and we were

figuring out how do we keep them

grounded and the first thing we thought

is like they cannot you know what we're

having pancakes in the morning it's just

crazy to have a man with a tuxedo come

in when when you got some little girls

at a sleepover and you bring in in some

water that you know so we cancelled the

tuxedos it's like you'll take those

tuxedos off wear some polo shirts and

some slacks unless we did something

formal we just sort of loosened it up a

bit but other than that the White House

does feel like a home

you know and I always say that a house

is a house and what we what you bring to

the home is what makes it at home and

how we lived in that home was what I

remember most and people asked to do I

miss the White House and it's like no I

don't miss the house because we took

what was important in that house with us

and it is with us it's family its values

and the friendship so the house is

beautiful and it's historic and you know

it was an honor to live there but the

people in it make it what it is and

you're watching book TV on c-span - its

television for serious readers we're in

the midst of showing you portions of

Michelle Obama's book tour across the

country well she sold out Capital One

Arena in Washington DC twice and we want

to show you those appearances now

[Applause]

[Laughter]

hey honey hey my love here we are this

is so exciting we are in this town that

has become your town yeah we are with

all these amazing people and the thing

that I think is so extraordinary as we

keep discussing is we are here to talk

about a book it's something all these

people are here because you know buddy's

twerkin no there's no tricking we are

reading that's right that's right

we're all reading and so no costumes no

no no costume changes sorry y'all but

you know we've been talking about this

and I've been thinking so much that the

the the extraordinary presidency comes

to an end you and we're going to talk

about transitions and swerves in life

but your time to make another transition

and what you decide you want to do is

write this book yeah why did you do that

well first of all it was sort of an

assignment right because every first

lady is supposed to write a book and I

think they've done it for quite some

time so it was one of those okay I'm

supposed to now write about this and

that's one thing the other thing as I've

told some young girls that I talked

about I thought about this book and

thought how many times does a black

woman get to tell her full story herself

in a way that's going to be read

potentially by millions of people so I

thought to myself let me you know take

this seriously I want to make sure that

this isn't just a chronology of things

that happened in the White House because

what I've learned over the years what

I've learned from my parents is that to

understand one's life you you have to

understand the context of it so for

people to understand what I got from the

eight years in the White House they not

they'd have to know all of my story that

I'm to understand the neighborhood that

I grew up in the family that built me

the values we were raised on the

challenges that I faced and I wanted the

book to be very readable I wanted it to

feel like a story so that

people of all backgrounds and young

folks of all ages could sort of follow

this journey of this little girl

Michelle Robinson who had very much an

ordinary life but took it took many

extraordinary turns and as my brother

said on the clip I want I wanted my

story to to be an example to many that

we all deserve and are worthy of an

amazing extraordinary life and the

stories that we all have in us you know

those small memories are really what

make us who we are it's not the eight

years in the White House that define me

that just happened to be part of my

journey so much more of Who I am comes

in the first three sections of this book

and I wanted the people to understand

that and and so what you've given us is

a story of this ordinary extraordinary

girl in a way that all of us I think can

read into the ordinariness of living

near your cousin's having dinner at a

certain time having a relative who's a

little bit cranky but who's still a part

of the fold all of these particulars are

something I think that that give people

an American coming-of-age story and the

fact that that is a black woman's

coming-of-age story for everyone to

identify with I think is an

extraordinary feat and as you know I

think you have written a work of

American literature for which I thank

you well that that means a lot coming

from my friend who is a literary

amazingness person in her own words the

truth is the truth is the truth and so

this story begins with my little

invisible pretend best friend Michelle

Robinson I wish we had known each other

when we were five years I know that

would have been so good it would have

been so wonderful because you are my

favorite little girl this little girl is

very determined

she's single-minded she's fierce she has

a rich interior life oh yeah she lives

in a close-knit family and you

live on on in an iconic place the south

side of Chicago outside South that's

right one of the America's great

metropolis is we are biased South siders

of Chicago but when I think back on my

life in the community that I was raised

in the truth is is that when you read

about my community it feels like so many

communities in this country you know it

was a working-class neighborhood of

peace some people who own their homes

some people who didn't

it was very racially diverse when we

first moved in as you can see from my

kindergarten classroom pictures there

were people with all kinds of last names

consul Ponce in Abu Asaf sand dempsey's

and Robinson's we were all sharing the

space together and living in a very

vibrant community and I was in and out

of the homes of all these kids you know

we grew up in a time where you know if

you got into some trouble you could

count on the neighbor lady calling up

your mother a stopping by and telling on

you and you couldn't talk back to the

neighbor lady you know you had to listen

to what other adults you had to respect

what other adults in your life had to

say about you we can get an amen on that

right but it wasn't just the people that

was sort of the sights and sounds I mean

we had a park down the street that had a

men's softball league that played at

Knights in the summers and I remember

falling asleep on the screened-in porch

because we didn't have air conditioning

and when you didn't have air

conditioning you slept on a porch we

spent on the porch had many a great

night on the porch just falling asleep

to the sounds of people cheering on

their teams you know we had the liquor

store on the corner that sold bread and

penny candy that's what your mother sent

you to get Newport cigarettes and you

could get a week's worth of candy with a

quarter and I remember getting my latest

now later

only recently you know not so recently I

realized that they were now or later but

we didn't say it like that

he said that's right it's Annihilator

can and the flavor was great it was

great colors yeah I want red and I think

like a lot of people in working-class

families we lived in a community of

relatives you know people didn't live on

their own you know you lived with an

elder and every elder in our family had

somebody who lived with them we lived

with a great on above in a very small

house but she owned the home she allowed

my parents to live there with little

rent because my parents moved to the

neighborhood to put us in better public

schools around the corner was my

maternal grandmother who lived with an

aunt around the other corner was my

maternal grandfather they were divorced

but they never just talked but they

lived around the corner from each other

mm-hmm you know you just learned that

they didn't talk and what we thought was

light years away was my father's family

they lived basically like five minutes

away but it felt like a big trip when we

went over to dandy and grandmas because

she had to get in the car to see them

but I grew up with a community of

cousins and cousins of cousins and

people who probably weren't your cousin

but they were your cousins

the story never really got fully

explained they're all your cousins

and music was a big part of my life I

write about my father who was a lover of

jazz and if you grow up with a father

you know of art that generation that's

when you play records on the stereo and

you actually actually had to sit there

and listen to them and learn how to put

the needle on the record player without

scratching it yes because you'd get in

trouble if you scratched up your

father's records and and

you had to listen to the whole album you

couldn't pick up and put it in the

middle on this song you like in the

beginning wait until your song came on

that you weren't in the bathroom when it

came on can we start it over nope no

gotta wait till we get to the end and

some of that to that music you listen to

with Southside you're grab great I loved

all the men in my life and this is

something yeah I point out because when

people talk about what what makes a girl

strong and a lot of times you look to

the mother and my mother definitely did

that there were strong women in my

family but I was surrounded men by a lot

of men who loved me and treated me well

and respected me I didn't know and and

and I didn't realize until I got older

how rare that is for a young woman to

grow up safe and loved by the men in her

life and that's a sad statement for us

as a society as a world quite frankly

but I was one of the fortunate ones who

grew up with both of her grandfather's

men who adored me in South Side I would

spend whole Saturdays with him

they were working-class folks who

managed without a lot of money without

degrees and connections to provide us

with a home full of stability

consistency love guidance values and

what they remind me and should remind

everybody is it doesn't take a lot of

stuff to raise good kids you know you

don't have to be titled to do the job of

good parenting and my parents did that

my father was a stationary fireman his

whole life worked the same job until the

day he died and my father was the oldest

of five my mother was the middle child

of seven and my father was the rock for

so many not just us but for his brothers

and his sisters he was

he was a giver you know I say in the

book that he believed that time was a

gift you give others and he gave and he

gave and he gave he was that person that

everybody would gather around in his

recliner they would come and bring the

girlfriends so he could check them out

and they'd ask him for advice and he was

a visitor you know he visited everybody

and oftentimes he dragged me along with

him on a Saturday where I would be

sitting on some plastic sofa you know

the feeling

some ladies house with a little little

cup of 7up and I would listen to him

visit and visit and visit but my dad was

a storyteller and he was courageous and

he also had MS which was only part of

his story and probably something I

didn't realize that he struggled so

mightily with as a young person because

my father was somebody who wasn't going

to complain you know he wasn't going to

seek professional help for his disease

which was a frustration to all of us he

was going to get up and go to work and

earn a salary and we were his world he

invested everything he had in us and any

other kid that came his way so I learned

to be a storyteller I learned to be a

listener I learned to be a giver from

watching him and then there was my mom

Marion who is as I described her in the

book she just had a Zen neutrality in

her ability to parent and she taught us

responsibility at an early age she was

the kind of mother I think we were about

seven or eight when she gave us alarm

clocks and she was like you're gonna

wake yourselves up because as my mom

said I'm raising adults not babies so

she taught us how to think for ourselves

in an early age and I think the thing

that I want to share with people I've

shared in the book that I want to say

about my parents is that they valued our

voices from an early age we were not

shushed

we were allowed to speak our minds and

to ask questions they encouraged our

curiosity they told us the truth and

they told us the context of people's

existence so if there was the crazy

uncle there the funny you know cousin

they'd explain to us that history so

that we could understand why they landed

where they were so I think because of

the two of them and we as Craig said my

brother said on the video we we were

successful because of these two

hard-working good valued folks and I

wish my dad could be here to see all

this how proud would he be of you yeah

so there was Michelle there was Craig

your brother who at one point you even

shared a bedroom with oh yeah what was

he like as a big brother and how did he

add to this equation of this family he

was my protector

you know I joked when I was on some show

this week because I've been on a lot of

them I can't even remember which one I

was Robin Robinson Robin Roberts

he was my he's the favorite okay and

that's okay he's my mother's favorite

she won't admit it but he knows it I

know it you know and I tell her all the

time it's like what do I have to do I'm

the first lady I live in the White House

[Music]

you know I'm taking her to China I'm

like you know she's meeting the Pope and

at Thanksgiving it still wins Craig

coming I'm like

I really really care but the thing is is

that I adore him too so I can't be too

bad at him and and here's the thing I

want to tell you about Craig he was he

and my father treated me as an equal and

that's so important for fathers to

understand about girls it's like having

a strong girl isn't just about having a

strong mother it's about having men in

their lives who loved them and respect

them so when my father taught my brother

to do anything whether it was boxing or

learning how to throw a fastball or

running bases I was right there with him

and my brother encouraged it he wasn't

like this this is not for girls we

didn't deal with that kind of stuff so

having men in my life who loved me from

the start and then I had a whole

community of men who loved me I had my

grandfathers and my uncles one of who is

here one of my favorite uncle's are here

and he knows who he is I grew up with

men who took care of me and looked out

for me so my bar was really high by the

time I was getting out in the world so

education was also important to your

family and early on in about second

grade something happened that really

changed your trajectory tell us a little

bit about what was going on back in

those early days well this is also a

story about this gives you some insight

into who my mother is as well but we

grew up in a neighborhood called South

Shore on the south side of Chicago yes

South Shore in the house we are

everywhere on the south side we just

come everywhere but when we moved into

the neighborhood it was a mixed

neighborhood mixed race neighborhood and

it was working class to middle class

which is one of the reasons why we moved

there to go

better schools we lived with my aunt

Robbie and she was a teacher so she was

able to own her own home she was married

to my uncle

we called him Tara he was a Pullman

Porter so they had a stable income and

was able to buy a house in South Shore

so the neighborhood was mixed and that

meant the schools were mixed so in

kindergarten and first grade my

classrooms I put a school picture in my

book to show you the diversity that was

there but what was going on in the 70s

was what we call white flight and all my

little white friends that I had and I

had plenty of them they started

literally disappearing before my eyes

and I didn't realize until I grown up

and learned about segregation and the

whole issue of pushing folks fleeing out

of communities as black families moved

in was that the neighborhood was

starting to change and so we started to

feel though those effects not just in

friends leaving but Adi investment

disinvestment in the neighborhood and we

felt it in the school so second grade

comes around and it was the first time I

was in a chaotic classroom you know

where erasers were flying and teachers

weren't teaching and I knew this as a

second grader and I would come home with

my little lunch my bologna and I'd come

sitting because you came home for lunch

back then lived around the corner we

turn on all my children and we'd watch

the shows and I'd have my bologna

sandwich and I would complain be like

mom this class you will never believe it

we didn't even get homework and I was

that kind of kid you know I was like we

are not learning enough in this class

how will we make it in third grade I was

this kind of worrier it's like

what we our friends saying who you

brought home with you they were all

saying because we had we had girls that

came with us we traveled in packs and we

were all complain and it's like this

isn't we this needs to change and and we

were just complaining and my mom did the

mom thing of like and we thought she was

just listening and just you know

humoring us but little did we know she

was back up at that school and she was

making some moves and what happened was

that a few of us got tested out into the

third grade

because of my mother and the advocacy of

other mothers but I tell this story

because I knew even at that age that I

wasn't being invested in as a second

grader and sometimes we like to pretend

that kids don't know when they're being

shortchanged and devalued and I'm here

to tell you that I knew that at second

grade so as we look at school inequality

and things aren't right kids know when

they are not being valued and it and it

makes them feel some kind of way and I

was lucky to have gotten out of that

classroom and into a better classroom

but that wouldn't have happened if I

didn't have a parent at home who was

also one of my fiercest advocates and

understood the difference between

whining and real distress and that was

the former first lady during her book

tour appearances in Washington DC now

book TV covered several of these

appearances but we were only allowed to

tape about ten minutes of each she also

stopped in Philadelphia and here she is

in conversation with comedian and author

Phoebe Robinson there is so much I want

to talk to you about tonight your book

becoming is literally life-changing I

really do feel that way it's so

incredible and smart and wonderful

there's a lot of stuff I want to cover

but I'm gonna come out hot out the gate

okay with a topic that's a

controversial just the way we like it

hi hi so stick with me um Thanksgiving

was last week yeah and I remembered

four years ago when you're being

interviewed by Robin Roberts on ABC you

and Barack and she asked you guys this

question so let's take a look how it

turned out oh it's tur stuffing favorite

pie pumpkin for Thanksgiving okay okay

so let's talk to me can be freeze back

on him that is that's not Michelle

that's a little fun being like what the

hell every woman knows that look when it

comes to her band it's just like wow

they're people looking at their men like

that tonight I can't can't believe you

just said that did you feel pretty

betrayal when he picked pumpkin pie what

you know that's sort of that's Barack

swervy wades pumpkin pie in the Robinson

household we do sweet potato yeah

I didn't even really know there was

pumpkin pie so I left home I didn't even

know what that was the concept of

pumpkin in a pie no no sweet potato pie

it's like I look at him like you know

better than that

okay so I'll can decide let's dive in I

want to just kick off with another

extraordinary achievement in your life

it just seems to never stop but your

book becoming sold 2 million copies and

the first two E's thank you guys that's

so incredible that's y'all thank you

it's almost Christmas yes it's a few

more weeks thank you though

it's amazing and so it's so exciting

making your Times bestsellers list and

you know as I'm also a writer and I've

also made that list and I know in the

industry like publishing that is so

predominantly white to have someone of

your stature have this kind of success I

think really means a lot and speaks a

lot to the industry to say people want

to hear stories from everyone yes so how

do you how do you feel like the success

of your book is gonna impact the

industry and also I think inspire future

authors of color and women of women as

well to want to get into the writing

game well I think the success of the

book speaks to what I've always known

about this country and this country is

open to so many people in so many ways

and people are curious about other

people's stories I mean that's what I

experienced when I first campaign for

Barack and Iowa the notion that there's

a little girl from the south side of

Chicago who at the time was named

Michelle Obama berry to Barack Hussein

Obama was going to dive deep into the

Midwest in Iowa going door-to-door in

people's homes and they were opening up

their homes and welcoming me around

their kitchen tables and what

connected us was our story

it was our shared stories of the stuff

that I put in this book you know it

wasn't what degree I had it wasn't what

school I went to it wasn't what career I

had it was what was our food like what

was that kitchen table conversation like

what was the relationship with my

favorite what relative like what were

our neighborhoods like the sights and

the smells and that's the commonality

that we share across this country it is

not race it is not gender it's not

religion it's the stories that make us

who we are and the fact that this is

resonating with so many different people

just reinforces what I know is true

about this country so yes I think that

is now incumbent upon us to stop being

afraid of our stories and to know that

there are so many ways to live a life

and is up to us to share it with one

another and know that we won't be judged

or criticized or looked upon oddly so

now we have to dig deep and and and know

our stories and be ready to put them on

the table so yes hopefully there's room

for more excellent that's amazing thank

you so much you know we all know you as

you know am I paying the best first lady

of all time

[Applause]

you know and we know you as a public

figure as a fashion icon as a

philanthropist there's a lot of things

that we know about you but I wouldn't go

back to the beginning as you just being

this little girl growing up in Chicago

and and you're during - how you became a

koko Khaleesi in my opinion koko

Khaleesi you may need to explain that

anybody watch Game of Thrones ok I told

you when you mentioned that I'm not a

game of Thrones person don't stone me

I've been busy but you have nailing that

to me

so Michelle Khaleesi is a white woman

but you are a koko Khaleesi see the

number one Coco Lee sees some powerful

woman it's just yes you are like the

boss ok I'll take it yeah the boss beep

I don't want to Kirk can I can't curse

here no I know when I don't want to get

kicked off the stage but I want you to

take us back to you growing up sort of

your journey like what was your

childhood like in Chicago tell us about

your parents and how they informed you

yeah I grew up on the south side I know

we've got some South siders and the

south side of Chicago my neighborhood is

like so many neighborhoods right we grew

up in the 70s where there was mixed

income and folks had jobs and they took

care of their lawns and they planted

flowers and kids went to school and they

listened to adults

so when somebody told you to get off

their lawn and you didn't they were

going to tell your mother and your

mother wouldn't curse them out they

would actually beat your behind

we're not listening to visco and so you

know we rode our bikes I had one of

those banana bikes with the seats mine

was white and purple with the big

handlebars and the big deal was not just

learning how to ride a two-wheeler

but being allowed to ride around the

block that was a big deal we had our

corner store where you could get milk

and bread we also called it the liquor

store because they sold liquor but there

were people who went there for liquor

but most people went there for Wonder

Bread and that's where your mother would

send you and you could also get your

penny candy back then I used to get for

a quarter you could get a bag of candy

including your Nile Eaters I don't know

if you all knew and know anything about

Nile laters it wasn't until I was like

thirty that I realized that it was

called now or later I just thought it

was one word not later

[Applause]

so you'd sit on the front porch with

your friends and there was a park down

the street where there was a men's

soccer softball league and I remember

going to sleep to the sound of men

cheering and playing sports but we were

poor folks we lived in a home above a

great-aunt because that's how we grew up

on the south side everybody lived within

a 5-mile radius

I had cousins around the corner

everybody lived with an elder so my

grandmother lived with a with a nod my

grandfather lived with an uncle and we

were all a part of this big unit where

you know you'd gather in one place in

the gathering place in my family what

South Side's house for those of you who

ever at the book my maternal grandfather

who was like the heart and soul of the

family he was a lover of jazz and I

would spend Saturdays with him and his

dog Rex because I still wanted a dog my

mother didn't let me have a dog but

Southside let me have his dog and you've

been watching former First Lady Michelle

Obama in Philadelphia on her book tour

for becoming her memoir has become the

best-selling book of 2018 selling nearly

three million copies since its debut in

November she and President Barack Obama

received about 60 million dollars in

advance for their memoirs from penguin

Random House now book TV covered five of

her appearances the next one is from

Brooklyn

[Applause]

we're in BK this is lyocell happening

hey honey

hello darling here we are thank you for

being here I am so excited to be here we

are gonna have another conversation

let's talk that's right we have a lot to

talk about very very very big night and

where I wanted to start us off is

thinking about this moment in your life

here we are all of these people are in a

stadium because of a book and so you

know I have to start us there because

there are so many ways that you have

shared your knowledge your grace your

power your inspiration with your

individual communities starting with the

people who love you up close and moving

out in radiating circles to the whole

world who you are up close is who you

are

writ large and that's an extraordinary

thing to see and what I think is amazing

about what you decided to do after the

White House years is you decided to

write a real book yeah you decided not

to write a book that hit certain First

Lady marks but rather a book that I want

to tell you all and you have not yet

read this book this is an important work

of American literature okay this is a

coming-of-age story a girlhood to

womanhood story of finding your power

story and ultimately a story that like

so many great works of literature helps

us know ourselves better so why did you

decide that you wanted to write this

kind of book when you did it was the

only way I can write a book because for

those of you who haven't read the book

what you'll see as I started telling the

story that the least important part of

the book was the eight years that I was

first lady that was just a part of a

bigger story and for people to

understand how I got there the context

was important in my life because I know

it's important in everyone's life you

know the real meat of our lives come

in those little moments that you see it

in the first section in the section

second section you know the stories

about real life the real stories not

your stats not you know where you went

to school and how much money you make

and what kind of occupation you have but

it's it's it's sort of what are the

sights and smells of your life you know

who are the people that touched you you

know what relationship did you have with

your father what was your first fight

you know what was your neighborhood like

what did it feel like what were those

sounds that's what makes us who we are

that's what made me who I am so you

don't understand Michelle Obama the

first lady unless you understand Miche

little Michelle Robinson who grew up on

the south side in a working-class

community we went to public school you

know who had her ups and downs and you

know here's the thing that I want people

to understand it's like people are

really interested in that part of our

stories and and I wrote this book and

hopefully as a way to let people know

that we need to tap into the stories

that we have you know and and and not

only be willing to understand those

stories to understand the journeys that

we've all gone on to get us to where we

are now but then you have to have the

courage to share them because that's

when you really know people you know

that that's when you you can tap into

their real essence and I and I hope by

being as vulnerable about all of my life

the highs and the lows the

embarrassments the challenges the

struggles that people would understand

that that just opens you up to Who I am

so there's no need to hide that stuff

for any of us that's what connects us so

my hope is that this book will inspire

everyone to tap into their own journeys

of becoming and to share those stories

with one another and I think you know

starting as you do on the south side of

Chicago without side side with the left

you say South Side but we're actually in

New York so we can only say it a few

times because then they'll start talking

about the whole New York thing -

Brooklyn

everybody's got their neighborhood

that's it my - happened to be the south

side and that little girl who I loved so

much who who I claim as the the

childhood best friend in my mind a

little Michelle Robinson was an amazing

little girl and as you described her an

ordinary extraordinary little girl like

so many of us and that there are so many

things about your life living within

five blocks of cousins and extended

family having those family members who

are sometimes coming with their feelings

or their anger or their outside miss but

still they're part of the fabric of the

family and listening as you write so

beautifully to the sounds of striving

yeah right listening to that all around

you talk about that and about that that

world

well my neighborhood was like most

neighborhoods you know not just in

cities but in in rural communities you

know you you we grew up with family and

everyone lived with an elder I lived

with my great-aunt

I had another aunt who lived with a

grandmother another couple of aunts and

uncles live with my grandfather south

side we all live in the same community

and we grew up in a time when you

respected your elders you know even in

the neighborhood when you were playing

around and if you ran over somebody's

grass or did something wrong

neighbor lady X was going to tell your

mother hmm

and your mother wasn't gonna curse her

out for telling you she was gonna come

home and beep your behind because you're

supposed to listen to neighbor ladx you

know and it was a community it was a it

my my neighbourhood South Shore was a

vibrant diverse community a

working-class neighborhood where people

own their homes it was it was a diverse

until 2nd grade right before white

flight set in that's when white folks

felt comfortable sort of living with us

in our neighborhoods and then people

like us moved in and they they fled so

you can see that in my class pictures in

my early grade in kindergarten you can

see that there are kids of all

backgrounds and we all played together

and we were at each other's homes and

little did I know that people were

whispering in their ear Realtors saying

get out because this is turning into a

ghetto you better run and by the time I

was in eighth grade as you can see in

this picture this the neighborhood was

all all-black and that sort of

sociological phenomenon of white flight

has gone on in countries in communities

all over the country and I stopped here

because I I just want us to understand

that in that time people were afraid of

us right now let's just hold that

thought because we we're sort of going

through that right now where we are

telling ourselves are being told that we

need to be afraid of people who don't

look like us who don't speak the same

language or because somehow we are to be

feared there were white folks who were

afraid of Michelle and Craig and Marian

and Frazier and Southside and I want us

to hold on to that because that still

goes on that sort of notion that people

look at the color of your skin and they

make assumptions about who you were they

didn't know our values they didn't know

that we were kids striving to be good

that our father was hard work and they

didn't care they were running from our

race and we still do that so I grew up

in what was a vibrant community but as

it started to become more more more

black you know we could see the

deterioration and you could feel it you

could feel it in the school system as

people were taking money out of the

schools you could see it and the

attitudes of the school teachers towards

us I could see it as a young child I

I was that kid who would come home I

came home from second grade just all

disgusted at the fact that we weren't

learning in the second grade

I would come home and slide to mom we

didn't get homework again last night

yeah I don't know how we're gonna be

prepared for third grade this is

outrageous I was a bad kid and your

mother wonderfully always said I wasn't

raising children I was raising adults

she was raising it though so she taught

us to express ourselves and to speak our

minds but to do it politely but at the

same time she was a mother who

fortunately because my father worked so

hard allowed my mother to stay home from

work so she was one of those handful of

mothers in the schools who were looking

out not just for her kids but for all

the kids who didn't have parents who

could be at home and she went up to that

school and because she she heard my cry

and she took my complaint seriously and

I say this to say that parents can be

advocates in some very powerful ways

early on for kids when they're young and
