all right don't want to inflate him so

everything we see in the universe the

Stars the planets the galaxies the

plants the rocks the plows us everything

you say it's me or the front of this

book is there's what you call the

product of a remarkable asymmetry of

matter over antimatter what did you mean

by that

oh can I just say something about your

introduction if I may you man so I I'm

impressed by your persistent skepticism

of all things I say reporters have to

you you can never really believe you

have to check and verify hmm okay you

just get you you're right every time

though so far I mean how can I possibly

just come up with that unless it was

correct what that a building ticks offs

by the second you're ridiculous

but when they built the building did you

think well I have a wonderful idea what

I saw half a foot Charles maybe we'll

get those second on the celestial clock

okay

I don't think so yeah no I'm sure it was

not on purpose it just is as so much of

the universe is so profound asymmetry so

you just went right into the stuff yeah

well okay just a quick note yeah that

this title astrophysics for people in a

hurry

I've had people joke with me about it

say Oh was astrophysics for dummies'

already taken you know and I just wanted

to make it clear that first yes it was

taken but but there's nothing I don't

think there's anything quote dumbed down

about the astrophysics in this book it's

all sort of curated legitimate full up

astrophysics in an attempt to sort of

grant the reader a degree of fluency in

modern astrophysics so like the next

morning at the water cooler

you could just be talking about yeah

like there are things in here that I had

never heard of really and you get around

I get around yeah you get around so I'm

gonna be checked but so in the in the

early universe the temperature was very

hot and above certain thresholds of

temperature what happens as matter no

longer stays as matter they can freely

move back and forth between itself and

energy and we have the recipe for this

it comes from e equals mc-squared

we all know that equation it's the

formal conversion recipe for matter and

energy and this C squared is the speed

of light squared is a huge number a

little bit of mass times that huge

number gives you a lot of energy we

don't experience in our lives equals MC

squared because the energy in which

we're immersed is not high enough to

enable matter to go back and forth

between energy and itself that's why it

took so long to discover equals MC

squared and to come to terms and to come

to understand it but it is a profound

equation that manifests from the

beginning of time all the way

to the future of the universe but not in

our life experience alright so and also

let me preface it by saying in one of

the opening pages of the book is what

you call it the uber know the what's the

beginning the publishers have a word for

the page that has a thing on it yeah

well it says that's the dedication for

all those who has the dedication or you

want to read it ok I mean for all those

who are too busy to read fat books and

yet nonetheless seek a conduit to the

cosmos yeah that's not what I was

looking for them to pages beyond two

pages beyond yeah contents yeah preface

preface okay oh yes the universe is

under no obligation to make sense to you

yeah that's it signed by you make that

clear

so the universe is under no obligation

to make sense to any of us so I will be

saying things and you'll say that

doesn't make sense just remember what I

just said okay okay what we've learned

is that the universe is what we measure

it to be not what we want it to be not

what feels good not what only has to

make sense to our five senses our five

biological senses forged in the plains

of Africa you know a million years ago

half a million years ago I would

whatever what's the latest the

biologists tell us is those senses to

prevent us from getting eaten by a lion

are very different from what you need to

grasp the universe and so this is why

mathematics is so potent because it

takes us out of our senses and enables

us to still probe the reality of what

the universe is so here's what goes on

if matter and energy can go back and

forth this is how that works I have a

blob of energy and it decides that it

wants to become matter and it does so

all this energy becomes matter but I

mean it decides

it goes and then it thinks what should I

like to be today it happens

spontaneously and it depends on what the

temperature is oh cool cool

what's it it's hot many kids you know

yeah so if the temperature drops too low

then it's not gonna happen the energy

will stay energy and whatever matter was

around at that time

we'll stay matter so watch what happens

we now have high enough energy that if

you convert it up this pocket of energy

into mass equals MC squared you get

enough mass to create particles out of

it okay mm-hmm so get a very low take of

an electron for example that's very low

mass among atomic subatomic particles so

you can ask how much energy does it take

to make an electron write that number

down if you don't have that much energy

around you your energy will never become

a particle hmm ever okay so in the early

universe there was so much energy every

particle could be made so watch what

happens you have a pocket of energy it

becomes mass and the only way we know

that can happen is if if it becomes a

particle and an antiparticle pair matter

and antimatter antimatter is the

opposite of the first thing yes in every

measurable way okay so the opposite of

an electron is a positron it looks just

like an electron but among other things

it has the opposite charge of an

electron positron okay every particle

has an anti particle does a neutron have

an anti neutral yes there's a proton

I've an antiproton yes and so you might

say well what's the opposite charge of a

neutron the neutron has no charge no but

you look at what the neutron is made of

it's made of quarks that have fractional

charges that cancel each other to get

zero net charge on the neutron so an

anti neutron has all those same quarks

but the antimatter version of those

on the inside what will happen if these

two kiss if you take matter and

antimatter and put them together they

annihilate and become pure energy and

the matter disappears entirely what I

mean disappeared some thing over oh no

not even I'll go little not a light a

photon some yes yes so you take the

particles matter antimatter identical

Porto's other than except that their

matter antennae bring them together they

disappear and that matter becomes energy

and all that's left is energy right in

that pocket right there that happens all

the time in the center of the Sun it

happened everywhere in the early

universe now here's the run you have all

these photons of light oh by the way I

have a photon joke can I tell it tell

the foots ok photon checks into a hotel

not a bar it can't be racy because a fan

this is a family I got this ok I got I

got this

folks hunt checks into a hotel the

bellhop hat comes up and says do you

have any luggage and the photo says no

I'm traveling light

and if the bellhop were here tonight

he's left a big fat lab so when I say

pocket of energy let's just simply refer

to photons because they carry energy all

right so a photon turns into matter it's

a matter of antimatter pair matter

antimatter come together they make a

photon it's symmetric okay okay so basic

that mean that if every matter part met

every antimatter part they all would be

left with just light yes there would be

no matter in the universe only light oh

okay so now as in let there be light

yes except there's nothing else after

that it's a sort of a very short store

let there be light and we're done yeah

start over yeah yeah yeah yeah that

would be a very short Genesis right

there so so you have all this energy in

the form of photons becoming matter and

back and forth and there it goes as the

temperature of the universe dropped you

reach a point where you can no longer

make particles with the energy you have

but you have all these matter and

antimatter particle pairs that

eventually find one another and

annihilate and make a photon but we're

still cooling the universe so according

to our known laws of physics in the

cooling universe every matter and

antimatter particle pair would have

annihilated made a photon the photon

would have cooled and no more matter

would have been made and we would have

had an entire universe of just light but

it is not the universe we occupy

we should start it like a band you know

no I'm saying if we apparently are the

exception yes yes so mysteriously we

call it symmetry breaking just because

we don't that's what if what happened

we're just describing what happened not

that we fully understand why it happened

one out of basically a million of these

reactions one out of a million the

photon did not make a matter/antimatter

pair it just made a matter particle it

was very you're trying to find out why

yeah and I'm just saying it is that okay

so one out of about a million makes a

matter particle without the antimatter

counterpart so now the dance card the

dance hall has nine hundred and ninety

nine thousand partners that can pair out

of nine hundred and ninety nine nine

thousand yes well not thousand nine

hundred ninety-nine yeah it is one left

over so everybody else becomes light and

that one has no antimatter particle to

mate with

and it is frozen out of the universe and

has become all the matter that we know

and see today so everything that we are

is a profound asymmetry on the early

universe we're the stuff that didn't get

a date correct

doesn't that strike you as an extremely

fragile interpretation of all that there

is I mean it's like being around by the

skinny skinny skin of your chinny

Chinchin whatever that thing is except

in the concept of multiverse we would

have many many universes all the laws of

physics don't have to be the same in

each universe so there could be plenty

of universes wherever the dance card was

full and they just have light in them

and you are not in that universe saying

that it was just a chance occurrence oh

well you are in the universe

we're not the other ones I'm just

interested that our universe the one

that we know and live in is such a

fragile arrangement no it's not

well it doesn't have to be it may be but

it doesn't have to be and it is unlikely

to be and can I give an obscure example

that will settle this yeah okay okay

line up a thousand people and give them

a coin and everybody's had flip the coin

and about half will get tails half will

get it if you got tails sit down those

500 left approximately mm-hmm have them

flip half get heads have it 250 of you

sit down never left or to it do it again

go from 250 to 125 to 60 to 30 15 to 8

to 4 to 2 to 1 okay in this experiments

not a it's not a unthinkable experiment

mm-hmm this person who survived this

exercise flipped heads 10 consecutive

times

now here is what journalists do they go

up to that person and they say how do

you feel well I knew I had felt that

heads energy halfway through and I and I

was feeling it can I did they ask anyone

else if they felt well that heads energy

no they only interviewed that guy

wait so that person says boy I was lucky

to flip heads ten consecutive times well

every time essentially every time you do

this experiment somebody's going to flip

heads ten consecutive times so you want

to say oh this is a special universe in

which that happened no no because of the

the nature of the the fact that you have

a thousand experiments happening all the

time there's gonna be one where somebody

flips head heads ten consecutive times

every time you do this experiment that

does not make it special just because

somebody flips heads take ten

consecutive times every time you do the

experiment so your inner universe where

this weird thing happens at the

beginning and you want to feel all feel

all heads energy about it and I'm saying

in a multiverse that could be 999

universes where that did not happen and

you're in the one that did and you want

special credit for it I'm not giving it

to you let me move on to another thought

in this second sort of section of this

book I I this is something I hadn't

really occurred to me I mean once I know

it doesn't I just meant the next thing I

noticed

that understand the book yeah is that

allowed

oh if you didn't know it you all get

like a free book tonight did you know

this okay everybody

excuse me just to be clear I signed

every one of your books okay and those

are the the books that are part of that

series if you look on that page that are

signed there six or seven cities there

are gonna be each in each one of those

cities giving one talk and all those

books are signed and I'm not signing any

other books but those so so limited

edition yeah basically that's right if

you open your book and your name your

signature his signature is not in there

and you're the only one you can go off

and start speaking of universes there

there was a time when people believed

that the heavens up there were the

province of God and whatever was going

on in there was unknowable and it would

be basically sinful to find out you

point out that that with gravity well

but just briefly Newton comes along and

then everything changes yeah yes so you

look up and the planets are going

forward against the background stars and

then backwards and what we call it

there's a word for that retrograde and

they do a loop-the-loop and nobody

understands it and the fact that no one

understands it is presented as evidence

in some bits of scholarship as evidence

for the divinity of the heavens because

that is the handiwork of God and we are

mortal and God is immortal and

omniscient and so we can't possibly know

the mind of God so he just content just

in your ignorance watching planet there

was some attempts at this with the

geocentric epicycles and all this but

this was a it was well accepted that

you'll never understand Newton comes

along writes down equations of motion

equations of gravity and kind of on a

dare he invents in

Grillin differential calculus then he

turned 26 this is why Isaac Newton is my

man just to make that clear okay

among many reasons but so he writes down

these equations and he can now

demonstrate full knowledge of how why

and where and what the planets are doing

and so potent was his new theory of

gravity that it worked for moons of

Jupiter orbiting Jupiter not just

planets orbiting the Sun and this was

the first indication maybe this is not

just a local truth that maybe it applies

across the universe and this was a

little bit of heresy thought by some

that in fact Newton was accused by some

say Isaac you've left nothing for God to

do and that's simultaneously a dig at

him but also quite a compliment that he

can actually understand the mind of God

well that's this is where it got

interesting then you went off I mean

everybody knows that gravity is

apparently is ubiquitous and universal

but then you wouldn't ask about

chemistry and physics constants and and

we thought about that before is is the

chemistry of the Sun and the chemistry

of the earth and the chemistry of the

farthest thing you can think of are the

laws about bonds and pairings and so

they are the same everywhere without

exception it was not obvious there's not

there's no tablet in the sky that

required that the laws of physics we

discover on Earth's surface would apply

elsewhere if they were different on

earth than on the moon and on a Sun and

I suppose we could deal with that but

what a remarkable fact that it is the

same oh wait a second like you've seen

that thing on on Jupiter that storm that

never quits the big red thing the big

yeah we call it the Red Spot on Jupiter

we call it Jupiter's red spot okay

because that's how we roll that thing

spots on the Sun sunspots sink feet see

how any geologists or chemists in the

audience geologists but but can she be

jealous of this fact because you guys

name stuff that nobody knows what the

hell you're talking about

okay you know it's suspicious to you

that a storm there could go on for 350

years without a break and we never have

storms that go on for 350 years without

a break we don't even have storms that

go on for like six weeks without a break

so first of all these storms are when we

have storms it's in our atmosphere

mm-hmm so it's gas yeah we rotate once a

day and so that rotation creates a what

we call a Coriolis force which moving

air air that moves from one latitude to

another actually has its direction

deflected because of this Coriolis force

and this is why storms rotate in one

direction counterclockwise in the

Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the

southern hemisphere just a quick aside I

I was channel surfing one day waiting

for a movie to come on at the top of the

hour I had 15 minutes I hit a football

game and they just ended the game at a

tie and they just started overtime I

said it's about right let me just watch

this how bad could it be

after the necessary exchange of

possession it became sudden-death

overtime and then one of the teams

Cincinnati Bengals got within 50 yards

and they kicked the field goal and the

ball rotated up it hit the left upright

of the goalpost and went in and I said

wait a minute and I said which stadium

is this what's the latitude and I looked

at the orientation of the stadium I did

a calculation and then I tweeted and I

said

the the the overtime winning field goal

by the Cincinnati Bengals was likely

aided by a 1/3 of an inch deflection to

the right imparted by Earth's rotation

which has lost in my people home at the

local sports channels and and and so the

point is if if if you were going north

south at all in the northern hemisphere

you will deflect to the right no matter

what you're doing

ok that's that's why you have a

low-pressure system and I'm a bowl of

gas below it if it's low pressure there

and I'm air I'm gonna head for the low

pressure that's how this works it's low

pressure that means it's higher pressure

out here so all the pressure is gonna

send me in that direction but I'm

crossing lines of latitude and so

Earth's rotation will deflect me to the

right

how about here that's above it it says I

see a low pressure system let me go to

it so it goes to it and it deflects to

the right so all this hair deflects to

the right but it's still trying to get

to the center of the low-pressure system

but it can't because it keeps that

getting deflected and all this

deflection becomes this cyclonic energy

that turns into a storm and that is how

you get hurricanes tornadoes it's what

he called it

cyclones say ok ok so we're back at

Jupiter yes we are so this happens into

the gas yeah all right

the Coriolis force is heightened if you

spin faster ok and so what is Jupiter

it's a hundred times bigger than Earth

more than that ten thousand times bigger

than Earth

it's like 10 it's ten times across cubed

so it's a thousand times bigger than

Earth it's mostly gas and it rotates

once in about ten hours you want to talk

about ferocious Coriolis forces we have

storms that last weeks here hurricanes

that pick up and they get weeks on this

little speck we call earth that has this

much atmosphere on it go to a planet

that rotates twice as fast is ten times

as wide a thousand times the volume and

is mostly gas and you're complaining

that it lasted 300 years you are really

good I'll grant you that the speed of

light is universal obviously angular

momentum conservation is sure what about

well this chapters just to be clear he's

coming from a chapter called on earth as

it is in the heavens why you said

can you spontaneously levitate and hover

above the ground in a lotus position

like like Michael Keaton in Birdman in

the Vino at the beginning of Birdman he

says that with his underpants forget the

underpants just the levitation this

that's your first thought when you think

of someone in a lotus position Michael

Keaton in that movie yes okay yeah yeah

so so it's just there's certain things

you just can't do because they're

prevented by all known laws of physics

you cannot spontaneously set yourself

into motion unless you push off of

something else or you lose some kind of

mass that was within you so rockets when

they take off their dejected mass out

the other side okay Wow so do you saw

Birdman did you just leap up from your

seats it can't do that can't do that no

there are movies where I'm prepared to

suspend my disbelief yes like just

before as an example I was asked about

the movie guardians of the galaxy

and they asked me well the ships that

are going through space they they make

noise and clearly you would does that

upset you because in space where there

is no air no one can hear you scream but

no one can hear you explode either nor

will you hear engines or anything and so

they said does that upset you and I said

I bought into the idea that this movie

has a talking raccoon

that shoots artillery from heavy

weaponry off its shoulder if I can

accept that I'm good with whatever else

they deliver in the film so I have the

capacity to accept movie magic what

would happen if someone served you a hot

cocoa with whipped cream and you see no

whipped cream in evidence oh don't get

me started

okay oh wait wait let me finish about

let me hating right so all the

Levinson's all the people are levitating

the it's some kind of an illusion that

they're not telling you about okay

period here you okay now then but if you

really want to levitate if this is

really important to you I I tried to

calculate how many cans of beans

this would require then you got to kind

of hold it in right then let loose

suddenly suddenly and in principle for

the duration of the thrust you can

levitate briefly but this would argue

against the lotus position because there

would be an opening so suddenly that

there'd be too much too soon too fast

and therefore no rise oh yeah

you wouldn't like you wouldn't well you

could stay there if it just kept yeah

some of that right so it's not

impossible to hold a lotus position

it's just unlikely you're doing it for

these other ways that are described I

said yes the Coco oh yeah so I had there

was there was an incident in Pasadena

California I was there I don't drink

much coffee I don't have a relationship

with caffeine but every now and then

I'll be delighted to have a nice cup of

hot cocoa and I went to one of these

coffee houses you know with the

chalkboard out front and so I had you

know the kind I'm talking about

all over Brooklyn you trip on the

chalkboards in Brooklyn so so I'm in the

I order hot chocolate and I order it

with whipped cream of course right and

it comes to the table and there's no

whipped cream and I said I wanted this

with whipped cream and they said oh we

put it on and I said well where is it oh

he said it sunk to the bottom

I then said

[Laughter]

either the laws of physics that apply

everywhere in the universe are suspended

in your coffee shop or you didn't put

whipped cream on my hot cocoa and he

looked indignant really now to his

credit rather than continue to argue

with me he intended to prove me wrong

well he went into the kitchen brought

out the the whipped cream scooped it up

popped it in my and my hot cocoa and it

bombed once and floated atop and there

was cream past the float because first

of all before was whipped cream it was

cream okay and old-timers remember what

is cream do in under homogenized milk it

floats to the top and you skim off the

cream leaving behind skim milk okay now

you take the heavy cream and then whip

it putting air into it it is not gonna

sink on any no liquid devised by man

all right so so here's my point the

lesson there is yes I'm I'm a fan of the

edict if an argument last more than five

minutes then both sides are wrong if

that applies maybe 85 percent of the

time it's a good it's a good rule it's a

good tenant to give to carry with you

now watch this how science works one

researcher comes up with a result and

that is not the truth

no no a scientific emergent truth is not

the result of any one experiment what

has to happen is somebody else has to

verify it preferably a competitor

preferably someone who doesn't want you

to be correct such as my waiter

he went out to prove me wrong and got

the same result that I had declared we

can call that the beginnings of an

emergent truth about whipped cream now

we need someone to do it in Asia and in

Europe and and and and then you get a

trend and you can then declare that a

consensus of observation and experiments

has emerged in the scientific community

whipped cream floats on hot chocolate

and that waiter today is getting a PhD

let me go on to to a question that came

up later in the book just how void is

the void of space like so it looks

pretty empty out there between galaxies

just a lot of black you know it seems

anyway if you step into intergalactic

space by the way what might happen to

you shoes die yep but you might see

stuff and this is the list well I don't

I had never heard anything Worf galaxies

run away stars faint blue galaxies hot

clouds let me just test about some of

them what is a dwarf galaxy it's a

little galaxy well that I figured didn't

we go through this already our words

mean what they say haven't but I pass

that all right wait what there are

galaxies that you see the ones the

Magellan sauce smudges in the sky those

are huge things

no well wharf galaxies oh yeah

oh yeah they're like a hundred the size

of our galaxy so how many dwarf they far

outnumber big galaxies they do yeah so

maybe we shouldn't be calling them

dwarfs because they're the common size

galaxies we should just be called Giants

perhaps I asked and they call them

regular the where the right that's how

that works right what is the difference

how many stars are in a galaxy galaxy

our galaxy has several hundred billion

stars and in a dwarf galaxy um at most a

billion but more typically hundreds of

millions these are small numbers

compared to full up red-blooded galaxies

so tiny or dwarf galaxies and we tend to

find them in the vicinity of big

galaxies but you know what happens you

know they orbit the big galaxies but the

orbits are not stable and they do a

death spiral in they get eaten by the

larger galaxies and we have a term for

that

it's called galactic cannibalism in fact

there are stars there's streams of stars

that we see in our own galaxy that have

the same trajectory as one another

through the stellar system that is the

Milky Way so they they're roulette and

you follow it and it comes back out and

back in again and so this is evidence

that this was once a fleshie but dwarfee

galaxies that we ate ripped apart and

now the stars are just trying to have

that sum the last bastions of a memory

of what they once were because they're

getting stretched apart by that what we

call the tidal forces of our galaxy is

all right does the Milky Way have dwarfs

yes I mean has the book so the first

science essay I ever wrote was called

the galaxies and the Seven Dwarfs

because at the time the Milky Way had

seven dwarf galaxies in horbet around it

and then but dwarf galaxies are very

small they're hard to detect and since

then we've discovered you know couple

dozen more so it might be up above

22,000 Dorf galaxies in our vicinity

basically nearby so the point getting

back to the void mm-hmm is you look out

on the void and say there's nothing

there well what are you invoking to

declare that it's a void is it your eyes

well let's bring in a telescope or using

visible light is that a visible light

telescope bringing an x-ray telescope an

infrared telescope bring in the spate of

senses that science has developed that

transcend the five native senses we have

through our human physiology and that

power enables us to decode the universe

not as our senses receive them but as

our detectors there is an amazing

chapter of kotas or in the back will you

find out how human beings finally

what they couldn't see that there is a

rainbow of color that we all can see

which are waves of different lengths

they go he take you from whatever it's

get be vid bow Roy be viv

so whatever boy be VIP Roy had Roy

we had to repeat after me Roy red Roy G

Biff Rock red are yellow green blue

indigo indigo the violin violin you got

it but it's weird

just a quick thing roses are red violets

are violent right is it me who came up

with violence or blue that we have a

name for that color that was a desperate

poet looking for a rhyme I think don't

be violating laws of physics just to

make the rhyme okay I was gonna say Mark

Twain's Enoch that I love what is it

first get your facts straight then

distort them at your leisure

the uh let me just finish this up I've

been command I'm sorry um at the end

there's this this moment where somebody

has to figure out that that there might

be something redder than red or somehow

more than violet now we only have eyes

but this particular person used a

thermometer what was brilliant was

brilliant brilliant

okay so Isaac Newton is the first to

understand that white light is composed

of colors he takes white light puts it

through a prism and he gets ROYGBIV

actually the indigo he had a mystical

fascination with the number seven so he

wanted to lay down seven colors but

indigo is just really blue violet all

right but anyhow we'll give him his

indigo cuz he did all that stuff before

he turned 26

so if you invent calculus just on a dare

we give it to you all right we'll give

you him to go if you need to have him to

go so he's got the colors and then he

took those colors merged them back

together and he got white light out the

other side that's some freaky stuff

that's just freaky yeah that red orange

yellow green blue violet equals white

okay so we're good there

William Herschel comes around later and

says I wonder just to even ask this

question I wonder if the different

colors of light have different

temperatures so he laid down the

spectrum with sunlight prism and he put

a thermometer in each color and then he

had an eighth thermometer I don't know

if he used one and did the experiment

eight seven times but he had another

thermometer that he used as a control

thermometer you put that over to the

side where there are no colors and that

would presumably just measure the room

temperature

mmm-hmm so he knows enough to even think

that this is an interesting exercise and

he's got a control thermometer and he

just puts it over to the side of the

read out of sight and then he watches

the two thermometers and the control

thermometer goes through the roof yes

and he's looking at it and he says

something must be coming through this

the prism that I cannot see and he

describes this as light unfit for vision

he discovers infrared light with that

experiment and then another guy which

the human eye cannot see it says you if

you go to the hardware store and get an

infrared bulb and you turn it on and it

looks red you're seeing the red light

that is also emitted from this infrared

bulb and the heat that you feel your eye

cannot see that's all the infrared that

you're buying when you pay money for

that bulb and then some other guy put a

piece of paper on the other side of

violet and it turned dark and even a

photographic paper and he found that it

responds it's responded in the way you

would normally respond by putting

photographic paper in front of visible

light so he concludes that was somebody

else from somebody else the end right

and says there's something beyond the

light there's something less than the

red infrared something beyond the violet

and thus was discovered ultra violet

light and so to pose the question in the

first place was a stroke of brilliance

to then trust your measurements on a

level where you then declare you have

made that discovery is a whole other

thing it's oh yeah it's yeah here's the

thing about this book is just so people

get a sense of the history yeah the

history of puzzlement and the history of

discovery rolled up into one I'm not

gonna ask you of anything else because

it's time for questions and answers but

I would have so just you know what else

is in here there's something there's

dark matter which is this mysterious

thing that's out there which dark matter

is everywhere okay dark energy one of

the questions yes is why are so many

heavenly bodies round

is there anything in the universe that's

perfectly round what's going on between

planets where why is there still debris

coming in when the earth seemed to have

scooped up everything after 4.6 billion

rotations something at the end called

the Copernican principle all of it is

really but never mind the question is

the universe is 14 something something

billion years old

we've now seen stars stars galaxies

galaxies that are 13 billion years old

and somehow that might suggest that the

the universe is expanding and that there

is more and more universe all the time

well first of all the universe is

expanding and there is more and more

observable universe all the time the

universe at its edge is expanding at one

light-year per year that's how that

works

and so in a billion years the edge is

not going to be 14 billion light years

away it'll be 15 billion light years

away so we got that okay so now galaxies

13 billion light years away we are

seeing light it made it by that galaxy

and that light has been traveling for 13

billion years okay yes that galaxy

emitted its light when the universe was

10% its current age and in fact was much

smaller than it is today

now you said the current paradigm is 14

billion year age of the universe you

said that with a little bit of oh you'll

come up with something different later

the proper way to say that is that is

the current measurements of the age of

the universe that's how that works

okay paradigm is came into our lexicon

in a big way in the 1970s with a book

written by the science philosopher

Thomas Kuhn what's it

there's a dangerous woman in here who is

this job you speak so dangerously

remember what happened to the guy who

put the didn't put the cream in the

coffee so this book the structure of

scientific revolutions sort of

introduced paradigm as a as a as a way

that scientists sort of gather around a

paradigm and they're all sort of

accepted although then something

different happens and better data comes

along that we all gather around a

different paradigm that happened

basically until the dawn of the age of

modern science which I date from Galileo

and and bacon of Francis Bacon where

when you experimentally measure

something to be true and it's verified

that is a truth that does not later turn

out to be false period it's not how

science works it's not like oh this is

now that's when he falls down let's all

crowd around this you would be left with

that impression having read that book

but the book got that very wrong for the

age of modern science before then sure

because people just thought stuff up and

then and call themself scientist and

that was it with philosophers and you

turn I'd be profoundly wrong when

somebody else thought up something

better and then everybody's wrong when

we finally started taking data it's all

about the data

okay so everything you described is just

perfectly fine yes it finds galaxies the

next telescope the James Webb Space

Telescope is tuned to live in that

regime to find galaxies being born in

the early universe so to be a whole lot

more data coming back from the early

universe when that telescope gets

launched lands at its observing point

and gets turned on so there's nothing

you said that's odd or weird that is the

universe we live in

okay question is people there's he heard

something he talked about God on CBS

television and he's had he's like

thinking about near-death experiences

and he wonders whether these deep

mysteries are interesting to you okay so

one of the things we know from research

in psychology as well as just practical

matters in the conducting of scientific

experiments is that one of

which is odd because it's one of the hi

evidence in the court of law which

disturbs me greatly so if you cut if you

come from a lab to a science conference

and say this is true we say how do you

know this because I saw it well it's

really the end of your talk and you just

leave and then we say come back when you

have a chart recorder or you have to

just give me something that does not

have to flow through your senses because

your census is some of the worst data

taking devices that exist and science

did not achieve maturity modern science

does not maseeh maturity until we had

instruments that either extended our

senses or replace them and Galileo was

not an accident that we have modern

science as I've described it experiment

verification this these tactics these

methods and tools began with Galileo and

Francis Bacon and Galileo was around

1600 that was the invention in that

period of the microscope and the

telescope so it's not an accident that

all this sort of came together at that

time so now we have people who are in

the act of dying and they come back from

life and they report on mental

experiences and that's intriguing it's

intriguing but because it is in the

realm of eyewitness testimony you can

establish it perhaps as a personal truth

but it'll take more than that to

establish it as an objective truth and

an objective truth is the kind of truths

that science discovers and it's the kind

of truth that is true whether or not you

believe in it okay it exists outside of

your culture your religion your

political affiliation personal truths if

I may consider that would be okay Jesus

is your Savior that's your personal

truth you cannot convince someone else

that Jesus is their Savior in an

objective way you have to persuade them

you have to persuade them in some with

in some cases by war right look at the

wars that have been fought

between religions that did not agree

about who was their respective saviors

so so sure we know if I walked on water

made you unblind turned got created

loaves and fishes out of nothing that

would be amazing I think we would like

investigate that and we would check we

would say whoa yes we would we would so

it would be an amazing thing and then if

we keep we cannot account for that for

by any other known laws of physics and

it's only happening with you that we see

we'd wonder if you were like alien or

something first right but no it would be

so easy to demonstrate divinity if in

fact you have the power you wanted to

display but getting back to the

gentleman's point so part of this issue

is what does it mean to be dead okay

to be did you fog a mirror that was held

up in front of you while you were laying

there on your bed alright and if you

didn't fog the mirror you were judged to

be dead they would put you in a coffin

and in some parts that it is told

there's a string that they put into the

coffin as they buried you and they put

it over a tree branch and connected to a

bell if you woke up you would pull the

string and you it that's where you get

the term dead ringer okay you would pull

the string and you come rescue me

because you buried a living person okay

so then it was you dead because your

heart stops well we know why our heart

beats it's an electrochemical so you do

poke the heart beats again we got that

one okay well is it when you're brain

dead well you can be brain dead but your

heart is still beating and yeah we can

keep you alive are you dead yet

well no cuz your heart's still beating

is your brain functioning no okay I can

tell you this that if you're dead long

enough that your brain is deprived

oxygen and then you we bring you back

you're not talking about seeing any

lights because you're brain dead okay so

plus this often happens to someone who

is deathly ill to begin with and where

are they they're in a hospital and if

they go into cardiac arrest or something

critical they take you from your

hospital bed to an operating table and

what is sitting above an operating table

lights

it's okay and so if you say oh I was

dead and I came back and I saw lights

wait maybe it's not all the cases but

it's many of the cases okay

now there were skeptics who tried to do

an experiment the people who say they

left their body hmm and they thought we

got some of those Montesquieu so here's

what they did when was Montesquieu he

got rear-ended by some guy in a horse

fell off flew up into the air looked

down at himself in agony watched his way

we're in collisions in the air machine

Montaigne sorry Montana still they have

rear-end collisions in the air well as

you ride a horse with a guy behind you

is riding too fast is like a cab

situation okay I didn't know that okay

okay so I didn't know that well I loved

stopping you mid-career and collision

where the horses where was I so so there

was an experiment so there's some

descriptions that are part of this

near-death experience literature where

they come above and they see themselves

down there on the bed okay so what they

decided to do is for people who are

about to die they would write a message

facing upwards to the ceiling above the

bed and suspended there so if a person

goes above their bed and looks down

they'd be able to read the message so

they rejoin their body they what they

should then tell us what message they

saw that's never happens just

no that's enough now

now I have a cousin who when her father

died was alone with him in the room and

he's in an open casket and she's

otherwise completely rational okay I'm

not saying there's a crazy person to

completely what she's a real estate

agent

okay thanks for itself okay

among other town okay so she's in there

she tells me of a conversation she had

with her dead father and I said was it

in your mind

no he sat up and spoke to her I said

what was the conversation and she said

well he asked he said don't worry about

him he's in a better place this sort of

thing so this is her eyewitness

testimony I'm not gonna say it's wrong

I'm just saying it's not scientifically

useful but that's all I'm really saying

here okay

I told her next time this happens ask

these questions and not those questions

okay don't say are you happy did you how

you know saying are you wearing clothes

it's where are you where did you get

your clothes what temperature is it or

you just ask questions like this is an

amazing scientific experiment you could

be performing so so that's my lesson to

all of you if you find yourself in that

situation okay cuz I have a dead person

sits up and starts talking to me oh I'm

getting chart recorders I'm gonna be all

up in that as an experiment okay all

right up in the balcony whoever that was

yes question is can you help us

understand a multi-dimensional universe

what would be the dimension is we are

unaware of any dimension higher than the

three that we're familiar with or the

actual four that we're embedded in we

live in a four-dimensional world and

that might sound a little flaky and

freaky but consider the following fact

you have never met someone at a place

unless it was also at a time and you

have never met someone at a time unless

it was also at a place that requires

four dimensions of their daily living

what about in a dream this is the dream

happening inside your head yes I don't

know when so the only point is we know

intuitively that we need four dimensions

to localize someone to meet up with them

especially well only two dimensions if

you don't have tall buildings you have

tall buildings you need the third

dimension so you don't say I'll meet you

at the 20th floor

you know on 7:21 Park Avenue what time

okay

this is a full four dimensions going on

there so to someone to convince you we

live in a four-dimensional world for

that reason okay it may be that these

four dimensions are manifest to us but

that in fact we are embedded in higher

than in a higher dimensional space and

strength theorists on the frontier of

this exercise are hypothesizing at least

ten dimensions to account for everything

we see in the universe even if we do not

directly measure those dimensions

themselves now with your permission may

I go on a dimensional journey with you

man might take you on a journey at a

dimensional Odyssey Odyssey are you

ready yes okay are you ready to get

ready for this okay

so I'm at my desk and the desk is a

surface okay and I start putting pages

down on the desk of tiling them on the

desk and then I run out of room I have

exhausted the two dimensions of the

surface of my desk we have ways of

accommodating this problem and so we

have page organizers that go upwards so

now and I don't have any more surface

area area of the desk I can enter a

third dimension and put pages there if

you are an ant embedded in this

two-dimensional world of the surface of

my desk and you fill up the desk with

these sheets of paper the ants will say

there is no more room and I say yes

there is watch me and I take a piece of

paper off the desk put it in the page

organizer and according to the ant

that's embedded in the two dimensions

that page disappeared it disappeared

into a dimension that ant does not have

access to what a brilliant invention

this is you can put practically an

unlimited number of pages but far more

pages above the desk then on the desk so

access to a third dimension is an

extraordinarily useful storage device

for a two-dimensional creature does the

ant trust you that what it cannot see is

nevertheless there I have to then talk

to it about this extra dimension and

then it will have to just trust you

yes because watch what happens next I

now have my three dimensional room and

I'm filling it with boxes now I've run

out of space to put the box

but now an alien four-dimensional alien

looks at us and says I got this

just move it into the fourth dimension

what are you talking about and the alien

comes in reaches in takes one of the

boxes and then the Box disappears

disappears it went into a fourth

dimension and this was captured in the

film Monsters Inc did you guys see this

film these are monsters that work in a

door Factory and they make these doors

and they open the door and it is the

door of the kids bedroom or their closet

and they step through and they're in the

kid's closet and then they scare the kid

because that's their job they're

monsters okay this doorway is a portal

through the fourth dimension and then

back to the third so imagine a new

storage system we just go to Home Depot

and buy a door and that door is your

portal to a fourth dimension you open

the door put your boxers close the door

you look on the other side of the door

there's nothing there so this is what's

going on when you have access to higher

dimensions wait don't you have to then

talk to somebody as far as you know if

you're a scientist and you need data

what you have is something that you had

or it's gone and now a voice says I've

got this yeah if if that were to either

if it's a voice from the fourth

dimension I'm gonna listen to it

so does everything I'm not gonna say no

you're out I if if there's a voice

coming out of the fourth dimension and

makes one of my boxes disappear I'm

thinking it's got more power than I do

and more knowledge of the space-time

continuum so I'm going with it does that

mean that in order for a scientist to

credit another dimension with reality

with real existence you will need a

testifier from beyond so you need a

dimension plus a dimension dimension

voice dimension a dimensionless voice

yeah that comes from another from

another place now there are things that

happen in quantum physics that kind of

defy our sensibilities like particles

pop in and out of existence they don't

they defy any rational attempt to

understand it particles can be entangled

with one another a particle can be here

and there's a barrier and it can

spontaneously show up on the other side

of the barrier and faster than the speed

of light all of this is just mysterious

let me ask you suppose you have a sphere

and I live in a 2-dimensional world and

you take this hollow sphere so it's a

shell and you pass that sphere through

my two-dimensional universe

how will I describe that I will say this

point just appeared out of nowhere

oops now it's a circle a small circle

and that circle is getting bigger by the

moment oh my gosh well if we start

maximum size now that circle is just

shrinking it's shrinking up now it's a

point now the whole thing disappeared

this would be completely freaky to a

two-dimensional being but it makes

complete sense if you live in three

dimensions and you passed a sphere

through my universe so who is to say

that some of the mysterious things we

are describing accurately but don't

otherwise make sense make sense in a

higher dimension and these are just the

manifestations of higher dimensional

phenomenon

in our world and that's an aspect of

what these higher dimensional physicists

are trying to establish at this point

now I want to totally blow their minds

if I can

oh sure if I may but you got to stay

with me on this okay a point has no

dimensions there's no height width depth

so it has zero dimensions a line has one

dimension length okay

a square has two dimensions sort of

height and width a cube has three

dimensions height width depth we got

this now follow me

a line is one dimensional but it's

bounded by two zero dimensional things

those are the points one dimension

bounded by two zero dimensional points a

square is two dimensions

bounded by four

one-dimensional sides a cube is three

dimensions bounded by six

two-dimensional sides so in other words

the dimensions of your sides are going

up your line is bound by zero

dimensional points your square is bound

by two-dimensional lines

I mean bye-bye but one-dimensional sides

the cube is bound by two-dimensional

squares okay so we going up to four six

two points four sides of a square six

sides of a cube and each side is one

dimension less they're squares on the

sides of a cube they're lines on the

side of a square

they're dots on the sides of a line

let's go up to a four dimensional cube a

four dimensional cube has eight sides a

regular cube has six sides we'll go it

up by two afford missile tube has eight

sides and each of those sides is a three

dimensional cube one dimension down from

itself in the same way each side of a

three-dimensional cube is a two

dimensional square so when you get to

four dimensions the sides are three

dimensional surfaces and you can take

this all the way up and our brains can't

picture is what we call a hypercube then

some circles are tesseract

we can't picture a volume bounded by

three-dimensional cubes what does it

even mean this is because we evolved in

the plains of Africa just not wanting to

get eaten by a lion

our neuro synapses are ill-equipped to

do to do the distance on this and this

is why we invent mathematics that can

take us there

well the mathematics can help us imagine

it but if we want to credit it with

reality then you have to design an

experiment that somehow touches your own

world yes yes so you can invent

something that you can't see if it has

testable consequences in ways that you

can see that's perfectly allowed not a

problem mm-hmm oh and by the way there's

some people that say you cannot prove a

negative

some people like coming after you

generally you won't hear a scientist say

that it's others like philosophers and

people who like criticizing scientists

but who are not scientist so that you

can't prove an A we kind of do that all

the time okay but we don't use the word

proof we demonstrate without any further

discussion

that the negative is true ok so here's

an example there's a cave there

is there a bear in the cave I don't know

I'm not going in to find out okay I'm

gonna set up cameras and see if a bear

comes out okay so I set up the cameras

all throughout summer no bear goes in

and out but then I

okay then I take down the camera maybe a

bear went in there to hibernate so

here's what you do you set a powder

outside of the cave something that will

record a footprint and you just monitor

this month after month after month after

month do it for 12 months look up in the

charts how often a bear has to eat and

how long would take a bear to die for

not eating if the period of time you

waited is long enough so that there are

no footprints you conclude that there is

no bear in that cave I just demonstrated

a negative sufficient enough for me to

no longer pose that question and go on

to another problem but if you were so

distracted that it's not a formal proof

of a negative then you could just keep

sitting there wondering while the rest

of us decode the nature of the universe

we have oh by the way maybe the cave is

not a closed cave you might have a rear

way have a back door yeah okay that's

possible I suppose that's possible so

then the assumption that there's no bear

in the cave would be wrong but I'm or

the cave could have a cave and that cave

could have another cave you see there is

just so much to worry about right and so

you will sit there you'll sit there

arrested by your own capacity to doubt

an experimental reality yes well like I

said the rest of us can keep making

discoveries well we need we have time

for one more question and that person at

the very end underneath the exit sign

hand prominently raised not the one

waving it but the woman in the yellow

shirt still with her hand up

wondering if I'm looking at her yeah

well looking back and what's not a

yellow shirt it's a horizontal striped

shirt oh okay really oh oh repeat it

this was an art major or something I'm

right I guess yeah if you had one last

question to answer this evening what

would that question be so you you you

misunderstand me oh that wasn't your

question but can I at least answer that

no okay oh if you're in your career as a

scientist if there is one question that

you wish to address before you go to the

great cave with the bigger or wait

forever for the bear to come out and

stay there what would that science

question be or do you like your previous

question better yeah okay so I'm gonna

give an answer but then I want your

permission to give you a kind of a

cop-out answer if I give both a full

answer and then a cop-out answer that my

full answer is I wonder if in fact the

human intellect is sufficient to

actually decode the full operations of

this universe in which we live and it's

not specifically an Astrophysical

question it's just more we are in

intelligent species because we defined

ourselves that way

we don't have the benefit of another

species to compare ourselves with

against whom we might fail miserably and

so when we compare ourselves to chimps

we sit up righteously and say we have

poetry and the Hubble telescope and

philosophy and the trim just stacks

banette stacks boxes to reach a banana

yet there's only 1% difference in our

DNA but then you'll say what a

difference that 1% makes and I would say

maybe that 1% DNA difference corresponds

with an equally small difference in the

intelligence between a chimp and humans

use I can't believe that no no well

imagine some other species that visits

us that's 1% along on that same scale

smarter than us consider the smartest

chimp does what our toddlers can do and

there's no way you will explain to a

chimp all of dinner ready at 6:30 you

pick up some some juice on the way home

that the simplest human thoughts are

inconceivable to a chimp and their

talents are about what our toddlers can

do so let's get back to this 1% smarter

alien that we've discovered

corresponding this analogy we now say

what would we look like to them well

they would roll Stephen Hawking forward

after combing the human species and

they'd say this one is slightly smarter

than the rest because he can do

astrophysics calculations in his head

like little Timmy over here

look who just came home from preschool

Oh Timmy you just composed three sonnets

isn't that cute let's put it up on the

refrigerator door oh you just derived

the fundamental law of calculus isn't

that kid put it up on the refrigerator

their simplest thoughts would transcend

our deepest thoughts and maybe they to

them it is obvious what dark matter is

and dark energy maybe to them particles

popping in and out of existence is a

trivial exercise in their understanding

of the multi-dimensional space-time

continuum and we are here groping at the

sides of a wall not knowing how tall

wide or deep it is because we have the

limits of the human physiology evolved

off the plains of Africa just to try to

understand the entire universe so I lose

sleep on that question each night so

that's my weight did you almost say at

the beginning of that answer that you

are wondering we may be something of a

mysterion that you you you're not sure

I'm not sure the world is so the

universe is so complicated that it may

be more complicated than we can ever

fathom

no that's the hubristic way to say it

it's not how I said it okay how did you

say it again we might not be smart

enough okay not you Brist 'ok if you're

hubristic you would say we are smart but

the universe is just really complicated

that's not what I said

when I said we might not be smart enough

to figure out a universe that could be

trivial to the brain of a more

intelligent species okay so check your

hubris at the door otherwise

yeah you will not bask in the cosmic

perspective that so much of this

discussion brings upon us so may a now

give you my cop-out answer my cop-out

answer is I think often about the

questions we do not yet know to ask

because discoveries yet to come but when

they arrive will put us in a new Vista a

new place to stand enabling us to see

questions undreamt of an unimaginable or

we got there so when I again lay awake

at night I ponder what kinds of

questions lay beyond our reach

because the questions that we even know

how to pose there there those are not

even interesting to me anymore because

we knew how to ask the question I want

to know the question that is beyond

everyone's reach and by definition I

can't because we haven't gotten there

yet but that doesn't mean I I shouldn't

dream of that frontier

and and

that sounded like a coder to me I gotta

say like I could hear the orchestra

playing - yeah can I offer a better

coder yes and then we'll let you go but

sorry we went long try not to ever

forget that the history of this exercise

this beautiful exercise where we find

out where we fit in this great unfolding

of cosmic events and phenomenon that the

larger grows the area of knowledge the

bigger that area grows just to remember

so - grows our perimeter of ignorance it

may be that as much as we think we know

as much as we know we know as much as

the more things that we ultimately learn

for all we know we could be steeped in

the center of infinite ignorance which

then provides job security forever for

science and society

run it forward
