Interviewer,"What have we learned from the dotcom bubble? (Or, what should we have learned?)."
Paul,One thing people learned from the Bubble is to judge startups more critically. Some really bad ideas got funded then. And the investors weren't the only ones who got burned. The people who went to work for those companies did too. Now everyone is more cautious.
Interviewer,What has led to the current flurry of Internet startups?
Paul,"I think the present startup boom has a couple causes. One is simply that the bust wore off. The Internet represents a big change, comparable to the arrival of steam engines. It's natural for people to be excited about it, now that the post-Bubble depression has worn off."
Interviewer,Do you think Web 2.0 is a real thing or a convenient label for some heterogeneous phenomena?
Paul,"Web 2.0 is a weird phrase. It began as the name of a conference, but the people organizing the conference didn't really know what they meant by it. Mostly they thought it sounded catchy. However, Web 2.0 has since taken on a meaning. There are some interesting new trends on the Web, and it's the nature of a phrase like that to adhere to them."
Interviewer,Opinions I have garnered range from the Internet has been given back to the people to there is absolutely nothing here that is new. Where do you stand?
Paul,"I think there are genuinely new things happening on the Internet. It would be strange if there weren't. There are new things happening in every area of technology. A lot of smart people are working on Internet stuff now, so of course they're coming up with new ideas."
Interviewer,What do you look for in a web startup that will persuade you to invest in them?
Paul,"We look for two things in startup founders:brains and commitment. One thing we've learned in this past year is that commitment matters more than we thought, and brains less. The founders can't be stupid, but as long as they're over a certain threshold, the most important thing is commitment."
Interviewer,Spending on Internet advertising is anticipated to increase dramatically. Will the long tail profit from this?
Paul,"To make money from advertising you either have to have your own plan for selling ads, or use something like AdSense. Unfortunately, AdSense's current keyword-based model doesn't fit with all startups. But that kind of revenue might help a little, in the earliest phase. It might not be enough to make a startup profitable, but it could be enough to stretch out their initial funding, and thus buy more time."
Interviewer,There's a lot of hype surrounding current trends. Are these bubble conditions?
Paul,"No, I don't think this is a bubble. The companies the VCs are investing in now are nowhere near as laughable as the ones they were funding in 1999. A lot of those seemed like deliberate parodies."
Interviewer,What ideas/values/approaches do you think will be permanent changes from Web 2.0 to whatever Web 3.0 brings?
Paul,"I doubt there will be such a thing as Web 3.0. I think so many people will use the phrase Web 3.0 for their pet theory about the future of the Web that it will lose all credibility, and by the time there's a change big enough to warrant a name like that, no one will want to use it. Web 2.0 is already close to the edge of credibility. Few people I know can bring themselves to use it seriously. Web 3.0 is probably already dead."
Interviewer,Well thank you for coming this morning we are trying something a little bit different this startup school year we.
Paul,Are not just having our weekly to lectures but we are having some conversations with notable people and I.
Interviewer,Couldn't be happier to have one of the most notable startup people here he'll get embarrassed when I say anything.
Paul,Complimentary so i'll try to avoid it Paul Graham my friend and the the founder of Y Combinator back in 2005 and.
Interviewer,We're just going to talk and hopefully it won't be boring Paul yes Jeff so you and I got to know each other.
Paul,Strangely at a it was kind of a start-up at the time Yahoo back in the late 90s 98 yeah guys know he wrote Yahoo Mail.
Interviewer,Some of it yeah Y Combinator has the people who wrote Yahoo Mail and Gmail that is weird right.
Paul,Paul buchheit who who actually has more of a claim on actually writing Gmail than I do have a claim on writing Yahoo.
Interviewer,I wrote i wrote some important parts of Yahoo Mail but Paul was kind of by himself doing G almost and we had we.
Paul,Were a little more intentional with yahoo mail and had had a team creating something called rocket mail but it is a.
Interviewer,Little weird that both of us ended up at YC years later uh but Paul was at Yahoo I was at Yahoo because we created.
Paul,Something called rocket mail and we were purchased in 97 but a Paul's company was bought in 98 and so how can you you had.
Interviewer,This weird idea for a product for something you thought people would would want in in the mid-90s which had to do.
Paul,With like sas before sas was a thing how did you come up with this idea for for via web the company that Yahoo bought.
Interviewer,Okay so what we made was something that is now called a web app I believe at the time I.
Paul,Was the first one and that's why the company was called via web because it worked.
Interviewer,Via the web and the way i remember very vividly we thought back then everybody thought that writing software was.
Paul,Identical with writing software that ran on the client and we're still for those of you who remember the mid-90s the.
Interviewer,Client meant windows right and like we knew how to write software for UNIX and we liked UNIX we did not know how to.
Paul,Write software for our windows but we knew enough to know that we did not want to learn and so we were really really.
Interviewer,Highly motivated to figure out how to write software without having to write software to run on Windows and so we.
Paul,Thought to ourselves well maybe well you know the way I first thought of it actually was that you would have this.
Interviewer,You would have it was an online store builder right and I thought that you could you could send it updates by email.
Paul,That was i thought you can send it updates by email right um and it would change your website and then I remember.
Interviewer,Thinking well if you coster us for shopping carts or whatever if you can use SMTP why not HTTP to update your.
Paul,Website whoa you could cut the software could run on the server and you could control it by clicking on links in the.
Interviewer,Browser would that even work right but i remember I was like sleeping on a mattress on the floor in Roberts spare.
Paul,Bedroom and i remember i sat up in bed when I thought of this like like the letter L right it was actually like one.
Interviewer,Of those scenes in a movie i'm like oh my god we could avoid having to write software on Windows at all.
Paul,We never at that point we were never thinking about the benefits of web apps which are great as it turned out we were.
Interviewer,Just thinking we could like actually do this without ever having to learn pointing windows you did yeah at ER that.
Paul,Like you could deploy then without having to ship software did none of that avoiding windows we could actually write.
Interviewer,Thank-you gates never have to learn windows because like the Netscape people had already gone through the pain of.
Paul,Making netscape work on windows hey just like that was like a hole onto Windows you know and people could get.
Interviewer,Through the hole and click on links in the browser and control the software and so we immediately we weren't even sure.
Paul,This would work because it was so weird but we immediately sat down and tried to write this really really clunky website.
Interviewer,Builder that worked by clicking on links it was terrible but it did actually work it could make a website and I'm like.
Paul,Holy this actually works that's weird that like an innovative idea like that just sort of comes out of no I mean.
Interviewer,It scene doesn't seem innovative now because all websites work that way but the first one like that's that's going.
Paul,From 0 to 1 how do you like it's very common happen right very common for ideas in retrospect they see him obvious.
Interviewer,And you and matt you sort of historians who weren't there sort of straighten out all the kinks in.
Paul,The development and it just seems like oh they had this you know it's like this idea I always hate it when people.
Interviewer,Represent startup ideas as light bulbs you know because as well as being the most cliched metaphor imaginable it's.
Paul,Also false you don't just like have this idea and then realize it right no it's more like you have this sort of inkling.
Interviewer,That something you could do something that somebody else hasn't done before and it's probably a bad idea.
Paul,But you're too lazy to learn windows and so you want to do it that way right um and so or like who would or like Zuck.
Interviewer,Starting facebook you know just like let's see what happens right the way implausible if this would ever be a.
Paul,Startup which is good for you all hopefully some of your ideas seem really implausible right I love it when ideas.
Interviewer,Seem implausible in the right way over the years I mean I already had just from being a hacker as sort of a good nose.
Paul,For this sort of thing but it has become refined over all these years of dealing with startups and when when people have.
Interviewer,I was talking to some people yesterday and they were talking about two possible things they could.
Paul,And one of them seemed so it seemed like naughty not like it was it was it was sort of maltreating anyone it was just.
Interviewer,Sort of taking advantage of something that seems like it shouldn't even be possible right like like making this.
Paul,Software run on the server and just like never making software that seemed to the users to run on their computer but.
Interviewer,Actually was just talking to them through the browser that kind of naughtiness and then I said like pick.
Paul,That one because it seems it seems so outrageous it seems so hilarious it seems like there's all these ways we.
Interviewer,Have talking about what's a good idea and when you try to match up ideas with them it's always sort of a complicated.
Paul,You know it's like is this idea naughty or is it is it is it is it like not quite intuitive or not so javea and it's.
Interviewer,Really always hard to to take any particular idea and say is that the one was potential well you can't tell in.
Paul,Fact that's another thing um it's not just that the outcomes of startups are hard to predict I think to some degree.
Interviewer,They're actually indeterminate there's a huge amount of luck involved you know and so I think even if even if Y.
Paul,Combinator were as good at picking startup so you could possibly get I mean in fact you have like 150 startups per.
Interviewer,Batch of which maybe 5 will become giant or something like that hopefully high that would be good yeah.
Paul,Well depends on your definition of giant right it's a power-law distribution we're like if for some definitions of.
Interviewer,Giant one of it one is taking any batches will think if five or any definition of giant yeah we'll be happy.
Paul,So talking about i like oh yeah the indeterminacy of yes even if you were able to pick perfectly that doesn't mean.
Interviewer,You could get the batches down to only five startups you probably have to pick twenty I think even if you were perfect.
Paul,So it just it's just it's hot it's hard like it's hard to know there's this there's a strange mix of extraordinary.
Interviewer,Hard work an idea that actually has something to it but is not obvious it's hard for founders to know yeah you don't.
Paul,Know yourselves you don't know yourselves I mean I mean you don't know comma yourselves not that.
Interviewer,You don't know yourself so that it's also true so and that's why it's good to be a hacker because if you're some.
Paul,Business person you know and you think i am going to work on business opportunities right well I don't know if.
Interviewer,This is a business opportunity so i'm not gonna work on it um whereas someone who's a hacker who's just doing things.
Paul,For the fun of it or because they don't like Windows yeah laziness to this is actually in some cases really helpful at.
Interviewer,Least some kinds of some kinds of later I'm a little scared about this meme escaping into the wild right.
Paul,Can't you just see well yeah you just see it's it's truly they said laziness is good he said from the sofa as he ate.
Interviewer,Another doughnut you know it would be better if people thought laziness wasn't good because the glaze enos the kind of.
Paul,The people to you that's good they do and they would do anyway even if they thought it's weird yeah well using.
Interviewer,Laziness not in the normal sense of laziness right because if you're late there's there's no such thing as a lazy.
Paul,Founder that it builds a big company there's but but a certain sort of it's sort of a reticence to do something for.
Interviewer,Some reason i'm calling it lazy weightings not really it seemed like sort of slaps it makes you it you know.
Paul,If you have a natural hatred for gratuitous slap slaps like then what that that produces elegant solutions so.
Interviewer,So in 1995 ish i was like trying every single idea I could possibly try to start some internet business and I was.
Paul,Doing it all by myself which was awful and and what I didn't know how to do was to find people to do it with and I kind.
Interviewer,Of ran into a bunch of people and i had no clue whether they would be good people to start companies with and I was.
Paul,Thinking about your experience you said you were like sleeping on Roberts well you started you started via web with two.
Interviewer,Fascinating people robert maxwell and trevor Blackwell who later robert morris robert morrison and trevor blackwell.
Paul,Robert maxwell Morrison Trevor Blackwell and that's a that was a weird mix of names anyway um.
Interviewer,How did you pick them as co-founders how did that happen and and when did you decide they would be good co-founders.
Paul,Were they good co-founders um alright so yeah right they're extremely worked they were.
Interviewer,Extremely truculent co-founders who were very good at programming but I remember Robert was like not into the whole.
Paul,Startup thing the entire way like whenever he was on the board and whenever we got and whenever you get an.
Interviewer,Acquisition offer the board has to at least consider it right and so we would get these crap lowball acquisition.
Paul,Offers we'll give you like two million dollars in our stock right was like yes no no Robert would say like we would.
Interviewer,Vote on it and robert would always say well you know I have to be honest here like this would at least mean we could.
Paul,Stop working on this thing and so yes i would take this deal right I made a deal with Robert that if he ever made a.
Interviewer,Million dollars out of out of via web he would get an earring Robert it's not the kind of guy who would enjoy having an.
Paul,Earring let me tell you um and so as soon as the deal closed me and Trevor frog-marched him to the place in Harvard.
Interviewer,Square where people get their things pierced never heard this before he got him an earring there's photographs on.
Paul,The internet if robert morris with an earring that he didn't keep it when his but not for long we should have.
Interviewer,Specified that i never thought i never thought to specify you know I thought you'd actually get the million dollars.
Paul,No no i really actually did but i thought he would wear it for a bit longer.
Interviewer,Um when his fiancee saw it she fell on the floor why did you choose why did I try killing Trayvon ders okay so I chose.
Paul,Robert because he was my co-conspirator in everything and I don't mean I was always I was always the lead and he was.
Interviewer,Just the co-conspirator when he did things I would be his co-conspirator to you so like the internet worm if 19 you.
Paul,Guys know robert morris's is pretty famous all on his own yeah he invented buffer overflow and I.
Interviewer,Remember when he told me about it and i said wow what a cool idea she totally do that he was the first famous hacker.
Paul,Who really got in trouble i think yeah really in trouble he was the way it's true he was the first person to be.
Interviewer,Prosecuted under the computer fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 which so if you're looking for a co-founder look at people.
Paul,Who have been prosecuted because it works yeah user he is actually a convicted.
Interviewer,Felon okay this is another mean we don't necessarily want to escape out there that convicted felons are what you want.
Paul,To look for as co-founders they're convicted for that maybe it was funny because the FBI like like law.
Interviewer,Enforcement kind of does things by the book right like imagination is a big thing in in like Sherlock Holmes stories.
Paul,But not in actual everyday law enforcement and so they have these the FBI agent told me like they have these.
Interviewer,Motive they look for sex drugs money revenge right and so like Robert did it out of.
Paul,Curiosity and that's just think it's just not on the list hey they really had a hard time figuring out what the hell.
Interviewer,Was going on i think even within the government there were lots of people who did never understood what was going on.
Paul,So back to robert and trevor whoo-hoo oh so why did I pick Robert Trevor yeah Robert Robert Robert I picked because I.
Interviewer,Would i would do everything with him right we had all these schemes and so you knew you could work with him I mean.
Paul,I could work with him when i knew it was really good he was a really good programmer he could program as fast as.
Interviewer,He could type of course this was in c which is a lot of very verbose language but but he could program as fast as he.
Paul,Could type he was amazing he would like if he didn't like what the operating system would do it he would edit the.
Interviewer,Source and recompile it and then it would do what he wanted so truculence aside he was exceptional.
Paul,Like when he showed up at harvard undergrads were only allowed to have accounts on like the official undergrad.
Interviewer,Computing system off in the science Center and there were all these real computers in the cs department and let.
Paul,Aiken lab and so they wouldn't give him an account there and so he just walked up to you a machine.
Interviewer,You know switched it to single user with him as the super user gave cellphone account and then and switched.
Paul,It back hey it was curious yeah well he also wanted to counts on the right machines he got kicked this whole thing.
Interviewer,Will be about robert robert such an interesting character I shouldn't talk about it may be more interesting than.
Paul,Anything else we can talk about he got kicked out of Harvard as an undergrad for reconnecting Harvard to the Internet.
Interviewer,Um harvard harvard had been one of the early internet nodes that's so funny to like like get interval for disconnecting.
Paul,A school from the internet connecting it can happen for connecting a school where were we.
Interviewer,Well we're still trying to figure out why the heck uh oh I should tell you though about how we.
Paul,Tell us about the disconnecting really fast no no it's okay so we have all day we don't do it no we don't okay how long.
Interviewer,Have we have we have enough time we have the same watch more or less Robert okay it was one of the very early internet.
Paul,Nodes and by the time robert arrived in as an undergrad the connection had died from bit decay that's like no one.
Interviewer,Noticed that's how unimportant the internet was back then or rather ARPANET as it was then called verily an Internet.
Paul,Right so rt m spent one whole semester working on getting Harvard reconnected RT M is Roberts yes yes Robert and he.
Interviewer,Like didn't do any work for any of his classes and he got such bad grades he got kicked out for a year so we actually.
Paul,Used that later as a recruiting technique because we knew there because there might be other people who got.
Interviewer,Kicked out for spending all their time on some project and so we actually went around Harvard and posted up this poster.
Paul,Saying did you get kicked out working on some project of your own we'd like to hire you I think there's probably so we.
Interviewer,Got a really grid programmer that way um there's probably something made tons of money off of options cuz we got.
Paul,Acquired journey here right and you like enjoyed life out of school so much I don't think he went back until he was 25.
Interviewer,So um all right so why did why trevor why Trevor well so you picked Robert Robert was what was the guy you did.
Paul,Everything with and he was great okay so after we'd been doing before the wave when you picked Robert did you know he.
Interviewer,Was gonna be a pain in the ass in so many ways as you like or was that a surprise to you well I knew he was a.
Paul,Pain in the ass i didn't know the company was gonna be so hard and it would bring out so much penis so you.
Interviewer,Didn't realize how hard tell you the way we got Trevor was very indicative yeah so a month in we'd been working on this.
Paul,Company for a month and robert rebels he says we've been working on this company for a whole month and it's still not.
Interviewer,Done and i thought hmm maybe we need more programmers so so I said all right Robert who's the smartest person you.
Paul,Know in grad school and he said trevor right and I said Trevor right and Trevor's one of those people who seems.
Interviewer,Of a lot smarter than you seems so but it's Trevor is actually super smart and so we went and recruited Trevor and he.
Paul,Said oh okay that's that's a really good Trevor but almost not a Canadian Trevor has two modes oh okay and oh I'm sorry.
Interviewer,Which is what he does when he does something that breaks everything which was very common very common and so we.
Paul,Got trevor i recruited trevor to work on the thing he does nothing for two weeks at least as far as I can tell he just.
Interviewer,Disappears and then two weeks later he says come into my office and he's rewritten all our goddamn software in.
Paul,Small talk typical yes um so i said all right Trevor we're not using that but do this instead right.
Interviewer,Um and so trevor like trevor was like this super productive hacking monster but you didn't know that in advance you.
Paul,Just trusted robert when robert told you he was really smart well if Robert said he was the smartest he's deaf.
Interviewer,The smartest but there's kind of a deep lesson in that and how you how you pick whether whether it's employees or.
Paul,Co-founders it's you find someone you trust and then find someone they trust yeah although here's an interesting.
Interviewer,Point that works better for some qualities than others like intelligence the intelligent people can judge other.
Paul,Intelligent people but trustworthy people cannot judge other trustworthy people in fact trustworthy people are.
Interviewer,Often fooled by untrustworthy people so like Kate quarto is like our architect who did this is like super trustworthy.
Paul,But she's always fooled by easily sneaky schemers you know who take advantage of her so I guess that means you take.
Interviewer,Recommendations from people but then you have to add your own no no no you can totally dress but if Robert says.
Paul,Someone's smart and i disagree i think i must be wrong right yeah but you need to just works for some qualities better.
Interviewer,Than others let's hold right you want them to be trustworthy when they join you as a co-founder so you have to add.
Paul,That for the trustworthiness yes this whole thing of like networking doesn't work it doesn't you have to have someone.
Interviewer,You can judge whether people are trustworthy which I'm I am not even good at I am not good at the person who does.
Paul,That for y combinator is jessica the social radar the secret power behind everything so you did hire people at via.
Interviewer,Web - yes what did you learn about hiring in your like your first startup like so you learned that they they if.
Paul,They were getting lousy grades your start working on a project that seemed good which is which is kind of.
Interviewer,Counterintuitive a lot of things we seem to do it.why see end up being counterintuitive startups in general are.
Paul,Very very counterintuitive and so that's actually why C exists if it was obvious what to do and starting a start-up we.
Interviewer,Wouldn't why c couldn't really add much by teaching people how to do it right and so I often say I often in fact.
Paul,Practically every day if i do office hours I'm reminded of this that like what Y Combinator does is tell founders.
Interviewer,Things that they ignore right so we tell people don't hire to you fast and then they go off and hire to you fast and.
Paul,Then they come back later and say oh i wish we'd listened but all the things we tell people we tell.
Interviewer,People the counterintuitive stuff not the obvious stuff and then what counterintuitive means is it sounds.
Paul,Wrong and so they go with their gut and do the wrong thing instead and then hopefully catch the mistake in time why.
Interviewer,Is it that startups are so counterintuitive you know that would be if that would be very much writing an.
Paul,Essay about that would be worth writing an essay about why startups are so counterintuitive I don't know I don't.
Interviewer,Know i don't know it's i could come up with some theories but I have a feeling the answer is so interestingly.
Paul,Complicated that would be unlikely to come and it's really just we were just talking about one of the things that.
Interviewer,That you you did write an essay about which is somewhat counterintuitive when you start a startup and you're like okay.
Paul,Now i'm gonna grow and then you write a whole bunch of stuff but you've already software that helps you grow and and.
Interviewer,You're at a whole si says don't do that do things that don't scale in the beginning yeah do things that don't.
Paul,Scale because growth is maybe you can start by saying what it means to do things that don't scale because I'm.
Interviewer,Afraid the best thing you did not already I'm sure you've all read all as well as I say but this is a this is.
Paul,Actually very important because most of you all have early startups and when you do an early startup it's become our.
Interviewer,Mantra yc and i've seen it again and again you should not try to do too much in the beginning you should do things.
Paul,That don't scale what doing things that don't scale means specifically is doing things in a sort of handmade artisanal.
Interviewer,Painstaking way that you feel like yeah it would be great if you could do things that way forever but you and you're in.
Paul,The back of your mind you think to yourself well there's no way we can keep doing this and become giant right and.
Interviewer,What do things that don't scale means is do those things early on anyway because you know if you don't do them you'll.
Paul,Never be big and you've got nothing to lose and also you learn a lot from it you learn a lot and so I discovered a.
Interviewer,Lot of this things that we teach startups at Y Combinator or you teach startups the Y Combinator I'm retired I.
Paul,Don't know if you know that but a lot of things you guys teach startups is are things that I hit myself.
Interviewer,And didn't realize that they were actually common startup lessons so one of them is doing things very manually.
Paul,For your early customers like it's so important to get early customers that if you have to do a ton of manual stuff.
Interviewer,That's ok you'll learn a lot from it did you guys do manual stuff oh yeah well totally and we thought oh we're doing it.
Paul,Wrong this is so lame and in fact it was exactly the right thing we made an online store builder you.
Interviewer,Could build a store on the internet and sell stuff and we would go to would be would be customers and say would you.
Paul,Like to use our easy online store builder and they would say no and we would say but you want an online store.
Interviewer,Right and they would say yeah and and they would say well what if we use we would say what if we used our software.
Paul,For you to make an online store and then you could have it would that be good and they'd say all right and so we'd like we.
Interviewer,Can't get anyone to use our software but at least they're willing to let us use it for them and it seemed it seemed so.
Paul,Lame i learned so much about like direct marketing as it turns out it's called we were members of the DMA the.
Interviewer,Direct marketing association that's what you know in every business card carrying member the DMA were we were in every.
Paul,Business they have a name for the business that's not the name Outsiders call it like fast food no no no they.
Interviewer,Don't call it that they call it fast casual within the industry right and in in the catalog business that used to.
Paul,Call the direct marketing industry right um so that's what the dma meant back in those days the catalog business we.
Interviewer,Signed up for every catalog you know his catalogs you get in the mail we would just like write a wide right and ask for.
Paul,More well you had this like bookshelf full of every catalog ever yeah it seems like almost like if you were building a.
Interviewer,New search engine and what you ought to do is have a have your box out there and then just take all the searches manually.
Paul,And like get results and throw them out there and see what see what happens I'm trying to think what we did for mail.
Interviewer,That was manual in the beginning we we sort of a manual ad server like we didn't really have ad serving technology.
Paul,We just throw at like i wrote it so it wasn't really good and and we would just throw them in there that there's a deep.
Interviewer,Lesson there for four for four people though like what happens if you think you know the solution and you build lots.
Paul,Of stuff for it you're going to be wrong because you just don't know and having to use our software myself made it much.
Interviewer,Better because i would be using our software to make someone's website right and I was also the guy who wrote the.
Paul,Site builder and so i would be using and think to myself this is inconvenient it's like going in the middle of.
Interviewer,Building their site i would change the software and I mean ship as in like MV and like that's like that's the great.
Paul,Thing about server based software ship is the UNIX MV command so well know CP I would want to keep a copy but but I.
Interviewer,Would like change the software in the middle of using it and then go back to working on their website and boy did.
Paul,That make that that made the software much better that I had to use it yeah so um so picking co-founders you want to.
Interviewer,Pick the best people who you can somehow believe are trustworthy it's probably helpful for a lot of.
Paul,People i think a lot of people taking the class or sole founders now yeah why is it that that sole founders that being.
Interviewer,A sole founder is so difficult wow um there's so many different reasons like I think the hardest part is more L there's.
Paul,No one there's like if you have multiple people they keep one another going when things are going badly and there's no.
Interviewer,One to cheer you up that's what's hard for me I remember 95 I'd be like I know this internet thing.
Paul,Is gonna be real but damn oh so you were sole founder yeah yeah that's why his hair is greater than mine.
Interviewer,The yeah like being a sole founders hard like it's hard because there's a million reasons why what you're doing isn't.
Paul,Going to work and mostly you're right so it's easy to convince yourself to used used to say this and I always remember.
Interviewer,To used to say look you have two choices as a founder do you remember what you would say after that well there's so.
Paul,Many different cases this versions of this what will he would say you could either quit or get rich mmm yeah die or.
Interviewer,Get rich like the company's a lot of versions well that's what happens with startups mostly the company either dies.
Paul,Or it's something succeed you get rich and you know getting rich can mean you know you have a nice little business.
Interviewer,Where you're the boss and you have 20 or 50 employees or it could mean your Airbnb right they're both good outcomes.
Paul,Not as good for your investors necessarily but for you it really good and and doing things that don't scale.
Interviewer,That's hot you know and internalizing what that really means I was thinking about you know one of the it's the sort.
Paul,Of things that don't scale we talked about at YC all the time we say you're supposed to for success you talk to.
Interviewer,Users and write code you you talked and if you think about it talking to users especially as sort of the founder.
Paul,Doesn't really scale very well but that's what it forces you to do if you have to do everything it doesn't scale.
Interviewer,It forces you to learn right in the beginning you only have ten customers you want to grow to 20% you want to go.
Paul,10% next week 10% weeks an ambitious goal you only got to get one more customer you can go out and do that very.
Interviewer,Manually right and then next week you have eleven customers you have to get 1.1 customers right so this is basically.
Paul,One right you just keep going out there and doing things manually and as long as your growth rate is good it doesn't.
Interviewer,Matter how small the number is because a grow a constant growth rate means exponential growth and that means the.
Paul,Base number will soon take care of itself it's kind of thinking about what makes.
Interviewer,Companies good what makes companies fail and I was thinking about maybe how we could talk a little bit about some of.
Paul,Those those aspects of of how people can kind of figure out how they're doing here we have thousands of.
Interviewer,Companies out in start-up school and trying to figure out what to do next and whether they're doing the right thing.
Paul,And whether they're failing and whether they're on the right path what makes companies fail most of the.
Interviewer,Time is poor execution by the founders right um we we often talk to startups who are worried about competitors and.
Paul,One good event one advantage of why is he having funded so many companies you have a really large data set and like.
Interviewer,How many companies have been killed by competitors one more than one out of nineteen hundred right um so I tell.
Paul,Startups that basically you have the same protection against competitors that's that light aircraft have against.
Interviewer,Crashing into other light aircraft when flying through clouds you know what the protection is space is.
Paul,Large hey this little cessnas don't have any radar in them you know you can't see in clouds it's this it's it this falls.
Interviewer,Under the rubric of counterintuitive advice because one of the things that happens all the time is people come up.
Paul,And say oh my god there's another new company what should I you know that's in exactly my space what should I do.
Interviewer,Right and it's sort of like if you're running the hundred meters right and suddenly there appears another lane with.
Paul,Another runner in it what should you do you run as fast as you can just like you presumably were or hate if they're.
Interviewer,Better than you they'll win and if not then then you'll win and that's a good reminder could everyone please silence.
Paul,Your phones if you haven't already yeah what else like like one of the one of the things we do a lot is try to judge.
Interviewer,Wright companies in it founders nick who's gonna succeed and and and you guys are doing the same thing except you're.
Paul,Trying to pick yourselves hopefully what what what is it that then make startup succeed that makes.
Interviewer,Startup succeed well you have to start with a good founding team ideally not just one person that's my quote you can.
Paul,Do it with one person well i couldn't i couldn't III I ended up I ended up having to join other people like I.
Interviewer,Actually think oh that's majority that was not rock you know I was no way like I couldn't do it I'm not built that way.
Paul,I think most people aren't built that way that's that's my questions about Robert and Trevor that you know it's.
Interviewer,Just so difficult i would not try and start a start-up just with just myself as the founder hmm I don't think I could.
Paul,Do it yeah it's lonely enough anyway think you can but I couldn't so um you need a good solid founding team who know.
Interviewer,One another well and who can work together just like stuff pause they're like knowing one another well why does.
Paul,That even matter because what happens in a startup will shake your relationship if there's.
Interviewer,Any sort of flakiness or uncertainty or disloyalty or whatever like lingering in there it will emerge under the stresses.
Paul,Of a start-up yeah it's like a marriage only harder you spend more time with that purpose other differences there's.
Interviewer,There's potentially yeah okay so you get a good founding team you get someone who you can stand stress with so there's two.
Paul,Categories of stuff there's two categories of answers we could give here like there's the answer you give to.
Interviewer,Investors about how to pick startups and there's the and then there's like only a subset of that is useful to founders.
Paul,Right so like if like if you you know you could tell investors you want to pick smart people right but founders are.
Interviewer,As smart as they are if they party what can we tell them get smarter right um and actually it turns out it's not that.
Paul,Important to be smart um it's much much more important to be determined if um if you imagine if you imagine this.
Interviewer,Hypothetical person who's like a hundred hundred out of 100 for smart and a hundred out of 100 for determination.
Paul,Right and then you start taking away determination you know it doesn't take very long before you have this sort of.
Interviewer,Ineffectual but brilliant person um whereas if you take someone who's like super super determined and you start.
Paul,Taking away smartness bit by bit i mean eventually you get to some guy who owns a lot of taxi medallions but he's still.
Interviewer,Rich right or like a trash hauling business or something like that but like you can take away a lot of smart yeah.
Paul,You take a lot of smart and and add and take away a bunch of ethics at the same time and then you get that guy right he.
Interviewer,Could be president yeah I've been thinking about what like zoos thought that would Trump would.
Paul,Actually teach an important lesson yeah for startups it's all about determination I was think about these.
Interviewer,Axes we we think about and those are two like of the intelligence axis and the determination axis and and obviously if.
Paul,You were really intelligent really determined that's awesome there's by the way only one person has to be super.
Interviewer,Determined right right so like you know you can have one person who really wants to start the one the company and look in.
Paul,Person you and Robin exactly who after a month is like what we're still working but.
Interviewer,That depends on this tight bond where you can drag that person along with you otherwise they'll go away but I was.
Paul,Thinking there's actually another axis which is you have to have the ability somewhere on your team to to to project.
Interviewer,To think of but because your idea is gonna suck and then it'll suck less and less and so you have to have the ability.
Paul,To think what where should we like to navigate like you have to have some sort of creativity that allows you to to to.
Interviewer,Like make the right choices and you know actually you might not have to be that creative if you care enough about users.
Paul,You can just follow what what mit what will make users happy the way the way a scientist follows the truth and.
Interviewer,Eventually without much thinking on your the need to grow will give you this product idea that's actually the product.
Paul,That's the result of evolution so maybe you're either sort of Steve Jobs and can intuit what customers need or you just.
Interviewer,Have to have the skill of actually talking to customers and understanding what they're saying which isn't always.
Paul,Obvious you know steve jobs his trick was he satisfied users to accept he was the user it's like I don't want to have.
Interviewer,Any phone jack anymore so no more phone jacks for anybody right maybe he was just lucky that he his his desires were.
Paul,Generic enough that it was closer everybody yeah yeah yeah he was living in the future yeah like he didn't really.
Interviewer,Like the internet except for reading the New York Times so he never really got that right hmm interesting.
Paul,You work didn't you work you work at Apple at one point after you got bought did for this it was months what was it.
Interviewer,Like what was steve like could you tell from where you were in Apple what Steve was like yeah I got to talk to him a few.
Paul,Times he um he's different tell us tell us how are their useful lessons you can learn from him or Zia one off I wouldn't.
Interviewer,Presume i only met with from a handful of times and I wouldn't presume to know too much about them yeah you had a lot.
Paul,Of indirect evidence and stories and stuff like that yeah like do you ever see founders at YC you think to yourself.
Interviewer,Oh this is like steve jobs yeah i don't think we'd I don't think we'd fun to Steve Jobs at YC well that's not good.
Paul,Yeah and the reason is especially when Steve Jobs was starting off he was an  oh I think actually you would.
Interviewer,Find him because steve jobs would make you find him maybe right maybe we try like we try to avoid people who who seem.
Paul,Like they're and i think like and and and like we like you know you wrote a whole essay on on being nice.
Interviewer,Yeah the ronco principle right there's a couple couples yeah be nice yeah and called be good be good right and and I.
Paul,Don't think he would have passed the test especially when he was younger which is I worry about that because it's.
Interviewer,True that it's usually good to be nice and friendly and benevolent he wasn't.
Paul,Maybe if yc had caught him early we could have helped maybe maybe that would be buddy maybe that's part of what made.
Interviewer,Him successful in the beginning i don't know I don't know it worked for Donald Trump Donald or did it that's a.
Paul,Different kind of that example right yeah we should know what like in business determination matters more but.
Interviewer,Like business is not identical with startups I want to leave these these guys some time to ask questions but I.
Paul,Want like what are they gonna get wrong what what mistakes will these people make that maybe maybe hearing them might.
Interviewer,Help it probably won't because you won't listen but what you will get wrong is that you will not pay enough attention.
Paul,To users you will have you will make up some idea in your own head that you will call your vision and then you will spend.
Interviewer,A lot of time thinking about your vision in a cafe by yourself and right build some elaborate thing without going and.
Paul,Talking to users because that's doing sales which is a pain in the ass and they might say no and and you'd be way.
Interviewer,Better off finding someone anyone who has a problem that they will pay you to fix and fixing it and then seeing if you.
Paul,Can find more people like that best case is if you yourself have the problem right but like you will not ship fast.
Interviewer,Enough because you don't want to face the you you're embarrassed to ship something unfinished and you don't want.
Paul,To face the the the likely feedback it's humbling and humiliating when they tell you how shitty what you built actually.
Interviewer,Is right but that's the only way you get it better yeah so you will shrink from contact with the real world or contact.
Paul,With your your users that's the mistake you will make yeah there's a Paul Graham ISM in there which is all around.
Interviewer,Launching its launching before you're ready that some tell people the story of its Reid.
Paul,Hoffman actually who harped on that one early not me he there's I think he said if you're not embarrassed what with what.
Interviewer,You launched rather than you launch too late I remember when I was I was joining Y Combinator and at the same time this.
Paul,Is not necessarily good idea of launching imagine k12 this this EdTech version of YC and and I came in to talk.
Interviewer,To paul and he's like so how's it going with imagine k12 because he helped out a lot and I said well it was probably.
Paul,Called something else well no no no still it was by then you'd already he actually gave us the name of Magic eight.
Interviewer,Twelve and and so it was called a magic a twelve but it's like when you get a launch and I was like well we're going.
Paul,On our pr plan and we're finishing the software so this was like you know we're we're gonna have a summer batch and this.
Interviewer,Was probably in february or something and and I said so we have like you know probably in like six weeks he said one.
Paul,He just launched when he just launched now and I was like damn he just did it to me and we did we launched we launched.
Interviewer,Like within a week we launched and so that is a mistake you'll make you'll wait too long you'll you'll you'll be.
Paul,Embarrassed you'll we launched YC probably in less than a week of having the idea of course.
Interviewer,Launching it was merely saying was merely posting a website and and we didn't have we didn't have any software.
Paul,In the beginning people we just had this ascii form that people would fill out and reply to us by email the first.
Interviewer,Couple batches the applications were by email we would print them out and pass them around amongst the partners and.
Paul,Like we would all right grades on the top like we were grading papers and then we would sort this heap of papers and.
Interviewer,That was the application press talking about doing things that don't scale try to do that with thousands of.
Paul,Applications now it would be harder so we have lots of software that does that because eventually you scale you know.
Interviewer,Eventually you you build software when you learn what software you ought to be building.
Paul,It'd be fun to spend a lot of time more time talking about how why she got got started but but I think rather than that.
Interviewer,Let's some how do you have left we can probably go to around 12 and and or all videos that get too long or like no one.
Paul,Wants to watch anyway so so we've already been going for about 40 minutes or so so let's open it up to any.
Interviewer,Questions you guys might have yeah are you saying that if you get if you recruit your co-founder your friends as.
Paul,Co-founders you might lose them as friends I don't think that's a big danger I don't think you have so the.
Interviewer,Question was should i have my friends be Cole founders and then maybe risk losing them as friends or should I just take.
Paul,Someone off the street where i they're not I don't have the risk of losing them as friends but I they might break my.
Interviewer,Company is that was that your question do I get that right I already answered it dude come on I just wanted to make.
Paul,Sure they heard the question too just because I repeated the question how do you deal with different commitment.
Interviewer,Levels of co-founders and if you do have to fire a co-founder what should you do okay so the way you deal with different.
Paul,Commitment levels is you ask yourself would I rather have 30% of this person or a hundred percent of some other.
Interviewer,Person and in my case i would rather have like 10% of Robert Morris's brain than a hundred percent of almost anybody.
Paul,Else's so is an easy decision how do you could fire co-founders in Y Combinator the answer is you.
Interviewer,You ask carolyn levy y combinator as there's so much experience with dealing with crap like firing co-founders and.
Paul,Like you just go and talk to them and they say here you do this and this and this right.
Interviewer,And it's probably online too so you could google it really is it YC published how to follow we've we have.
Paul,Published we've actually if you look at some of the talks Carolyn has given and Christie I'm pretty sure they've covered.
Interviewer,That particular issue one way you deal with it by the way is making sure that someone has a little bit more stock.
Paul,Perhaps like it's usually better to have somewhat equal shares not not but not completely equal and if one person has.
Interviewer,51% the other person has 49% then they can you know deadlocked yes so when you talk about launch is launching to like.
Paul,Private bailout a couple of people good enough what do you have you just launch so what does launch really mean it means.
Interviewer,You have actually okay so the question is is launching in a private beta to a few people good enough for you to have.
Paul,To launch the general public i will take launching in just a private beta to a couple people because that's closer to.
Interviewer,The that's closer to full launch than like just sitting thinking of your idea in a cafe next yes.
Paul,Wouldn't we come out of the currently raising in the project maybe a little bit rate so basically you asking about I.
Interviewer,Seos yeah what do you think about i cl is Paul I have I haven't I know nothing about this world um I've heard there's a.
Paul,Huge amount of crypto money floating around um so like if there's money floating around it's often a good idea.
Interviewer,For startups to try and get it beyond that I don't know but but I will say like one of the things we've seen a lot.
Paul,At y combinator is it's not always right to raise too much money and even if you don't it like the IPO thing by.
Interviewer,Definition of - it's always wrong yeah the the ways a lot of money and the thing about there's a couple reasons for.
Paul,That one you dilute more than you necessarily need to but the other reason is that money just sitting there has.
Interviewer,Sort of a gravitational it makes you suspend it and it makes you do stupid things so it's like these companies that.
Paul,Have raised a billion dollars on icos and I don't know if they'll ever have a real company where you get like you get.
Interviewer,A bunch of lps and raise a billion dollars and then you just hire so many more people than you actually need.
Paul,Right i know that's the difference when I see oh I get it but just having a billion dollars when you only barely.
Interviewer,Have an idea is not necessarily you know magic leap raise 2.3 billion dollars and they seem to have almost nothing by the.
Paul,Way that is the trick for getting your question answered I learned that a long time ago you raise your hand as your fin.
Interviewer,As people are finishing the preceding question and and I see that guy's hand over there he knows the trick go ahead.
Paul,What is it my best tips for a great user interview um well you want to figure out but not.
Interviewer,Just what they think is wrong but what's actually wrong like what's missing in their life right so just start talking.
Paul,To them like say what would you like to do what would you like to be able to do that you can't and they might just you.
Interviewer,Know they might they'll they'll tend to give you an answer that's like a subset right um like you know if you were.
Paul,Asking someone about email they'd like to say I like you know I it's really important to me to be able to mark.
Interviewer,Emails as unread right and like what does it mean unread that whole unread thing is a sign that the whole inbox is.
Paul,Being misused it's what's really going on is it's a to-do list you know and that's why you have to mark items as.
Interviewer,Unread so they stay on your to-do list um and so you could so you start asking them with what's wrong and then you try.
Paul,And figure out what they really mean what they're really getting at which they themselves might not know you know.
Interviewer,And then you start asking them so what if you could do such-and-such what if you could do such-and-such right so.
Paul,Start by asking them questions about their life and then get hypothetical on them okay we should ask someone on this.
Interviewer,Side you've taken over so you just keep calling them you're doing great but you you pick you'll go all right.
Paul,Right there in the way corner how do you justify the financial risk of launching a shitty product okay.
Interviewer,So the risk of launching early is not as great as the risk of launching late it's not like there's only risk on one side.
Paul,Right there's a risk of launching late too so you got to have a rule of thumb about when to launch and my rule of.
Interviewer,Thumb the way i like i have this phrase for it that didn't become as sticky as Minimum Viable Product because it.
Paul,Describes what the minimum viable Product has but it's a quantum of utility right um.
Interviewer,Launch as soon as you have a quantum of utility which means as soon as you're there's one person in the world who is.
Paul,Glad that you launched because now they can do something that they couldn't do when there's when you if you don't if.
Interviewer,You have something that if you launched it no one would be happy then you're not ready to launch right as soon as there's.
Paul,At least somebody out there who would say oh here's this thing I can use because I can do X and before that I.
Interviewer,Couldn't do it then you should launch as soon as you have a quantum of utility it sounds like there's some wolves utility.
Paul,Function like if it makes too many people happy and like one person happy in like a hundred really unhappy maybe.
Interviewer,It's not ready but if you you know pablo Kaito he says if you have ten people who really love your product that's a good.
Paul,Place to be yeah all you need is if you that's why if there's ten people who are super excited.
Interviewer,Totally totally launch unlike and nobody else cares that is perfectly fine that's great okay well the danger of building.
Paul,Okay so the question is how do you decide between building what people need and building what people want right well.
Interviewer,The problem is what you really want to be doing is build something people will choose to use or buy more becoming your.
Paul,User or something like that and so here's a counter example to the whole need versus one thing what people need.
Interviewer,Is healthy food what people buy is unhealthy food so if you're a business which one do you want to do okay I mean.
Paul,Yeah ideally you want to make healthy food that also tastes good right but really um you can't you can't push this.
Interviewer,Too far you can't push this too far I mean I myself would not start some company.
Paul,Making junk food or something like that but if you are making food don't like or something where need and.
Interviewer,Want are very different be real careful about picking need you know or you'll go out and you know your goal will be to.
Paul,Cleanse the world of sin or something like that it's it's easy to delude yourself as a founder to think you're.
Interviewer,Like you yeah the other danger is what they need is what you think they what you what you're is implicitly talking.
Paul,About is what you think they need cleanse the world of your definition of sin right yes yeah normal as a founder.
Interviewer,To be to see multiple different solutions yeah sure absolutely you just have to pick one pick the one that you.
Paul,Think could get could get usage quickest what's the founder DNA founder DNA bothers you mean what makes a what makes.
Interviewer,Someone a founder yes it choose to be one what makes someone a good founder a combination of.
Paul,Positive and negative things i think positive things are things like determination and you know willingness.
Interviewer,To try new things but then there may also be negative things like if if you are I think if you have worked for a.
Paul,Large company for twenty years you might not be a founder unless you were forced to for visa reasons because if you were.
Interviewer,The kind of person that would that would make a good founder you wouldn't be able to stand working for a large company for.
Paul,Twenty years right and so actually we've noticed certain companies where the the alumni of these companies tend to make.
Interviewer,Bad founders and it's because no one who would make a good founder could have stood working.
Paul,For these companies for very long okay maybe we should pick one on this side okay what do you what are you price.
Interviewer,During lunch well you can probably guess if you know your business you know roughly what you should charge so you.
Paul,Should probably just go with whatever you'd guess if you want to be more scientific about it you could try.
Interviewer,Talking to it talking to some potential users most of the time you have some sort of tame users who are actual users.
Paul,But are also friends of yours or something like that or family and you can ask them.
Interviewer,Tell me honestly like what would you actually pay for this right um you can always change your prices later though.
Paul,If you want to lower your prices no one's gonna complain and if you want a grant if you want to raise your prices.
Interviewer,You just grandfather your existing users which if you have exponential growth will always be a tiny subset of your.
Paul,Total users and then no one will complain about that either so don't sweat about it too much.
Interviewer,One way i think about that is it just seems like in the beginning what you need more than anything is customers and.
Paul,You want them to pay so you will need to pick a price that gets you customers so you'll learns because you learned so.
Interviewer,Much from those customers and you're right don't lose don't leave you customer.
Paul,Price yeah cuz in the beginning you just want growth because the customers teach you the first customers don't just give.
Interviewer,You money they teach you all right two more questions you choose you you pick to you okay right up front here angel.
Paul,Investing so my name is karen and i'm with chat goose which is a chat manager so three tips for dealing with and.
Interviewer,Finding angel investors if you don't have you know the original goals etc well we never talked about fundraising.
Paul,At all well maybe i'll have to do this whole thing again that's good fun fundraising as it is it as a as a Nakia.
Interviewer,Is the thing to occupy your thoughts as a founder is overrated it's better not to be spending all your time thinking.
Paul,About fundraising we come to it much later in the class we don't need to all right so the.
Interviewer,Question was how to find angel investors well that's the part that's the thing I'm particularly ill-suited to answering.
Paul,That question because y combinator is like this machine for funneling angel investors into all the startups that it.
Interviewer,Accepts so like how do you find angel investors if you don't it's like asking a pilot how to you know walk along and.
Paul,Track on the ground i know the least about that um here's the thing angel investors are looking for you.
Interviewer,So get out there go to i don't know well there's there's lots of startup events the angels are ancient like they're not.
Paul,Necessarily good angels but angels are out there looking and the look the best way to actually meet angels is to get.
Interviewer,One to invest in you and then to introduce you to people actually I know the answer to this I know the answer.
Paul,Find find people who work at startups and ask them to introduce you to their investors that's the way to do it that's.
Interviewer,Good that's a good answer okay last question Paul you get to you get to choose maybe from this right.
Paul,There is why is he thinking of going after high school students to fund well I don't know because I don't think on.
Interviewer,Behalf of yc anymore but you better not be because that would be an evil thing to do there at wise high school students.
Paul,Could there are plenty of high school students who could start successful startups but they shouldn't just because.
Interviewer,You could start a successful startup doesn't mean you should because if you start a successful startup like that.
Paul,Means like the you know the footloose and francy fancy-free days of your life are over hey that like you're going for.
Interviewer,That company but we have funded kids in high school but only because they're already going like like it's that we're.
Paul,Not encouraging that i agree you think to go to high school encourage kids to like do this incredibly hard thing.
Interviewer,Instead of how fun and like like being kids that's that's awful I actually think that it's.
Paul,Moma chur optimization to write what you should be doing when you're in high school and even college is you should be.
Interviewer,Figuring out what the options are we're not picking one option and running with it right and you know it just turns.
Paul,Out that usually people who are in school and then stop to start companies it's like you know there are dropouts.
Interviewer,From harvard we know the classic examples but if you have like if you drop out and just go do it and it's.
Paul,You're on a path that's one thing but most people like they're dabbling and they have a fallback and that's not a.
Interviewer,Good way to be a startup founder you have to be a hundred percent committed and so we'll fund people in college.
Paul,Maybe even high school if they're already clearly a 100% committed otherwise no whatever Trent I think that.
Interviewer,Trend you're talking about is that is that you graduate from high school and why bother getting a college degree.
Paul,Because you're already a fantastic hacker so I'm going to hire you and and if that person wants to enter the.
Interviewer,Professional workforce well that that's great I don't know I was I don't think I would it would have been good for me it.
Paul,Wouldn't have been good for me either but you know like go off and start just some startup I just think between 18 and.
Interviewer,22 you grow a lot as a human being who's human and humane and it's not clear what what society will turn into if we if all.
Paul,Those folks enter the workforce it's it's good to like mess around and do a whole bunch of different things in your.
Interviewer,Early 20s if you could have work yeah whether it's whether this messing around doing a whole bunch of things takes the.
Paul,Form of college or something else just like don't be careful because like starting a startup is like catching a.
Interviewer,Dragon by the tail if it works it like be careful at what point in your life you do that Paul thank you very much for.
Paul,Coming in thank you  .
Interviewer,WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS THE KEY TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP?
Paul,"I'm going to assume that by entrepreneurship you mean starting startups, because in fact they're very different things. Starting startups is a tiny subset of entrepreneurship, with different rules from the rest. The key to starting a successful startup, especially for younger founders, is for it to grow organically out of your life"
Interviewer,HOW DO YOU PROPERLY IDENTIFY A COMPANY YOU WANT TO INVEST IN?
Paul,"There are hundreds of different kinds of clues, but if I could only ask one question, it would be Why are you working on this particular idea?"
Interviewer,WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF WORKING IN VENTURE CAPITAL?
Paul,"Working with good founders. Suggesting an idea to a really good founder is like passing the ball to Lionel Messi. You know he's going to score, and probably in a way that will be fun to watch."
Interviewer,WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN YOUR FIELD?
Paul,"The hardest part about investing, especially early stage investing, is predicting how much founders can grow. You're not just judging what founders are, which is hard enough, but what they could become."
Interviewer,IS THERE ANY SPECIFIC ADVICE THAT YOU WOULD GIVE YOURSELF IF YOU WERE BACK IN COLLEGE?
Paul,"I would tell myself to make an explicit effort to think about what interesting things there were to learn there, then try to learn them. Like most students, I blundered along semester to semester, worrying about whatever was due tomorrow. I never lifted my head up and looked around and tried asking, who here is working on interesting things, and what could I learn from them?"
Interviewer,Who do you expect to be your leaders for both the men and the women?
Paul,"Every athlete on our team has an important role to play! In regards to the leaders on the ladies side, it's evident all the upperclassmen are eager to help in different ways. During competitions, we will look to Samantha Sposet, Jodi Turk and Madisen Tretter to lead the charge. On the men's team, this senior class was part of a Horizon League championship team in 2013. Danny Roberts and Adam Ingledew were important pieces of that victorious team and continue to bring leadership every day. Based on his successes last season, we look to Philipp Sikatzki to lead the charge in the pool at each meet."
Interviewer,Who do you expect could have a breakout season?
Paul,Jonathon LaValle and Anna Evans each had solid a summer of training. Both are well ahead of where they were at this time last season. They are both in a good place at this moment.
Interviewer,What are your expectations for both the men's team and women's team?
Paul,"Our expectation as a staff and team is to control the controllable. We want to make sure that each and every day we give all that we have to make the team better. If we strive daily towards this ideal, the results will happen."
Interviewer,What most excites you about this group?
Paul,The energy that a large new group brings to the team! Everyone is excited to learn and get better. The returning athletes are also willing to share and help the team.
Interviewer,"Paul, there's a lot that people have learned from you over time, both from your essays and from working directly with you. So I just want to say thanks so much for joining us today. I'm looking forward to the conversation."
Paul,"I'm looking forward to it, too. Let's see how good a job you guys do. Are you going to ask me interesting questions?"
Interviewer,I hope so. At least I hope you'll have interesting answers regardless of the questions.
Paul,"It is actually a trick for interviews. If someone asks you a boring question, just answer the interesting one they might have asked, and nobody complains."
Interviewer,"The most fascinating interview I ever saw... it wasn't really an interview. It was a Senate inquiry or Senate panel. It sounds weird, but it was questioning Donald Rumsfeld. And the skill with which he responded to any question was a master class in how to answer questions. He never said anything he didn't want to say. He never answered any question he didn't want to answer."
Paul,"Yeah, I'm not so good at that."
Interviewer,"And I wouldn't aspire to try to be like him in a lot of other ways, but he could an interview very well."
Paul,"Yeah, kind of."
Interviewer,What drove the decision to go start a business?
Paul,Poverty.
Interviewer,Poverty.
Paul,"I was tired of being poor. I was working as a freelance programmer, and it was this sort of boom/bust thing where I would get money and then I would run out of money, and then it would be a disaster, and I just got tired of it. And then I thought, ""I'm just going to work until I won't run out of money.""."
Interviewer,"Did you consider joining a larger company, not doing the contracting thing?"
Paul,No. I've never really had a normal job.
Interviewer,"Is that sort of a religious thing with you, or you just knew you weren't suited to it?"
Paul,"It's like the idea of eating roadkill. Is it a religious thing with you, or do you just know you're not suited to it, right?"
Interviewer,And this is something you've always known?
Paul,"Oh, God, yeah. I'm the last person in the world who'd be suited to being in a big company."
Interviewer,So where did the idea for Viaweb actually come from then?
Paul,"Well, we did something else that was a bad idea."
Interviewer,Which was?
Paul,"We made software for putting art galleries online. Because remember, here I was in New York in the slums of the art world, basically, and it seemed like, ""Oh, now here comes the Web. We'll put art galleries online."" What a stupid idea. That's not how that business works at all. But we persisted in it for six months trying to sell this thing to people that nobody wanted. That is where Y Combinator's motto, ""Make something people want,"" comes from. From making something people didn't want."
Interviewer,What were the big online stores at the time?
Paul,"Marketplace MCI. Can you believe it, right? That's what was going on. These gigantic companies... does MCI still exist anymore? I don't even know."
Interviewer,I don't know.
Paul,"But these gigantic, late 20th century oligopolistic telecom companies thought, ""Oh, here's the Internet. Let's set up a task group of 500 people sitting in cubicles making HTML by hand."" These people were all making HTML by hand."
Interviewer,"So given that at the time, the  stores were being started by these super large corporations as side projects, the decision to say, ""Well, we're going to build a store builder that lets anyone do this""... Who was that ""anyone"" at that time? Did you think that companies like MCI were going to use Viaweb?"
Paul,No. We thought
Interviewer,"Right. It's interesting to think how long catalog companies were entrenched in commerce, right? The Sears Catalog was such an important part of the world for so long."
Paul,"Oh, God, yes. Sears was so huge, so early. Like, 1900. Sears was this huge deal. And it was so big. Like the Walmart of its time."
Interviewer,"It was so ubiquitous... the catalog was so ubiquitous that when people finished them, they actually used it as toilet paper in their outhouses in a lot of places. Because it was everywhere. It was the most available source of paper."
Paul,"When I was a kid at Christmas, the Sears Catalog was your reference work."
Interviewer,Really?
Paul,"You would go through the Sears Catalog... whether your parents bought the thing from Sears or not, it was the list of stuff. It was the list of available stuff."
Interviewer,It's wild to think that that was the list of stuff. That was everything.
Paul,Yeah. It was that comprehensive.
Interviewer,"Right. So then, here you come and you say, ""Well, we're going to take things like the Sears Catalog and we're going to convince them to put it online.""."
Paul,Yeah. Some of them did.
Interviewer,They did?
Paul,"Yeah. There were some that were quick to get online. Frederick's of Hollywood measured by page views. We charged a flat rate regardless of page views, and they got so many page views, we basically broke even on Frederick's of Hollywood."
Interviewer,"Moving back a step, how did you decide to work with Robert ?"
Paul,"Well, Robert, like everything I've ever done, I've done with Robert. Everything I do, the first thing is I bounce it off Robert and say, ""Is this a good idea? And if it is, do you want to do it with me?"" And then...."
Interviewer,And you were undergrads together?
Paul,"No, actually, he...."
Interviewer,How do you know each other?
Paul,"I went to grad school where he was an undergrad. He's one year younger than me, but he also got kicked out of college for a year for basically getting Harvard back on the Internet. Harvard's Internet connection had died of bit decay, which showed how unimportant the Internet was back in the mid-'80s. The Internet connection died and no one complained for a year."
Interviewer,And you met through CS Program? Or just through building stuff?
Paul,We were the ones who were there at night programming.
Interviewer,"Got it. Because this goes back to something that I've heard you say to a lot of people, which is the best place to find cofounders is school...."
Paul,"School. Yes, I think so."
Interviewer,And it's coming out of your own experience with it?
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And you weren't thinking at the time, I don't think anyone was really thinking at the time, ""Hey, I'm going to find a cofounder now who we're going to go start a company with or we're going to do something.""."
Paul,"Oh, my God, no. I went to Harvard thinking I was going to do general AI in 1990."
Interviewer,And then go into academia?
Paul,"Good luck. Yeah, of course. I was going to be like Isaac Newton."
Interviewer,That was the computer science path?
Paul,"Yeah, sure."
Interviewer,And where does Trevor come in?
Paul,"Well, what happened was I recruited Robert to work on this startup thing with me. And after a month... it's so funny how things turned out later. But after a month, Robert said, ""I've been working on this for a month and it's still not done."" He was starting to get a little grumpy. So I thought, ""All right. We better get some more people to work on us with this. Because Robert might suddenly disappear at any moment.""."
Interviewer,Had you spent much time with Trevor at that point?
Paul,"No. He seemed at the time, man... he had just adopted this new plan for organizing his life on note cards, and he would carry around this big stack of note cards. You would ask him a question and before he could answer, he had to get the appropriate note card. He seemed like such an eccentric that I had just completely written him off. Robert would be talking to Trevor in his office and I'd be gesturing behind Trevor's head, ""Get this loser out of your office so we can go to lunch!""."
Interviewer,At what point in that relationship did you start trusting Trevor? Or have you?
Paul,"Well, we recruited Trevor to work on Viaweb. And we wanted him to write certain things. We needed to be able to re-size images and stuff like that, right? So we get Trevor to work on Viaweb. And for two weeks, we hear nothing from him, and I think, ""Oh, this guy is so useless.""."
Interviewer,But he proved what he could do and it was just misguided a little bit?
Paul,"Yeah. Basically, it took the combined efforts of me and Robert to sit on Trevor and keep him under control. But once sat on, he was super powerful."
Interviewer,"Did the three of you think similarly about what the goals were for Viaweb at that point? It's a month or two into the company, the three of you are working together. Do you have a vision for what you wanted it to be other than not poverty?"
Paul,"Well, we wanted to get users. We knew we had to get users. Because this was one of these old-fashioned startups where we charged users money. And so, if we got lots of users, we would be able to pay our expenses and our rent, and we would not have to shut down the company. So we knew we had to get users. It was sort of like, whatever would get users."
Interviewer,Not surprising.
Paul,"We were all computer nerds, but I was the least nerdy of three, so I was...."
Interviewer,So then you were in charge of getting users?
Paul,"Yeah, of course. They did not want to talk to users. We had this joke"
Interviewer,"And that's the first time anyone referenced Buckaroo Banzai on the show. Which if you don't know who Buckaroo Banzai is, he was a fictional character. But President, billionaire, inventor, pilot, race-car driver?"
Paul,Brain surgeon.
Interviewer,"Brain surgeon as well. Right, I forgot about that."
Paul,And rock star.
Interviewer,"Rock star, yeah. Really, the complete renaissance man of late '70s B-movies, I guess."
Paul,That was a great movie. I recommend that to anybody.
Interviewer,"It is. When he goes into the mountain with the car and all of a sudden, there's another dimension because that's how that works... great movie."
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"What else were you learning as you were actually talking to all these ""Johns""?"
Paul,"Well, we learned about their strange desires. You know what we had to do? We had to do things that didn't scale. This is where I learned about doing things that didn't scale. And in the beginning, I thought that doing things that didn't scale was something that we were forced into because we were lame. It was only later that I realized it was actually the optimal thing to do."
Interviewer,"Were people not interested in using the software because they didn't see the revenue potential, they didn't see the value? Or it was too hard?"
Paul,"It was a combination of, they didn't know if it was going to work, and they thought software would be hard. Still, to this day, one of the big things programmers do not get is how traumatized users have been by bad and hard to use software. The default assumption of users is, ""This is going to be really painful, and in the end, it's not going to work.""."
Interviewer,Right. It's crazy that that is still the default assumption.
Paul,"That's still my default assumption. I've used Amazon Streaming and it says, ""You have to reinstall Silverlight,"" and I'm like, ""Oh, my God. Half an hour later, I'm still going to be trying to do this and it's not going to work. Can I avoid reinstalling Silverlight? Please?"" You know?"
Interviewer,"It's interesting to hear that's the thing that doesn't work now. Whereas ten years ago, anything you tried to do on a Windows computer resulted in the blue screen of death."
Paul,I wouldn't know. I've never used a Windows computer.
Interviewer,"You never used a Windows machine, right."
Paul,"Did you know, by the way, that the big incentive for inventing software-as-a-service was that we didn't want to have to figure out how to develop software for Windows?"
Interviewer,Really?
Paul,Yes.
Interviewer,Because you didn't want to write in that universe?
Paul,"Because back then, developing software meant developing software for Windows. That's what it meant, right? We thought we were going to have to build a store builder that would run on Windows. We wrote it on Unix in the beginning, because that was the only operating system that we knew or liked, right? That was just our world. So we wrote this thing and we thought, ""You know, if we just made it work through that browser, you could make clicking on links control the software. Instead of clicking on links just go to some other page, you could generate the page on the fly."" The page could be essentially a UI."
Interviewer,Right.
Paul,"It sounds so obvious now. But back then, that was not what hypertext was supposed to be for."
Interviewer,It was just links from place to place.
Paul,"Yeah. And so, we thought you could generate the places on the fly. They don't have to be static text that you're fetching off disks somewhere. It can be the next screen in the use of some program. And we thought, ""You know, if we did this, we'll never have to learn Windows.""."
Interviewer,Right. It inspired people in that anyone who didn't want to build for it would have to try something new.
Paul,"And boy, it was so great. My God, software, we would ship in a second. You want a bug fix? We would do this trick, sometimes, that we couldn't resist"
Interviewer,Right. Because everyone was used to software where a bug fix came in the next version that was pressed in a CD-ROM that was shipped in a box that took months.
Paul,"Even if it was sitting on the Web, they assumed it would have to go through engineering and would take days or something like that."
Interviewer,"There's a great illustrating example in this. There's a book about Intuit and how Intuit got started, and how they competed with Microsoft Money and all and stuff, it's a great story. And at some point, they're talking about how they finished this new version of the software. And as they pressed everything, put it in boxes, it was ready to go, and they found a major bug, and had to rewrite the software and repackage it in a weekend kind of thing. Everyone who worked at the company came in for the weekend and was just shoving discs into boxes to send out to re-sellers because that's what happened, right? It went out to Comp-USA and places like that."
Paul,"Even that was advanced. Because what would normally happen is they'd say, ""We can't redo it. There's a code freeze. Ship the broken thing and we'll fix it later,"" right? That's how a more grown-up company like Microsoft used to do things. They would ship stuff broken. They would ship stuff knowingly broken and say, ""You can download a patch later, because that's the procedure.""."
Interviewer,That's the 30- and 40- years of software trauma that people are dealing with. Which is why I think people are still amazed every time something works. A little bit amazed.
Paul,"You know what, though? I'll tell you. The one real advantage of having a Ph.D. in computer science is you don't blame yourself. Because you can say, ""This is really hard and painful for me."" And instead of stopping at that point, you can say, ""And I have a Ph.D. in computer science, so here's an interesting data point. That means it's probably too hard and painful for almost everyone,"" right? Except the people who wrote it."
Interviewer,"Right. Because they know all of the quirks and all of the tricks, and they internalize that."
Paul,"Yeah. Well, that's why it's really useful to go and watch your users use your stuff. If you build something for users, go and stand behind them. And my God, it is so hard to say, ""Oh, no, don't do that. Just click on that obvious button right in front of you. What are you doing?"" It's not so obvious."
Interviewer,Why do you think people have such a hard time taking that step and actually going and spending time with their users?
Paul,"I think because they think they know what their users are already like. And they don't realize how different they are. And boy, let me tell you, direct marketers are very different from programmers. We brought down the average for a while because we were members of the DMA, the Direct Marketing Association. So for a while, there was a brief convergence."
Interviewer,"It could be a great spot, though...."
Paul,That's what we discovered. It was fabulous.
Interviewer,Smart.
Paul,"All these people going to the bathroom would walk past our booth. We learned, though, you want to get them on the way out, not the way in."
Interviewer,Makes sense.
Paul,"All these little things, the 1,001 little things you learned. We learned, ""Don't take a house plant on the roof of your car."" We bought a house plant to decorate our booth. We were such bunglers. And when we got to New York, all the leaves had blown off. It was just this stick."
Interviewer,There was just a trail of leaves flying behind you on I-95 as you booked it from Boston?
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,That's amazing.
Paul,Three years.
Interviewer,And then....
Paul,"Three years between starting it and getting bought, almost exactly."
Interviewer,"And then, did you all spend time at Yahoo after?"
Paul,"Me and Trevor did. Robert didn't, because Robert still had to go and finish his degree. Trevor got rich and got his Ph.D. the same weekend. He graduated the same weekend the Yahoo deal closed."
Interviewer,He was still working on his coursework and his dissertation while he was....
Paul,"Oh, yeah. Grad school, man, you've got a lot of...."
Interviewer,A lot of free time?
Paul,... yeah.
Interviewer,How did you feel about selling the company to Yahoo?
Paul,"Well, we had made the thing to sell it. We had really made the thing to sell it. When we were getting kind of big, people would talk to me about going public. And I knew back then, going public would have been a disaster. They would have had to hire some suit to be the CEO. And what if the suit actually believed the part about him being CEO and tried to tell us what to do, right? What a nightmare. I didn't want to deal with that. Selling it was the only plausible thing."
Interviewer,Right. There was no model then for the founders....
Paul,E-commerce was not my life's work. I didn't actually want to spend my life working on this. I did it to get money and make that money.
Interviewer,"Yeah. This is such an interesting thing because it's so opposite from what you tell people a lot of the time, what YC tells people, certainly, of ""Don't do things just because there's a business there,"" right?"
Paul,"Well, it depends what you want. I tell founders, ""Do what you want,"" right? If you want this to be your life's work, then don't sell the company just because someone's offering you money. But if you're just doing this to make money, then do it to make money, but do it right."
Interviewer,Right.
Paul,"And your attitudes could change. There are lots of people who start out thinking they just want to make money, and then it gets big, and they think, ""Wow, I'm important. I already have enough money. I'll just keep doing this.""."
Interviewer,"Right. So when you hit that decision point, Yahoo came knocking and said, ""Hey, we want to buy you."" How did that work?"
Paul,"Well, we flirted extensively with Yahoo. They didn't just come knocking. We were an e-commerce firm. Back in the '90s, people tried to buy us 12 times in the course of our existence. This is how I learned another rule"
Interviewer,Why?
Paul,"Because they were like us. They were like us. One of the things we did that is now completely taken for granted was running everything on open source software. We used this free operating system, and everyone said, ""What? You're using freeware on e-commerce servers?"" Yes, it's actually better."
Interviewer,How long had they been around at that point? Two years?
Paul,Not much longer than us.
Interviewer,"Yeah, they were like three, three and a half years old at that point."
Paul,"Yeah, it made us feel kind of small, actually, that they were so huge."
Interviewer,"You wanted them to buy you, so does that mean you turned the other 11 down until Yahoo showed up? You said some of the deals fell through."
Paul,"Oh, my God, all kinds of disasters happened. People...."
Interviewer,You wanted the other 11?
Paul,"It depended what kind of offer they came up with. Basically, what would happen is people would suck up vast amounts of their time and then either disappear or come in with some low-ball offer."
Interviewer,Got it.
Paul,"Before Yahoo, we almost got bought by another big search engine, and they actually welched on the deal. It was a complete disaster."
Interviewer,Really?
Paul,Yes.
Interviewer,You've seen all the things that can go wrong with a deal?
Paul,"Oh, my God. I have seen almost everything that can go wrong with startups, period."
Interviewer,How did you like working at Yahoo?
Paul,I didn't like it.
Interviewer,"Was it the thing you said at the beginning? You're just allergic, basically, to working at large companies?"
Paul,"Yeah, pretty much. It's funny to think... to call it a ""large company."" Because when we got bought, Yahoo only had 500 people. We were only their second acquisition. Geoff Ralston was their first. But already, it seemed like a big company to me."
Interviewer,Yeah. And they had raised a lot of money. Were they public yet?
Paul,"Yeah. Yes, my God."
Interviewer,"They went public... 12, 18 months after they started?"
Paul,They had a market capital of $500 million when they went public. Isn't that crazy?
Interviewer,It's crazy.
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,It's crazy how to think how different the IPO market....
Paul,One-fiftieth of the valuation of Airbnb as they went public.
Interviewer,That's incredible.
Paul,Yeah. You know what's happened? The balance of power between VCs and founders has changed.
Interviewer,Right.
Paul,"This was back in the day when VCs thought, ""I want to unload this sucker as fast as possible.""."
Interviewer,"And they owned 60 to 75% of the company, so they controlled everything."
Paul,"Well, it wasn't that. It was board control."
Interviewer,"Well, yeah."
Paul,"And so, Yahoo was like a very different kind of company. Jerry and David were not the CEOs. The VCs appointed adult supervision. They called themselves ""adult supervision."" It was like this weird transitional state between pre-startups and the present-day startups. But now, the reason companies don't go public now is because founders don't want to go public. Who wants to be the CEO of a public company? Bleh, it's all downside. Who wants their company to be public and have a bunch of people speculating and the stock going down next month? There's just no upside to it."
Interviewer,"Well, there is some upside in terms of the liquidity that you can provide to employees and things like that. There are different things that you can do as a public company."
Paul,That's true.
Interviewer,"It's become more onerous, certainly, with Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulations."
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"So you sold the company, when your goal, originally, when starting the company was to make money. You accomplished the goal."
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And you could have just said, ""All right, I'm done. I'm going to paint for the rest of my life or write.""."
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,How long did you stay at Yahoo?
Paul,"I felt like I had to work there for a bit. They were expecting us to go work there, and it would have been a bad move to . Trevor lasted longer."
Interviewer,That's interesting.
Paul,"Well, the reason is they gave us options when we went to work for Yahoo. And I thought Yahoo was so overpriced. I just treated these as a joke. I didn't even count how many there were. My God, from the point where we got bought, Yahoo stock went up 12X. These options were worth huge amounts of money. I guess I better not say the number, but it was a shocking number each month after tax, just shocking."
Interviewer,"I think that most people, or a lot of people in startups now, don't quite remember how fast these companies were moving, like, how fast they were going up, and the amount of wealth that was being created by them."
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,It's crazy.
Paul,Yahoo was like... it was the poster child of the Internet.
Interviewer,A fact I did not realize until my mother told me about it
Paul,Dell?
Interviewer,"Almost positive. I should probably triple check this. But basically, when Dell started in the '80s, they had all these splits and all this growth. And so, they were earlier than all those others, and they just exploded...."
Paul,Rose with the market.
Interviewer,"... and then obviously didn't do great. And now, they're a private company again. But people always point to the Internet companies as the ones that got the most valuation bump. And it was Dell, I think, that was the leader of that pack."
Paul,"Well, considering Yahoo started out at practically zero, surely, the multiple for Yahoo was higher?"
Interviewer,Probably over those few years.
Paul,Yes.
Interviewer,Yeah. But not from graphs.
Paul,You should see the graphs. I remember looking at these graphs.
Interviewer,So Trevor ended up lasting longer because he....
Paul,"When I left, I left after a year."
Interviewer,So you left in '99?
Paul,"Yeah. Because I felt like it was okay. The product was safely launched within Yahoo. They didn't really need me, and I didn't like working there. And I figured, why trade something I don't need for something I do? I had enough money, but I didn't have enough time. So why trade money for time?"
Interviewer,Did you think about starting another company?
Paul,"No. But everybody at Yahoo thought I was going to. They thought, ""How could he possibly leave all this money on the table except if it's to go and start another company?""."
Interviewer,To make more money.
Paul,"So they totally did not believe... it's funny, at the time, all these top people at Yahoo were asking me all these things about my future plans. And I thought, ""Oh, how nice of them to care."" And it was really just because they totally didn't believe my stories about how I wasn't going to go start a new startup. They thought I was going to go and go and try and recruit Trevor, and take the whole store team. No, I just wanted out."
Interviewer,What did you end up doing?
Paul,Writing.
Interviewer,Is that when you started writing more regularly?
Paul,"Well, writing software and writing essays. That's what I ended up doing."
Interviewer,What was the purpose of the software you were writing? Just things for fun?
Paul,"Programming languages. That's what I've always been interested in. That's what I was always specialized in. Programming languages, especially dialects of Lisp."
Interviewer,"So you basically got enough money to return to the roots of what you wanted to do, which was being an academic?"
Paul,"Yeah. And I went back to Cambridge, too. I basically went back to my old life of sitting around hacking and writing stuff. Because I had been writing books before, too."
Interviewer,Right. So what made you start thinking about startups again to the point where you actually started writing about startups?
Paul,"I was always interested in startups. Startups are interesting. It's an interesting novel phenomenon. But I didn't write that much about startups. The way I got to be talking about startups really was, one of my tricks for writing essays was to agree to give talks. And the Harvard Undergraduate Computer Club, doesn't that sound nerdy? Well, it was, invited me to give a talk. And I thought, ""What shall I give a talk about? What could these people want? What would be useful to them?"" And I thought, ""I know. I'll tell them how to start a startup. All that stuff I have in my head that's otherwise going to go to waste, I'll write down in an essay and give them this as a talk.""."
Interviewer,How did this pair of UVA guys found out that you were giving a talk to the Harvard Computer Club?
Paul,"Because I advertised it on my website. I had all these people who would go to my website to read the essays. And I said, ""I'm giving a talk."" And these guys got on a train and came up there from Virginia."
Interviewer,"I think looking at the startup landscape, the echo chamber now online of everyone writing about it and all the stuff out there, it's a little hard to realize how little was being written, and how few people were talking about it back in '04, '05."
Paul,"Well, you know what? Startups had become unfashionable again. They were deeply fashionable in the late '90s, and then, pow, the Internet bubble burst, and the whole economy was bad, and no one was talking about startups in 2004, 2005."
Interviewer,Do you know how they initially found your essays?
Paul,"Well, Steve Huffman was a Lisp hacker, right? And so, he was reading stuff on my website because he was interested in Lisp, not startups. But then, I was going to give this talk and they thought... I don't even know if they knew the talk was going to be about startups. I'm not sure. Maybe."
Interviewer,"Startups weren't even really that much of a... like you said, it was a dead thing. No one was thinking, ""Oh, that's something I really want to do.""."
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"""I want to go and start a company."" Were you surprised, then, when you first launched YC... let's actually talk about that a little bit, because I'm curious if you were surprised by the reaction. Jessica spoke a little bit about where the idea came from and why you decided to do it. For you, was it a decision that you wanted to keep learning more about startups? Because now, this is a thing you were more interested in?"
Paul,"No, not at all. You know what it was? Jessica was going to go work for this VC fund. Like anybody who knows me knows, it's almost a joke how much the following phrase comes out of my mouth. ""You know what you should do?"" So here, Jessica is going to go and work for this VC fund. While, I, in the last few years, had had all these bad experiences with these idiots at VC funds. So I thought I knew how to do it a lot better."
Interviewer,"It's funny, though. In the last few years... at that point,  were eight and ten years prior. It had been a while, right? This was 2004, '05...."
Paul,Seven years.
Interviewer,Seven years.
Paul,But it was still fresh in my mind.
Interviewer,Yeah. A traumatic experience.
Paul,"Yeah. So I was telling Jessica, ""You know what you should do? When you go and work for this VC fund, you should do this and you should do this."" And the VC fund was taking a real long time to make up its mind about hiring her. Big surprise, a VC fund taking a long time to make up its mind."
Interviewer,You created your nightmare.
Paul,"Up there, in the middle of the talk, I said, ""But not me. No.""."
Interviewer,Did you call Robert to see if it was a good idea?
Paul,"Well, I called Robert to see if he would do it with me. I couldn't back out at that point because I told Jessica, ""All right, I'll put $100,000 into this thing, and you can quit your job."" So even if he said it was a bad idea, it would be too late. But fortunately, he wanted to do it with me, and so did Trevor."
Interviewer,"So it's funny to hear about you talking how the two companies you founded were founded, right? When you talk about Viaweb, it's, ""Well, I don't want to be poor, and so I want to make some money.""."
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"And you sell the company for an amount that makes you not poor. And with YC, you started not from that perspective. It's like, ""All right. I'm doing this for other reasons.""."
Paul,"YC, honestly, we had to incorporate it. But we didn't even think of it as a company. We just thought of it as a project. ""We'll just do some angel investing,"" right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Paul,"And so, the big innovation about YC... I mean, there's a bunch. There's a network of related innovations, but probably the single most important is investing in startups in batches. And that was just an accident that we did in the beginning. It was something we did in the beginning to learn how to be founders, investors."
Interviewer,Investors.
Paul,Interesting Freudian slip.
Interviewer,"So talk to us about how that first batch went for you. You decided... you called Robert, you called Trevor. Jessica was in. And Jessica mentioned when she was on the show that about 200 applications came in."
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,How did you go about sorting through all of them?
Paul,"Well, back then...."
Interviewer,How did you know what to look for?
Paul,"Well, you know, actually, we, ourselves, we're startup founders, and we knew lots of other people who were startup founders. So it would be like asking a writer, ""How do you know what to look for in a writer?"" These people were our peers. We could tell, right?"
Interviewer,It's very much a grad student approach to getting through a lot of the paperwork.
Paul,"Yeah. We would just have these big piles of paper. We did this for several batches, actually."
Interviewer,How do you start to decide what it is you tell startups to do at that beginning?
Paul,"I would just say what I would do if I were in their position, which varies tremendously depending on the startup, because startups all have different problems. But there's usually one problem that's the most urgent. And so, you zero in on the most urgent problem and then you figure out how to fix it."
Interviewer,"In those first startups, they were all basically consumer-focused Web at the beginning, weren't they?"
Paul,"Sam  was not doing Web. Sam was doing mobile apps before smartphones, how about that? And Reddit wanted to as well. The Reddit guys, their original idea was to order fast food on your phone."
Interviewer,My Mobile Menu.
Paul,Is that what it was?
Interviewer,"Yeah, it was."
Paul,"Well, it must have, because I don't remember much about what I told all these people 10 years ago."
Interviewer,Sure.
Paul,"There could be fights among the cofounders, right?"
Interviewer,Did you learn a lot from that first group?
Paul,"Well, I learned that YC would work. We thought of that first group, we thought of it as this throwaway thing. You know how when you're doing something with dye or something like that, or some sort of cleaning fluid, they say, ""Try it on a corner of the jacket first?"" This was the corner of the startup world's jacket, you know? We just thought of it as this complete throwaway thing. In fact, we pitched it for undergrads. It was supposed to be an alternative to doing a summer internship, which is like a throwaway job. We said, ""Instead of a throwaway job, do a throwaway startup. And at the end of the summer, if it's doing badly, you throw it away.""."
Interviewer,Right.
Paul,"And lo and behold, non-zero numbers of these startups were viable. It was astounding. We did not expect at all. This was supposed to be just a learning experience, and it seemed like it might actually work."
Interviewer,What showed you they were viable?
Paul,"They were getting users. They were getting growth. These people were actually building stuff and launching, and getting users. And they were going to keep working on it."
Interviewer,How did that then lead to deciding to do it again?
Paul,"Well, we realized very quickly that this might actually work."
Interviewer,It was the first week of the actual batch?
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Oh, wow."
Paul,"Very early on, we thought, ""Holy cow. This might actually work."" And then during YC, we seemed like a joke to everybody, which is not surprising because we thought of it as a joke. And we had this name for this phenomenon that would happen, when people would visit YC and realize that it wasn't lame. We called it the ""Y Combinator Effect,"" Jessica and I. And we would see it time after time. People would come to give talks at the dinners, in the same spirit they might have given a talk to a Boy Scout troop, right? And Steve Huffman actually looked like he might actually have been a Boy Scout not that far before."
Interviewer,"When you say that you figured out it would work, had your goal or your definition of work evolved? What did it mean?"
Paul,"No, ""work"" meant the startups would not die."
Interviewer,Ah. So startups wouldn't die?
Paul,"Right. Because in startups, there's a bimodal distribution of outcomes. If you don't die, you become rich."
Interviewer,Unless you become a zombie.
Paul,"Well, okay... that happens very rarely. It's pretty rare for a company to just drift along sideways. Because what are the odds you'd make exactly the amount of money that would be a good salary for the founders, but no more, right? How are you going to hit that exactly? So it's pretty rare for that to happen."
Interviewer,"Right. So within the first week, you looked at it and said, ""These are going to work in the way that the founders are going to get rich and the investors are going to get rich""?"
Paul,"Well, at least the investors aren't going to have to stop doing it."
Interviewer,Got it.
Paul,"Our big worry, when we started YC, was we didn't say it was going to be this ongoing thing. We said it was like the ""Summer Founders Program."" Just this one summer, right? We tried to hedge our bets and not say we were going to keep doing it. Because it was pretty expensive to fund all these people, basically, out of our own money."
Interviewer,Wow.
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"Yeah, that's fast."
Paul,It wasn't guaranteed that these startups were going to succeed. But it was a sufficiently good bet. Which is all you ever get in the startup world. All you ever get is a sufficiently good bet.
Interviewer,Did you have any thoughts of how long it would take for those startups to actually prove you right or wrong?
Paul,"Well, we knew from our own experience that it took years. Viaweb took three years, and that was fast."
Interviewer,That's so fast.
Paul,"Yeah, so we were thinking it would be years, but we would have data along the way. Companies don't seem like they're failing, failing, failing, and then suddenly after five years, bang, success."
Interviewer,Right. And I guess Reddit sold really quickly.
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,How long was it?
Paul,Like a year and a half or something.
Interviewer,Yeah. That's really fast.
Paul,I'm sure the Reddit founders would say too fast.
Interviewer,Right.
Paul,"I'm sure they wish they hadn't sold it. But at the time, it seemed like a big deal. Everybody was high-fiving one another at the time. Because everybody had such low expectations."
Interviewer,So what point did you notice other investors start taking YC more seriously? Was there a turning point or did it happen gradually?
Paul,"Well, the first batch, Sam Altman had... Sequoia invested in Sam Altman in the first batch, and we thought this was just amazing. That one of the startups we funded got a Series A from Sequoia? Holy cow. The first batch, at least one-eighth of the startups  12.5%, that's not bad. 12.5% of the first batch got Series A from Sequoia."
Interviewer,It's amazing what small numbers and single occurrences can do on statistics.
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"How did it change, then, from the first batch, to the second batch, to the third batch? Other than the California piece."
Paul,"Well, the California piece was huge. That was a huge change. And boy, did we do that at the last minute. The first dinner in California, we had to explicitly warn people not to lean against the walls because the paint was still went. Kate Courteau, the architect, had been in there an hour before these people started... in fact, I think we had probably had to get the paintbrushes out of the way."
Interviewer,The fumes were still pretty strong?
Paul,"Yeah, probably. We had the windows open. So it was really this last minute seat of the pants thing."
Interviewer,What drives a last minute seat of the pants decision to move across the country?
Paul,"Well, everything we did at that point. YC was so informal. It was just me and Jessica. We would just say, ""Hey, want to put on a conference called Startup School and invite everybody? Maybe we can get a room at Harvard.""."
Interviewer,"You know, the parallels to what happens in startups and what happens in YC are so strong. And I think people looking in from the outside have absolutely no idea how seat of the pants everything is."
Paul,Even to this day.
Interviewer,"At YC, certainly. But I mean in startups, in general...."
Paul,"Oh, yeah."
Interviewer,"You look in from the outside and everything looks so carefully plotted and organized. And just, everyone is just making decisions on the fly and hoping for the best."
Paul,"Yep. Yeah, seriously."
Interviewer,So long.
Paul,"Yeah. Early-stage startups are just fast-moving chaos. That is a constant. That was true in Henry Ford's day, it was true when we started YC. It'll be true in 50 years."
Interviewer,"Yeah. When you have a small group of people tackling a brand new problem with potentially new technology and customers they don't know, there's no way for that to be organized."
Paul,"That's why, by the way, you want the cofounders to have a close relationship before they start the company. Because they're going to have to throw a ball without looking and assume that the other guy will already be reaching out his hands to catch it, you know?"
Interviewer,"Yeah. Over the years, have you been surprised at the importance of the cofounding relationship? Did you know that right from the start? That that relationship between the two cofounders was as critical as it turned out to be?"
Paul,"No. One of the things I learned from YC, actually, is how many things Viaweb did right by accident. We just basically executed perfectly without realizing it and in fact thinking that we were doing everything wrong. And everybody would give us grief for so many of our choices. But in retrospect, we did everything right by accident."
Interviewer,Yeah.
Paul,"And YC did a lot of things right by accident, too. Actually, it's sort of like, maybe if I ever write an autobiography,  ""Doing Things Right by Accident."" Because that's the story of my life."
Interviewer,"I think the way that we sort of rely on that in YC is everything is kind of an experiment, right?"
Paul,But YC was started in order to learn.
Interviewer,Right.
Paul,"It was not started to make money, right?"
Interviewer,Right.
Paul,"It was started in order to learn about how to be investors. That is in YC's DNA. You know what you should do? You should keep that. Don't lose track of that explicit part of the origins, because that's the secret."
Interviewer,And maybe that's the key.
Paul,That's why it makes so much money.
Interviewer,"And I think that influences virtually every decision we make, and everything that we try, and everything we tell the startups as well, right?"
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,"We tell the startups, ""Don't do the thing that's going to necessarily maximize revenue. Do the thing that's going to help you figure out this market, or learn, or figure out what's next."" And you see people making these really weird, false optimizations when they're only concerned about making the next dollar."
Paul,It's basically sprinting in the first 100 yards of a marathon.
Interviewer,Yeah. Which usually ends up with a very tired person not finishing the marathon.
Paul,They look great for a while.
Interviewer,Yeah.
Paul,It is true.
Interviewer,Why'd you move (back) to England? You seem so consummately American to me.
Paul,Originally we only meant to stay for a year. We wanted the boys to see what it was like to live in another country. Plus I was born here and had always wanted to try living here again. But we liked it so much we've stayed longer.
Interviewer,What's the future of what we now call journalism? Is it all Substack (a YC company)? Can we run the global-scale world with that model?
Paul,"I worry about that. I worry that the kind of journalism I took for granted growing up was actually the result of specific conditions that have now disappeared. In particular, the newspaper of record that couldn't stray too far from politically neutral because they wanted to reach all the people in a particular region, both liberal and conservative, but which made so much from it that they could afford to support a thorough search for the truth."
Interviewer,What's the company you turned down that you most regret not having invested in?
Paul,"Unfortunately I can't name names, because we can't disclose which companies applied. There are none that I regret financially. There are a handful that have become fairly successful, but none, as far as I know, that would increase the value of YC's portfolio more than a percent or two."
Interviewer,"If Paul Graham hadn't become PG, what would you have liked to become? Full-time essayist or painter? Something else?"
Paul,"I'm not sure what you mean by PG. Do you mean an investor? Because that still feels to me like an accident. YC was just meant to be a part-time thing when we started it. The things I've always done are writing and programming, and that's what I'm doing now. So to me it feels like life is back to normal."
Interviewer,"What's the biggest lesson from parenthood? Do you want your two boys to go into tech too, or are you indifferent?"
Paul,"The biggest lesson from parenthood? Hrm. Maybe how much of kids' personality is inborn. Which in turn implies that the way to be a good parent is not to squish your kids into some predetermined idea of the perfect child, but instead to understand them deeply and figure out what will help each one to flourish. Fortunately I really like doing that. I love it when I find something that interests one of them."
Interviewer,Is COVID the final triumph of the screen and bits over the real world and atoms? (I tend to think so.).
Paul,"No. It has accelerated a few trends. But a few years after it's over, we'll be acting as if it never happened. We're good at that."
Interviewer,"Do you still invest in companies? If not, why not?"
Paul,"Sometimes I invest in the companies that present at Demo Day. But I'm pretty haphazard about it. I have no idea if I'm getting good returns, which probably means I'm not."
Interviewer,Why is the Pie Fallacy so prevalent? Why do so many even well-educated people think in zero-sum terms if all they need to do is separate the idea of money from material wealth?
Paul,"Perhaps the reason the pie fallacy is so prevalent is that it's in our DNA. Research shows other species have a concept of fairness. This concept of fairness must be based on an equal division of existing resources, since it has only recently become possible for even humans to create significant new wealth."
Interviewer,"You write, ""If economic inequality should be decreased, I shouldn't be helping founders. No one should be. But that doesn't sound right. What's going on here?"" Some might argue that you're rationalizing the importance of startups, private property, capitalism, etc. only because it worked for you. How do you respond?"
Paul,"Capitalism seems to have worked better than any of the alternatives, and capitalism implies startups, in the sense that you'd have to turn it inside out to prevent them."
Interviewer,"Which of the following statements are you most opposed to and why?1. Warren imposing a 40% exit tax on your net worth if you renounce citizenship 2. Warren imposing a 2% tax on wealth over $50M and 3% on wealth over $1B. 3. Warren's consolation, ""Good news-you'll still be extraordinarily rich!""."
Paul,"The exit ""tax"" seems the most alarming to me. Though it's called a tax, it's really just confiscation. And if you look at the other countries in history that have confiscated the property of people who tried to leave, it's not company you'd want to be in."
Interviewer,"In The Hacker Crackdown, Bruce Sterling refers to Robert Morris' Internet Worm of 1988 as the ""largest and best-publicized computer-intrusion scandal to date"" at the time. On a scale of 1-10, how *phreaked* out were you? Any key takeaways?"
Paul,"I was pretty freaked out at the time. It broke the whole internet for several days. It's true the internet was nothing like as important as it is now. It was just the playground of a few nerds at universities and research labs. But I was one of them, so it seemed momentous to me."
Interviewer,"You write, ""Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it's especially so in programming languages."" How does a new market entrant overcome this barrier? What key features do you see that inspire a movement towards a new programming language or paradigm?"
Paul,"The way new languages get attention is usually by being better for solving some problem than existing languages. Often this solution is represented by a specific application, as in the case of Unix and C. Sometimes an application alone is enough though. E.g. Netscape made JavaScript."
Interviewer,"As a public figure, do you feel more or less freedom to ""pick battles?"" Which hill are you dying on?"
Paul,"I feel less freedom, but more responsibility. I know that if I say certain things I'll probably get dragged by a mob. But on the other hand, I'm one of the few people who can say heterodox things without worrying about getting fired. So if I don't say these things, who will?"
Interviewer,"You write, ""It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower."" What's the top idea in your mind right now and how are you making it happen?"
Paul,"The top idea in my mind right now, to be honest, is Covid-19. It seems likely to become a pandemic at this point, and I'm trying to figure out the details of isolating my family. No one has talked much about this, but it's not a binary thing. You don't just lock yourself up in your house one day. You have to withdraw gradually. But when exactly is the point where you'd no longer go out for dinner? When do you stop having your kids' friends over to play? There are no conventions to guide us."
Interviewer,"Quotes Overrated? Underrated? Why? ""No man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money."" Samuel Johnson."
Paul,I don't think he really meant this. He was either feeling depressed or was just saying it to get a rise out of Boswell. He must have known that he enjoyed writing. You can sense it in many of the things he wrote. He's not grudgingly turning out just as many words as he needs to get paid.
Interviewer,"""You know, I'll tell you, boy. Guilt-it's like a bag of f*ckin' bricks. All you gotta do is set it down... Who are you carrying all those bricks for anyway? God? Is that it? God? Well, I tell ya, let me give you a little inside information about God. God likes to watch. He's a prankster."" John Milton, The Devil's Advocate."
Paul,"Guilt seems a reasonable thing to feel. I don't think you need to invent a God to feel it for. Even though I don't believe in God, I do find it useful to ask e.g. ""If someone could read your mind right now, what would they think of you?"" Asking that kind of question can wake you up and make you behave better."
Interviewer,"""I have not the pleasure of understanding you."" Jane Austen."
Paul,"This is just a polite Regency way of saying ""I don't understand you."" There's nothing more to it than that."
Interviewer,"Final question-follow up on your response to The Devil's Advocate quote. In Hackers and Painters, you write:""Within my head I make a point of encouraging the most outrageous thoughts I can imagine."" Turning your question back on you, if someone could read your mind right now, what would they think of you?"
Paul,"What they'd think of me is that I'm very unproductive. I've been so preoccupied with the coronavirus that it has pushed everything else out of my mind. I published a decent essay about ten days ago. Ordinarily I'd be well into thinking about some new topic by now, but this time I'm not. I have no project. That feels weird and unpleasant. Soon I'm going to have to say enough is enough, and push the coronavirus into a corner of my mind so I can have room to think about other things again."
Interviewer,"So let's start at the beginning:the history of Brindabella, and Aeropelican, and now FlyPelican."
Paul,"Myself and the two other directors are owners of FlyPelican. We use FlyPelican as a marketing brand name, although the registered business name is Pelican Airlines Pty Ltd. We decided to keep the Pelican in the name because the three of us were ex-Aeropelican. I started with Aeropelican in 1994 when it was based at Belmont down at Lake Macquarie airport (which some people call Pelican airport). Back then, we were affiliated with Ansett, and we operated four Twin Otter 19-seat aircraft mainly to Sydney. We were carrying up to 100,000 passengers a year from Newcastle to Sydne."
Interviewer,That was your first service?
Paul,"First service, yes. That and Sydney to Mudgee, which also hadn't had a service in two years. We went and talked to the airports at Canberra, and here at Newcastle. We looked at some better offices, we had to expand a little bit. We needed a financial injection. So we went and talked to the Mid-Western Regional Council which is Mudgee, effectively. And after three or four months, they awarded us with a financial program to give us a little bit of a kickstart, mainly with employing some more staff that we needed."
Interviewer,"So what did you learn from what happened with Aeropelican? And how is FlyPelican, your business model, different to that?"
Paul,"It's very similar. As I say, I headed up Aeropelican so I knew that the 19-seat market is a niche, unique market for an airline in NSW. Because we are the only ones. The next stage up is another carrier that has 60 aircraft. So we're not into competing with operators of that nature. What we were looking at and what we knew from the statistics and historical research was that some routes which had previously been operated by Brindabella or Aeropelican were very successful. That being Canberra-Newcastle and Sydney-Mudgee. We also operate Newcastle-Sydney, which is the only route on which we're in competition with another carrier."
Interviewer,So why do you think Newcastle-Canberra is such a successful route?
Paul,"It's high yield. Newcastle-Canberra is our bread and butter. With a 19-seat aircraft, we're not a low-cost carrier. We can't be. There's a certain cost to operating a 19-seat aircraft, when you've only got four of them as well. So the economies of scale aren't there. So you need to find routes that are supported by people like Defence Force and government travel."
Interviewer,Because of the RAAF base?
Paul,"Absolutely. There's a huge market; probably 30% of our passengers on Newcastle-Canberra are defence. I think there's about 7,000 people that are on this base, so there are a lot of people moving between Canberra and the military area. Up here is a RAAF base, and also obviously there's the government, state government, Federal government, politicians that are travelling backwards and forwards."
Interviewer,You also have a Newcastle-Dubbo-Canberra service?
Paul,"Last year, we started a Dubbo service which we do 7x a week. There was a lot of demand for Newcastle to Dubbo. There hadn't been a service previously from Newcastle to Dubbo, but Dubbo is the third biggest regional airport, I think, in NSW. Around 250,000 passengers a year or so. There's a lot of flights that come in and passengers that come in from Sydney, and they also have links to Melbourne, and they also have links out to Broken Hill, etc. So that feed from Newcastle was never present."
Interviewer,And so do you have any other network or route expansion that you're considering at the moment?
Paul,This year we're consolidating. We now have our fourth aircraft and this allows us to schedule maintenance in the week whilst operating the other three.
Interviewer,"You spoke a bit about which segments are more leisure and which are business. Overall, for the whole business, how does it skew? Business or leisure?"
Paul,"Business. Again, because we're not a low-cost carrier, our average fares have to be and it's a very broad term, saying your average fare but across our whole network, our average net fares have to be up around $150. So our average flight times, most of our flights are around one hour. But then we do have Newcastle to Sydney which is 25 minutes."
Interviewer,Do you do any cargo or FIFO or charters?
Paul,"We're quite capable of doing charters. We have that available on our website. We've got full charter capability within Australian territories under our AOC. We can go anywhere as long as the runway, the airport can take a Jetstream 32."
Interviewer,And do you think that model will change much? You'll continue with the occasional charters every second week?
Paul,"To be honest, the optimum number of aircraft for us without getting too big would be five. Because that would then, with the hours that the aircraft would be doing weekly, we would have one aircraft on maintenance all the time. So, the Jetstreams have got a 200-hour cycle for base maintenance, where they go down to Bankstown, and they go in the hangar. It's like your car going in for a service. It's obviously preventive maintenance which is being done. So if we had five aircraft and we were doing 200 hours a week on the other four, then we can really utilise much better the four aircraft. So that's our goal, at the moment, is to achieve the fifth aircraft. There are some other Jetstreams that will be coming available."
Interviewer,Is that with the same lessor?
Paul,Possibly. We've got two different lessors at the moment. But possibly one of them.
Interviewer,"Well, let's talk about fleet. They're getting on in age. Do you have any plans for swapping the Jetstreams?"
Paul,"Not unless I win the lottery! No, they're fairly old in calendar time. But they're actually fairly young in hours and cycles. We've got one Jetstream which has only got 14,000 hours on it. Which effectively is very young. Another one has only got 17,000 cycles on it. The other ones are up around 18,000 hours. So they're still fairly young. And they still have a lot of life on them. The finite life on the aircraft, they've still got another 20 years on them, the way that we operate them. And we're doing good utilisation, as well. So the finite cycle life on them, which is every landing, pressurisation cycle, there's plenty of time left on them. So we're not really looking at that. We're probably looking at getting some more Jetstreams and using them before we get to any stage of being able to look at renewing aircraft types. Certainly the 19-seat area, capacity, is what we're really trying to maintain."
Interviewer,So you're not looking at going bigger?
Paul,No.
Interviewer,You said you don't want to compete with other carriers directly?
Paul,"Well, look at NSW there's only a couple of other carriers anyway, and one of them has 60 aircraft. There are other companies like JetGo which operates jets, Embraer 135s and 140s. They're not operating in this area, so we don't have competition at the moment. That's not to stop someone starting up a 19, 20-seat aircraft market and competing with us. Sydney-Mudgee is not regulated anymore, so it's not licensed like it was previously to one operator. And a lot of those licenses now have ceased. So, there's always that potential that someone could come in and go straight over the top of us. But we'll keep trying to work smart and wise and just do what we do well."
Interviewer,And what about opportunities to link up with other operators?
Paul,"Potentially. Nothing has come about yet, but certainly every door is open."
Interviewer,Are you cooperating with Virgin or Qantas at all in any shape or form? Or are people mostly just self-connecting.
Paul,There's no affiliation with any other airline.
Interviewer,So people sort out their own connections?
Paul,Yes.
Interviewer,"Do you expect any more route opportunities to open up? Or as you say, you're consolidating?"
Paul,"There's always things on the radar. We're always looking at potential opportunities. There's nothing being locked in at the moment, but we're certainly in discussions with councils all over NSW, especially. As I say at the moment, we are looking at consolidating this year, and try and do what we're doing at the moment to a higher standard."
Interviewer,"Many regional carriers are struggling, especially the smaller ones with smaller aircraft, but you seem to be doing okay in the market now. So what do you think is different now than it was before?"
Paul,"The only way that we survived is the top five or six people in this company wear lots of different hats. We don't have the luxury of employing 20 different people to cover 20 different jobs. So we are very, very streamlined. I'm an engineer. I might be out changing a wheel on the aircraft in a minute when you go. I might come back in and hire a pilot, I might come back in and fire a pilot, I might come back in and look at the accounts for the day."
Interviewer,"Why do you think many Australian independent regionals are able to survive, while in other areas of the world it's been more difficult?"
Paul,"Australian regional airlines, how many are there? There's only a handful. There's only really three in NSW. There's obviously QantasLink and VARA Virgin Regional, which are kind of the next level above. But they're still regional operators. But the small regional operators, the ones that have only got four, five, six, ten aircraft, there are only a couple around. The other ones like Skippers and Sharp, which are down south, there are a few of us around."
Interviewer,But they are also closing down pretty quickly.
Paul,"I'm sure they are. But I can only really comment on what's happening in Australia. I'm from the UK, I worked for flybe. for eleven years. Back then it was Jersey European. I saw that company build very slowly and gradually when I started they had Bandeirantes and Twin Otters, it's where I got my regional experience from into being one of the biggest Dash 8 operators in the world, which they are now. I'm sure we won't be there. We might be one of the biggest Jetstream operators, you never know."
Interviewer,"You never know. And that's a good time to look to future plans. You already said what you've got for this year. Do you plan to move into New Zealand, for example, or even outside of NSW?"
Paul,"Certainly, I wouldn't shut the door on operating out of NSW. And obviously we operate to the ACT, to Canberra. We've done charter work in Queensland. The big thing for us is that we need to be very conscious of not trying to compete with anybody outside of our territory, as well. There are other operators Regional Express operate pretty well throughout Queensland, NSW, all across Australia. There are operators up in Queensland as well."
Interviewer,So you're hoping to get a fifth aircraft.
Paul,Hopefully this year.
Interviewer,Great. What sort of factors would hinder your growth?
Paul,"Fuel prices. Fuel prices at the moment are about the lowest they've been for a number of years, and it does help considerably."
Interviewer,Do they sometimes come back? They go off to the big airlines and come back?
Paul,"It has been. In fact, our most senior flight examiner was, not with one of the really big airlines, but he was with a large airline in WA, and came back home to Newcastle to retire and we snapped him up and he's been with us for seven years. And he's close to 70 years old."
Interviewer,"And would you consider mergers again, after what happened with Brindabella?"
Paul,"I'd consider anything. You know, we put anything on the table and have a look at it. I think we've got enough knowledge and experience to make good educated decisions on the way this company goes forward. The difference is now this company is ours. The three of ours. So whatever we do, whatever we spend, is straight off of our bottom line. We're not working for somebody else. It's all in our best interest. We've all taken a lot of personal, not just financial hits, but our whole personal lives over the last two years, put everything into this company to make it a success. I feel that we've got to the stage now where we've got all the platforms built. All the building blocks are there to consolidate, hopefully, and really start seeing things get better with what we're doing."
Interviewer,So it's only been two years since you've been operating?
Paul,Two years since FlyPelican.
Interviewer,"And does it feel like a long time, a short time?"
Paul,"In a funny way, it seems like a long time, because I was involved with Aeropelican since 1994. So I've been involved with these aircraft, in these offices, at this airport with a lot of the same people for a long, long time. And in a same sort of a position. But there's a big difference when it's yours and you're not working for somebody else. That's a huge difference. And that's the same with myself and Marty and Emil, the other two who are here today. Look, we're pretty happy with the way things are tracking at the moment. But like I say, it's a very small line between making or breaking."
Interviewer,What are you doing to protect your particular market niche?
Paul,"It's hard to protect what we're doing. We protect our slots, for instance, in Sydney. We've got four absolute prime time slots in Sydney every day. Two in the morning, two in the afternoon, and there are no slots available in Sydney. Our slot is the same as an A380 slot. Obviously there's a regional ringfence of slots that's available to regional airlines. But we're the smallest allowable aircraft that can go into Sydney Kingsford Smith. 19-seat. It was based on the old Metros and Aeropelican days, actually. So you can't go in there RPT with smaller aircraft. So those slots are like gold for us. We operate from Newcastle to Sydney and we get in at 6:40 in the morning. There are no slots between 6 and 9 in the morning. Nothing. Full capacity. And from about 4:30 in the afternoon until maybe 8pm. If you want to go to Sydney at the moment then it needs to be anything after 10pm and before 4pm. So we protect those, and they are invaluable to us."
Interviewer,"Yeah. I have to say, I thought the prices were pretty good."
Paul,"Fortunately with our fares, like any airline, we have basically four or five different fares which serve us on each sector, route. They range between the general use-it-or-lose-it type fare. We have saver fares, as well. Essentially if you buy that fare and you don't use it, you lose it. You can't change it, you can't name change, you can't refund, you can't do anything with it, you have to use it."
Interviewer,"I'm just being nosey here, but what's your sales system? Do you have an integrated sales system or is it all in house?"
Paul,"It's all in house. Our website, which we look after here ourselves, when you go into the booking, that goes in to the back end, the Internet Booking Engine, IBE. That then goes to a reservation system that is the backend reservation. So that's all looked after remotely, by a company."
Interviewer,"Just on that, you said that the reason you've stayed successful is because you've got a good team who wear lots of hats. So perhaps one of your biggest risks is losing someone in the team?"
Paul,"Absolutely. The main key people that are here, obviously the three of us who are the owners, we're the key persons, from a regulatory point of view as well. So I'm the Accountable Manager for the AOC. Marty is the CAM (Continuing Airworthiness Manager) which we have to have, you can't operate without one, and he is also an avionics engineer. And we then have Emil, who is the other Director/Owner, and he's the operations director."
Interviewer,And now you're a lot more hands on?
Paul,"Yeah. I mean, every hour that I do as an engineer working on an aircraft is an hour I don't have to pay another licensed engineer to be working on our aircraft. I've got to manage that obviously. I've got to manage my time and my responsibilities and through CASA's eyes, as well, make sure that I'm not overloading. Which I'm not. I'm fine at the moment. But it can be stressful. But that's what we decided to do. And hopefully over the next few years, things will be like a well-oiled machine."
Interviewer,"And as a last question, do you get much support from Newcastle airport? It's much bigger than it used to be, and you've got all these other operators."
Paul,"We've had good support, really, from all the airports that we operate to. We are Newcastle's only local airline that's based here. There's no other airline based here, hence we've got the nice offices. But Newcastle airport have been very proactive in making sure that we are successful, with advertising, marketing assistance. We have a meeting weekly with Newcastle airport senior management just to see how things are going. It's in their best interest as well. We operate the most number of destinations out of Newcastle. We certainly don't operate the most number of passengers, but destination wise we operate directly out of here to Sydney, Dubbo, Ballina and Canberra. Four different destinations out of Newcastle, which is pretty big. So they're very supportive and we've got a really good rapport with them."
Interviewer,Thanks so much for having a chat.
Paul,No worries.
Interviewer,You know i came out here earlier and they didn't clap as loud so it's pretty obvious why they were clapping loud this.
Paul,Time that was for you um all right i don't have any songs for you I just came in a few minutes ago and Jack was here.
Interviewer,Playing a song look what's going on in here and some he can pull that off I can't.
Paul,Maybe next year um so I wanted I know it's probably hard to remember what it was like way way.
Interviewer,Back in the beginnings of facebook um but that's where these guys are in the beginnings so I'm gonna ask you.
Paul,Questions about the early years right um which also have the advantage that you don't have to worry about saying bad.
Interviewer,Things it's a public company because we're just talking about ancient history right um so I wonder if you remember.
Paul,When you sat down to write facebook during that reading period what was the first thing you wrote like when you when.
Interviewer,You had enough code to test something to see if it worked what was it what did you test I don't.
Paul,Remember then what that would the first thing was that I wrote but it actually the first code for Facebook started way.
Interviewer,Before then right so it i like probably a lot of you guys I just built a lot of stuff for myself all throughout my.
Paul,Childhood i built games that i wanted to play I built a music player that I wanted I tried to build stuff that that.
Interviewer,I really wanted for myself right now as I was young I wasn't building very high quality stuff it was just stuff that.
Paul,That i wanted not not for anyone else and then when I got to college I started wanting to build products that would let.
Interviewer,Me get insight into the community around me and let me connect with the people around me and that had the property that.
Paul,You can't actually just build something that only you use if you want to be able to connect with people around you you.
Interviewer,Have to start building software that other people are going to use as well so I actually mean like Facemash oh well.
Paul,Before that you know it's actually one of the UM it's that stupid movie makes everyone think that Facemash was like.
Interviewer,Was this critical thing but but actually a lot earlier than that in my sophomore year one of the first.
Paul,Things that i built that was kind of like this was actually called coursematch I don't think we've talked.
Interviewer,About this that much and you know startup schools it was um I was trying to figure out what classes I wanted to.
Paul,Take my sophomore fall and i wanted to see what other people who had taken the CS classes that I'd taken wanted to take.
Interviewer,And what my friends were planning on taking and what they'd taken in the past but there was no database like that that.
Paul,Was out there so i thought all right well how can I do this so I went and I wrote this little script that scraped.
Interviewer,The course catalog and let people put in what classes they wanted and I called it the course graph and um and that was.
Paul,Actually the first time yeah i mean it was it was actually I made the mistake of running it running the website from a.
Interviewer,Laptop in my dorm room and the my desk was right next to the bathroom when there was like constantly steam pouring.
Paul,Out of that from people showering so the laptop actually fried and I lost that one after like a few weeks of it running.
Interviewer,But that was the first time that i had ever really set up a production you know Apache server my sequel server or a lot.
Paul,Of that stuff and then you know a lot of those those things you know then when I went on to build later stuff I had those.
Interviewer,Lessons and i knew that i could set those things up quickly so those were just building blocks on top of which to.
Paul,"Build future things did people put their classes in it did you use it oh yeah but ya know it was like a thousand or 2,000."
Interviewer,"People out of the reasons like 6,000 people at Harvard yeah yeah so I mean it worked fine."
Paul,Amid it it was actually really interesting people spent so much time just clicking through the links of.
Interviewer,People to see what classes they were in and then in the classes they clicked on people who the roster the the people.
Paul,Whose just it was i thought it was going to be interesting and I wanted to solve this problem but it was actually just.
Interviewer,Way more compelling and you know part of my theory at the time was you know I looked at all the other types of content.
Paul,That we're out there on the internet right it's like you could search for any music or news or content or reference.
Interviewer,Material that you wanted but part of my theory at the time was that people were really missing from the internet right.
Paul,And there were no services like that and you know that's why I built some of these services that that went in that.
Interviewer,Direction but i still think people are largely missing from a lot of the software that we build which is why I.
Paul,Focused on building this development platform today as part of Facebook's that way the next.
Interviewer,Generation of software that the industry builds can just be more human so every app that people build has this sort of.
Paul,Additional dimension now where you can sort of see what other people are doing - we're trying to go in that direction.
Interviewer,So you knew by the time you started Facebook that if you made some website you could get thousands of people to.
Paul,Show up to it well i it was i didn't have a choice I knew that if I wanted to do this that I had to build something.
Interviewer,That i could that would get people to use it I didn't know if I could actually do that so but it must have been a.
Paul,Little bit surprising that thousands of people that are very sources on writer people would shut up for something that.
Interviewer,Wasn't even intended to get raw thousands in originally I probably do it again right well yeah and then I did a.
Paul,Few more and i was really focused on this idea of channeling a community's energy to build some kind of shared.
Interviewer,Asset whether it's you know the course graph or you know ultimately Facebook was a good example of this I mean one of.
Paul,My favorite stories from from college that I actually I think I've told it startup school before is I built the.
Interviewer,First version of facebook during reading period which is basically this two or three week period that Harvard I don't.
Paul,Know if they still give this but they don't yeah I think I stopped by talking well you know both Microsoft and.
Interviewer,Facebook started during reading pso never likes canceling things that work so the.
Paul,Um but so basically it's this period during January before your finals where you can ostensibly study for classes for.
Interviewer,Your finals and and i took that period to write the first version of Facebook I don't think I've written any code for.
Paul,That project directly until really January and then by the end of January is basically done with it but then one.
Interviewer,Day i woke up a couple of days before this um final for this class that was taking called a room of Augustus it was.
Paul,This lit in arts class and the class was all about learning the historical significance of a bunch of pieces of art.
Interviewer,That were there and for the final they were just going to show some pieces of art from the class and you have to write.
Paul,An essay on the significance of them and I hadn't really gone to class all term I just like programmed and then during.
Interviewer,Reading period when i should have been learning this I programmed and so I was pretty screwed right there's no way that.
Paul,I was going to cover all this material so I just went to the course website downloaded all the the images and I made.
Interviewer,A little website that basically would randomly shown in the images and would let you contribute your notes of what.
Paul,You thought was reasonable of what was important about that photo your notes see everyone else's taken by going to.
Interviewer,Class what's up yeah but other people could learn through hard work and um and then I sent this out to the course email.
Paul,List as like hey guys i built a study tool and within an hour the whole thing was just populated with all the.
Interviewer,Information that we needed to take the class to take the final so I think I did pretty well in the final I don't.
Paul,Remember the exact grade but tell us about some real-world system you have hacked to your advantage.
Interviewer,What's up that's an answer that's a question on the YC application form we actually asked for people having done a.
Paul,Trick like that um that would get our attention incidentally if you ever want to do oh I.
Interviewer,See uh-huh well it's funny you know the first couple times I met mark after all.
Paul,This time evaluating startup founders i can't turn it off so I'm like the first couple times I met mark there would be.
Interviewer,This like prophesied process running in my head saying accept him accepting him say and I would have to say stop it it's.
Paul,Too late well no we get to work together on other things hmm um all right no I love it I love it um so one of the.
Interviewer,Things i we talked about last year was how when you first launched Facebook the first other colleges you expanded to.
Paul,Were ones that had competing services so I didn't ask you at the time but I wonder now why did you win what was it.
Interviewer,That facebook had that the competing services didn't I think it was just this focus on real identity and the.
Paul,Connections between people but it goes back to this theme where before Facebook on the internet there were you could.
Interviewer,Find a lot of information about a lot of different types of content but the thing that we as people care the most about.
Paul,Which is other people write it around us and our brains are just wired that way it wasn't there and if you think about.
Interviewer,It the reason is that you know that that information about people isn't just out there on the internet to be indexed by.
Paul,Some search engine right you can't just send a web crawler around and learn what's going on with people you have to.
Interviewer,Build tools that give people the the power to share that that content themselves and that stuff didn't exist.
Paul,And if you go back you know most of the way that people interact online was anonymous right and the idea at the time.
Interviewer,Was that it was pretty scary to put your name and real identity online without the right privacy controls and without.
Paul,Kind of the right community infrastructure so I think that that's a lot of what we built was a framework.
Interviewer,Where people would be comfortable sharing in that way and we're people able to share less on these.
Paul,Competing services there were three universities you mentioned yeah I mean Stanford Yale and Columbia.
Interviewer,Yeah they each had different things i think some of them were just they gave people less ways to express content.
Paul,About themselves none of them i think had a concept of connections right so one of the things that if you think.
Interviewer,About you friend people yeah and if you think about friending today and one of the.
Paul,Reasons why it's important is because you get the person's content in your newsfeed right and there was no newsfeed.
Interviewer,Back then right so a lot of the reason that that friending was was good was just because you could put someone on.
Paul,Your profile and say that you were connected to them so just like people were more fascinated than intuitively it.
Interviewer,Seemed like they should have been about looking and clicking through the classes that people were taking a lot of people.
Paul,Also just wanted to see who other people knew there was nothing like that that existed so you had friending from the.
Interviewer,Beginning oh yeah that was a really critical piece so the missing religion teen connections they had the nodes of.
Paul,The social graph but not the arcs um well there's that and I think there's less emphasis on real identity in the.
Interviewer,Community so some of these communities you know just like you you made it so that people could sign up with a.
Paul,Pseudonym which is is fine i mean i think there are lots of services that are good with pseudonyms but if you're.
Interviewer,Talking about real a real community then then you want that why do you have its drawbacks have you ever seen the.
Paul,Comments on a kearney's i think if people were talking under their own names they might be a bit more civilized.
Interviewer,Well i mean sometimes it's actually it goes both ways though right I mean a lot of the advantage of that is that people.
Paul,Can be very critical right it's if you're always talking into your real name it there's often a social penalty.
Interviewer,For being critical so it is more civilized I think but that may not always be the most productive thing mmm.
Paul,So you want to balance of these things at the moment I envy you um so well we can talk after this without getting.
Interviewer,Called my god her to do i know what you're about to say yes the devil you know or the devil you.
Paul,Don't okay the keys don't only use Facebook connected right it's some people make.
Interviewer,That can use facebook and twitter well yeah or Facebook and email or whatever whatever else do.
Paul,Twitter's fine too how minutes what you want to use to you want to all right now this is a hypothetical question um so if.
Interviewer,You hadn't started facebook like for example if if Harvard had already cancelled reading period um and you were.
Paul,Actually kicked me out right or they kicked you out for facematch a smash you know you asked this question before.
Interviewer,About what i've started facebook without Facemash about the only thing that I got from Facemash was I met my wife because.
Paul,Of it because my harvard said that they were gonna kick me out and my friends really thought that they were gonna kick.
Interviewer,Me out so they planned this going-away party for me and actually met my wife at that party so they didn't even wait for.
Paul,The ad board to decide before they had the going-away party they were so sure yeah my friends were just like.
Interviewer,Completely positive that i was gonna get kicked out of school actually you know not only that but my family was pretty.
Paul,Confident that i was gonna either get kicked out or drop out of school too before I started college my little.
Interviewer,Sister bet me that she would finish college before me and my mom later told me that she always knew I was gonna.
Paul,Leave college oh it was like oh thanks mom so here's my hypothetical question if you hadn't started Facebook um there.
Interviewer,Would probably be something like Facebook now yeah would it have would it have to have been.
Paul,Something that started out as a network for college students was that thermal so powerful the winner would have had to be.
Interviewer,One of these college things were could MySpace have sort of morphed and grown and you know become it yeah I don't.
Paul,Think it had to be a college thing you know one of my earliest memories from Facebook was I I used to get pizza.
Interviewer,Almost every night with one of my friends I did my computer science problem sets with and we used to talk.
Paul,About technology and where we saw the world going and I remember one of our conversations right after I'd launched.
Interviewer,Facebook was about how i was really excited to offer the service for our community but that one.
Paul,Day clearly someone was going to build this for the world right and it hadn't even crossed my mind that maybe we would.
Interviewer,Be the ones to do it because from my perspective it's like alright we're just college students what do we know about.
Paul,Building software that hundreds of millions of people will use you know clearly this is going to be something.
Interviewer,That you know microsoft or google or Yahoo or someone like that who builds these services that that tons of people.
Paul,Use is going to do it and it when was the time when you realized you were gonna do it like how many how many.
Interviewer,Schools do you have before you realized this was horribly it probably later on when we went outside of college but even.
Paul,Live it up to the point where you had hundreds of colleges you still thought some big company was gonna come along.
Interviewer,And do this better well not necessarily the college part but I didn't know that we were going to be the people building.
Paul,The the community to kind of connect everyone right so it's um in retrospect though it was pretty obvious no no not.
Interviewer,At all you know i actually i spent a bunch of time analyzing and in reflecting on why it was that we were.
Paul,Even able to do it because oh like all reasons suggest that we shouldn't have been able to do it right because all.
Interviewer,These other companies had way more engineering power and and and servers and time and money and all this stuff.
Paul,And i actually think that this is a pretty instructive thing for anything that you want to go do because this is.
Interviewer,The same property is gonna be true for anything that you guys start is that someone else is going to have more.
Paul,Resources and be able to do it the reason why I think we actually ended up being the ones doing it is because we.
Interviewer,Just cared way more about it than everyone else right so there were always projects at some of these other.
Paul,Companies that were these hobbies but we always thought that it was this really important thing and really just like.
Interviewer,Felt in our gut in our heart that we wanted to do it and you know early on there were always these skeptics saying.
Paul,That oh this can't be a business whedon actually care that much about it being a business early on but a lot of the.
Interviewer,Reason why bigger companies didn't invest in it was because it wasn't clear that there was a model that would work.
Paul,For it it seemed like a bad idea yeah and I actually think that's true for a lot of the best ideas where it is that.
Interviewer,It's not that someone else can't do it they actually can and the odds are stacked against you but I think often.
Paul,That belief and the fact that you just care so much about what you're doing is the only thing that kind.
Interviewer,Of drives you to do it and you know to be honest that kind of drives me to this day I mean one of the big emphasis.
Paul,Points for the company right now is internet org and you know for why we had this rallying cry of can we connect a.
Interviewer,Billion people and you know when we start talking about that we thought that was crazy you right it was way bigger.
Paul,Than any service in the world that had been built and you know it was ten digits long right it's like a you know.
Interviewer,It just it felt crazy we'd never get to that but then the thing is as we've started to actually get closer to that.
Paul,We took a step back and like alright well our mission isn't actually to get one in seven people in the world to be.
Interviewer,Connected it's we want to connect everyone so it's um it's a big issue that only around a third of the people.
Paul,In the world have access to the internet and that's something that we think that we can do something about and similar to.
Interviewer,Early facebook we don't there's no business model around this I mean all the people who have all the money in the.
Paul,World i mean it's not necessarily a fair thing are already the people who are on Facebook right it's in the first you.
Interviewer,Know seventh of the world but we just believe really strongly it's like this is what we were here to do this is what.
Paul,Our company cares about i care about it the team cares about it our culture cares about it so we're just going to.
Interviewer,Keep pushing on it and i actually think a lot of the reason why great stuff gets built is because it's kind of irrational.
Paul,At the time but so it kind of selects for the people who care the most about it doing it do you think there's there's.
Interviewer,Anything about you like if a personal quality of yours besides sort of basic smartness and determination that made.
Paul,You well-suited to work on this this project I realized this requires some introspection yeah I actually think.
Interviewer,Determination is probably the biggest piece you know it's um so many things go wrong when you're starting a company and.
Paul,Often i think people ask you know what mistakes should you avoid making and you know my answer that question is don't.
Interviewer,Even bother trying to avoid mistakes because you're going to make tons of mistakes right and the the important.
Paul,Thing is actually learning quickly from whatever mistakes you make and not giving up right and I mean there are.
Interviewer,Things every single year of facebook's existence that could have killed us or made it so that it just seemed like.
Paul,Moving forward and making a lot of progress just seemed intractable but you just kind of bounce back and you learn.
Interviewer,And nothing is impossible you just have to kind of keep running through the walls.
Paul,So the biggest mistake is the sort of meta mistake of letting a mistake Lorelei's you hmm.
Interviewer,Um do you think facebook know i don't know one who knows a better do you think Facebook had a rougher time like do you.
Paul,Think it ran into more obstacles early on than typical startups because now you've known oh you know a lot of other.
Interviewer,People who started startups and you've heard all a ghastly stories about what goes on behind the scenes do you think.
Paul,It was more of a show or less we're about normal probably more yeah and I mean Bry well part of the reason was.
Interviewer,Because i knew nothing when i got started I mean you have to him I was 19 years old when I started Facebook right.
Paul,So i mean probably like that the same age or younger than most of you guys I think you would be young for this.
Interviewer,Actually and um i knew nothing nothing about business at all right not even think that I was starting a company I.
Paul,Actually remember when i first came out here for the summer with Dustin because we want to learn from Silicon Valley.
Interviewer,Companies i remember driving up the 101 and seeing all these great companies and thinking to myself oh wow these are such.
Paul,Amazing companies maybe one day i'll start a company and I'd already started Facebook right and and it like hadn't.
Interviewer,Occurred to me that that was actually you know so um how did you learn how did you learn well just advanced people.
Paul,Around me but there's so many mistakes that just come from not I mean like I really knew so little at the time I mean.
Interviewer,Like when peter thiel came in to invest one thing that he demanded was that all of the founders beyond vesting schedules.
Paul,And um i didn't even know what a vesting schedule was I'd never heard of that right so I mean part of the the early.
Interviewer,Conflict that i had with um with eduardo who's one of our founders who then left was he was at Harvard with us we kind of.
Paul,Decided okay if we started a company would divide the equity up this way we hadn't heard of vesting schedules and.
Interviewer,Then he just balanced he never moved out to California with us so so Peter was like oh all you guys have to be on.
Paul,Vesting schedules like oh now what do we do right so in but it's fine I mean it's like that mistake probably.
Interviewer,Cost me billions of dollars but it's fine you just you you move forward and and you can't.
Paul,Hit it doesn't matter right i mean you just kind of keep pushing forward and um and that's how it goes yeah um how did.
Interviewer,You learn though like you you start out that's good you can do it Robert um uh um.
Paul,So you start out as a 19 year old right and you have this website that's just like going through the roof Ron was.
Interviewer,Talking earlier about her very early on that the graphs just were going up very steeply um you had to learn how to.
Paul,Create this organization you know you had to learn how to be a manager that's the next phase after you raise money and.
Interviewer,You have something that's growing how did you learn how to how to manage people well through a lot of mistakes.
Paul,Um i don't think anyone is like naturally good at hiring out of the box so right it's a key you have to learn in.
Interviewer,Each role we probably went through multiple iterations before landing on a balance of a person that made sense and.
Paul,And the problems made even harder by the fact that you don't need the same thing at each stage right so it's a moving.
Interviewer,Target as well but that's just tiring though you have to somehow lead a group of people and get them all to work.
Paul,Together that's very hard yeah that's what you do now right you don't program much probably right you spend all the.
Interviewer,Way from managing yeah well mostly poor fun now you're a mando an expert no absolutely not.
Paul,You must be right it's yeah try telling that to my team no um but how did you learn it was there anyone who taught you.
Interviewer,Just were any bullet you just have to throw yourself in right so you I was really just trying here six so I have um.
Paul,You know i've developed a few heuristics over time that I think are simple enough that the organization can internalize so.
Interviewer,In terms of hiring you know everyone says hire good people right no one wants to hire like a reasonable person um you.
Paul,Know you want to hire like a really good person but then the question is how do you like what's the right heuristic for.
Interviewer,Determining if someone's really good so over time what I figured out was that the only actual way to let someone.
Paul,Lies whether someone was really good was if they would work for that person so I don't think that needs to recurse too.
Interviewer,Many levels down in the organization but I basically think that that's like that's a really good heuristic right and.
Paul,And i i believe that i mean for if you look at my management team today I mean if we were in an alternate universe and.
Interviewer,I hadn't started the company it would be an honor to work for any of these people and I think if you if you build a.
Paul,Company that has kind of those values rather than just saying oh I want to hire you know the best person I can find.
Interviewer,Or whatever if you hold yourself to that standard then you'll then I think you'll build a pretty strong company there are.
Paul,Other things around management that you just kind of have to throw yourself into in different ways as well I used to be.
Interviewer,Really terrified of public speaking up to the point where when I did All Hands which at the time we're like 10 or 15.
Paul,People had to sit down because i was so afraid and at the time a lot of people which is ironic because I'm still.
Interviewer,Sipping but um but not not because i'm afraid just because it's more comfortable and so what I did was I.
Paul,Basically i threw myself into some of this stuff and you know a bunch of schools invited me to come speak and.
Interviewer,What i did was i accepted some of those invitations even though I had no real goal of doing that except for.
Paul,Desensitizing myself and i went up to give a speech without having prepared anything and if you do that a few times.
Interviewer,You stop being afraid really quickly and because I mean what's the worst thing that can happen you know I think a.
Paul,Survey says that more americans are afraid of public speaking than deaf and it's so you know just throw yourself in.
Interviewer,You get over this stuff i remember the first talk you haver gave it gave it startup school and I think it was one of.
Paul,These the way you describe that you went with no preparation right and you know actually I can tell you know what but.
Interviewer,Thank you what's the worst thing that can happen you can say something off the cuff that gets like taken by the press.
Paul,Like a football and thrown around and gets you that's fine I actually I actually did prepare for that one I.
Interviewer,Don't have that excuse but the fact that um it was really this did all that this practice did was desensitize me it.
Paul,Didn't actually make me good at public speaking as this is this is proof of do you like managing people um you know if.
Interviewer,You work with people that you like then it's wonderful right now because I'd one definition that I have for a good team.
Paul,Is a group of people that makes better decisions as a whole than would individually make is a sum of the parts.
Interviewer,And when you're i think most smart people like learning right and I mean that's like one of the thrills of.
Paul,Starting a company right is you're just that the learning curve can be so steep and if you can set up a team dynamic.
Interviewer,Where you're constantly learning from the people around you then I mean what's better right these are the people I wake.
Paul,Up every morning and i want to i want to go learn from and was from is that one of your heuristics for hiring people to.
Interviewer,To like hire people that you learn from yeah uh and when building a team you wanted to you want to think about the.
Paul,Dynamic so that way you can maintain this property that the team makes better decisions as a group than any individual.
Interviewer,Would hmm how when you first started like back in that house in Palo Alto you were a start-up founder right so how I.
Paul,Didn't know yet well what was your mental model of a start-up founder how where did it come.
Interviewer,From did it was it Bill Gates you know or Steve Jobs did it come from reading.
Paul,Books or peter teal or sean john parker I mean where did it come from one of the things that was kind of interesting was.
Interviewer,There's this culture in silicon valley that kind of makes startups seem glamorous and I never really believed.
Paul,That right i never had a goal of starting a start-up and my goal when I realized that I had a company was to get.
Interviewer,It to be a good company as quickly as possible where I didn't kind of get out of what you'd call they're like risky.
Paul,Startup phase where you are just like constantly about to die and where you could get to a point where you can.
Interviewer,Actually do some interesting things and make make a lot more interesting bets and um so I don't know I I never read a.
Paul,Lot of the literature on this and i mean maybe if I had then I wouldn't made so many mistakes but I don't know if like.
Interviewer,If learning for me is the right way to go on this but I mean but it did your model must have come from somewhere.
Paul,Though even if it was even if you it was unintentional right like were you influenced by Peter Thiel.
Interviewer,Where sean well yes i wasn't even all these people once I met them I actually I hadn't really heard of Peter Thiel.
Paul,Before i'm talking about like me yeah right yeah but he was massive.
Interviewer,Influential on my thinking right i mean I like a lot of the the early lessons that I took on how to think about.
Paul,Strategy came from peter and shawn and i did pay a lot of attention when I was growing up to Microsoft I thought I mean.
Interviewer,I grew up you know using you know Windows 3.1 and then Windows 95 and I just thought that those were like the.
Paul,Most unbelievable things and sense they are yeah they really were awesome right um well I don't know if youyou meant.
Interviewer,That positive positively but i did and and I thought you know building this ecosystem was really neat and that kind.
Paul,Of inspired me right in the way that they built a platform I kind of thought okay well maybe one day you know that.
Interviewer,The tools that i'm building can be part of a broader ecosystem as well and I think that we've kind of gotten lost.
Paul,From the valley ha by the time that i got around to setting up Facebook as a company I mean Google and Apple to that.
Interviewer,Point i hadn't really created platforms they went then went on to create much better platforms than anything that was.
Paul,Created on a desktop with their mobile operating systems but that was pretty influential for so was that idea of one.
Interviewer,Day making facebook into a platform sort of implicit all along was it always something you were mulling over or was.
Paul,It something that occurred to you after you had all these people you know talking to one another.
Interviewer,Well turning facebook into a platform was after that but the idea that there should be some social platform was.
Paul,Pretty early on right so between you know coursematch and the room of Augustus thing and face smash and like.
Interviewer,All these things when i was at harvard it kind of became clear to me that a lot of the software that we use should have.
Paul,People at the center of it right and people want to learn about people that's like a really core thing in our.
Interviewer,Psychology so i thought that you know whether there was a central central social network kind of at the core of.
Paul,That or just like some kind of social libraries or API or something that there needed to be something that made it so.
Interviewer,That was like a common framework that that everyone could use to develop you mentioned earlier that Peter teal and.
Paul,Sean parker both influenced your ideas about strategy can you remember a particular strategic insight that you.
Interviewer,Had early on and it's probably you know the statute of limitations is for competition is probably passed now.
Paul,There's probably stuff you can say about some insight that you had early on and you thought to yourself.
Interviewer,Ha ha ha nobody else knows this except us but we have this we have this great this great trick do you remember any of.
Paul,Them well Peter teal was really focused on network effects and he had this model.
Interviewer,That i think is right for making decisions that as the complexity of the company grows every.
Paul,Day you're going to be faced with a hundred things that you could potentially go do and your job is to.
Interviewer,Pick the one thing that actually matters because out of those hundred things it's really only actually going to be one or.
Paul,Two things that actually matter and that was pretty informative to me at the time because I had intuitively like I had a.
Interviewer,Lot of self direction intuitively but as soon as I started getting all these people around me who all had reasonable.
Paul,Perspectives on things was very hard for me to balance that and Peter was always very useful for that we wouldn't focus.
Interviewer,He was good at seeing here's the one thing that matters like I'll go kiss on the one thing that matters well.
Paul,Partially that and partially just the meta lesson of figure out the one thing that matters and do that but he also.
Interviewer,What the one thing that mattered like if someone who actors weren't as quickly as possible because I mean network effects.
Paul,Were massively important part of us one of the the story windows in connecting everyone as quickly as possible you.
Interviewer,Don't mean specifically getting more signups you mean getting people to friend one.
Paul,Another faster yeah well why would you do that um well we built a lot of tools to.
Interviewer,Enable people to do what they already wanted to where you can't like push uphill on this stuff right it's it's um.
Paul,We were solving a problem that people had and we just needed to remove as much friction as possible but there was a.
Interviewer,Pretty early you know funny sequence where there was actually this company in 2005 that got started that was called.
Paul,College facebook it was like an exact clone of us and it even had the same name right and um and their strategy.
Interviewer,Because we started at harvard and then tried to branch out to schools that we thought would have dense social.
Paul,Connections with harvard so we can build this network their goal was they wanted to start in places that we weren't right.
Interviewer,So they started on the west coast and in the South when we started on the Northeast and they tried to build up.
Paul,This network of different schools and just as race for a while and I'm eventually their older Seattle.
Interviewer,Yeah and it's ivan and we just took this stuff really seriously and I remember Dustin just took it so personally right.
Paul,It's like any time they launch at some school that we weren't at we had this concept that we actually still have it.
Interviewer,The company today called lock down which is whenever any other company gets ahead of us on something that we think is.
Paul,Strategic to us back then lock down meant we literally did not leave the house until we had addressed the problem.
Interviewer,Now it's a little looser and interpretation inside the company we don't literally lock everyone inside the.
Paul,Office but about as close to that as we can legally get so and you know now the funny thing is inside Facebook you know.
Interviewer,Because we have a lot of different initiatives teams kind of do this themselves right in and just decided to.
Paul,Alright there's like some competitor that has something that we feel like we really need like we're going into.
Interviewer,Lockdown to get this thing because we're not gonna you know let college Facebook get ahead of us so in retrospect could.
Paul,You have completely ignored college Facebook and it wouldn't have made any difference I don't know it's a good.
Interviewer,Question um don't you think like you would have just eventually spread to those schools and.
Paul,Killed them i mean in theory i think they didn't do a perfect job copying us you know one of the things that's.
Interviewer,Interesting is that there are some countries where folks have made such good clones of Facebook that it has been.
Paul,Very hard for us to grow and russia is the biggest example right so V Kentucky's guys are just like the.
Interviewer,International olympiad computing i'm computing Olympiad champions and it's the small team and they like just did.
Paul,Like an awesome job cloning facebook and there are fewer content laws so they also have like illegal file downloads.
Interviewer,And all the stuff and like we just have not been able to beat them and and it's um maybe it's because of the illegal.
Paul,File downloads and it's work so you should add file down well it's we try not to break the law but it's um the.
Interviewer,We're growing fine right it's like linear growth and we're we're I think slowly making a lot of progress and I'm.
Paul,Pretty sure we'll pass them eventually but it's been literally like almost ten years so right since we got started with.
Interviewer,Facebook and we still have not beaten them in Russia so it is possible that if the college Facebook.
Paul,Folks had done better and had gone faster then maybe maybe maybe no no but like they went the speed they.
Interviewer,Did that wasn't affected by your lockdowns I'm just wondering like maybe those lock downs were unnecessary.
Paul,Because we always advise people basically just ignore competitors right I do think that it's definitely possible.
Interviewer,To over rotate on competitors but one one caveat that I would say I think people tend to worry too much about.
Paul,Strategic competitors who are doing something that's related but clones I think actually end up being a pretty big.
Interviewer,Nuisance right so they're like they're these whole companies now in Europe that like all they do is just clone companies.
Paul,That have been founded in the us and other places and try to bring them to Europe and have Network effects and it's.
Interviewer,Like a pain in the ass right and i got it so so I actually think you do want to.
Paul,Internationalize and pay attention to that stuff fairly early because those things are really annoying once they get.
Interviewer,Lodged in okay i think we have one minute left so I'm going to ask you one more question um it seems like the most.
Paul,Successful founders are sort of obsessed like they're a little bit they care a little bit too much about certain things.
Interviewer,Right like steve jobs cared a little bit too much about how perfect the edges of some polygons were right um what is it.
Paul,That you care too much about connecting everyone no seriously if you think about I mean it's like this aesthetic sense of.
Interviewer,The world that i have is that you can communities if people can channel their energy to do great things and having.
Paul,Connections between people is the infrastructure for the world to do that and you know and that's why it each step.
Interviewer,Along the way when there was always all this uncertainty about you know whether it would be profitable or whether it.
Paul,Would make sense or be good or whatever to do these thing this we always were doing it because we just cared more and.
Interviewer,I mean to this day i mean you could you could say that that was a startup thing but it isn't because I mean now we're.
Paul,We're here and we connect more than a billion people but I mean I we're pouring tons of money and resources into.
Interviewer,Connecting people who can't even afford internet access right so I mean that's like there's no way that that's going to.
Paul,Be profitable in the near-term medium term but we're doing it because we think it's the right thing to do and.
Interviewer,Over the long term i do think that there's something there and it's going to be fundamentally important for the.
Paul,World and maybe we'll get rewarded maybe not but we just really care so it's a movement in facebook the company is sort.
Interviewer,Of a subset of it hmm well all right you guys I think we're done are we done we done all right thank you very much.
Paul,Right mark zuckerberg  .
Interviewer,You are the owner of speed-development.co.uk. Could you tell us about your company and your clientelle. It would also be good to hear about your background and what led you to create Speed Development.
Paul,"I've been racing in athletics since the age of 9. I started out racing cross country and 800-5k on the track. When i went to university in 2005 i gained a wider perspective of a wide range of team and individual sports and it was very easy to distinguish the top guys & girls from the ""chasers"". Speed, strength and skill appeared to be the difference so i began researching top coaches, trainers and athletes in sport. To name a few latif Thomas, mike boyle, bret Contreras and pat beith have been very influential and i agree with most of what they preach. After graduating from the University of Bedfordshire in 2009 in Applied sport science, I wrote myself a program designed to improve speed in all sprint events from 100-400m. I improved by 0.89 seconds in the 100 from 12.49 down to 11.60. At this point i realised how much i could help many other athletes improve their game. I believe every sprinter will improve by using my training methods. Including Usain! For now tho, i coach a small number of male & female athletes from ages of 10-44 in the east of England. Ben Snaith & Eugene Mandaza have both made the English schools final and Luke Oswick is now playing international football competitions. www.speed-development.co.uk is primarily a resource for the athletes i coach as i will post workouts & sprint videos for them to use as i provide an online coaching service for those who don't live locally."
Interviewer,Okay lets get into the training questions now. I'd like to start with strength training. Could you talk us through your exercise selection process when designing strength training programmes? How do you decide which exercises are the most approopriate for your athletes?
Paul,"This is a fantatastic question, as so many coaches and fitness experts get this wrong. First of all, let me start by saying the 2 biggest ways to improve most sports are strength and efficiency (skill, technique e.t.c.) I select an athletes' strength program based on the sport they play. There are 4 movements we need to train in the weight room. These are 1) axial loaded exercises (bottom to top) e.g squat, deadlift and lunge variations as well as sled pulls, box jumps, and depth jumps, which recruit the quadriceps. These may help you jump high in basketball, volleyball, football and about 40% of sprinting acceleration. 2) mediolateral loaded (side to side) e.g side raise, standing/lying/seated resistance band abduction which predominantly recruit the upper glutes, and inner thigh muscles. These help agility and cutting speed. 3) torsional loaded (rotational) e.g external band rotation and bicycles which help with rotational sports such as discus, hammer, javelin and field/court sports. 4) anteroposterior loaded (back to front) e.g hip thrusts aka glute bridge, quadruped hip extension, reverse hypers, back extensions, glute ham raise. This list is long because they are the most important to sprinting fowards. These exercises have been scientifically proven to recruit the largest percentage of muscle fibres when performed with appropriate weight. For example, many pilates and yoga classes incorporate anteroposterior exercises but using just bodyweight, so coaches working with ""powerhouse"" athletes like dwain chambers feel the need to put loads of weight on the bar which is great because it trains the CNS very well but doesn't recruit the glutes and hamstrings as well as many exercises used in pilates and yoga classes with middle aged women, respectfully. In fact the ACE study proved that a bodyweight quadruped hip extension recruited more gluteous maximus muscle than a 1RM conventional squat."
Interviewer,"In terms of periodisation of the strength training programme coaches often fall into two broad camps. In the first camp the coaches will stick with the same key exercises throughout the programme. These coaches prefer to achieve variation through the adjustment parameters such as loads, sets, repetitions, tempo and recovery periods. In the second camp the coaches prefer to achieve variation by alternating exercises."
Paul,"Yes, i use both to some degree. Throughout the year we apply the progressive overload method which works extremely well with beginners and intermediate level athletes. Or put another way, athletes with a training age of less than 1 year. I have athletes of very different ages, training ages, strength levels, skill levels and spring levels. There is a strength-spring continuum whereby a ridiculously strong guy may be out sprinted by someone with pretty good strength and spring (plyometric) levels. Depending on where one is on the spring continuum will dictate how much emphasis is placed on strength, plyometrics, conditioning/endurance, hip mobility, agility/coordination, flexibility and speed. Novice athletes will generally improve with any of the above methods being trained but as the years pass and they begin to peak in their performance capacities, we must work on their weaknesses and maintain their strengths. For example, Some may think that Dwain Chambers has ""peaked"" in his speed and acceleration and therefore must place more emphasis on training speed endurance qualities whilst maintaining others. Either way, remember to take something out of a program if you are putting something else into it, otherwise you'll eventually keep adding more speed or strength or other components of fitness and it'll turn into a bad case of over training. This happens way too often in track, field, court and gym sports. They try to take the philosophy of one successful coach and add it to a program they got off the internet and then try to add their own recipe. As mike boyle once wrote, a cook tries to do the job a an experienced, knowledgeable chef and ends up with shit soup! What he should have done was stuck exactly to the original recipe, from the ingredients (exercises) to the time in the oven (reps, sets, distance run e.t.c)."
Interviewer,A current hot topic in sprint training relates to vertical Vs horizontal force production. Traditionally it had been assumed that maximum speed sprinting performance was dependant on the ability to produce high levels of force horizontally. Research from Weyand et al. then indicated that vertical force production was the limiting factor to maximum speed sprinting performance. Recently more research has been conducted by Brughelli et al. suggesting that increasing maximal sprint velocity may be more dependant on horizontal force production as opposed to vertical force production.
Paul,"As the race begins, the movement vector is changing all the time. During acceleration (from starting blocks) the movement is half axial loaded (vertical) and half anteroposterior loaded (horizontal). The sprinter should aim to come out at a 45 degree angle from the head to toe when joints are fully extended. When the sprinter is at top speed they'll be upright and so the movement is predominantly anteroposteror (horizontal). This is supported by studies which have observed elite sprinters displaying a 5-10cm vertical movement at top speed on each stride cycle compared to a 2.45-2.75m horizontal movement on each stride."
Interviewer,"The time taken from toe off as the foot leaves the ground behind you, to the time the foot moves foward and up underneath the hips. The speed and efficiency of the swing phase. As the knee drives up, the foot must be dorsi-flexed (toes lifted) in order to keep the leverages small to save time and energy of the swing phase. If you don't believe me, try lifting your foot up and out in front of you keeping your knee lock straight as you bring it up and down for 100 repetitions. Then, on the other leg try the same but with a bent knee. Both speed and efficiency are compromised. The rate of deceleration of the knee drive as the swing phase comes to an end before driving the foot back down to the ground. It is also important to get a high knee lift as your flexibility will allow whilst moving at high speed. Most top sprinters will bring their knee up at least 90 degrees at the hip joint which allows them to produce more force to the ground and hence cover more ground per stride. The time taken to extend the knee joint and bring the foot BACK and DOWN to the ground. Foot strike should be directly beneath the hip to avoid breaking forces. Slow runners and distance runners will land too far out in front as if overreaching which increases ground contact times, strain on hamstrings and posture break downs. Successful sprinting is about putting yourself in the best anatomical position to create the most amount of force to take advantage of all the strength training. Weak core and upper body strength are usually the source of posture breakdowns. The time taken to pull the centre of mass from behind to a neutral position. Like I said previously, the further out the foot strike takes place, the longer it'll take to be in the most powerful sprinting position to propel your body mass foward. It is also important that the knee be a straight as possible upon ground contact to maximise leg stiffness and translate that into a positive ground reaction force. Number six is hip hyper-extension."
Paul,The short to long approach is the best way to improve an athletes speed. I would blend the two methods if an athletes' speed has started to plateau or the athlete was training for the 400m and beyond.
Interviewer,What are some of the key technique drills that you use with your sprinters?
Paul,"In the warm up we do the A-skip, C-skip, A-run, Fast leg and alternating fast leg to teach correct foot placement, posture and path of the foot. I don't use the B-skip because I think it teaches sprinters to over stride. We use sled pulls and hills to get the athlete used to what negative shin angles should feel like. If a sprinter allows their knee angle to open up too much during the swing phase, they will over stride and/or produce too much vertical force, which slows down rate of acceleration and limits top end speed."
Interviewer,What are some of the biggest mistakes you see athletes and coaches making in their training?
Paul,"I know guys who go down to the track without a plan. They decide what to do once they're warmed up and sessions are done at random with no direction or specific goal. Get a plan. Write up a program for every day, week and month of the year. Maybe even a 4 year plan. If you're running the same workouts week in week out, you will not improve. If you're running a speed session and you're having less than 1 minute rest per 10m run, you're not running at 100% speed. If you're not video recording or giving technical feedback, how will the athlete know what he's doing wrong?"
Interviewer,Thank you very much for the interview Paul! Where can the readers find out more about you?
Paul,Cheers Tim. My website is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn more about speed training and staying in touch with the latest news in track & field.
Interviewer,"If I have a startup, but can't code... what should I be doing?"
Paul,"You have to do sales. There's two things startups need to do early on:you need to build stuff, and talk to users. So if you can't build stuff, you have to talk to users."
Interviewer,Can a non-technical founder hire developers?
Paul,"It depends. There are now startups working on things that aren't very technical at all. For example:retail businesses where the technology used is fairly generic. So yes, to some extent you can be a non-technical founder and somehow get programmers to do that stuff for you. But it's very hard to hire programmers if you're not a programmer yourself, because you can't judge them."
Interviewer,So... how can you tell if a developer is good?
Paul,"There's not really any good solution. Of all the startups with solo non-technical founders that Y Combinator has funded... it's possible that none of them are doing very well. It's hard, very hard."
Interviewer,At One Month we believe that knowing a few months of programming will help you communicate better with developers. What do you think? Does knowing a few bits of programming make you more proficient at running a digital company?
Paul,I think it would help! I think it would help a lot.
Interviewer,Do you have a language of choice for companies coming into Y Combinator?
Paul,I would be worried if someone was writing their stuff in COBOL! I would ask why. (laughs).
Interviewer,"Would you hire someone who was a really good developer, but didn't finish college?"
Paul,"Oh yeah! 'Would I hire Bill Gates?', yeah. Although Bill Gates might be a little bit difficult to have as an employee. But my god of course."
Interviewer,Would you say being a developer has become more plug and play?
Paul,"Well people wouldn't do it if it wasn't easier. I don't think that this is some sign that programmers have fallen from grace. It's just some natural progression... it's weird for me, but only weird in the way that the future always turns out to be weird."
Interviewer,"We hear many of our students at One Month Rails say ""I can make an MVP with Rails, but I have no intention of becoming a computer scientist."" It's almost like they're putting themselves down for not adhering to this somewhat elitist definition."
Paul,Well what's a computer scientist? Someone who can program and who also took a class in Automata Theory. (he laughs).
Interviewer,"In the essay you mentioned that ""hacking is not as cool as painting"". Do you still feel that way?"
Paul,Hacking is getting a lot cooler now. But I think it is probably better for picking people up at parties if you can say you're a painter.
Interviewer,What is neurodiversity and why is it important to you?
Paul,"Neurodiversity is the concept that brain differences are just that: differences. For example, conditions like ADHD and autism aren't ""abnormal"", they're simply variations of the human brain. For people with learning and thinking differences, the idea of neurodiversity has real benefits. It can help children and parents frame their challenges as differences, rather than as deficits."
Interviewer,What needs to be done to encourage neurodiversity in the workplace?
Paul,"We have to give people the opportunity to realise their full potential, especially if they have different thought processing that may not fit with the 'traditional' way things are done. It's about being inclusive, listening and positively responding. It will lead to far richer business solutions."
Interviewer,What is Britvic doing to encourage neurodiversity and diversity in general?
Paul,I'm proud of the work we do at Britvic to create a positive diverse working environment.
Interviewer,What can we as individuals do to make the workplace more inclusive?
Paul,"We can all do our bit to change and create inclusive workplaces where everyone has equal opportunity. We all need to be open to new ideas and welcome fresh thinking and the unconventional. It is this that will create a workplace that is open to all kinds of diverse, talented people and an environment where all can thrive."
Interviewer,What was it like to interview companies for YC when you started eight years ago compared to today?
Paul,"It was a lot like it is now, except longer. The interviews were shockingly long. Possibly 45 minutes, which in retrospect seems crazy. We'd be interviewing them for 20 minutes and then twiddling our thumbs for the remaining 35 now."
Interviewer,How do you do?
Paul,"We're too accommodating but that's not the error that I worry about. I worry far less about accepting a group that does badly than I do about rejecting one that does well. One that does well, sufficiently well, would pay for hundreds of other start ups that return nothing."
Interviewer,Has there been a famous case when you didn't accept a company that became big?
Paul,All the time. We keep a list. We've definitely had people in our interview tracks that we rejected that we were bummed about. I can't say which groups apply to YC. There definitely have been some from our interview track that we missed.
Interviewer,How did YC get started? When did you know it was working?
Paul,"Initially, it was really just, Oh, I should really do some angel investing. Let's get into angel investing."
Interviewer,What's YC's biggest innovation?
Paul,"The biggest innovation is funding startups synchronously instead of asynchronously, funding them all at once in a batch, instead of one at a time as they come to you."
Interviewer,"No one had ever done this before. It's better for both sides. It's much more scalable for us. They're all doing the same things at the same time. I can get up in front of them and say something once to 50 groups instead of having the same conversation one at a time with 50 groups and forgetting it half the time, right?"
Paul,"But it's also better for them. It has the same advantages as mass production. Mass production, you produce things cheaper but they're also of higher quality, instead of some individual person stitching things together. They have colleagues, other people to encourage them, bounce ideas off of, compete with, exchange information about investors. It's good for them and yet, also, good for us."
Interviewer,What's the biggest reason startups fail?
Paul,"It's a domain where there's constant, constant ups and downs. I never know. All of my conclusions are tentative. I never say, These guys are going to be great. All I ever say is, These guys are doing great so far, because some percentage of the time, it turns out there's some explosion around the corner. Not just founder disputes, there's all kinds of explosions. Startups are very, very uncertain."
Interviewer,What's an example of a startup where you loved the founders more than the idea?
Paul,Airbnb is a classic case of funding startups for the people rather than the idea because we actually didn't like the idea. We loved the founders.
Interviewer,"Now, it's just one of these brands. Like Apple. People don't even think of it as Airbed and Breakfast Anymore. People don't realize the first B goes with the Air. It's Airb and b. Right?"
Paul,"People call it Airbnb as if it were an airline. Definitely, when we interviewed Airbnb, Jessica said, We have to fund these guys."
Interviewer,"That combination of keeping going, but also keeping going in such an imaginative way, is exactly the kind of quality that makes successful startup founders. We thought, These guys are so good. Maybe they'll do some other idea, or maybe this idea will turn out not to be as bad as we think, but whatever. We have to fund these guys. How could you not have the Airbnbs in your batch?"
Paul,"You want enough money for people to keep going for, maybe, a year if there's two founders. If the company does well, they're going to raise far more on top of that, so who cares? It's a great deal for the investors."
Interviewer,Does YC discriminate against female founders?
Paul,"I'm almost certain that we don't discriminate against female founders because I would know from looking at the ones we missed. You could argue that we should do more, that we should encourage women to start startups."
Interviewer,How can you tell whether you are discriminating against women?
Paul,"You can tell what the pool of potential startup founders looks like. There's a bunch of ways you can do it. You can go on Google and search for audience photos of PyCon, for example, which is this big Python conference."
Interviewer,"Ok, yes, women aren't set up to be startup founders at the level we want. What would be lost if Y Combinator was more proactive about it?"
Paul,"No, the problem is these women are not by the time get to 23...Like Mark Zuckerberg starts programming, starts messing about with computers when he's like 10 or whatever. By the time he's starting Facebook he's a hacker, and so he looks at the world through hacker eyes. That's what causes him to start Facebook. We can't make these women look at the world through hacker eyes and start Facebook because they haven't been hacking for the past 10 years."
Interviewer,What makes you an essential part of Y Combinator?
Paul,"I specialize in when people need to tweak or replace their ideas, or when they need to figure out what giant thing their current idea is stage one of. Because very often people will do something initially, just knowing instinctively that it's a promising thing to work on and not know what its full implications might be."
Interviewer,"But it's a good idea to think about what the full implications might be, because it influences which direction you go in. You going that way or more that way?"
Paul,"Because in the beginning that way and that way are almost the same, but after a while they diverge."
Interviewer,Why do Y Combinator startups all seem to search for a way to explain how their business could address a billion dollar problem?
Paul,"What investors are looking for when they invest in a startup is the possibility that it could become a giant. It may be a small possibility, but it has to be non-zero. They're not interested in funding companies that will top out at a certain point. If you were the early Bill Gates explaining your startup to investors, if you just said We're going to keep making programming languages for microcomputers, that would not have seemed promising."
Interviewer,Do you lose credibility if you encourage companies to frame themselves in terms of how they can address a billion dollar market?
Paul,"We don't fund everybody who applies. We only fund the people who we think are sufficiently good. I never tell these people lies. I actually believe every takeover-the-world plan that we cook up with these startups. If they executed sufficiently energetically, almost all of them could actually make them happen. One of the secrets to convincing people is surprisingly simple, you just tell them the truth."
Interviewer,Why do people attack YC?
Paul,"It's weird. Just last night, actually, in bed, Jessica was saying, Why does everybody hate us so much? Why is everyone trying to attack us? I explained that reputation is potential energy."
Interviewer,"Nike has their clothing made in sweatshops, and suddenly it's like Nike uses sweatshops! It's big exciting news. Newspapers report about it because it gets pageviews, and labor advocates are all over it, even though they're not over the smaller companies using sweatshops, right?"
Paul,It's because their reputation is potential energy.
Interviewer,Why?
Paul,"Well, it depends. You could say, if you think we're actually good, then envy. If you think we're not actually good, then it's because they think we don't deserve all the deal flow we get. That's what investors all want. They want deal flow."
Interviewer,"You were recently quoted saying that a ""strong foreign accent"" can hurt an applicant's chances of getting into Y Combinator. What's the backstory to the comment?"
Paul,"That was such a controversy made out of nothing. It depends who applies. That interview was boiled down from a two hour long conversation, which is why it sounds like a bunch of aphorisms stitched together. They took out all the bits in between."
Interviewer,How tough do you really have to be to found a startup?
Paul,Ultimately in a startup you have to pull yourself together. You cannot be a wimp and succeed.
Interviewer,Why do some start-ups succeed and others flop?
Paul,"The way the failures die is they run out of money. So what could cause them to run out of money? They can either not make something people want or they can be bad at selling it. Sometimes, they're just bad at selling. But most of the time, start-ups fail for the same reasons restaurants do: Their food is bad. If a place has really good food, it can be in an obscure location, charge a lot, and have really bad service, and it will still be popular. If it has bad food, boy, it better do something really special to get anybody in there. Which is why we say, Make something people want. That's the fundamental problem. If you die, it's probably because you didn't make something people wanted."
Interviewer,"Given the recent setbacks suffered by Groupon and Zynga, how do you know you're making something people want for a long time and not just for now?"
Paul,"Those are edge cases, in which you have some superaggressive sales force that burns out their prospects. Usually, you're lucky if you grow so fast that you run a risk of alienating users. You're talking about the danger of overeating, while most start-ups die of starvation."
Interviewer,You recently brought on Groupon founder Andrew Mason as a part-time partner. How come?
Paul,"He is great, that's why. He is brilliant and hilariously funny. One thing I know about start-ups is that, internally, they're all train wrecks. You read about some train wrecks in the press and other train wrecks stay out of the press. I would certainly never hold it against Andrew that his particular train wrecks ended up being reported."
Interviewer,Incubators have caught flak for underselling the challenges of entrepreneurship. Are Y Combinator founders prepared for how hard it is to start a company?
Paul,"I've written a lot about what a bitch the start-up world is. So, maybe the other incubators are underselling, but we're not. That being said, everyone is surprised by how difficult it turns out to be, because it's not the kind of difficulty people have experienced before. That's one reason you want to have something like Y Combinator, because not a lot of money or time is at risk. So we're totally OK with funding people who seem promising and earnest, and then, if it turns out to be too hard for them, that's all right. Nobody knows what they're capable of until they try it. Maybe half a percent of people have the brains and sheer determination to do this kind of thing. Start-ups are hard but doable, in the way that running a five-minute mile is hard but doable."
Interviewer,Are there any bad habits that many Y Combinator founders share?
Paul,"They don't realize how independent they can be. When you're a child, your parents tell you what you're supposed to do. Then, you're in school, and you're part of this institution that tells you what to do. Then, you go work for some company, and the company tells you what to do. So people come in like baby birds in the nest and open their mouths, as if they're expecting us to drop food in. We have to tell them, We're not your bosses. You're in charge now. Some of them are freaked out by that. Some people are meant to be employees. Other people discover they have wings and start flapping them. There's nothing like being thrown off a cliff to make you discover that you have wings."
Interviewer,There's been a lot of debate over whether Silicon Valley founders are solving real problems. Where do you stand?
Paul,"I think people underestimate how small big ideas were when they first got started. Microsoft's first product was an implementation of the BASIC programming language for a machine called Altair. There were probably a few thousand users, total. If those guys had presented that idea on Demo Day, investors would have laughed at them. But it turns out, everything has some adjacent territory, if you're energetic enough. It's OK to start out with a small idea. People are bad at looking at seeds and guessing what size tree will grow out of them."
Interviewer,How do you know when a small idea has big potential?
Paul,"Mostly, we look at the people. If they seem determined, flexible, and energetic, and their ideas are not just flamingly terrible, then we'll fund them. We thought Airbnb was a bad idea. We funded it because we really liked the founders. They seemed so determined and so imaginative. Focusing on them saved us from our own stupidity."
Interviewer,How has your method of assessing Y Combinator applicants changed since it launched?
Paul,"We learned a bunch of tells as time went on. We videotape all of our interviews, and before each round of interviews, we look at the game tapes from the last round. By then, we know something about how these start-ups turned out, either good or bad. Sometimes, you look at that video and say, We would have been fooled by these guys again. But sometimes, we can see: Aha! They're doing X."
Interviewer,Like what?
Paul,"One quality that's a really bad indication is a CEO with a strong foreign accent. I'm not sure why. It could be that there are a bunch of subtle things entrepreneurs have to communicate and can't if you have a strong accent. Or, it could be that anyone with half a brain would realize you're going to be more successful if you speak idiomatic English, so they must just be clueless if they haven't gotten rid of their strong accent. I just know it's a strong pattern we've seen."
Interviewer,"What do you make of all the $1 billion valuations these days? Are these companies worth it, or is this a sign of a bubble?"
Paul,"Instagram is probably a good deal, because Mark Zuckerberg is no fool. If he bought Instagram for $1 billion, that means he needed to. I suspect what that meant was, Instagram was a real danger to Facebook. That's what valuation is, right? If you're worth $1 billion to Mark Zuckerberg, then you're worth $1 billion."
Interviewer,You seem to be one of the most optimistic guys in Silicon Valley right now. Why is that?
Paul,"What inspires my optimism is I get to work with the best 2 percent of thousands of people. For all I know, the world can be going to hell in a handbasket. But of the 53 start-ups in the current batch at Y Combinator, almost all of them are really good. People talk about young people being lazy. None of the young people around here are lazy. They're all working their asses off. Maybe that's why I'm optimistic. Part of it is that I'm probably naturally optimistic, though. If you were a naturally pessimistic person, you would not be very good at this."
Interviewer,Is there anything Y Combinator start-ups have taught you that you wish you had known when you were running Viaweb?
Paul,"We were the only start-up I knew, so I didn't know what our strengths and weaknesses were, relative to other start-ups. Now I can say exactly what kind of start-up we were. We were the kind of start-up started by nerds who were really good at programing and really, really bad at sales and business. Now I would know exactly what to tell my previous self, which is that I should be spending all my time selling. Our first inclination back then was that the solution to any problem was to program our way out of it. In retrospect, our software was way more sophisticated than it needed to be."
Interviewer,Do you ever miss the excitement of building a start-up yourself?
Paul,"My God! I would never do that again. It's much easier to be an investor than it is to start a company. I mean, I sort of have started a company, because Y Combinator has become so big, but at least we're not serving data to paying customers or dealing with issues that blow up in the middle of the night. Even though it's more of a company now than I meant to start, it's not as bad as running a start-up."
Interviewer,What do you see in Y Combinator's future?
Paul,"There is a secular trend going on, in which launching a start-up is a more common thing to do. It used to be there were two things you could do after college: go to grad school or get a job. Soon, I think there will be three things: go to grad school, get a job, or start your own company. I suspect this will be one of these economic transformations on the scale of the industrial revolution."

Interviewer,God to make sure we have to get that announcement done by the by before the launch conference thank you kidding.
Paul,Exactly what exactly is the announcement and and how does it change why comment oh my god.
Interviewer,And your role yeah here's a picture you can throw up you know who you know who that is that Sam Altman Alexis Steve.
Paul,Huffman and justin and emmett from twitch Wow and everybody in that picture now works for Y Combinator in some way.
Interviewer,Except steve huffman that's amazing what yours that that's the first batch that is the first summer that is.
Paul,Probably a demo of reddit judging by where the way people are standing that is probably a demo of an early version.
Interviewer,Of reddit and i see you kept the same shirt and you know it might it might well be actually is that nine years ago.
Paul,That's that's the summer of 2005 yeah in Boston yeah in Cambridge and Sam almond all they on the left with the blue shirt.
Interviewer,Who did you pooped yeah which was the first really mobile location-aware product yeah kinda sad people didn't.
Paul,Want to broadcast their locations people want to consume location but they don't want to supply it interesting and now.
Interviewer,You've made him the president of y Combinator yeah he is gonna be the boss I'm not running the show anymore it's.
Paul,Sam's show now and why is that we just tired after nine years and 600 startups yeah he do have I think you said in your.
Interviewer,Piece that you thought he would do a better job why well what you're thinking Y Combinator is gonna have to grow right.
Paul,We grow as the number of startups grows when the number of startups has been growing um.
Interviewer,And y combinator it's like this it started out you saw what it was like it was just that what that was in my.
Paul,Kitchen that picture and now we've got like ten full time partners maybe 20 people total and I mean no exactly six.
Interviewer,Hundred and thirty two startups we funded it's turned into this and I'm no good at running giant things.
Paul,Sam however is gonna be good at running a giant thing and are you going to be involved every day or a couple of days.
Interviewer,Or to be determine because that was something that I think a lot of people weren't clear about you said you're.
Paul,Gonna do office hours i'm gonna do office hours with the startups but I don't do office hours every day right so.
Interviewer,Probably i'll end up doing office hours a couple days a week that will probably be enough to talk to everybody in each.
Paul,Batch and other than that i'm not doing anything I'm not reading applications I'm not doing interviews I'm not.
Interviewer,Worrying about all the hideous internal crap that takes up the time of most organizations it yeah the founders in.
Paul,Each batch they see me at office hours and as far as they're concerned that's what I do that's about a tenth of what I.
Interviewer,Do i spend all the rest of my time dealing with random crap associated with any anything of any size so now I won't.
Paul,So it'll look the same to the founders right but it will feel very different to me yeah so when you started it and you.
Interviewer,Were in your apartment i mean what was the origin I mean why did you start Y Combinator for those folks who don't.
Paul,Know the origin story in the well i wrote something about this so if you go to Google and search for how YC started.
Interviewer,Yeah i actually wrote down the story of how it started but really I mean what I say in that is the reason it started was.
Paul,A combination of me feeling guilty but i hadn't gotten around to doing any angel investing yet and also that Jessica was.
Interviewer,Talking to this vc fund about becoming their VP of Marketing and the VCS were taking so long to make up their minds I.
Paul,Said fuck'em we'll just start our own thing right so if that VC fund in Boston had not been so typically slow-moving Y.
Interviewer,Combinator would never have existed and how did you get those first six companies or whatever it was in the.
Paul,First eight eight companies how did you convince them to come on this journey with was a pretty easy.
Interviewer,Thing right because when y combinator first started this is something a lot of you.
Paul,Don't realize when y combinator first started it was a summer program for undergraduates that was that was the.
Interviewer,Idea and so compared to a summer job where you'd have to like go work in a cubicle and like maybe get up earlier.
Paul,Than you would like to you and work on not what you would want with people you don't want to worked with right compared.
Interviewer,To a regular summer job it was a great deal you just go to Cambridge work on whatever you want with whoever you want.
Paul,And we like you know pay you money and give you give you dinner once a week um so we got lots of applications you got.
Interviewer,More than we expected hundreds of applications but in that first batch were Sam Walton who started looped.
Paul,Reddit was in that first batch kiko which was started by the founders he went on to start justin.tv a a k-8 which.
Interviewer,All in that first batch aaron swartz was in that first batch to you yeah what was Aaron's project what was it called.
Paul,Infogami it was called infogami and it was kind of tumblr I remember yeah and it merged with reddit what was that you.
Interviewer,Were one company what was what was aaron like um precocious he had sort of made at that point I think he was 18 and he.
Paul,Had sort of made a career of being precautious up till that point right he sort of had decided he had realized like.
Interviewer,Most kids don't realize this but he had realized like when he was probably about 13 or so he was sort of very.
Paul,Obstreperous he never wanted to do what he was supposed to um and he would realized that like he could just sort of.
Interviewer,Start acting like an adult and maybe no one would stop him he yeah and so he like didn't go to high school and he.
Paul,Made money by writing code he just started acting like a grown-up right yeah like and he'd realized that.
Interviewer,Essentially kids don't realize this but they're all kept in place by a bunch of dotted lines that aren't real.
Paul,And they could just like start acting like a grown-up and no one is gonna come away with submachine guns and black ski.
Interviewer,Masks and drag them away right um so he was one of the few people who realized he could cross the dotted line and when.
Paul,You look at his untimely death and sort of what happened with him how do you reconcile it I mean what how.
Interviewer,Do you feel about it that's a personal question but Aaron Aaron and the federal government were not very evenly matched.
Paul,Right like those guys are a bunch of humorless an Aaron was sort of an innocent.
Interviewer,Um i don't know innocent it's not quite the right word to use for him because he was a pretty scheming innocent but.
Paul,Anyone who's had small children could understand that scheming and innocent can be combined yeah and that's what he.
Interviewer,Was like in some ways he was it's weird in some ways he did approaches in some ways he was like right right in some.
Paul,Ways he was like an adult when he was 13 and in some ways he was still a child when he was 25 right um but I think I.
Interviewer,Think like the federal government just like the federal government they assume that everyone is al Qaeda right you know.
Paul,And so they just like hit you with everything they got which turns out to be a lot and then he discovered he had.
Interviewer,Sort of bitten off more than he could chew yes Scott Walker is a great attorney who.
Paul,Is also a tireless supporter of startups I've known Scott for a long time he's partnered with me to bring you this.
Interviewer,Program for years now and he runs a boutique law firm that specializes only in startups all of his attorneys come.
Paul,From those bigger firms but they prefer to be at a boutique firm when they don't have to ratchet up the hours and try to.
Interviewer,Destroy startle through these crazy legal bills no he does something different he gives flat fees for all the.
Paul,Different things you have to do it your startup whether its incorporation employment agreements or you're selling.
Interviewer,Your company he's a true man he truly focuses on the founders and he makes himself available in the same way I try.
Paul,To make myself available or paul graham makes himself available to founders he's a really great guy go ahead and give him.
Interviewer,A call for one five nine seven nine nine nine nine eight that's right call Scott ed Walker at four one five nine seven.
Paul,Nine nine nine nine eight or visit Walker corporate law comm and he's very easy to get in touch with Scott at.
Interviewer,Walker corporate law and you just put Jason in the subject line and I guarantee you he will respond quick.
Paul,And he will be an incredible advocate of your startup I've gotten so many great great responses back from people I've.
Interviewer,Referred to scott over the years so he's just a tremendous tremendous supporter of startups go ahead and thank Scott ed.
Paul,Walker on twitter and follow him really great guy really great team over there I can't give them any bigger endorsement.
Interviewer,They've been a great partner of the program they do a great job for startups everybody I sent over there is pleased.
Paul,What more do you need to know let's get back thanks Scott and let's get back to this incredible fireside chat with Paul.
Interviewer,Graham so you brought y combinator the next sort of seminal moment I guess was bringing Y Combinator to the valley.
Paul,Leaving boston yeah how did you come to that decision Addis / of the moment you know what happened I went to foo camp I.
Interviewer,Went to foo camp after over the first y Combinator batch and I thought wow it's so much better here uhm the start the.
Paul,Streets are paved with the corpses of startups you know the weather so nice what I thought was actually someone is.
Interviewer,Gonna start the y combinator of silicon Valley and it better be s so we thought we had better go out here and plant the.
Paul,Flag and also like boston in the winter is not as nice as Silicon Valley it's not like this in Boston so we decided.
Interviewer,And jessica was freaking right because like we had just figured out how to make this thing work and I said you know what.
Paul,Let's move across the country and do the next batch in Silicon Valley right and she's like what and the reason we ended.
Interviewer,Up in mountain view was because our friend Trevor had a building there and the only way we could get a building on.
Paul,Such a short with like such short notice is to take over part of his but even so that first dinner we had to tell all the.
Interviewer,Founders not to touch the walls because the paint was still wet the first dinner and when people applied we said on the.
Paul,Application form we don't know where it's gonna be you're applying for this thing and you don't know whether it's.
Interviewer,Going to be in cambridge or silicon Valley so let us know if either of those problem for you prior to my Combinator.
Paul,The only incubators that really existed I know it's you don't consider an incubator really but it was a class of.
Interviewer,Incubators in the first ball thank you Bader's yeah they the model or were you the this the anti model of no no no they.
Paul,Were definitely not the model they were like the model of what not to do right so the early version that most people.
Interviewer,Here probably never even knew what the incubators and the bubble were like but they were their idea was they would do.
Paul,All your funding ever right y combinator is just supposed to be first gear and then you go off and raise money on at.
Interviewer,The market at market rates from whoever these things in the 90s the idea was it would it was almost like you were a.
Paul,Subsidiary of the incubator they would like you would operate out of their building and they wouldn't have your you.
Interviewer,Wouldn't have to have an accountant because their accountant would manage your money right and they would like.
Paul,Give you a lot of money and take like 30 40 percent of the company yeah you know 80 90 percent or that yeah they were.
Interviewer,Gonna really control you and and that model seemed to me and yes like work out of their building right very much like.
Paul,An employee um that model seemed to me because I had the advantage of having been a founder and so I could ask myself.
Interviewer,Would i have done that no right it's like an adverse selection filter right you do things like that how.
Paul,Do we not get the best ah yeah yeah i was always in the beginning now the funny thing is the word incubator has.
Interviewer,Changed nobody even remembers those stupid things in the news now it means Y Combinator so now on our FAC it says are.
Paul,You an incubator and i'm like no no we're not an incubator except now as people who use the word we are yeah.
Interviewer,Meaning if the word has changed i'm the only one who remembers the old stupid yeah so we should probably give in and.
Paul,Agree to be called an incubator so how did you define what the program was in the early days was it strictly the.
Interviewer,Constraint of the summer session yes yes the reason nobody even a lot of people probably don't realize this a lot of.
Paul,People who even start these things probably don't realize this but the reason it's three months is because that.
Interviewer,Was summer vacation right and it turned out there were a lot of things we got right three months turned out to be just.
Paul,About right and so we kept the three months and having dinner once a week which was not.
Interviewer,Modeled on the society of fellows at Harvard it's a group of people who were all grad students and sort of went off.
Paul,And did their research and then once a week but you get together for dinner that turned out to be good to you.
Interviewer,Getting speakers to come having demo day at the end that was something I think we only decided to have demo day about.
Paul,Halfway through we're getting to the enemy thought maybe we should put on some sort of event where these guys.
Interviewer,Present to investors so we and demo day is now a misnomer nobody does demo as a demo day right um.
Paul,The presentations are two and a half minutes but you know the name was already established by that point did.
Interviewer,You all a bunch of accidents all a bunch of accidents that turned out to be good is there a moment at which you thought.
Paul,This is going to scale to what it has become today which is in just nine or eight years is kind of like an.
Interviewer,Institution nine short years jesus they don't feel well I mean yeah that's why you gave the president's lot of yeah I.
Paul,Think i'm supposing it's been very long for you but nine years is not a long time you know to build an institution uh.
Interviewer,Was there a point where i thought i could get this big yes yes cuz I remember Steven Levy I don't know if I.
Paul,Don't know if this was the first batch of the third so I'm not sure but I think about about halfway through the first.
Interviewer,Batch i'm a very optimistic person right and so you show me an Altair basic I see Microsoft right right um.
Paul,So pretty early on during yc because i was ridiculously optimistic I imagined that it would become sort of what it in.
Interviewer,Fact i imagined probably would become even bigger than it has become today but that doesn't mean I was correct she's.
Paul,Wildly optimistic by nature it wasn't like in the five like planned to make it riot it's more like I had.
Interviewer,These crazy imagined futures that turned out to be correct but they shouldn't have been where did you come up with the.
Paul,Deal as it were you know six percent for 15 K or 21 K whatever it is it was based on what a lot of what we did was based.
Interviewer,On the funding we got for our startup via web so we had this guy who was the husband.
Paul,"Of my painting teacher at harvard and he was a lawyer he gave us $10,000 and got us incorporated and like set up as a."
Interviewer,Company and taught us a little bit about business he didn't know much about startup specifically but he sort of knew.
Paul,About business like i knew nothing about business um like nothing and he was on our board and sort of saved us from.
Interviewer,Stepping in a bunch of dog poops along the way a bunch of land mines actually be more accurate um and so I remembered.
Paul,"Thinking later boy what a good deal for Julian he got 10% of this company for $10,000 and then."
Interviewer,I realized wait a minute without him we would never have made it so it was a good deal for us too and when you like I.
Paul,Thought wow that's a good deal for both so 10% seemed a bit much yeah so we didn't ask for 10% I think originally.
Interviewer,Used to ask for 6% and then along along the way it became 7 and the reason we invested the amount of money we did is.
Paul,Cuz i asked robert he was a professor at MIT how much MIT grad students got his.
Interviewer,"Stipends for the summer and it was $2,000 a month so that's what we did $6,000 per founder for the summer."
Paul,Because we knew you could live on that in Cambridge yeah so all of these things that people think you put a people.
Interviewer,Wonder where these sort of devices come from they come from that sort of summer yeah of summer school basically yeah.
Paul,Like a summer job a summer program you you've seen 600 of these startups now some pattern recognition happens yeah.
Interviewer,And about the smallest things it's weird when you have 632 data points the patterns you can see or astonishing yeah.
Paul,So what are some of them that are some of them my god yeah I think about thousands of things yeah but what are.
Interviewer,The ones that matter the ones that matter okay well founders have to get along.
Paul,Okay if the founders hate each other you're in big trouble right how often does that happen once or twice a very.
Interviewer,Often um I mean like do you guys realize that Apple had three founders not two right.
Paul,Yeah there's a lot of companies that have more founders than you realize so there's founder conflicts or like you.
Interviewer,Don't know how good you are how good friends you are with somebody until you try to start a start-up with them so.
Paul,You've got to have a good relationship between the founders that's why it's that's why it works so badly when you.
Interviewer,Have a start-up that's started by some dude in the business school who has this idea for some startup and then he goes.
Paul,And find some like 20 year old meek undergraduate computer science major to realize his vision right and that is the.
Interviewer,Founding team and you know and these guys come in for the interviews and the guy says Arthur you know I was.
Paul,Quarterback with my college team you know this is my co-founder he's like and you know we asked him a question and he.
Interviewer,Looks nervously at the business dude to see if he's allowed to answer right are you gonna whip me afterwards if I say.
Paul,Stuff right that's like that kind of like if you go into a Y Combinator interview and one of you looks in terror.
Interviewer,At the other one before answering the questions that's one of our secret tells right or say if you roll your eyes at us.
Paul,While your co-founder is speaking right actually happened works if you stand up your co-founder like if you don't show.
Interviewer,Up for the interview and you asked and we ask the guy where's your co-founder Eisel I don't know he was supposed to be.
Paul,Here right these are all happens literally yes it all happened yeah um what do you do in an instance.
Interviewer,Where you know you have two people who are brilliant you know to use the Apple you know metaphor I mean woz and Jobs.
Paul,Obviously brilliant in different ways and they just can't get along one has to win in order for the startup to survive.
Interviewer,One has to bow out how do you even broach that conversation you have to have a mechanism for doing anything one.
Paul,Of them has to leave wellwe're because not necessarily because in the best startups what.
Interviewer,Happens is each founder is king of their own domain so in Apple like the wat was was like he was not a super forceful.
Paul,Person but he did not let steve jobs change anything about the Apple one computer like there was one thing he.
Interviewer,Wanted to change i think like fewer expansion slots and woz said no hey that's nothing like Steve knew Steve.
Paul,Jobs knew where the limits were so Steve's like but wise didn't give a damn about the business stuff so Steve Jobs.
Interviewer,Was off selling the thing and was built it and they were each masters of their own domain that's that that's the model.
Paul,That works that's how you have multiple people who are each extremely effective and not step on one another's toes you.
Interviewer,Do as a rule multiple founders is that true or do you you mean we prefer to fund startups with more than one founder.
Paul,Correct oh yes yes have you ever done single founder startups we have the result in.
Interviewer,Them we have funded some single founder startups the most successful well okay so there's a bunch of weird cases like.
Paul,Drew houston of dropbox was a single founder when he had filled out the application form but we told him it.
Interviewer,Would be really good if you got a co-founder and so between getting invited to interviews and the interview.
Paul,Just like two weeks he got a rash right um so that worked out really well and then the most successful startup that is.
Interviewer,Run by a single founder now is pebble smiley yeah it sure but though that was two people when they came to YC and one.
Paul,Of them left ah right so but like single founders who've been single founders all the way through God I mean they always.
Interviewer,Get other people and i never know if their co-founders are just employees there's a lot of equity yeah you know so.
Paul,I don't recommend it though got a co-founder when people walk up to me and say legs start blabbing to me about.
Interviewer,Their idea i'm like no no who's your co-founder that's what I care about Dropbox is the most successful on a.
Paul,Valuation level of any why cause I have this week as of this week ten billion dollars change.
Interviewer,Yeah so that's a super unicorn and you've had a couple of others Airbnb I guess would be considered a unicorn in.
Paul,The new parlance i would say airbnb is value is comparable to drop boxes valuation and value are not the same.
Interviewer,Thing right like if a company hasn't raised money for a year or two and they're growing like 5x a year right.
Paul,They could two years of not raising money at 5x a year their value is off by 25 X X right right um so you got to.
Interviewer,Watch out for going for treating evaluation as value I would say Dropbox and Airbnb or our peers than their.
Paul,Stripe and stripe is also yeah yeah did you know in the case of those three that they were very very very very special.
Interviewer,What did you just think they were special enough to accept they were all there the they were all no brainers at.
Paul,The interview they were all cases where in the interview we didn't even have to think about it right um we decide.
Interviewer,Whether to fund people or not immediately after the interview we have to because we do 20 interviews a day.
Paul,Like we won't even remember the first people in the morning by the end of the day well so we have to decide while our.
Interviewer,Memory is fresh and the good ones that we talked to people for 10 minutes and the good ones were like looking we have.
Paul,You know after all these years we can just look at each other and sort of send signals by our eyes right this person is.
Interviewer,In right right we're looking at each other like these people are in or or sometimes we're looking at each other.
Paul,Like oh my god how long can ten minutes last right right um but if there's if there's.
Interviewer,Borderline cases and then there's cases where definitely yes and definitely no halfway through the interview and.
Paul,Dropbox Airbnb and stripe we're all like we didn't even need the full ten minutes I.
Interviewer,Remember that i mean i didn't predict that they would end up being worth billions of dollars you know why because.
Paul,You cannot predict that that is unpredictable it's not like there was some data there that I didn't see it's.
Interviewer,Actually indeterminate you know and i back when drew Houston applied drew Houston zapped location for Y Combinator.
Paul,Is on line and back when he applied we used to still ask this stupid question that we.
Interviewer,No longer ask which is if someone wanted to buy you right after why see how much would you take right.
Paul,And if drew's answer was a lot less than 10 billion dollars I don't remember what it was it was probably like a million or.
Interviewer,Two or something like that maybe even less it was this turned out to be a stupid question that obviously predicted.
Paul,Nothing as you can see yeah so just as well we took it out but a lot of these companies that end up being worth.
Interviewer,Billion billions of dollars they only do that because the M&A people that potential acquirers are stupid enough to.
Paul,Not pick them off early right hey speed we all need our applications to be fast and reliable I'm busy I'm the CEO of the.
Interviewer,Company i want to know what's going on with the servers because I know through watching Marisa and Larry Page at Google.
Paul,Just absolutely crush it by having the fastest services in the world and the most stable services they build a lot of.
Interviewer,Trust with their audience well new relic is the tool that you need a CEO or CTO to monitor the performance of your.
Paul,Applications and let me tell you a little story we were launching a little startup named inside.com a month ago and.
Interviewer,We had a tremendous technical difficulty something was going wrong on our servers so I emailed like at 9 o'clock at night.
Paul,Hey listen we have a lot of users coming in tens of thousands of people are rushing the front door and our servers.
Interviewer,Are questioned we can't figure out why the database servers going off the charts my boys and girls over there boom.
Paul,They just gave me all the all the licenses they need we put it on all our servers and all of a sudden it was very.
Interviewer,Clear we had some kind of problem with our database and it turned out when people were scrolling up through inside.
Paul,Com it was firing off the voting mechanism which was then flooding flooding our database and pinning the.
Interviewer,Server and making this service unusable for everybody else and it was like God came down from heaven and pointed his.
Paul,Finger at the problem that would have taken us a week to figure out thanks to New Relic it's literally as good as god.
Interviewer,I mean how much more do i have to sell these people it's a powerful application performance.
Paul,Tool nike warby parker airbnb comcast and AT&T used it we use it here and I get this beautiful email every week that.
Interviewer,Shows me how fast there things going so I can have like a top-level perspective on I have to get.
Paul,In the weeds every day and we love it go to New Relic calm such twists go to New Relic calm / twist New Relic calm / twis.
Interviewer,Tea and you'll get a free this week in startups t-shirt it's a great product it's super fast it's super easy no.
Paul,Credit card required you're gonna love it and I want to just take a moment to personally thank at New Relic go ahead.
Interviewer,And thank them on your twitter handle for supporting independent media like this week in startups okay let's get.
Paul,Back to the rest of this amazing interview with mr. Paul Graham of Y Combinator let's talk about this sort of.
Interviewer,Period of supreme growth what was the largest class size you guys ever had in when you hit that 80 the whole industry.
Paul,Was like whoa there was this a year where I think we iced we have 68 in the current batch right not that much.
Interviewer,Different it's not that much the demo day is still gonna be pretty tiring but there was this year where I think the.
Paul,Industry because of the massive success Y Combinator was sort of like this promising thing over here but then.
Interviewer,"Something happened in the same year you hit 80 and then oh the $250,000 like uncapped node or something 200 150 150."
Paul,50 but it hit at the same time did it and everybody got that note it was like the same year or something yeah that.
Interviewer,Year was that the year it got too big it might have been I don't remember I don't remember when when all these things.
Paul,Happened because all these people have internet connections everyone in the audience got the answer and I don't what.
Interviewer,Did you feel absolutely perspective skidded feel like it was getting too big because I thought when I saw it like oh.
Paul,My god 2012 was the batch that we said was too big right huh um and I don't know what the rest of the world was.
Interviewer,Thinking i don't care what they think but it felt big to us because as we later realized we embodied an N squared.
Paul,Algorithm up till the summer 2012 yc did not have any kind of sharding every partner had to know what every startup.
Interviewer,Was doing and when a partner when the startups this was embodied in the office our software when a start-up requested.
Paul,Office hours they did not specify the partner was not monistic when someone posted office.
Interviewer,Hours they was just fifo right now just get whoever was sitting in the queue the longest and we I can't believe we were.
Paul,All computer science people and we made this mistake so obviously and the squared.
Interviewer,Duh duh i mean when we realized when you looked him you thought like why did this batch suck so bad why did we hate our.
Paul,Life right like there there were startups like halfway through the batch I still didn't know what they were doing.
Interviewer,Um and we were asking what went wrong it was so obvious a little bit too much to.
Paul,Do yeah well no no because it was n squared specifically like it would be no problem having that many partners deal.
Interviewer,With that many startups right so long as they were sharted so then we redesigned why I seem to be sharted and it has been.
Paul,Ever since and it works just fine like 68 no problem right yeah each partner has no no it's not each partner we have.
Interviewer,Three silos three silos each one overseen by a group of partners so basically it's like three little Y.
Paul,Combinator's and we know little y Combinator works right sobs problem no what about the everybody gets this note.
Interviewer,Because that was a first in the industry as well yeah did that I remember you writing I think that it cost a little.
Paul,Bit of a problem of fighting over the money and got the money and whatever with the bad startups the bad startups.
Interviewer,It used to be the bad startups they would just like drift away right right didn't work it was like a divorce where.
Paul,"Weren't where there was like a large fortune at stake Hey ah $150,000 is a lot of money let us remember right like."
Interviewer,"$150,000 for most people it's like a house right um in a lot of parts in this country so so like they would fight over."
Paul,"The money like one guy would leave and he would say and I'm - I want my $75,000 is $75,000 it was the company's but then."
Interviewer,He wouldn't leave you know got it oh what a disaster and so the notes still exist but in a smaller form now 80 80 80.
Paul,You know i thought of getting rid of it I thought of getting rid of it entirely um because it was like a big a big pain.
Interviewer,To organize and i thought of getting rid of it and so I pulled the startups and said did this money help you.
Paul,Like 80% of them said yes it had helped them significantly like oh all right we'll keep it yeah so we kept it we made.
Interviewer,It smaller and when you look at the those meetings what else when you're in that decision meeting do you think.
Paul,Actually comes out of it that you know the signaling that is correct and then one of this what's the signaling what.
Interviewer,Name is out of it and the signaling that's correct yeah we wouldn't you're signaling you mean how to work that we.
Paul,Have fun yeah how do you know how to fund and then are there signals that you've gotten wrong consistently that.
Interviewer,You've switched like reverse course on you know saying like you thought this type of person is unfunded well that the.
Paul,Crazy jock from the brit business school but they you know you know what actually there are some cases where that crazy.
Interviewer,Jog actually could do it well it's true we have a bunch of MBAs now there Quincy will our MBAs in yeah well that's what.
Paul,You get if you stay at business school long enough yeah when an MBA comes in on the application I mean you know so many.
Interviewer,The products that we see today or companies are driven by product people when you see MBA does that make.
Paul,Everybody go uh not automatically not automatically cuz rescale for example the founder of the CEO of rescale has an.
Interviewer,Mba but he also has a huge amount of domain expertise in the aircraft industry right he's not just some sort.
Paul,Of finance dude right um so no we don't automatically discriminate against MBAs specifically that like the MBA has an.
Interviewer,Idea and then he goes and finds a hacker that he never knew before he's like eight years younger you know.
Paul,And like lives in a box and his in his house um so let's see are there things either are you asking are there things.
Interviewer,We used to well you used to look at and say you know I used to not want to accept these people but now we accept.
Paul,Them like hackers you know uh you've been since you're a developer yourself very developer centric now.
Interviewer,Businesspeople maybe now you let nonprofits in I mean what what signals have changed for you over the years very.
Paul,I'll tell you the one probably the one thing is people who are very smart but that's.
Interviewer,It right people who are really smart but ineffectual we used to think we used to we used to have more faith in brains.
Paul,Yeah it turns out it turns out like you can be surprisingly stupid if you're sufficiently determined right and.
Interviewer,Actually you can you can anyone can tell this empirically I mean I'm sitting right here Paul they know they know but.
Paul,You're talking about it like there are some parts of America where there's a lot of rich people and they're not very.
Interviewer,Smart right like there are some some parts of Manhattan and Florida and LA right like like you don't have to be.
Paul,Super smart if you're if you're really fearsomely effective at its nature what is the most important thing for start-up.
Interviewer,Just to focus on now you've looked at 600 of them you've seen them fail you've seen you know them there's a meta answer.
Paul,To that i mean the most important thing for startups to do is to focus ah right because there's so many things you could.
Interviewer,Be doing one of them is the most important if you should be doing that and not any of the others right so you.
Paul,Should not be grabbing coffee with investors right when you want to raise money you shift into fundraising mode.
Interviewer,And you go and raise money you do not like promiscuously meet with investors in the middle of the day when you should.
Paul,Be working simply because they like sent you an email saying hey let's grab coffee right um and there's there's like.
Interviewer,A thousand things you could be doing and only one of them is the most important you do the most important thing it's.
Paul,Like optimizing software there is something that is currently the bottleneck to making the software faster.
Interviewer,You work on that right and that's a lot of what we do it why see we like figure out we just like sit down with people.
Paul,And just like look at all the things they could be doing and ask them which one is the most important they know the.
Interviewer,Answer in their head they just don't ask themselves this question and then I'm like okay so why aren't you doing that.
Paul,You're like oh gosh i don't know i guess we could do and being a Y Combinator company now means.
Interviewer,You're gonna drowned an opportunity to a certain extent you mean funding funding attention I.
Paul,Mean it won't automatically get you customers I mean it'll automatically get you customers if you're making something.
Interviewer,For startups sure and so it's that's you know a lot of the companies we fund are yeah and we're getting we're starting to.
Paul,Have this sort of little gdp 8na where companies are building stuff for other companies but we've funded but if it's.
Interviewer,Some consumer thing it's not automatically gonna get you users now all right a couple of controversial.
Paul,Statements that have i think got you in a little bit of hot water and I think actually quite unfairly to be totally.
Interviewer,Honest but you said something about people's accents you know if they can't present properly if people can't.
Paul,Understand them if people can't understand an entrepreneur that is a difficult thing for the entrepreneur to.
Interviewer,Raise money right but you've got kind of barbecued a little bit by that what people thought you were a xenophobe yeah.
Paul,Confirm you've had many people in the program from many different countries from any firm I am an immigrant myself.
Interviewer,Yes so you're not a xena floyd in America so when you get barbecue like that is the best yeah I mean I get the.
Paul,Sense that that was particularly unfair how did you feel when you were sort of getting attacked relentlessly do you.
Interviewer,Think that just comes with the territory of building something as successful as Y Combinator no actually I think what's.
Paul,Going on is there's there's a new phenomenon which is and on Twitter especially actually what I was watching.
Interviewer,Is it was sort of like being bitten by some fascinating it was like being an entomologist and being bitten by some.
Paul,Fascinatingly horrible bug like while the bugs biting you and you're thinking ouch that hurts you're also thinking.
Interviewer,Whoa what an unusual bug that's interesting right um and so I think what's going on is basically the.
Paul,Internet if you heard built fires you know like if you build a bunch of if you put a bunch of logs and a sort of teepee.
Interviewer,Like shape it'll just like burn like crazy and if you just like sit them next to each other won't burn at all right.
Paul,And so the internet is now out of shape where fire spreads really fast right right because the.
Interviewer,Things like twitter and so some meme can get out there and if it's there's sort of you know the idea of linkbait yeah.
Paul,Well there's sort of like indignation bait right right um and so and something can get out.
Interviewer,There and everybody you know like that's this is this must stop right right and they're starring and.
Paul,Retweeting it without ever being the original sources that's what I think is happening that's what I think that was.
Interviewer,That was what it was i think like there was there's this this landmine exists yeah right so be careful what you say.
Paul,And it just happened like i stepped on it right right and then gender is the other one your co-founder is a female.
Interviewer,Yes and other and wife not that's a founder and wife yeah and you've had a decent number of female startups and you.
Paul,Act 24 percent in this batch in this batch you actively work on this issue but they also grabbed a quote from you.
Interviewer,In isolation and said you thought that wasn't just isolation they took a word out of that one yeah and you you guys.
Paul,Are important word well how do you feel about females in technology and sort of promoting diversity and those kind of.
Interviewer,Issues in your own words well um it's half the population right so if if more women started startups that could.
Paul,Produce an awful lot more startups right since we want to scale in fun more startups you know like even if people.
Interviewer,Like honestly i would have to i would have to like want to lose money right against women starting startups so of.
Paul,Course i want more women to start startups I want everybody to start startups and women are half of everybody.
Interviewer,Right and you're accepting many more and you're doing a female founders conference yeah you're actually taking a.
Paul,Lot of steps to try to be extremely open and helpful maybe even by the way the female founders conference was something.
Interviewer,We were already working on before that whole controversy erupted right yeah we can't make too big of a deal of it.
Paul,Because it's march first it's like in a week so where do you see ten years from now.
Interviewer,Y combinator i mean if you went from six people in your kitchen to 650 startups in nine years like.
Paul,Yeah so you guys sit around yeah do you get 632 to be exact you guys sit around and think the next 10 years or do you.
Interviewer,Think let's get through the next class well what you want to do is you want to simultaneously you want to mostly focus.
Paul,On what to do now but you want to know what general direction you're heading in it's you sort of inch forward you know.
Interviewer,You're inching south rather than north right um I'm certainly hoping Y Combinator will grow a lot but really.
Paul,You shouldn't be asking me what's gonna happen in the future you should be asking Sam well yeah he'll be here next.
Interviewer,Year to talk about it i remember i don't know what I don't know what he's planning except in the most general.
Paul,Terms i mean the most general terms it's gonna grow and does that mean multi-city maybe or I'll be eventually yeah.
Interviewer,Something you haven't done and not in the short term yeah maybe eventually and what do you think of the change in the.
Paul,Funding environment i mean we have so many more angel investors right now the market is so bullish on startups you had.
Interviewer,People come in and and give these notes to everybody yeah it's a pretty robust market does it worry you you think it's.
Paul,A great thing what do you think about funding it's a great thing and I'm worried it's gonna stop yeah hey um.
Interviewer,Price is what i tell people is like prices are high right valuations are high that's not the same thing as a.
Paul,Bubble a bubble is a very specific version of prices are high it's prices are high because people feel like they.
Interviewer,Can sell this overpriced thing to a greater fool later right right so you can't really get a bubble without a.
Paul,Bubble in the public markets and it doesn't seem there it's one of those yet so like it's really just like I mean.
Interviewer,Prices go up and down sort of like a sine wave and then like weird uh prices seem high right and so that means.
Paul,They're probably gonna go down somewhat in the future and that's what I tell startups and it has gone down a little.
Interviewer,Bit i think it maybe was two years ago it seemed like I saw a lot of Y Combinator startups in the uncapped 15.
Paul,Million you know kind of you know range and stuff like that gmass patch I feel like the valuations.
Interviewer,Were the highest ever well i don't know for sure what um do you advise him in what were the range what would you.
Paul,Advise them on what they should do valuation wise and yes not for I mean not as a knot in a.
Interviewer,Blanket statement because i depends on the start up some right we're like Oh thirty million will be no problem for.
Paul,You guys another like if anybody wants to give you money you should take it right so there's what is the range now.
Interviewer,Of these you know the range of valuations the people have raised money at well currently you said it was very.
Paul,High in the most recent batch who was in the most recent - I mean it's nineteen batches they all blur together certainly.
Interviewer,Like there's probably somebody in the last batch she was at least 50/50 coming in right after YC yeah I think so I mean.
Paul,They're certainly happy that company that was had been worked on for a year then join YC because you do see that.
Interviewer,Sometimes - somebody comes into yc and they've been working on it for a little while some of them yes some of them no.
Paul,But that's not correlated with that's like how far along people are when they come to YC it is not very well.
Interviewer,Correlated with how they end up doing even immediately after YC like Airbnb Airbnb had been launched for a year.
Paul,Before they came to yc but they would have been launched in like we're sort of flatlined right right um so there's not.
Interviewer,A pattern there there's no pattern there let's talk a little bit about growth as we wrap up here startups want to grow it.
Paul,Seems like one of the things y Combinator really teaches people is how to grow stuff what what do you think the.
Interviewer,Secrets of growing startups are well in terms of techniques you've got to start with you got to start with a small.
Paul,Intense fire so you have to if you're suppose you're the Apple one right you have to find I mean I think they made.
Interviewer,Something like 500 of those things right yeah so all I had to do is like find 500 people to buy these computers and they.
Paul,Launched apple apple yeah so you gotta find a small number of people it's necessarily gonna be a small number of.
Interviewer,People you can't find you could there's it's impossible to make something that a large number of people want a lot so.
Paul,You've got to find people who want what you're making a lot and that's necessarily gonna be a small.
Interviewer,Number and that's okay that's how these giant things get started right you don't have to do any better than Apple and.
Paul,Facebook just goes 500 true fans found that your fan whatever it is I mean if it's a mobile app it might not be a 500.
Interviewer,It might be five thousand right but you've gotta you gotta know who those first users are and how you're gonna get.
Paul,Them and then you just sit down and you just have a party with those first few users and you just focus entirely on.
Interviewer,Them and you make them super super happy right like there's a start-up in the current batch that it's making a new.
Paul,Mobile email client right and their beta group has one user Sam Altman their goal is to just make Sam Altman happy and.
Interviewer,When they like send sam altman is like uses email a lot on the go he's sufficiently demanding that if they mate.
Paul,And he knows what all the other options are - yeah so he's sufficiently demanding that if.
Interviewer,They make him happy they've they've sort of used him it's like the positive for a mold right they can now look they like.
Paul,Could make lots of people happy um and that's sufficient right so all one of the things we tell startups in these.
Interviewer,Extreme cases where you could just like make one user happy is act like you're a consultant act like Sam has hired you to.
Paul,Make an email app just for him all you have to do is mix am happy it can say Sam Altman at the top of the screen.
Interviewer,That's okay yeah hey just so long as you make Sam feel that he would be bummed if you stopped working on this that's the.
Paul,Test right not like your friend say oh yeah it's good I'll use it right like they have to be bummed if you stop.
Interviewer,Working on it so what startups in the in these 19 sessions have gone away that you most miss etherpad etherpad I.
Paul,Remember etherpad yeah if your dad still exists Google Docs no no no it's like an open source.
Interviewer,Open source project but it was like a Google Docs kind of I think we have funded etherpad four times I like that.
Paul,Idea so much right and in smash had yep etherpad sty pee well was there a fourth one you might add.
Interviewer,At least i mean at least collaborative writing real time real time real time like you type and other people are.
Paul,Typing in the same document um so boy whoever the fourth one is if I they're gonna be mad at me if I don't remember.
Interviewer,The name but so it goes um that's one of those ideas I just that's gonna happen right it's Google Wave who away was a.
Paul,Good idea well they just like they just launched it like new coke or something you know if they had launched it like a.
Interviewer,Startup it's like here look there's this little thing that doesn't matter the problem they said is like this is gonna.
Paul,Change everything right they made a fake video yeah right what does it do I don't know everything.
Interviewer,Um like if it does everything it does nothing um and they should have just like.
Paul,Launched it is this apparently inconsequential thing right and then everyone have said hey this is much more.
Interviewer,Than a simultaneous typing thing yeah that's could replace the web like yeah yeah what didn't you accept that you.
Paul,Should have accepted well um you must have the anti portfolio the area there is what we say we're not.
Interviewer,Gonna talk about we say we're gonna keep it confidential at people apply um well if they're that successful they're gonna.
Paul,Be pretty flattered that you would well I don't know I haven't talked about him so far but there are pretty there's I'll.
Interviewer,Tell you an easy algorithm for figuring them out right we there are a bunch of other things like Y Combinator ah and.
Paul,When people get rejected by us they often get accepted by one of the others alright so a Center in or something like.
Interviewer,That could have gone to one grid or something like that yes Bernie you know I've just picked techstars as biggest.
Paul,Win i think yeah we changed our application process after that to have so a particular application that might.
Interviewer,Have been recently mentioned was only read by one partner Robert Morris who was really harsh and he like gave them.
Paul,Such a bad grade that they sunk to the bottom of the queue no one else ever saw them and his comment was just spam.
Interviewer,Company oh yeah so now we changed our procedure after that to double no one has ever anyone.
Paul,That robert gives a bad grade to you i would go and look at as well hey just to me.
Interviewer,You guys have so many people reading applications that could never happen you have like ten people reading.
Paul,Applications what do you think of google under Larry Page Google under Larry Page I find it indispensable yeah what do you.
Interviewer,Think if i want to look for things on the Internet it's Google all the way well more like.
Paul,Google corporate i mean so not google search but Google buying six robotic companies Google self-driving car DX.
Interviewer,Yeah i think they're trying to be bell Labs or you know belt whatever Bell Labs is now um and that's great I think.
Paul,That's great but they're not just sitting there like you know trying to turn up the screws on advertisers or.
Interviewer,Something like that Apple under Tim Cook I have an iPhone um I'm really bummed they funded that.
Paul,Patent troll rock yeah yeah yeah like Isis bummer that when I heard that news I actually for the first time ever like.
Interviewer,Thought like maybe i don't want to have an Apple computer anymore you know I feel like that was probably wished upon.
Paul,Them by steve jobs i don't know the origins of that but I feel like that was way that was probably something that.
Interviewer,Like steve decided and they were kind of stuck with because they've spent so money on so much on it but like and that.
Paul,And then i now feel ambivalent about Apple in a way I never did before I think they crossed the line with that.
Interviewer,And they're being really quiet about it no one's talking about Rockstar so let's talk about Rockstar everybody and what a.
Paul,Sucky thing to do they just waddle defunded a patent troll yeah like have you ever been to the.
Interviewer,Website of rockstar like the kid the copy on that page um it's a work of like art you.
Paul,Know like like the guy who ever wrote that stuff was like like they told him just like you know channel some evil.
Interviewer,Dictator propaganda it's like a bond villain right yeah and the guy who it's probably some nice guy who wrote that.
Paul,And he was probably like i can't believe this this is like this is like like some guy stroking a cat on his lap you know.
Interviewer,Yeah and Facebook you know had a billion people I mean how do you look how do you.
Paul,Look at your relational men they've got a lot of employees not I mean in a way basis they are creating the content they.
Interviewer,Are employees it's a carriage um Facebook I mean startups depend a lot on their founders.
Paul,And mark zuckerberg has infinite energy and Drive and cleverness so I wouldn't worry about Facebook yeah and and how.
Interviewer,About like everybody else they read the news about whatsapp and they thought that's ridiculous to pay 19 bill it's.
Paul,Ridiculous that 19 the white sap is worth 19 billion dollars a month I thought I read it like as if someone had.
Interviewer,Measured the atomic weight of whatsapp and it turned out to be higher than I thought.
Paul,Right really what's half is worth 19 billion dollars that's interesting because who knows better these random.
Interviewer,People chattering on forums i won't mention any names right were like Zuckerberg himself who like knows all.
Paul,The numbers and is actually betting this money right people like it must be worth 19 billion dollars if if Zuckerberg was.
Interviewer,Willing to pay 19 billion dollars for it because he is no idiot right yeah so congratulations on the newfound freedom.
Paul,And a couple of days off a week it's gonna be antastic for you it's not the time it's the attention it's that I.
Interviewer,Won't have to think about y combinator all the time right in order to build something like this you have to give up.
Paul,Like a lot of cycles there's this funny like the thing the quote of mine that people quote the most is that one about.
Interviewer,How you can't do a good job that's something without thinking about it in the shower in the morning I'm like every.
Paul,Time i see this on twitter i'm like ah every time every doll I think about in the shower in the morning is y.
Interviewer,Combinator right it's taken over my brain now I'm gonna get my brain back I'll take two.
Paul,Showers every morning i'll be so psyched oh you uh you think you'll ever do your own startup again no no never.
Interviewer,Why i always say you are encouraging people and telling them I have to start side on in a mine right hey it's just.
Paul,Not worth money start a startup but it's not worthy you might be starting a startup is the most efficient way to do.
Interviewer,It but starting a start-up hurts like i mean you would expect it to there's a conservation law there.
Paul,Like you shouldn't expect starting a startup to be the great way to get money and to like feel really easy and good.
Interviewer,Like like that would be great wouldn't it yeah it feels great and it's the easiest way to make a large amount of.
Paul,Money yeah the quickest way yeah yeah felicitous yes and we we don't try and like we don't tell founders any other.
Interviewer,It's painful right if it's not a certain amount of painful you're probably not trying hard enough.
Paul,Well that's as good a notice any to stop on ladies and gentlemen Paul Graham that was awesome well done well done.
Interviewer,First question is and it's the works in the present seem to speak of what it is to see a moment.
Paul,Not just it's rendering and it's allusion to photographic dialogue but to understand this potential dialogue from.
Interviewer,The 50 of the camels position and its potential for serial investigation a transversal of time order and inevitable.
Paul,Ways of seeing these occurrences with it's sort of Kwazii cinematic device could you possibly elaborate on your.
Interviewer,Views of a momentary fragment for us somewhere they questioned something something something so that's cheating.
Paul,Something sent you something more mature right yeah well my complete for going back to the question I guess I've guess.
Interviewer,What i'm getting at to paraphrase question i'm not living need my cake looked in good now I guess what I'm sort.
Paul,Of hinting out about the sort of thing is uh you know using sort of there's a sort of cinematic feel to some of the.
Interviewer,Work in the present which is taken in part by each fragment II on each moment that is sort of separated by another the.
Paul,Next moment so it alludes to this passage of time and how we sort of read an image were especially a photographic.
Interviewer,Image and i think we did sort of tend to think of photographic dialogue is one image you know when everything that's.
Paul,Around it cinematically offers such different information so when I say momentary Fred I'm interested in this.
Interviewer,Idea how you use a camera from different moments to do more elaborate on longer position what a moment actually.
Paul,Is in photographic terms and do you feel that something that is in an errands of work I mean is that part of what your.
Interviewer,Reaches for the present from the state is definitely a part of the the what intrigued me interrogation of that David.
Paul,Sharma just sent me an interesting article from the New Scientist recently on how we as sentient beings how we.
Interviewer,Define them now the present the moment and I recommend someone to read that article with it basically it seems that.
Paul,We have and now two to three sections and that is that are ongoing time is two three maybe four seconds is what we.
Interviewer,Define now is obviously any now energy becomes past but for us to process for on the neurological of brain functions.
Paul,Our senses process it lasts about 23 seconds and that's where anything is that is usually interval of time.
Interviewer,Anything from from sort of one second to three seconds in most of the images in the present you know which we're trying.
Paul,To discuss what what is the present what is the what is them now what is our awareness of it in that way the film.
Interviewer,Side of the question you're getting at this is the cinematic side of that I guess you could ask that about shimmer.
Paul,As well could a would ask that about shimmer as well and so it was sort of longer.
Interviewer,Investigation of that and i've said this before but it partly has become it's become something as easy to focus on.
Paul,Since digital's come to photography because you tend to look at stuttering sequences on screen next next next flick.
Interviewer,Flick flick my god like like a film editor sitting as a editing table nudging through the frames the point.
Paul,Where they're going to make the cut of course that was always there and film photography that they had it but they.
Interviewer,Had it on a contact sheet you know they took many pictures in all this stuff Katya press only and you look at the.
Paul,Contact sheet she took a lot of pictures off the same thing it wasn't just the one and but it just was the in terms of.
Interviewer,Process looking at a screen being able to tap them about on sequential e go through things just help to clarify.
Paul,Those ideas and if i'm recognize it soda library on the potential of see reality and you're the way that image is collude.
Interviewer,In shimmer possibility for example suggests a sort of fabricated see reality of images and moments working.
Paul,Together but each photograph is also seeing Santa matically as difference to the audience's perception of each.
Interviewer,Individual fragment so each image has character within a longer sort of sequence or see reality to the to the.
Paul,Overall work so the question being do these images when displayed in this manner in particular presented discourse.
Interviewer,On the idea of see reality and perception within the overlord overall keys yes kind of and I would add the.
Paul,Word consciousness in there a sort of awareness and copy of awareness or consciousness of the moment arriving.
Interviewer,Enveloping you and gently departing as part of that is the stuttering moments that you are talking about their form.
Paul,Sort of little nodal points or links you know along that way in that thing in the process of recognizing the value of.
Interviewer,Something the beauty of something the simplest heating a piece of chicken at a bus stop or smoking a cigarette you know.
Paul,Cutting the grass or walking shopping home just recognizing that and somehow within the work there is also I hope a.
Interviewer,Sort of instructive quality to it affected in sense of by defining and photographing those moments of awareness.
Paul,Those you know points looking at someone's hands looking at their feet looking at.
Interviewer,The rodent problem back to their face again you you help people appreciate the process of cognition you know and that's.
Paul,Very vital useful for all of us you know so isn't it's about it so it's in that sense it is educational asics am rather.
Interviewer,Late because it is obviously it's more than that it's a work of art but there is an educational or instructive quality.
Paul,To earth like this is one way to see you know this is one way to perceive life and that can't be anything but useful.
Interviewer,Absolutely i think with within the ceo talked about for the graphic died when I don't see sometimes difficult to get.
Paul,Outside of the medium when you talk about these things but photography for me by and large has always had this sort.
Interviewer,Of you know the fixity of being a singularity and when he started stressing past that again stuttering.
Paul,Moment thing you know where you've seen the different maybe that's more what i mean by cinematic seen different angles.
Interviewer,Focus points i think that's when you say education I think to sort of sort of get people through a moment from different.
Paul,Images within that moment i think that's quite powerful I don't I don't think that in terms of perception how we even.
Interviewer,Sort of deal with photography that is something that it gets taken for granted yeah you know that's that's really a way.
Paul,Of you know a way of seeing this sorry pops key would probably yet entitled it and we become complacent about the power.
Interviewer,And meaning of photography because the single instant has become so overused and you know exhausted in some ways it.
Paul,Shouldn't be in these are putting these refreshing there's no I've got no problems with this tall and as yet makes.
Interviewer,Cd images myself most of the time but it is to be helpful in in refreshing that you know in refreshing that that value.
Paul,And imported photography you know as a medium then great it's definitely an expansion I think for me that's what's.
Interviewer,One of the most important aspects that i take away from your work is to sort of teach people that it's not just this.
Paul,Thing but neither is it killing but driven absolutely neither is it something still so it isn't the people.
Interviewer,Who seem to say think i've moved two steps forward why don't I you know start jogging in a in a there's a little thing.
Paul,Is still avoids narrative so the boys storytelling of always all the problems that come with that with chaining the.
Interviewer,World down to a rather simplistic you know clanking for you know choo choo train pulling.
Paul,Along telling you a story and it avoids that which totally did get stuck into back in the 1950s you know and.
Interviewer,Thankfully escaped from again but uh you know so I don't wish to take it across the video or filmmaking that way.
Paul,Something quite different quite unique it's also quite a bit different than what you think about here was a picture.
Interviewer,Post is that the full story too many storytelling and but it's difficult to story photo slower yeah those narratives.
Paul,Were all woven together with different single pictures is completely different to what you're proposing when we look at.
Interviewer,Having open-mindedness about either the quotidian or the moment within and in observing it perception again observing.
Paul,It from a different sort of sort of way that was exactly a question right that's right so we get to the next book okay.
Interviewer,This is an important one in particular for display because your display methodologies incredibly important one.
Paul,Thing you will evolve show chillin and I think that was shimmer fire to fight I have this right shimmer.
Interviewer,Possibility the arrangements the idea of seeing through the use of display the process of editing might be must be.
Paul,Quite expensive from the series in the exit exhibition you had a bob can give us some insights into how you use a.
Interviewer,Space display the nuances of the work how much goes into how to place those images from floor to ceiling and he's.
Paul,Against evan i'm so little about just to correctly that of the ball was in the main gutter puppet is just the presence.
Interviewer,It wasn't pronounced downstairs yeah so it's just that this new york street scene set up house where there's some.
Paul,Old film camera pictures but there was both notion mother it I mean I made up I created a framework of rules for myself.
Interviewer,You know giving me obviously the dip tix you know a sequence to the court Cryme Tyme very straightforward in Western the.
Paul,Near reading of left to right when it was the same exact this is not the right word but passed and Senate sex set of.
Interviewer,Players within the frame and they're just rearranged slightly like some had drifted out to focus and a new doesn't.
Paul,Come in they were just arranged horizontally linear fashion when I was standing the same place and the whole.
Interviewer,Cast of people had changed but something you know like adding a postman had been replaced by a UPS delivery man in.
Paul,Exactly the same positioning they couldn't see the person anymore then I slackened vertically so when there was.
Interviewer,No concurrency between the imaging there's no snow I did oh that man there is neutral that.
Paul,Or this woman is now over here when you couldn't see that I put them vertical when you could see it I left horizontal.
Interviewer,So that was the simplicity of my little have made rule so don't know when you're always disbanded in a sense of time.
Paul,That's what he snapped we couldn't even identify just by looking that it was a certain matter how much time had passed.
Interviewer,I stacked vertically i think if you break that was just because it had to cut space but yeah the low they were.
Paul,Hung low to the floor towards you make that flow from the usual of the concrete of the floor and getting in a gallery or.
Interviewer,Museum into the sidewalk itself into the pavement as they say in England just a tablet languages which is a very nice.
Paul,Effect i like that but at the same time the pictures one quality of the photographs as they are the sort of got.
Interviewer,That marginalize was there very sharp medium format digital pictures on the hook so they sort of achieved this.
Paul,Quality of verisimilitude that a lot of drivers have chased for a long time ever dreamed with film being able to wander.
Interviewer,Around with a large format camera and do bangkok street photographs freeze in the world but having every every tiniest.
Paul,Little hair and poor being shown and you can with medium format digital that you.
Interviewer,Could not get you couldn't walk around with a four by five yeah working order focus and our way and so once I was.
Paul,Slightly boss by the fabrication or so down low to the floor can do have a normal life people actually see that.
Interviewer,More no sir no sir no do you think do you think with that that's an interesting confident picked up where.
Paul,This is kind of a banal question of tech or something but the sort of what we have now for technologies and you're.
Interviewer,Explaining in other areas on the face sort of standing on a picture with medium format digital and we kind of in.
Paul,Terms of optics or perception potentially entered into the sort of hyper reality of looking at images when.
Interviewer,You many we don't see that way you know we don't we just look at a scene we don't see like that when you get into.
Paul,Aggression on how we see i mean it is congregated as we see we we see in shallow focus you know we don't see in.
Interviewer,Deep focus you know i'm if i'm looking at you I'm seeing your sharp but the background is blurred if I focus on the.
Paul,Wall behind you you can return to blur but take that with most cameras and people often you know they optically.
Interviewer,Make sure that everything's in focus so we've the deep focus is actually an optical trick worth of certain cameras.
Paul,And lenses you know it's not so how received but then you can flip its head and say anything I choose to look at.
Interviewer,Will come into focus you know it's where I choose aliyu you're in photo so i choose over the background you that's.
Paul,The coming focus so their photograph that where everything is in focus is actually equally bad if you could argue.
Interviewer,Now i if i choose to you know come walk closer to you I can see the pores on your face to get back to the Arctic.
Paul,Point new to me or hear me i can see the hairs and boards which you choose to walk up to a photograph question you plz.
Interviewer,Patent laws so therefore that level of and to use the word here consult ability you know in a photograph is actually.
Paul,Accurate in some ways because yes it may be excessive in terms of the new technology and digital but it means that.
Interviewer,If you choose to want to go and look at something like that you want to go look closely like you can life you can do it.
Paul,You don't hit a wall of grain and poor resolution you want to go right up to them stick your nose in each room.
Interviewer,Picture and see how many high lashes as best as you more or less over to do it towards the topic of perception an early.
Paul,Night the white sort of pictures and it's a system that alludes to blindness for me it's events a bit attentional.
Interviewer,Attentional your newsfeed before there's no pacity of human sites in a sort of milky iris a blindness which is if maybe.
Paul,They understand which in terms of American socio political economics deals with the idea of the blind eye which in.
Interviewer,America in particular treats the the disparity of classes very particularly an American Way so when you implement.
Paul,This you know this white printing if that's very call it that I'm assuming that's part of a sort of potential.
Interviewer,A metaphor for them for the work and and how we get this idea of displaying the blind item will be ours through a.
Paul,Photographic thing about having it question is a sort of larger socio-economic issues I think that's a.
Interviewer,Big part of i imagine i that serious work yeah yeah I don't want to reduce these are all very good and accurate.
Paul,Points you're raising i know it's not like there is one key that you know yes it's about blindness and it's only about.
Interviewer,Not because it is obviously principally you know when the principal concerns is is the psychological or willful.
Paul,Invisibility and blindness or invisibility of the poor dispossess in the United States and it does that is.
Interviewer,Obviously one of the key things but also in other ways about the landscape of America you know so why should I insist.
Paul,It's just about this one thing and say that those pictures of houses and the suburban white out things and the.
Interviewer,Inner-city da creatures are also about the landscape as they are there's also a scientific value when we consider the.
Paul,American night images sort of looking into this idea of rhodopsin rhodopsin being a biological pigment in.
Interviewer,Photoreceptor cells of the retina they're extremely sensitive to light enable envision in low light conditions.
Paul,Exposed to light up in yet pigmented medial photo bleaches that's where they use photo bleach.
Interviewer,Sort of wording it takes about 45 minutes to regenerate fully in humans as you investigative phenomenon of relapse.
Paul,And in terms of future making or no no it doesn't surprise we say they're nice as what's interesting about that is very.
Interviewer,Much mirrors work the way the digital photo sites work you know if they get hit with lights they think they feel.
Paul,They're considered little wells that fill the delight and at a certain point therefore if they've been hit good light.
Interviewer,And they have to be refreshed and the camera has to reset itself you know the very sight and how how refresh rate can.
Paul,Happen or how i'm burnt out it becomes we will see an old TV cameras that were the filming life of a sudden again.
Interviewer,Blinded by glare and you see it taken a few seconds for the site to reset which is very similar to one of the ways i.
Paul,Stumbled across that way of working was walking out of a movie theater in mid afternoon fire one of the side doors you.
Interviewer,Know those emergency exits in memphis and walking out into blinding sunlight and coming from a darkened you know our.
Paul,Half two hours in a darkened room out into you know Memphis brilliant middle name sunshine was completely.
Interviewer,Overwhelming and you have that optical burn out for the rhodopsin that either it was my rhodopsin was for English am.
Paul,Leading regeneration and come where we squint your eyes in C and he can't he can hardly see at the same time working.
Interviewer,Out and the sun staggering across the car park in front of me there and they're realizing this is a pretty.
Paul,Amazing visual experience you know something that could perhaps easily fairly easily be imitated in a.
Interviewer,Photograph photographic representation sort of value based systems led by perceived notions of truth in a document.
Paul,Form what is your position on the validity of such arguments for momentary truth in photography do you believe in.
Interviewer,Photographic representation of for photographic relativism is largely meaningful deposited leak illusion I.
Paul,Think we believe in multiple truths really any moment and that photographs suffer when they're chained down to.
Interviewer,Illustrating a single truth you know a single dogmatic position my life which doesn't believe that he can't you can't.
Paul,Do something useful when you do do that but they often suffer from it the more I've gone on with the trophy the less.
Interviewer,Useful i found it to chain my work to a single intention or value that i set up and maintained you know.
Paul,So the trophy that interest me arch i struggle to make myself it does have multiple readings and multiple truths.
Interviewer,Within it you know and it grows and i've been around long enough to know I look back at work which I thought was about.
Paul,One thing has become about another you know or another quality of it the beyond caring issues which should probably the.
Interviewer,Most dogmatic ones i did of unemployment offices in in England during the time mrs. Thatcher seemed to be about one.
Paul,Single thing and now they've almost become about that they've become about multiple other things they've become.
Interviewer,About that era did not only about unemployment at that exact time but about that era about the 1980s they've.
Paul,Become historical artifacts rather than angry screed against Thatcherism and unemployment so it's it's often limiting.
Interviewer,To taiyou down to a single you know viewpoint of this is one single truth one single version of reality you said.
Paul,That our lives are not made of disasters in car crashes there a humdrum and a cotillion to which you though when you.
Interviewer,Need let's set the tableau of a scene exert some life into a grand scale and.
Paul,Photograph and photographs either by serious or scale the size of things that say do not in effect magnify and.
Interviewer,Embellish the quotidian reality into a sort of realist history painting favored by me Laker bay and so on so that the.
Paul,Non-rotating and the magnificent or a sublime are in fact something we react to when we see the photograph printed.
Interviewer,Large or in a scale to become to me for the scaling of your images they go sort of from this quotidian into the sublime.
Paul,Sort of territory i think the best example of that children has is the pictures and burn age pictures I did.
Interviewer,Which aren't in this pho course but of young people in clubs and bars in Europe jr. 20 years ago and those are very.
Paul,Casual snapshotting pictures you know very hairy with often with so-called errors in them you negative out of focus.
Interviewer,Or blur or lights you know not color corrected red eyes sometimes and they will blown up very large you know bigger.
Paul,Than life size and pieces of i think they're like 60 x 80 inches or something like that in the frames maybe a bit less.
Interviewer,And i guess part of what you are trying to do at that point is take the mundane the overlooked the vernacular snapshot.
Paul,Picture and printed beautifully large frame very carefully and you're saying I know this looks like an ordinary.
Interviewer,Amateurish badly focused picture the look at the fact that I printed this vehicle of the fact I presented it taken.
Paul,A lot of care a lot of effort more energy to complete this and surety of this size and scale there is something.
Interviewer,Worth looking at worth considering about life however every day to how much this doesn't seem like a professional.
Paul,Photograph it does speak about our lives and who we are our condition so I think a lot of them message in large-scale.
Interviewer,Photography or told me that seeks to you know seeks to stun you with in some ways that list is to take you out of that.
Paul,Comfort zone where you can place a little candid snapshot we expect it to be you know four by six black and white.
Interviewer,And you might value that and love it and feticide then that's great but when you're taking a contemporary picture.
Paul,Knowingly about the quotidian lee every day something that is easily overlooked that we wouldn't or most people would.
Interviewer,Not get the camera out about you have to somehow make you a Zeta no this is not a mistake it's not an accident it is.
Paul,Important look again size scale sequence  .
Interviewer,"What is the mathematical function from which Y Combinator takes its name, and why did you choose this?"
Paul,"It's a function that builds recursive functions without them needing to have names. The Y Combinator is one of those things that seems miraculous when you first encounter it. You wouldn't necessarily have expected such a thing to be possible. We named the company after it partly because we thought it was such a cool concept, and partly as a secret signal to the kind of people we hoped would apply."
Interviewer,How quickly can you now tell whether a start-up will make it? And what are the key characteristics that indicate potential success to Y Combinator?
Paul,We can never tell for sure. No investor can. But we are trying hard to get better at predicting.
Interviewer,"Several copycat incubators have sprung up since Y Combinator launched in 2005 (TechStars, Y Europe, Seedcamp, BoostPhase). Can your model be replicated?"
Paul,"There are a few things they haven't copied correctly, but really it's not our model that distinguishes us. It's the people that make the difference, not just us, but the 250 or so founders we've now funded. The amount of knowledge accumulated in all these heads is remarkable."
Interviewer,"I read that when you call Y Combinator winners, the founders have only five minutes to accept. (If people turn us down, he says, as far as we're concerned they've failed an IQ test.) Have startups turned you down? Are there any that have turned Y Combinator down and still gone on to succeed with a liquidity event?"
Paul,"You're confusing two separate things. The reason people are supposed to decide quickly whether or not to accept is that they already know everything except the percent we'll ask for. They've already seen the deal terms, and they already know as much as they're going to know about YC before actually working with us. So they should already know when we call what percentage they'd be ok with. Since all they have to do is subtract one integer from another, five minutes should be enough."
Interviewer,"How did you determine the 12-week term of each Y Combinator class? Why is two months too short, or six months too long to incubate a startup?"
Paul,"We discovered it by accident. When we first started YC, we began with a summer program. We were trying to learn how to be investors, so we invited college students to come to Cambridge and start startups instead of getting summer jobs."
Interviewer,"Name one thing founders can do to increase their odds of being selected by Y Combinator. Is Andreessen right that the market matters more than the idea, the tech, and even the talent?"
Paul,"Get good cofounders. You can't change who you are, at least not in a short time. And the idea doesn't matter to us as much as the people. So the best thing any indvidual can do is find good people to work with."
Interviewer,How did you first become interested in photography?
Paul,"I first learned how a camera worked as a teenager in the Scouts, of all things, but no one explained to me what photography could do, so eventually I lost interest. Then, while at university, I discovered some great photography in the magazine Creative Camera, there was a column every month by Robert Frank, for example, along with various books in the university library. In a section called ""American Studies,"" I found titles by Lee Friedlander, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Paul Strand, and so on. That's when I thought, ""Wait a minute. You can actually say something with this?""."
Interviewer,So your first serious exposure to photography came through publications and magazines rather than exhibitions?
Paul,"Definitely. I was in a small city in the southwest of England where there was little cultural opportunity to see good photography. Though truthfully, even if you were in London, it was not a lot better in the 1970s. The main chance for me was books, either in libraries or arts bookshops, or, as I said, Creative Camera, the one magazine that would be like Aperture or Blind Spot today."
Interviewer,What was the first major project you completed after graduating?
Paul,"I photographed English cafes and modern English housing developments in some of my earliest work, but the first project that ended up published was A1:The Great North Road (1981-82). I would drive along the A1, which starts in London, runs up the entire length of England, and crosses the border into Scotland to end in Edinburgh. I'd treat these trips like work-travel, similar to what I did with a shimmer of possibility (2004-6) many years later, sleeping in the back of my Mini most of the time."
Interviewer,"Starting with your first significant body of work, you were traveling quite a bit to make photographs?"
Paul,"Yes, I suppose. Troubled Land (1984-86) was made in Northern Ireland. I wasn't based there, so I would drive over to work. With Beyond Caring (1984-85), I went to various unemployment offices across the south of England. I traveled, but I don't think there's anything too unusual about that being part of your process. Traveling isolates you in time and removes you from distraction."
Interviewer,What kinds of challenges did you face making work on the road?
Paul,"The difficult thing about photography is you have no idea where your photographs are. You've carved out time and space to do the work, but you just don't know when or where pictures will arrive. When photographing unemployment offices for Beyond Caring, I could literally pull a page from a phonebook and there would be a list of addresses where my pictures might potentially be. But that was an exception; sadly, good photographs don't come with a list of where you will find them!"
Interviewer,"After completing the three projects in Great Britain, A1, Troubled Land, and Beyond Caring, what came next?"
Paul,"I traveled around Western Europe a lot more, which resulted in two books, New Europe (1993) and End of an Age (1999). I also traveled to Japan on and off for about seven years. Photographs from those trips resulted in the book Empty Heaven (1995)."
Interviewer,Did you take any trips to the U.S. during that period?
Paul,"I was periodically visiting America because I loved coming here, but it wasn't until 1998 or 1999 that I started visiting very regularly and began to seriously consider living and working here."
Interviewer,"You relocated to the States just a few years later, in 2002. I know you currently reside in New York. Have you lived anywhere else in the United States?"
Paul,"I've only lived in New York. I've visited quite a few other places, maybe something like forty out of the fifty states."
Interviewer,What drew you to New York in particular?
Paul,"Besides it being a great city? Well, New York is, of course, one of the principal centers for photography. The Museum of Modern Art has had a department of photography for over eighty years . . . since Edward Steichen. And while this was not a motivation to move, at the time I left London the Tate still didn't have a photography department and had not programmed a single exhibition by a photographer. So part of my thinking was, ""I don't belong here."" More important, though, was the positive embrace of being in the United States and its love of serious photography, about opening the New York Times and finding long articles about Garry Winogrand or Diane Arbus or someone like Boris Mikhailov. I remember finding a half a page on him in the New York Times, that was wonderful."
Interviewer,"Once you arrived in New York, a city filled with galleries and museums, did you spend more time looking at work in person? And if so, did it shape how you were thinking about the medium at that time?"
Paul,"Yes, of course, and I still do, I'm a very regular gallery-goer and look at a good amount of contemporary art. Virtually all artists come through New York at some point, which is one of the wonderful things about the city, you can see a lot. But really, the contemporary photography that influenced me wasn't often in galleries, you'd find it primarily through books. It should be said, though, that there comes a time when you stop regularly looking at other people's work because it can be too distracting. It's nearly impossible to avoid being influenced by others, especially subconsciously. So I've found it best to just shut down when I am into the work and get on chasing my own ideas, rather than look too much at the work of others."
Interviewer,"Your upcoming exhibition at Pier 24 Photography includes three bodies of work made in the United States. The exhibition is titled The Whiteness of the Whale, a reference to Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851). What was your experience reading that book?"
Paul,"Well . . . I'm no Lit graduate, but I think the book touches on many major subjects. Especially relevant here are issues of monomaniacal blindness in a human being and how chasing one thing obsessively can drive you to destruction. To be honest, I found it a hard read, inspired and crazy in places, insightful in others, racist and offensive in others again."
Interviewer,Why did you decide to read Moby-Dick the first time?
Paul,"Because of American Night (1998-2002), the white images, the white whale, etc. We ended up using a quote from Moby-Dick on the back cover about seeing and whiteness. It's nice to return to the book now with The Whiteness of the Whale. Melville's chapter of the same name, which we have included in our exhibition book, is on the edge between genius and madness and that intrigues me. The Whiteness of the Whale is on the edge between genius and madness and that intrigues me."
Interviewer,How do you see it as a metaphor for what's happening in the U.S. today?
Paul,"I'd rather not over explain it, it's better to let the work live for itself. But I do think Moby-Dick speaks to the way people go down rabbit holes based on their own particular beliefs and fail to see what is happening to them, their society, or their land. Ahab causes his whole ship to founder in his quest."
Interviewer,So is American Night the first project that resulted from your serious focus on making work in the U.S.?
Paul,"If you're talking about the first body of work, then yes. But you don't start out thinking, ""I'm going to make a body of work about America."" You just start taking pictures and looking for truly interesting photographs. And that can take a month, or a year, or three years, to find some amazing, unusual, different image, which is the gateway through which you will pass into uncharted territory. In this case, I found these overexposed white pictures, which described a sort of invisibility of the dispossessed in this country. That was a fresh visualization worth pursuing, making near-invisible photographs."
Interviewer,Where were you making these pictures?
Paul,"The locations in American Night were basically along the compass points across the United States. North was Detroit; South was Memphis and Atlanta; East was New York; West was Greater Los Angeles. I wanted to make sure that the pictures were geographically spread out so people didn't think, ""oh, isn't inner-city New York terrible, or Detroit . . ."" It wasn't about one location; it was about something pervasive."
Interviewer,You made these near-invisible photographs through deliberate overexposure. How did you decide to make pictures in this way?
Paul,"The idea principally came about during a visit to Memphis. I was there for a group show that included a portrait from End of an Age. One afternoon, I went to the cinema, lazy me, and when the movie finished, I walked out a side exit door that led straight into the bright afternoon sunlight. I stumbled around thinking, ""what is going on here?"" While completely blinded by the brightness, I noticed this slightly unhinged guy shouting to himself as he walked across the car park. And I realized how amazing this whole scene was. With my overwhelmed, burnt-out vision, this poor man appeared to be crossing a wasteland of whiteness, unnoticed by the world."
Interviewer,"There are also very dark inner-city photographs and bright ""Technicolor"" images of large homes included in American Night. How do these three different kinds of pictures work together?"
Paul,"The earliest pictures for American Night were the dark inner-city ones. Some are dated around 1998 and 1999, like the man and woman with white eye-patches. In those pictures I was working on the streets of New York like a classic street photographer, but didn't have any purpose for them. Two or three years later, I discovered the white pictures. And I realized that was the breakthrough. While I wanted the majority of the images to be these near-invisible white pictures, the dark pictures were important too, and I wanted to include the American Dream, presented as glorious full-color McMansions. I worked with these three types of imagery, white, dark, and ""Technicolor"", looking for ways to integrate them. Ultimately, the white images predominate; they're around 80 percent of the pictures."
Interviewer,"In the book for American Night, you grouped all the dark inner-city pictures together in the center. What inspired that design decision?"
Paul,"The idea of a play within the play. In Hamlet, Shakespeare has the characters create ""The Mousetrap"", a play within a play, that speaks to the plot of Hamlet. Situating the dark pictures in the center of the book is kind of like that, a project within the project."
Interviewer,How did you know when you were finished making pictures for the project?
Paul,"The work was complete with the edit of the book and realizing how to integrate those three categories of photographs, light, dark, and color. I realized these elements were working together, forming a stable base upon which to build the final work, and I didn't need a fourth approach. I showed the pictures to the publisher, Michael Mack. It took him a little time to see what was going on, but to his credit, he totally got it and stood behind it, and we published the book."
Interviewer,"As you moved on to making pictures for a shimmer of possibility, did your working process and concerns feel like a departure from, or a continuation of, long-standing interests?"
Paul,"In all my works, there is a similar engagement with the world through photography and being in the world. shimmer also engages with the social fabric of the United States, so in that sense it's not a departure. It is, however, structurally different with these extended, flowing sequences, the ""visual haikus"", of images. Change is not unusual for me. I've consistently moved things around to keep my work interesting for myself. Troubled Land is visually quite different from Beyond Caring, which is different from New Europe. I've always believed that as soon as artists succeed in something, they should find new ways to scare themselves! You have linked the idea of the ""visual haiku"" to the short stories of Anton Chekhov. What is the connection? As I was reviewing scanned negatives on my computer screen, I started to notice these interesting flickering sequences. Even though I was still shooting analog, there was no traditional ""contact sheet."" Instead."
Interviewer,"As you were making these pictures of ordinary, everyday life, what would inspire you to pick up the camera and take a photograph?"
Paul,"I honestly don't know. It was not as if every time I picked up the camera and took pictures I ended up with one of the sequences that appears in shimmer. I photographed hundreds of things that didn't turn out to bear fruit. But driving and wandering around America, often without even really knowing where I was going or to what end, led to random and wonderful moments. Meeting someone or sharing a modest experience, be it in New England, Las Vegas, or Memphis."
Interviewer,Were people often aware of your presence photographing?
Paul,"Sometimes. You can see from some of the sequences that I'm talking to people and they're looking at the camera as I photograph them; they're clearly cooperating. But sometimes you talk to strangers and sometimes you don't, just as in life. You may equally remember both experiences; there may be a stranger you never spoke a word to, but you will still be able to perfectly describe what you saw and experienced. The actual process of photographing, of seeing, is right there:the realization of the world as it arrives and departs on your screen."
Interviewer,"As you designed the sequences in shimmer, did you always use consecutive images, or were there instances where you eliminated exposures from the final sequence?"
Paul,"Some pictures are left out because there's a pause, they're repetitious without purpose, so I'll skip them. I'm not literally showing every frame from a five-second film. That's not the idea. In a haiku, there's a moment where it breaks away and they touch upon the weather or the time of year, like ""spring blossoms,"" just a single word or two. I try to integrate that breakaway into some of the sequences. For instance, in the pictures with the man cutting the grass, one frame looks at his brown minivan, in all its 1980s glory. In the pictures where."
Interviewer,Was there any anxiety in approaching New York City as a subject when so many others have explored it before you?
Paul,"Of course. It's a cliché. A trope. But it's very rare that people do it exceptionally well. There's plenty of bad street photography. I also feel like a lot of the art world doesn't quite get street photography. They associate it with random observations and don't see the value, or deep art, in a Winogrand or a Frank. That's kind of ridiculous to me."
Interviewer,"You mentioned earlier that there comes a point when you try to avoid looking at the work of other photographers as you undertake a new project. Were you consciously trying to think about different ways of approaching the city, or did you just go out and start making pictures?"
Paul,"I can't erase my knowledge of Winogrand, or Arbus, or Tod Papageorge. But hopefully that knowledge is constructive, I appreciate their lessons and experiences rather than simply imitating or copying them. So it corrects and steers you."
Interviewer,"Many people who came through our exhibition A Sense of Place, which included selections from The Present, were surprised to learn that the photographs were completely unstaged. Can you talk about the process of making those pictures?"
Paul,"If you look at Winogrand's contact sheets, he took five pictures of the same thing and then printed the one he thought was the most interesting. And that was great, of course. Likewise, I'm taking five pictures, but choosing two, or very occasionally three, to show this flowing consciousness of time, to get a different sense of the city, time, people, and life's flow. It takes a different direction from Henri Cartier-Bresson or Winogrand, who worked to capture the singular instant, but it continues in that lineage and connects with their amazing work. In short, there's an attempt to shift our awareness from a sort of spotlight to a floodlight."
Interviewer,The photographs in The Present are very much about the way our eye operates in the urban landscape. You draw our attention to the idea of seeing through repeated allusions to sight and blindness. Was that something you noticed during the editing process . . . that these subjects appeared in the work? Or were you deliberately shooting for those kinds of pictures?
Paul,"It's in American Night as well. The first and last pictures in the sequence of dark pictures in New York are of a blinded man and a woman whose eye is covered over with gauze. In The Present there are quite a few pictures of blind people with white sticks in the city. I've always been interested in notions of sight, seeing, and blindness. And American Night is primarily about blindness, willful blindness or psychological blindness."
Interviewer,"Thinking about your work more generally, I was interested in writer David Campany's comments about your use of color. In discussing the work you made in Britain, he suggested your use of color serves the work's social commentary. Does the use of color operate similarly in your pictures of the United States?"
Paul,"Without a doubt, color is an extra layer of information. Sometimes it matters a lot and sometimes it's less relevant. Just like it's essential that some pictures be made in black and white, while other photographs just happen to be in black and white. When we look at the color of some early Stephen Shore or William Eggleston pictures now, we see how specific palettes of color were connected to the time. You can date pictures by the colors used on cars, signage, clothing, or even hair. I don't know why you would want to remove that embedded information, unless you feel it's especially unhelpful or confusing."
Interviewer,The work you made in the U.K. documents a particular moment in time. Do you think the same is true of the work you've made in the U.S.?
Paul,"It's hard to tell right now, because we're so close to it chronologically. You need the parallax effect of time to spiral off into the distance, and then we might begin to see it. And that can be slightly sad, to look at a Shore or Eggleston and start focusing, with nostalgia, on the hairdos and cars. Those pictures were contemporary, absolutely of their moment when they were made."
Interviewer,Do you think anything about your relationship to American politics is reflected in the photographs?
Paul,"Well, I am not a political shill for any party viewpoint. Most photographers worth their salt rely on empathy and concern for their fellow citizens on this planet, rather than on political ideology. Inevitably, that empathic connection with other human beings leads one to certain sympathies. But I'm certainly not a spokesperson or a mouthpiece for the Democrats or Socialism or anything like that."
Interviewer,"You did three bodies of work in Britain, and now there are three bodies of work you've done in the United States. Is this idea of working in threes something that happens organically? Or is there something about this three-part organization that suits the way you made work in these two places?"
Paul,"I feel it's just a coincidence. Though, with American Night, shimmer, and The Present, there is a connection to the three principal controls of the camera, aperture, shutter, and focus . . . though that isn't why I made them, I didn't think of this master plan fifteen years ago and then decide to dedicate three to four years to each body of work, I'm not that smart! It's usually something you realize along the way and recognize is happening, like novelists recognize who their characters have become as they write them."
Interviewer,At what point did you become conscious of the fact these three bodies of work touch on the three controls of the camera?
Paul,"It occurred to me toward the end of shimmer. I also realized by using very shallow focus on the street in The Present that I could deal with specific individuals in terms of one's awareness very effectively. And that would neatly encompass all three respects. Of course, the three camera controls, shutter, aperture, and focus, are really not that interesting in themselves. I mean, so what? But when you start to think of them in terms of the shutter controlling time, the aperture adjusting light and the focus directing our attention or consciousness, they become a lot more powerful and fertile:time, light, consciousness. Art often does that, it speaks both of itself and of the stuff it is made of. I like that about this work. It speaks about America, about seeing, and about photography. That makes me happy."
Interviewer,Will you invest in and/or advise our startup?
Paul,"I invest in and advise startups through Y Combinator. If you want investment, the way to get it is to apply for our next round of funding. If we fund you, you can have all the advice you want (if not more)."
Interviewer,Can I mirror an essay on my site?
Paul,"I'd rather you linked to it instead. I like to keep track of which ones people read, because it gives me ideas of what to write about next. I also like to be able to fix typos."
Interviewer,Can I include an essay in my school newspaper?
Paul,"Sure, go ahead. Please include the url of the original though."
Interviewer,Can I put a translation into another language online?
Paul,"Sure. Please include the url of the original, and send me the url of your translation so I can make a link to it."
Interviewer,How long does it take you to write an essay?
Paul,"Usually about two weeks. What You Can't Say took a month, partly because the topic was so dangerous. How to Start a Startup took a week, because I started it a week before I had to deliver it as a talk. Writing, Briefly was the fastest, at just over an hour."
Interviewer,Why did the school authorities veto the plan to have you give the talk that became What You'll Wish You'd Known?
Paul,"They didn't have anything against me specifically, but because I wouldn't be coming from any organization, they wouldn't have any guarantee I wouldn't say dangerous things. Whereas if I came to speak from IBM or the State Department, and told the students they should all go out and try heroin, I'd be fired."
Interviewer,Are any of your paintings online?
Paul,"I don't really consider myself a painter. I was trained in painting, but I haven't worked seriously at it for years. For the curious there is one image online. The painting on the cover of ANSI Common Lisp is also one of mine."
Interviewer,Are you the photographer Paul Graham?
Paul,"No, that's a different guy."
Interviewer,You say in Taste for Makers that setting text in sans serif fonts was a mistake. So why do you use them on your site?
Paul,I was talking about books. The resolution of computer screens is much lower.
Interviewer,What editor do you use?
Paul,vi.
Interviewer,How can I learn to program?
Paul,Find a friend who knows how to program. Get them to set you up with a system where you can edit and run programs. Use whatever language they suggest for a beginner (probably it will be Python or Ruby). Then get the O'Reilly book and start working through it.
Interviewer,Why do you advise plunging right into a programming project instead of carefully planning it first?
Paul,"If you're trying to solve a simple, predefined problem like doing a depth-first search, thinking everything out beforehand doesn't hurt. But few real problems are like that. In real-world applications, you don't usually know at first precisely what problem you're trying to solve. So if you spend a lot of time planning in advance, what you'll end up with is a minutely detailed plan for solving the wrong problem."
Interviewer,"Often the reason programmers are pushed into planning is not that the problem requires it, but that project managers require it. Maybe programmers should give managers an explicit choice: do you want me to solve the problem in the way that will make you feel good, or the way that will yield the best solution?"
Paul,"There are a number of topics I go on about: that small companies do things better than big ones; that cubicles suck; that you have to understand design to be a good hacker; that planning is overrated. Those don't seem so conspicuous, because many readers either have no prior opinion, or already agree."
Interviewer,Isn't object-oriented programming naturally suited to some problems?
Paul,Yes and no. A lot of what seem to be OO problems turn out not to be if you have random access to the concepts that together comprise object-orientedness.
Interviewer,Where do you find co-founders?
Paul,"Most successful startups have more than one founder, and usually the founders seem to have been friends for at least a year before starting the company. The best way to meet co-founders is to go to school with them, so recent grads have a big advantage there. You can also meet co-founders at work, but be careful not to violate whatever noncompete you signed. In the old days, co-founders often met through user groups, but this seems less common now."
Interviewer,How can someone start a startup if they have a family to support?
Paul,"The best plan might be to start a consulting business that you can gradually morph into a startup. This way you always have a source of income. See How to Fund a Startup, especially the section labelled Consulting."
Interviewer,Do you know of any good books about startups?
Paul,The how-to type of books are generally wretched. Many are downright mistaken.
Interviewer,I have multiple startup ideas. How do I decide which to work on?
Paul,"Work on the one that will cause the most immediate, concrete improvement in users' lives. Don't worry too much at first about competitors, or how users will find out about it, or how to make money. But don't work on something that's going to take ten years, either. (In technology, ten years rounds up to never.)."
Interviewer,How much should a startup worry about being sued for patent infringement?
Paul,There are two kinds of patent suits:.
Interviewer,Where do I get it?
Paul,Arclanguage.org.
Interviewer,Why do you need to design a new language?
Paul,"It would be surprising if we didn't still need to design more languages. That would amount to saying that programming language design is now a solved problem, and that the final, perfect language has now been designed. It does not seem that way to me not by a long shot. The number of still open questions makes my head spin."
Interviewer,Why is it called Arc?
Paul,"The name is a reference to bottom-up programming. This means customizing the language to suit your application, yielding a program shaped like an arch, rather than a lintel. Since brevity is another aim, we lopped off the h."
Interviewer,Why did you keep car and cdr?
Paul,"Because we couldn't think of any better alternatives. It would have been misleading to use first and rest or head and tail, because conses are fundamentally pairs; lists are one thing you can build with them, but not the only thing."
Interviewer,Is Arc object-oriented?
Paul,"The phrase object-oriented means a lot of things. Half are obvious, and the other half are mistakes."
Interviewer,Why not use some other delimiter than parentheses?
Paul,We tried various possibilities. Square and curly brackets lose because they are less directional than parens (left and right differ in fewer pixels); < and > lose because they don't wrap around enough to enclose expressions longer than tokens.
Interviewer,Won't allowing <new possibility> confuse people reading code?
Paul,E.g. (a i) could be a function call or an array reference.
Interviewer,Why not build Arc on top of Java/Parrot/.NET?
Paul,"We're trying to make something for the long term in Arc, something that will be useful to people in, say, 100 years. (If that sounds crazy, remember that we're already up to 50.) So (a) we're not in a hurry to save effort; when you're trying to make something that will last 100 years, there is plenty of time to work on it, and (b) we don't want to adhere to anything that isn't timeless, lest the whole project curl up like a bimetallic strip."
Interviewer,What is Lisp?
Paul,"Lisp is a family of programming languages descended from a language John McCarthy invented (or more accurately, discovered) in the late 1950s. The two main dialects now are Common Lisp and Scheme. We're working on a new dialect called Arc."
Interviewer,How can I learn Lisp?
Paul,"The way to learn any language is to write programs in it. You have two main dialects to choose between: Scheme and Common Lisp. They each have advantages and disadvantages, but the differences between them are tiny compared to the differences between them and other languages, so if you want to start learning Lisp, it doesn't matter which you choose."
Interviewer,"Which should I learn, Common Lisp or Scheme? What's the difference?"
Paul,"Common Lisp is powerful but ugly. Scheme is small and clean, but the standard only defines the inner core of the language. If I had to deliver an application I'd probably use Common Lisp; if I were teaching a course I might use Scheme (but with Common Lisp macros)."
Interviewer,"Do you know a good, free Lisp implementation?"
Paul,"There are several. The Common Lisp implementation I use is Clisp, but CMUCL is also well-regarded. For Scheme hacking I use Scheme 48 and PLT Scheme."
Interviewer,Can you recommend a book for someone who wants to learn Lisp?
Paul,You might like this one.
Interviewer,Is there a good online tutorial for Lisp?
Paul,"Start with Chapter 2 of Ansi Common Lisp, which is a brief introduction to Lisp programming. For more detail, see the Common Lisp reference manual."
Interviewer,"If Lisp is so great, why don't more people use it?"
Paul,"The root cause is probably that it looks hard, but it would help if there were a dialect with extensive libraries."
Interviewer,Where can I get a copy of On Lisp?
Paul,"Thanks to Chip Coldwell, you can now get a Postscript file of it online."
Interviewer,Is there a second edition of ANSI Common Lisp?
Paul,"Some databases say that there is, but there isn't; not yet at least."
Interviewer,Is there a set of solutions to the problems in ANSI Common Lisp?
Paul,"Unfortunately not. I was supposed to write one, but we started Viaweb right after the book went to press, and I never got around to it."
Interviewer,Where can I get a job hacking Lisp?
Paul,Try the companies with Lisp applications. Or you could start your own.
Interviewer,I like Lisp but my company won't let me use it. What should I do?
Paul,"Try to get them to let you use Python. Often when your employer won't let you use Lisp it's because (whatever the official reason) the guy in charge of your department is afraid of the way Lisp source code looks. Python looks like an ordinary dumb language, but semantically it has a lot in common with Lisp, and has been getting closer to Lisp over time."
Interviewer,What do you think of ML and its derivatives?
Paul,"Most hackers I know have been disappointed by the ML family. Languages with static typing would be more suitable if programs were something you thought of in advance, and then merely translated into code. But that's not how programs get written."
Interviewer,Do you know anyone who does AutoLisp consulting?
Paul,"No, but Google does."
Interviewer,How did the editor handle client sessions?
Paul,"There was one Lisp process for each user. When someone logged in to edit their site, we'd start up a new process and load all their data into memory. From that point they had an ongoing conversation with that process."
Interviewer,What did you use for an HTTP server?
Paul,"At first the editor had its own HTTP server, written in Common Lisp by Robert Morris. Later we switched to a version of Apache that he hacked to talk to Lisp."
Interviewer,What Lisp did you use?
Paul,Clisp.
Interviewer,Did you use real continuations to save state?
Paul,"No, we used macros to fake them in Common Lisp, as described in On Lisp."
Interviewer,What database did you use?
Paul,"We didn't use one. We just stored everything in files. The Unix file system is pretty good at not losing your data, especially if you put the files on a Netapp."
Interviewer,Was your co-founder the same Robert Morris who wrote the worm and is now a professor at MIT?
Paul,Yes.
Interviewer,Where did you get venture funding?
Paul,"We got money from several private investors, what are known in the business as angels. Our investors were pretty serious, almost VCs, but they weren't actually brand-name VC firms."
Interviewer,How was Viaweb pronounced?
Paul,"The official policy was that you could say either vee-a-web or vie-a-web. We all used the former, but everyone else, including the people at Yahoo, seemed to prefer the latter."
Interviewer,What would you do differently?
Paul,"Technically, not much. I think the main thing we should have done that we didn't was start some kind of online store ourselves. We used the editor to make our own site, so we were pretty motivated to make it good. But we could only understand the e-commerce part of the software second-hand."
Interviewer,Is this code available anywhere?
Paul,"No; it's written in Arc, which is itself not released yet."
Interviewer,Is there a Bayesian filter for Outlook?
Paul,"I know of nine so far: Spammunition, SpamBayes, Spam Bully, InboxShield, Junk-Out, Outclass, Disruptor OL, SpamTiger, and JunkChief."
Interviewer,Is there anything that can protect my company's server?
Paul,"The best commercial server-level Bayesian filter is probably Death2Spam. SpamProbe, one of the best open-source Bayesian filters, can also be run on the server."
Interviewer,Does Arc/Lisp have some advantage for writing this kind of software?
Paul,"Lisp's symbol type is useful in manipulating databases of words, because it lets you test for equality by just comparing pointers. (If you find yourself using checksums to identify words, it's symbols you mean to be using.) Prolog, Erlang, and Ruby also support symbols. So does Python, to a degree, though I don't think it has any syntax for them yet."
Interviewer,Do you mind if I write filters based on this algorithm?
Paul,"Of course not. I don't claim to have invented anything new here. Bayesian text classification is an old and established field. If there is anything new in this article (at least, it was news to me) it is that such a simple variant of it is so effective at filtering spam."
Interviewer,I don't know Lisp; can you explain the algorithm to me?
Paul,It's expressed in math notation in Hackers & Painters.
Interviewer,Could you use Bayesian filtering to make Web content filters?
Paul,"I've never tried it, but yes, I think it would work well."
Interviewer,Will this algorithm filter out 99.5% of my spam with no false positives?
Paul,"It does filter out 99.5% of my spam. I got similar results for the one other spam collection I've tested it on so far. (I couldn't measure false positives, because I only had the spams.)."
Interviewer,Could spammers fool Bayesian filters by filling their spams with random words?
Paul,"They would have to get rid of the bad words as well as adding neutral ones. Only the most interesting fifteen words contribute to the probability, and neutral words like onion, no matter how many there are of them, can't compete with the incriminating viagra for statistical significance."
Interviewer,"Once this software was available, couldn't spammers just tune their spams to get through it?"
Paul,"They couldn't necessarily tune their emails and still say what they wanted to say. If they wanted to send you to a url that is known to the filters, for example, they would find it hard to tune their way around that."
Interviewer,What if spammers sent their messages as images?
Paul,"They already do sometimes, and we are able to catch them. Such emails include a lot of damning content, actually. The headers, to start with, will be as bad as ever. And remember that we scan html as well as text. Within the message body there will probably be a link as well as the image, both containing urls, which would probably score high. Href and img themselves both have spam probabilities approaching pornographic words. Within the url, the image has to have some kind of name, and these are usually far from random."
Interviewer,Can your program deal with the spam trick of inserting html comments in the middle of words?
Paul,"Yes, I ignore html comments down at the level of scanning tokens, not even considering them as separators."
Interviewer,Would this article itself be filtered out by your filters?
Paul,"No. Someone sent it to me as a test, and it wasn't. Although the article contains a lot of spam words, it also contains a lot of even more provably innocent words (like spammers ironically, which occurs in a lot of my real email, and never in my spam). Since only the most interesting words count, the innocent words crowded out the spam words in the rankings, and this mail ended up with the minimum possible probability."
Interviewer,How well can your software filter out mail that's about spam?
Paul,"This is a problem for anyone who works on spam filtering. In the extreme case, if someone you've never heard from merely forwards you a spam with no additional comment, it's going to be hard to filter out. There it will all come down to the headers."
Interviewer,Will this software filter out good automated email like order receipts and newsgroup faqs?
Paul,"Mostly not. That kind of mail may be automated, but the text usually has a very different character from spam."
Interviewer,Will the kind of people who would respond to a spam use filters?
Paul,"I think so. I'm guessing here, but I suspect that people stupid enough to respond to a spam will often get email through one of the free services like Yahoo Mail or Hotmail, or through big ISPs like AOL or Earthlink. Once word spreads that it is possible to filter out most spam, they'll be forced to offer effective filters."
Interviewer,"If filters catch most spam, won't spammers just send more to compensate?"
Paul,Spammers already operate at capacity.
Interviewer,How do you feel about blacklists?
Paul,"As ISPs use them now, they're equivalent to very bad filters. But the information they supply could be incorporated into Bayesian filtering."
Interviewer,Doesn't Bayes' Rule assume the predictors are independent?
Paul,"Yes, strictly speaking it is only valid assuming the probabilitiy of e.g. sex occurring in an email is unrelated to the probability of sexy occurring in it. Obviously that is not the case."
Interviewer,Does this algorithm take into account the prior probability of a mail being a spam?
Paul,"No. It assumes it's equally likely for a mail to be a spam or not. So accuracy could be slightly improved by taking into account the actual proportion of spam received by each user. You would have to do this by hour though, because the proportion varies so much depending on the time of the day that the overall prior probability is useless as a predictor."
Interviewer,Why do you consider 15 words? What's special about 15?
Paul,"Actually, in the latest version of the filter I use 20, because marking tokens by context means the software now sees more distinct tokens per mail."
Interviewer,Will this work for languages other than English?
Paul,"As long as they use whitespace to separate tokens, it should."
Interviewer,What is an FFB?
Paul,A Filter that Fights Back.
Interviewer,What would an FFB do?
Paul,"Spider every url in each newly arrived spam, if the ip address of the server was blacklisted. Ideally the http requests would be spread over the lifetime of the spam the period during which customers respond to it. I suspect most responses occur within a couple hours of the spam being sent. It may be different for spams sent at night."
Interviewer,Could spammers make servers fast enough to handle the flood of http requests?
Paul,The hardcore spammers probably could. But not sites like AmericanSingles.Com.
Interviewer,What kind of bandwidth costs could FFBs generate?
Paul,"If there were 100,000 FFBs, a spammer's site had a total of 100k of stuff in it, and each FFB crawled the site 10x per spam, this would generate 100 GB of transfer. At current rates for spam hosting that would cost the spammer about $1000-4000 per spam."
Interviewer,Couldn't spammers protect against crawlers?
Paul,"They probably could, by putting invisible links in their pages. Anything that followed such a link must be a crawler and could safely be ignored. But the easiest way to protect against FFBs would be to include working unsubscribe links. This would be particularly necessary for small fry just getting started and legitimate sites that hire spammers to generate traffic. These would not have the infrastructure or expertise to protect against FFBs."
Interviewer,Wouldn't retrieving web beacons show your address was live?
Paul,"Yes, so that might bring more spam. But it would also make web beacons stop working as an index of open rates. And you'd be clicking on unsubscribe links as well, which FFBs would make more popular."
Interviewer,Wouldn't this encourage people to send spams promoting sites that pay for clickthroughs?
Paul,"If there are still sites that pay for clickthroughs, they must already have some way to protect themselves against people who generate traffic by spamming. So there would be no money in it."
Interviewer,Isn't a denial of service attack on spammers illegal?
Paul,"This one would be uncoordinated, and so distributed that no one client would have to submit too many http requests. I'm not proposing that a given filter hit a spammer's site with 10,000 http requests. More like a couple hundred, at most."
Interviewer,How would blacklists be managed?
Paul,I'm not committed to one way of doing it. But I suspect it couldn't be entirely automated. Sites would have to be inspected by humans to protect innocent sites from being blacklisted.
Interviewer,Aren't blacklists prone to abuse?
Paul,"Yes. To be honest, this is the weak link in this plan. A widely used FFB blacklist run by nuts like MAPS could do a lot of damage. And all blacklists seem to become corrupt eventually."
Interviewer,Couldn't spammers just sue or DoS the blacklist?
Paul,"To protect against DoS attacks, the blacklist might have to be distributed through a p2p network."
Interviewer,Wouldn't this miss spammers using Migmaf-style proxies?
Paul,"Yes. But if we drive spammers to use such measures to survive, I think we'll drive a lot of them out of business. Writing viruses seems to be taken more seriously by the criminal justice system than forging headers. I think many current spammers wouldn't take the risk."
Interviewer,What about spammers breaking into people's web servers and using them to redirect?
Paul,This wouldn't help them. FFBs would still interfere with the spammers' customers.
Interviewer,What about spammers using redirects off sites like Geocities?
Paul,"Such spams are rare, probably because Geocities has figured out how to prevent spammers from using them for this purpose. Hosting services that hadn't figured this out would soon learn."
Interviewer,Why have email as part of the system? Why not just have a blacklist of spam sites and encourage people to beat on them?
Paul,"Several people have written suggesting a DDoS@Home project of this type. (Two correspondents who shall remain nameless simultaneously invented this catchy name.) But I think mail should remain in the system for two reasons: (a) it tells you which sites to pound, and when, and (b) if you included it as part of a filter, you could get more users."
Interviewer,Why don't more painters have hacking jobs?
Paul,"Probably for the same reason that few hackers take up painting. They both seem from the outside like great abstruse mysteries. You can learn great abstruse mysteries as a teenager, because everything is a mystery at that point anyway. And you have the boundless self confidence that comes from ignorance. But unless you learn both as a teenager, which is rare, you'll be afraid of the other later."
Interviewer,What should I read to learn more about history?
Paul,"The way to do it is piecemeal. You could just sit down and try reading Roberts's History of the World cover to cover, but you'd probably lose interest. I think it's a better plan to read books about specific topics, even if you don't understand everything the first time through."
Interviewer,Couldn't you add something equivalent to Lisp macros to languages like Perl or Python?
Paul,"Not without turning them into dialects of Lisp. Real macros need to operate on the parse tree of the program. To allow that in a language with syntax, you have to (a) make public the translation from source code to parse trees, and (b) give the programmer the opportunity to run programs on parse trees before they go on to the compiler."
Interviewer,How can I avoid turning into a pointy-haired boss?
Paul,"The pointy-haired boss is a manager who doesn't program. So the surest way to avoid becoming him is to stay a programmer. What tempts programmers to become managers are companies with old-fashioned corporate structure, where the only way to advance in salary and prestige is to go into management. So if you want to avoid becoming a PHB, avoid such companies, and work for (or start) startups."
Interviewer,Why be a manager when you could be a founder or early employee at a startup?
Paul,The best teachers I remember from school had three things in common:.
Interviewer,Two startups want to hire me. Which should I choose?
Paul,"The one with the most determined and smartest founders (in that order) is the more likely to succeed. Pretend you're an investor, which you are, of your time, and ask yourself which of the two you'd buy stock in."
Interviewer,How can I become really good at Lisp programming?
Paul,"Write an application big enough that you can make the lower levels into a language layer. Embedded languages (or as they now seem to be called, DSLs) are the essence of Lisp hacking."
Interviewer,What philosophy books would you recommend?
Paul,"I can't think of any I'd recommend. What I learned from trying to study philosophy is that the place to look is in other fields. If you understand math or history or aeronautical engineering very well, the most abstract of the things you know are what philosophy is supposed to be teaching. Books on philosophy per se are either highly technical stuff that doesn't matter much, or vague concatenations of abstractions their own authors didn't fully understand (e.g. Hegel)."
Interviewer,"I want to start a startup, but I don't know how to program. How long will it take to learn?"
Paul,"I would guess a smart person can learn to hack sufficiently well in 6 months to a year. The best way to do it would be to find some startup to hire you in an initially menial capacity, and start learning to program on the side. Then gradually work your way up from answering phones through system administration to actual software design. There is always so much to do in a startup that people won't be too picky about your paper qualifications, if you can solve problems for them without screwing up."
Interviewer,"Let's start with this new book, which is actually a series of books, and work backwards. How did the project originate?"
Paul,"Well, my principal source was from reading Chekhov's Short Stories, and the critical essays around those. A lot of people have tried to understand why this writing works so well, since in the stories there's not much happening. They're dealing with the simple, everyday things, in one of them a woman is combing her hair for six pages, remembering that night at the theater; in another a school teacher is coming home in a cart dreaming of meeting the landowner, who does ride past and they exchange a few pleasantries, but nothing more. But there's something magical about how perfectly described they are, the transparency of what's happening, without guff or show, simply described, with nothing proscribed."
Interviewer,"But difficult to convey, I would think, no? The layout must have been the crucial step."
Paul,"Yes, in terms of making them, it was a process of letting go of one's own pretensions and not looking for this great summation picture of any given situation. For example, while photographing a man smoking at a bus stop in Vegas, I just had to slow down, take a step back, and realize that the moment before and the moment after are just as valuable as the instant when he takes the perfect drag on the cigarette."
Interviewer,Where was the picture of the lawn mowing man taken? It's fantastic.
Paul,"Thank you. it's in Pittsburgh. That was one of my early road trips and I really wasn't expecting much. When I set out I thought, I'll never be able to do anything good, so I'll just have fun, and see the country a bit. But then I saw this guy cutting the grass. It's kind of perfect that his shirt is a riff on the American flag too."
Interviewer,"What I like about the work is that you are clearly dissatisfied with the confines of traditional documentary but you haven't made the jump, as so many do, to video. You haven't given into temptations...."
Paul,"... like staging my work. I've never wanted to become a filmmaker. I've always seen the two major tropes in photography as the studio and the street. And I'm a street person. I don't get tired of trying to understand and look at the wonderful amazing nature of what's around us. Yes, I have dissatisfaction with classic documentary language. It was wonderful when it was invented. But it has to be alive, to grow, develop, just like the spoken word. We don't speak the same way we spoke in 1938 or 1956, so why should we make pictures the same way?"
Interviewer,"But the dissatisfaction of others, particularly with the narrative limitations of photography, has led them to add sound or moving image sequences. You seem determined, and happy, to stay within the boundaries."
Paul,"Well, some might see these books as leading toward building a narrative."
Interviewer,Clearly.
Paul,"Part of this is about the new flexibility of digital photography. You are able to shoot and shoot and then look at everything on screen. The technology does liberate people. You can get remarkable quality, close to 4×5, working on the street."
Interviewer,But you are clearly an outsider and we never learn much about these people.
Paul,"I have no problem with that. I don't want to feign being intimate with somebody I meet 5 minutes ago. I accept and embrace that so much in life is ""ships passing in the dark."" The world is comprised of 99.9% strangers."
Interviewer,"Is that what you don't like about photojournalism, the pretense of intimacy that is there?"
Paul,"It's undoubtedly there in some photojournalism. But I have more problems with the motives and uses of photojournalism , the clichéd stories they tell, or the way photography is used to service a written story. There is of course some great and rare exceptions that far exceed this criticism, but we have to be honest"
Interviewer,Let's move backward. Who were the important photographers to you when you were starting out in England?
Paul,"The important photographers for me belong in that period from 1966 to 1976, mostly American, let's say from ""New Documents"" to ""New Topographics"". It was a profound creative period for photography. Szarkowski at MoMA radicalized things for photographers by creating an artistic territory to operate in that wasn't there before. Before, you were either an editorial photographer working for magazines in a semi-documentary style, or a fine-art photographer making pictures of landscapes or nudes or rocks. He swept aside that division and showed that people like Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand were making the most profound photographic work of our time, and though it looked like 'documentary,' it was far more than that, and it didn't belong in magazines, but in museums. This was transformative"
Interviewer,How was that work translated for a man growing up in England?
Paul,"When I became aware of it in the mid 70s, it was through books. Hence my great emphasis on books in my work. Reading Public Relations, and the Diane Arbus monograph and Lee Friedlander books, was very important. I didn't get Robert Frank at first, because it seemed almost photojournalistic, but strangely I got Eggleston right away."
Interviewer,I went on the dole.
Paul,"It was an instinctual rather than an intellectual understanding. The first thing I saw of his was a promotional pamphlet for Election Eve. A friend came back from the states, and he gave me this brochure with six pictures in it. I was struck by his elliptical, tangential approach. So elegant and beautiful."
Interviewer,So you were taking pictures by then?
Paul,"I learned how a camera works early on, maybe even in the Scouts... but there was no concept of what you could do with it. Seeing the work of Winogrand or Friedlander was like the proverbial light going on. The fact that you could say something profound about the world through photographs was a life-changing revelation."
Interviewer,"That's a bold leap to make right out of the box, from the Scouts to understanding a Winogrand or Friedlander photograph."
Paul,"Well there were a few years between the two! I wouldn't claim to understand everything about Winogrand's work, though essays like Tod Papageorge's in Public Relations are wonderful reading for anyone who cares about photography. One of the great things about this medium is that you don't need to have an academic degree to get it; photography can be so visceral, it cuts right through language that way."
Interviewer,Did you go out and try to take Eggleston pictures?
Paul,"Well, yes and no... (Laughs.) ... the great open road journey photography doesn't translate that well to the United Kingdom. It's not that big. What I adapted was an amalgam of Eggleston and Robert Adams, and put that together with the classic British obsession with Social Critique. It became my own mash-up, if you will."
Interviewer,Did you realize that you could have a career?
Paul,"A ""career"", god no! Sadly I belong to that naïve alternative culture of the 70s that rejected ""careers."" I did what most UK musicians and would-be rock stars did"
Interviewer,But if you're going to travel to Europe and Japan you must have figured out ways to support yourself.
Paul,"You sleep on friend's floors. I traveled in an old Mini - the original Mini - and I slept in the back of that for a long time. That was uncomfortable! I ate in truck driver's cafes, and had a friend who found out-of-date film for me. Then you do some teaching and get a small grant. The documentary-style tradition is very strong in England. Eventually I met up with Martin Parr, Chris Killip, Graham Smith, John Davis."
Interviewer,"A1, Beyond Caring, and Troubled Land, driven by the boundless energy of youth, no doubt... but by 1987, we had this juggernaut of color documentary photography emerging in England; it had really taken off. Martin Parr switched to color, so did people like Tom Wood, and then our students, like Paul Seawright or Richard Billingham or Nick Waplington came along. So... I felt it was time to move on from that, before it became exhausted. For example, the mixing of landscape with war photography in Troubled Land was striking and quite successful , I had shows in NYC galleries, but what happens is that you hit this resonant note and everyone wants you to repeat it. I was invited to duplicate Troubled Land in Israel and South Africa. Commissions, dollars, travel, the whole nine yards. But I thought, I can't do this. For better or worse, I'm one of those artists who once something is ""proven,"" have to drop it and find another way to scare myself."
Paul,In the early to mid 80s I had made friends with a group of German photographers who were quite distinct from the Becher's Dusseldorf school. They were mostly around Essen-Berlin
Interviewer,It's funny that that school is so unknown here. Michael Schmidt even had a one-man show at MoMA.
Paul,"Yes, a great show and few remember it. It's as though the Gursky show wiped out people's under-standing of everything else in German Photography. Gursky is much more accessible. He goes for the jugular because it is about the 'Great Photograph.' Of course, he succeeds, but it's recidivist, in a way. Photographers have been trying for years to make bodies of work where images work together to build up a coherent statement. It's not about one great picture by Robert Adams; it's about twenty or thirty pictures that form a sensitive, intelligent reflection of the world. It's the same with Garry Winogrand, or Robert Frank. Gursky brings it back to that ""wow"" moment. It sort of undoes that way of working, and reduces things to the ""What a great shot!"" appreciation of photography. I'm a sucker for that as much as anyone, but want people to appreciate what Robert Adams does more so."
Interviewer,So you were hanging out with these guys and going back and forth to Europe?
Paul,"I actually lived in England most of the time, but I would go stay with Volker in Essen or visit Michael in Berlin. I lived in Berlin one summer; actually one photograph in New Europe is inside Michael's apartment. We all came and went. It was a reciprocal thing. Somehow I went from being part of this English group with Martin Parr et al, to being an honorary member of this German alliance. They became much more relevant to my way of working and seeing the world. My work grew quite a bit, as all of ours did in that grouping, and when it was finished, in 1992, I released the book New Europe. That was made for the opening exhibition for the Fotomuseum Winterthur in Switzerland, but the book was never distributed here in the U.S. so it's not so well known. Gerry Badger insisted it be included in The Photobook II so at least someone saw it."
Interviewer,"One of the paradoxes of our time, and I've discussed this with many people, is this explosion of photography books at the same time as the explosion in new media. Every photographer has his or her own website and gets their information on-line. And yet they all still want to make books. What is the enduring appeal?"
Paul,"John Gossage made a great comment that his books are the original work. It's the summation of one's endeavors, the book is the work. Now, a painter or a sculptor can have a catalogue of their work but... it's completely different in photography. It is the exact thing, maybe a little smaller scale, but with a one-on-one dialogue when you read it. Looking at a Nan Goldin book is quite different from viewing her photographs on the wall with other people around you. The book is personal and direct, from the artist to you, complete and faithful."
Interviewer,"That's true. When you're looking at images on-line, it's a much more public experience than with a book. You're part of a community and reading in a public square when you go to your computer."
Paul,"Yes, you're right. It's something I wonder about with A Shimmer of Possibility. Am I diffusing that intimate experience by doing twelve books with Steidl? Or am I taking it to the maximum degree by separating each piece of work into its own volume, allowing each story to have that precious moment of intimacy with you? So much art relies on the confidence transaction. I know this is different, doing ten or twelve books. I know it seems crazy, but I'm asking you to trust me and enjoy this quiet journey. Just slow down and look at this ordinary moment of life. See how beautiful it is, see how life flows around us, how everything shimmers with possibility."
Interviewer,What should entrepreneurs think about to start company?
Paul,"Think about finding the right co-founder. He compared co-founder of your company to location to your real estate property because once you buy your property, you're stuck with the location. And similarly you can't morph your co-founder. ""The (startup) idea does not matter as much as having the right co-founder.""."
Interviewer,What makes a startup successful?
Paul,Success of a start up is dependent upon whether co-founders want it enough.
Interviewer,What is the biggest challenge for early stage startup?
Paul,"The enemy is the ""back button."" Once people leave they don't come back. In order to get people to return and install your product or a service, ""You got to understand what people need."" And you do that by finding out what people need, what you need need.You've got to create something that a real person needs."
Interviewer,Is starting a company easy these days?
Paul,"The startups are cheap in the beginning, considering that founders don't have to pay them selves. And everything you need to do a start up you already have. Computer, internet, and you can buy server per usage. So it doesn't really cost anything more to do a start up than ordinary life."
Interviewer,What is the right time to start looking for money?
Paul,"You should only start looking for money when you can convince investors to give it to you. In fact, raise money when you don't particularly need it and not because you are broke."
Interviewer,Do you feel some start ups don't think big enough?
Paul,"Some startups don't think big enough, while some do. Paul in an email later clarified:."
Interviewer,"I'm intrigued by the title of the exhibition, a reference to Moby Dick, especially to Ahab's mad quest."
Paul,"I like to think it points the viewer in a direction. I don't want to pin down what that direction is, except to say it can be thought of as a metaphor for the United States in action for instance, the pursuit of one thing to the exclusion of all others, even to the destruction of yourself and your society. Of course, in America whiteness is also a metaphor."
Interviewer,"It does raise the question for me of why you took up residence here, like Jonah in the belly of the whale."
Paul,"A variety of reasons, but the main one was I felt that photography wasn't valued very highly in England. I remember in the early 1980s seeing a review of a Garry Winogrand show in The New York Times that covered two-thirds of a page. And the other third was devoted to a review of Boris Mikhailov. The level of presumed knowledge about photography was so high I couldn't quite believe it. I thought, this is where I belong."
Interviewer,"It seems to me that your style changed somewhat when you began shooting a shimmer of possibility. With The Great North Road, 1981-82, you could be seen as a sociologist of Thatcher England and its discontents. In the United States, your work seems more openended, even puzzling sometimes."
Paul,"I suppose it is more open-ended. In England there is no such thing as the infinite highway, the Kerouacian open road, but I wasn't on the road in the same sense as Robert Frank. I wasn't on a quest for freedom or for the essential truth about America. It's more that I was wandering randomly through suburban America, looking to find something in nothing. At one point I found myself laughing because I was in a car park somewhere, and I realized I was in the same spot as I was 25 years earlier, in Yorkshire, alone in a car park."
Interviewer,"Something in nothing that resonates for me because so many of my students are seeking the same thing. It's the shimmer you talk about, that thing that the camera hovers around, the experience you feel and know but can't fully articulate; a testament to being."
Paul,"It's that point when things, time, and circumstance come together, rich with cognitive potential. It's reality looked at directly, with a kind of amazement. It's often hard to say what the pictures are actually about because there is a provisional-ness to them. They refuse to kowtow to a narrative line, never crippling potential readings. Rather, they hint at a way of seeing, instruct us on how to perceive; that is the source of their consultability. I am pleased that young people are photographing nothing again."

Paul,The ambitious upstart part?
Interviewer,Yeah.
Paul,"Well, what I was thinking when I heard it is, ""Oh, good. This is my kind of place.""."
Interviewer,"Oh, good."
Paul,I wasn't thinking about whether it was a particularly good marketing tagline.
Interviewer,"Oh, good. Then if you think it's your kind of place, then it is a good tagline for me."
Paul,"Yeah, ambitious and upstart, that's exactly what I'm looking for."
Interviewer,"Perfect. As I told you earlier, I'm going to be structuring this as the biography of Y-Combinator and along the way, I'd like to see what you've learned as you funded, I think it's 172 startups, you told me."
Paul,"One hundred and seventy-two, yeah."
Interviewer,"Wow. Well, let's start off with the essay since that's how many entrepreneurs get to know you. Why did you start writing about entrepreneurship?"
Paul,"Well, I write about whatever I'm thinking about. So I just started thinking about entrepreneurship. I think that started because I had to give a talk to the Undergraduate Computer Society at Harvard. In fact, that's what Y-Combinator grew out of. So I had to give a talk to these undergrads and I thought, ""What shall I tell them?"" What could I tell? So I thought, ""All right. I'll tell them how to start a startup."" So I gave this talk about how to start a startup and I put it online later as an essay called, ""How to Start a Startup."" That Y-Combinator literally grew out of that talk."
Interviewer,What happened? How does a talk become a revolution?
Paul,"Well, what happened was I was giving them advice, sort of in real time, that they should raise money from angels. The best thing was to raise money from angels who had themselves made their money from doing a startup because then they could give you advice, as well as money. And I noticed all these guys were looking at me sort of expectantly, in fact, sort of like baby birds. I thought, ""Jesus, they're all going to email me their business plans."" So I said, ""Not me."" Right? Because I had never done any angel investing at that point and I didn't want to start. But then I immediately felt guilty."
Interviewer,"Who are the original startups that were so good, were so inspiring, that you said, ""I've got to back these guys""?"
Paul,"Well, Reddit, the founders of Reddit were at that talk. They came on a train from Virginia."
Interviewer,"From Virginia, they told me, that they got over to see you."
Paul,That's a long train ride. So I was impressed by their determination. That was actually why we funded them because they were so determined that they came on the train all the way from Virginia to hear that talk.
Interviewer,"What else was it about them? Because I'm sure there are a lot of people now who will come and travel a long way to see you and they don't have that magic. But I talked to Alexis and he said that you didn't like his original business idea, but you liked something about him to bring him back. And I asked him what it was that Paul Graham saw in him, and he couldn't define it. So now that I've got you here, what is it about him? Maybe from there we can extrapolate."
Paul," Steve. He and Steve were both smart, and they were determined, and they seemed flexible. They seemed like they really wanted to start a startup. But it's a little bit misleading to ask what I liked because Jessica, her nickname in Y-Combinator is The Social Radar. I actually have bad judgment of character. I'm not good at judging people. Really, I'm kind of bad at it. I know I'm bad at it. But Jessica, she is very rarely wrong. There will be somebody I meet and I really like, and she says, ""You know, there's something off about him."" And it always turns out she's right, always. So I've learned, like when Jessica says, ""These people are good,"" or ""These people are bad,"" I should really listen. A lot of people don't realize."
Interviewer,"Okay. Let's pause here and go back a little bit and talk about the people who started Y-Combinator with you. In that talk, you said that it's important to get the right team together. On your team, it sounds like from the start you had Jessica Livingston, who was an investment banker at Adams Harkness before. You had Robert Morris, who was your partner at Viaweb and a long time friend."
Paul,And Trevor Blackwell. He worked on Viaweb too.
Interviewer,"Oh, Trevor Blackwell from Viaweb also."
Paul,"Yeah, it was basically the same three people from Viaweb."
Interviewer,"Oh, so Jessica Livingston was at Viaweb with the three of you? I'm sorry, we had a little bit of a lag. Was Jessica Livingston . . ."
Paul,"No, no. No, she was not."
Interviewer,"Okay, so was it three of you?"
Paul,"Right, yeah."
Interviewer,"How did you find Jessica Livingston, and what was it about her?"
Paul,I was  her.
Interviewer,Sorry?
Paul,I was going out with her.
Interviewer,How did she go from girlfriend to partner?
Paul,"Well, when we were going to start . . . we were going to start investing. And we didn't know anything about the logistics of investing. She had one of these weird securities licenses. I think it's called a Series 7, or something like that. She actually knows about this whole world. To this day, I have only skimmed our legal agreements. But she keeps this stuff in line. She knows how to do the mechanics of investing and we didn't know how to do it. If it hadn't been  just the three of us, we would have never started this ourselves because who would have done all that crap. Or, sorry, who would have done all that very important work?"
Interviewer,Okay. So now you got to know her. What about Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell? What did they bring to the partnership?
Paul,"They're very smart. I mean, they're the smartest people I know. They've done the startup themselves. I mean, they have basically the same experience I do, in the same companies, and I can work with them. And Robert is our sys admin."
Interviewer,I'm sorry?
Paul,Robert is our sys admin.
Interviewer,I see.
Paul,We're probably the only company that has a full professor at MIT as their grumpy sys admin.
Interviewer,"All right. So let's go back then. Jessica Livingston sees these guys. She says, ""I like them, there's something about them. Let's invest.""."
Paul,Do you mean the Reddits?
Interviewer,"The Reddits, right. Yes, so you guys bring them in. What kind of structure, what kind of support system did you have back then?"
Paul,"It was pretty much the same as now. That very first summer. The reason we decided to invest in startups in batches all at once was because we didn't know what we were doing, and so we thought, ""Well, you know what we'll do? We'll have a summer program."" I don't know if you have a programming background, but everybody treats summer jobs as kind of throw-away jobs as a programmer. You're not expected to get a lot done. It's just so the company can decide later if they want to hire you after you graduate."
Interviewer,What kind of help did you give them as you were doing this? I know about the weekly dinners that Alexis Ohanian said that he got a lot out of. I know that the entrepreneurs got to talk to each other and show each other their progress. What else did you do to support them along the way?
Paul,"We got all their paperwork done. And we got them set up cleanly, so if there was some weird gotcha about the IP, like they had started working on the thing with their previous employer, we would tell them, ""No, rewrite that code."" So by the time they got to the end, at demo day, they were like a clean start out, with no weird gotchas that would make investors barf, like former co-founders who were gone, but still had 30% of the company, or they didn't own their IP, or someone hadn't signed some agreement or something like that. And they were properly incorporated as Delaware C-corps instead of whatever broken LLC they came in with. All that stuff is not nothing. That's actually the kind of stuff Jessica does."
Interviewer,"How did you do that? That's another thing that Alexis told me, that the idea for Reddit came from you and a lot of the entrepreneurs who you have backed have told me ."
Paul,"The idea for Reddit was a combination of us and them, okay? We told them we didn't like their original idea and we said, ""Come back and we'll talk about other ideas,"" right? But we didn't say, ""Look, here is a wireframe. Build this.""."
Interviewer,"I see, right. You said, ""Here's an idea, go run with it."" And they did go out there, and actually it was an idea that you guys came up with together?"
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,But you led them in the direction.
Paul,"But they came back. When they came back from the next day and we talked for quite a long time the next day, and we cooked up something in that. I called them on the phone and said, ""We loved you guys, even though we rejected you. If you come back, we'll figure out something new for you to do.""."
Interviewer,"I see. So how do you do that? I mean, yes, you did create one of the early web apps. Yes, you did create Viaweb, and you saw it all the way through to a sale to Yahoo, and you got to see the inside of a big company like Yahoo. But that still doesn't seem like enough experience to be able to sit down with an entrepreneur and say, ""Here, I'm going to help guide you in that direction."" What else was it?"
Paul,"I have a weird ability to do this, or something like that. I don't know why. But I often worry that it will stop working. But it's almost like some weird knack that people have. Like people who can tell you that December 21st, 1960 was a Tuesday, you know what I mean?"
Interviewer,Okay. So what did you learn from that first class? What did you learn from that first experience of working with a batch of entrepreneurs on new companies?
Paul,"We learned a lot of stuff. We learned some of these we had done by accident were really good. Like funding a whole bunch of startups at once is really good because they can all help one another. We learned that young people can actually successfully start startups. I think in how to start a startup, I said, ""You should probably be like 24, or 25, or something like that before starting a startup."" Some of these guys in that first Y-Combinator batch . . . Sam Altman was 19 and he was the best startup in the batch. So lo and behold, you can start a startup even younger than we thought. Which is not to say that is the only age you want to start a startup, but the age range of potentially successful startups extends frighteningly low."
Interviewer,"I think, actually, you said that the cutoff was 38 and you're over 38, running essentially a startup with Y-Combinator. How do you . . ."
Paul,"No, I'm not. There's one big difference between Y-Combinator and a product company. We do not have customers who can call us any random time because something is breaking. And that is what makes a startup so hard. The closest thing I have to that is Hacker News, but if Hacker News is down for a day, it wouldn't be the end of the world. Whereas Viaweb was down for like 10-minutes, we would have a lot of really angry people calling us. So there's a big difference. I can go on vacation. A startup founder cannot go on vacation because who's going to watch things?"
Interviewer,"I see. I happen to know that the guys from Airbnb prided themselves on getting as many minutes of your time as they could while you were building out their product. But you're saying there's a limit to when they could call you. If they had a question in the middle of the night, at 2:00, they'd have to wait till the next day to call you."
Paul,"Yeah, I mean, the kind of questions that founders ask me are not usually the kind of things that have to be answered at 2:00 a.m.. Sometimes they are, like if someone's getting acquired, or something like that. But even then, M&A guys aren't doing stuff  the morning."
Interviewer,"Right, and it's not breaking at 2:00, well, it might, but not often."
Paul,"Yeah, what can happen at 2:00 a.m. are like usually technical problems."
Interviewer,"All right. So let's talk about, then, the second group of people. What did you do differently as you were assembling that group?"
Paul,"Well, the second batch, the biggest, most obvious thing that was different was we were in California. We decided in our second batch that we would try doing one in California, partly because it's much nicer in California in the winter. So we could be self-indulgent and also ambitious at the same time. So we decided we didn't want somebody to say, ""We're going to be the Y-Combinator of Silicon Valley,"" right? After we'd started it because we could kind of see pretty early on people would start copying us. In fact, I'm kind of surprised it took as long as it did. But we didn't want somebody to say, ""We're the Y-Combinator of Silicon Valley."" We wanted to be the Y-Combinator of Silicon Valley. So we thought, ""All right. We'll do a batch out in Silicon Valley.""."
Interviewer,This is .
Paul, did we do? What else did we do differently?
Interviewer,Yeah.
Paul,"Not that much else, really. I mean, it was in the winter, so there was no question of it being a summer job for people."
Interviewer,"Did you get the sense, by then, of the kind of entrepreneur you wanted, that maybe there was a kind of entrepreneur that you thought you wanted but wasn't a good fit? Was there ?"
Paul,"We were getting better. We gradually got better. And we're still not very good, even though we're much better than we were when we first started. But we started to learn, for example, that it mattered a lot how much people actually wanted to do a startup. People who really did think of it just as a summer job at the end of the summer, they would go back to school, just like people do at a summer job. So we were starting to learn determination was the most important thing."
Interviewer,"How can you find determination? How can you know that somebody is determined for real, and not just, ""This is it. I've got to . . . "" It's not just a temporary thing?"
Paul,"That's actually our single hardest problem, telling how determined people are. I mean, there are two things we care about"
Interviewer,What kind of things does an entrepreneur do to fool you into thinking that they're really determined?
Paul,"Well, seeming really tough and calm during the interview. Why am I telling people ?"
Interviewer,"Because you guys are going to get better and as long as this information is out there, you might as well get it all the way out there and even the playing field."
Paul,"That's the danger of live interviews. Matt Maroon of Blue Frog Gaming, he was a professional poker player, I mean, talk about poker-faced. So he came in for his interview and he just seemed absolutely unflappable. We thought, ""Boy, this guy is tough. This guy is not a wimp."" And actually, we were right. He was really tough. But to this day, he is genuinely unflappable, and I probably would want to fund more people who are really good poker players. I've noticed, empirically, there seems to be a high correlation between playing poker and being a successful startup founder."
Interviewer,"But then that's not fooling you, that's just . . ."
Paul,That's how you seem to tell.
Interviewer,"He had a calm, strong presence about him. What else? Did they tell you specific stories about the time that they sold candy in elementary school?"
Paul,"Oh, yes. Actually, that's a good one, if people have evidence of their determination. For example the Airbnb guys, at one point they were running out of money in their startup. They'd been working on their startup for quite a while before Y-Combinator. I think maybe around a year or the bulk of a year. At one point, they were out of money, and they made their own packaged breakfast cereal with an Obama and McCain theme. You could buy either one, and we were like . . . yeah, yeah. I have a box of Obama-Os on the shelf behind me, in fact. I'll tell you, I think they made like $30,000. They designed the box ."
Interviewer,"They designed it, they sold it."
Paul," Yeah. You know, as soon as we heard that story, they were in, basically. There's often a point in the interview where we all kind of look at one another and decide, ""Okay. We're funding these guys."" At that point, the remainder of the interview, we're just chatting. As soon as we heard that story it was all over. They were in."
Interviewer,"What about Kevin Hale and the Wufoo guys? They also had similar experiences, didn't they?"
Paul,Yeah.
Interviewer,What drew you to them?
Paul,"They had Particletree. They had made Particletree, and I knew Particletree. I don't know how I knew it, but I knew about this website and I knew it was really good. So I knew they could make good things. They were not just thinking, ""Oh, maybe we'll start a startup."" And then a few months later, they'll say, ""Oh, maybe we won't."" Right? Obviously, they had some practice doing projects together and they could work well together."
Interviewer,I see. So maybe one of the ways . . .
Paul,The Wufoo guys were terribly nervous during their interview.
Interviewer,Were they?
Paul,"Yeah. Oh, they were so nervous. I mean, we try everything we can to make people calm during the interview. Now we have people waiting outside, talking calmly to them before the interview because we don't want people to be flustered during the interview. Our goal is not to try and break them. If people are nervous, all it does is add noise to the interview. We need all the signal strength we can get so we want people to be calm. But the Wufoos were only our second batch. We didn't have anything to help people be calm or we didn't write these instructions about how to ace your interview or anything like that."
Interviewer,"There's another situation where Kevin told me that he had one vision for what he wanted to do and you had another. You said, ""Oh, what you're looking to build are forms."" And he said, ""No, not forms. Forms are these ugly things that don't make sense. Nobody wants to be in the form business."" And he said, ""No, Paul Graham said this is the opportunity."" In fact, he said, I think that the guys at Y-Combinator, he didn't just say you, but the people sitting across the table from him helped him come up with the idea."
Paul,In the interview?
Interviewer,Yes.
Paul,"It often happens that the idea for the startup gets crystallized even in that 10-minute interview. What we do in the interview, we don't ask, ""So where do you see yourself in five years?"" Or, ""Why are manhole covers round?"" Or some crap like that. I mean, what we do in the interview is we just start doing Y-Combinator. The first 10-minutes of Y-Combinator is the 10-minutes of the interview. So if we like a group, we just start. ""Okay. What about this idea? What about this? You've tried this."" And that's why people come out of the interview thinking, ""Oh, my god. They asked us so many questions.""."
Interviewer,"I see. How do you know if the business idea is going to be big enough? How do you know if there's enough money in the form business? How do you know if there's enough of a market around Reddit, or do you even know that?"
Paul,"We don't. We don't know that, and we don't worry about that, that early. We don't care that much about the idea. I mean, it would be bad if it were an obviously terrible idea. Like, start a new search engine with no features that are any different from Google. If someone was determined to do that as their idea, we would reject it. Okay? Actually, they'd be stupid. We should reject them. But unless it's an obviously terrible idea, it's not the idea that's important. At this stage, we care about the founders. We're going to have three months to figure out the perfect  to the idea."
Interviewer,"Okay. Did you, by the way, get into search? I think you did. One of your startups was going to get into search, or . . ."
Paul,"It's okay if people are doing a search that's not exactly the same thing as Google. So for example, Octopart does electronic parts search. Those guys are really good, so that's search. There's a startup in the current batch that hasn't launched yet, or at least hasn't outed themselves, what I see as doing search. But again, that's a specific vertical. That's okay. That's fine."
Interviewer,"Okay. Yeah, and web . . . I never know how to pronounce them, even though I use this."
Paul,WebMynd.
Interviewer,"WebMynd, that's how you pronounce them? Web M-Y-N-D, of course. WebMynd."
Paul,"They don't do search themselves. Well, they do sort of do search. Yeah, they put search over on the right-hand side of Google Search."
Interviewer,"Yeah, they enhance Google Search."
Paul,"Yeah, yeah. Okay, so they do search."
Interviewer,Okay.
Paul,"That's funny, I thought of them as this plug-in for Google, but they do actually have to do some amount of search to make that work."
Interviewer,"Okay. I don't want to stay too much on Wufoo, but I know them best because I've used them for years. So let's continue there. You decided to back them. Did you have, at the time, an idea for an exit, or did you say, ""This is an interesting . . . ""."
Paul,No.
Interviewer,"No. What was your thinking in the future, here?"
Paul," take care of themselves. It's so impossible to predict something like that. You know, the founders themselves don't know. I mean, think of all the stories about . . . like Larry and Sergey. They founded this company and it's worth something like $200 billion. I don't know what Google's market cap is, but it's gigantic. When they first started out, they were walking around to the existing search engines, trying to sell the technology to them for a couple million. So if the founders themselves can be off by many orders of magnitude about the exit, it's stupid to even think about it. You just want to fund people who are good, and some of them will go public, and some of them will just explode on the starting line, and there's not much you can do about it."
Interviewer,"Okay. So then they went through the program, they had a product at the end. And then you and Paul Buchheit invested in them. At that point, did you say, ""Now I see an exit for myself. Now I see that these guys can go public or be sold""? Is it important there?"
Paul,"No, . Even then you can't predict exits. They really are genuinely unpredictable. It's better just to not think about it."
Interviewer,"To just say, ""This is a good business, I see it growing. I'll support them.""."
Paul,"Yeah, these guys are good. If they have some kind of exit at some point in the future, it'll be good for them. We're all in the same boat. We have the same kind of stock. So you have to assume that if they do something that's good for them, it'll be good for you too."
Interviewer,"Okay. All right. So let's suppose somebody's listening to this, and says, ""Man, Paul Graham is incredible. He can help shape an idea, he can help draw out the best in you. I don't have Paul Graham in my neighborhood."" Or, ""Maybe I'm too old to fit the criteria."" Or, ""Maybe I just want to fund my business myself. How can I find somebody like Paul Graham?""."
Paul,"Well, the first two don't matter. You don't have Paul Graham in your neighborhood. Most of the people who do Y-Combinator don't come from the Bay area. They come from all over. They come from all over the world. So that doesn't matter. And the thing about age, that doesn't matter either. We funded a bunch of people over 40. I don't think we've ever funded anyone over 50, but some of the most successful startups have been funded by people over 40."
Interviewer,"I see. A lot of people don't have this gift. A lot of people can't, if you bring them an idea, rattle off a solution. I watched Jason Calacanis on This Week in Startup. Some guy will call up with an idea and he'll kind of bat the idea back and forth with them and brainstorm until there's something that's fundable there. I don't know a lot of people who can do that. How do you find those people?"
Paul,"You know, I don't know. I don't know."
Interviewer,How important do you think it is to have that ?  Paul
Paul,"Well, whenever you're writing an essay, you don't want to just do a lot of hand-waving and never get to the point. My goal in writing any essay is to make the strongest statement that you can make without being false."
Interviewer,"And are you also trying to find formulas? Is there a formula here that people could apply? Could say, ""Look, this is a guy who has now worked with 177 startups."" Did I get that right, or 172?"
Paul,One hundred and seventy-two.
Interviewer,"One hundred and seventy-two. Let me make that clear on my paper. ""He probably knows the formula at this point, or if he doesn't, when he hits 372 he'll have the formula."" Do you agree at that point, there will be one?"
Paul,"No, no. There is not a formula, like an itemized list of stuff we could suggest to people, ""Do this, do that."" Startups vary."
Interviewer,"I see. Okay, all right. Let's take a look at some of the questions that people have put up on Hacker News. Max Cline has asked me about your personality. I've noticed it here too. Are you always this calm? Do you lose it?"
Paul,"No, I'm not always this calm. But I saw that question too and he asked if I threw chairs. No, I definitely don't throw chairs. If I'm really mad, I'll just sort of talk coldly to someone. Like this."
Interviewer,"I see. I've heard people . . . here's the thing. A lot of entrepreneurs are now studying you for years. They're in this community. You're the leader of this Hacker News community of entrepreneurs who are developers. If you don't like their ideas or disapprove of their progress, or if they perceive that either of those are true, they're hurt. I've talked to a few people who felt that way. What are you noticing?"
Paul,"Did it help when I disapproved? Did it seem like a wake-up call, or did it merely depress them?"
Interviewer,I don't know. I know that . . .
Paul,"Well, there's a big difference. I mean, if it's a wake-up call, that's good. And if it merely depresses them, then that's bad."
Interviewer,"Well, I don't know that I can make sweeping generalizations. I haven't had that many conversations like that."
Paul,"Well, when you find out, let me know. I'm trying to get better at this."
Interviewer,You are? Are you actively trying to get better at the way that you communicate with them?
Paul,"Oh, yes."
Interviewer,How? What have you done that helps you communicate with them better? How do you bring out the best in people?
Paul,"Well, one thing I've been trying to figure out is how to tell which people to keep nagging and which people to give up on. Because there are some people when basically we made a mistake. There's always going to be some, we get to demo day, and we know they're not going to raise money, and they probably know they're not going to raise money, and they're going to go back and get jobs."
Interviewer,Really?
Paul,"Really, yeah."
Interviewer,You still consider yourself bad at it?
Paul,"Oh, god, yes. Yes, we think of ourselves as just utterly terrible at picking startups."
Interviewer,Why? What's bad about the . . .
Paul,"Because no hard choices are always wrong, that's why. We have tons of evidence about bad we are."
Interviewer,What do you mean? What's your percentage of bad companies to good ones would you say?
Paul,"At least a third are just disasters. In the venture business, generally, a lot of the investments are failures. Even a venture fund, which has a lot more at stake and spends a lot more effort on due diligence than our 10-minute interviews, even a venture fund, half the investments will be failures. So everyone in the venture business is bad. Maybe if we had more experience in the venture business, we would take this badness for granted and think, ""Oh, well, actually, we're really good if only a third of our investments are miserable failures."" But we're not in the venture business and so it seems intolerable. We're so often fooled."
Interviewer,"So the four of you might sit around, maybe with some entrepreneurs and try to bat around ideas about why that third didn't work out."
Paul,"Amongst ourselves, amongst ourselves. We talk about startups that we picked that we're really glad we picked, and we say, ""How do we recognize more people like that?"" There are startups we were fooled by, and we think, ""How do we stop being fooled in the future?"" You know? We learned a lot from interviewing Wufoo. We learned how to tell the difference between people who are nervous and people who are lame. And we were figuring that out in that interview. So we get better from practice."
Interviewer,Okay. What about the bad ones? What have you noticed that is disastrous? What kind of people?
Paul,Wimps.
Interviewer,Wimps.
Paul,"Yeah, it takes a ."
Interviewer,What's a wimp look like?
Paul,"They have a certain body language. You should really ask Jessica. Jessica is the expert at telling when people are going to wimp out. She's so much more sensitive to this. She has a much more natural ability. When we were writing code in college, she was judging people's characters. So both by nature and training, she's so much better than I am. If I want to know if someone's a wimp, basically, the high bit is ask Jessica. She's the one who will tell you."
Interviewer,"I do have to have her here on Mixergy. I don't know if you know, back when I had a bookcase behind me for I guess the first year of doing these interviews, I often put her book behind me, ""Founders at Work,"" knowing that if somebody saw my interview and recognized ""Founders at Work,"" even though the cover was a little blurry, and it was hidden behind . . . well, it wasn't hidden. It was out there, but it was a little hard to see. If they recognized it, and they loved it, then they're the kind of people I want in my tribe here in Mixergy."
Paul,"Yeah, same with us. Actually, that book was . . . I mean, the way she chose who to interview for that book was who we ourselves wanted to hear the stories of."
Interviewer,"How did that factor into Y-Combinator, the book itself?"
Paul," She was working on ""Founders at Work"" before we started Y-Combinator. The book came before Y-Combinator, and it was part of the reason we started it. That was one of the reasons I was thinking about startups so much because, for a long time, I didn't think that much about startups. I was working at programming languages and then spam filters. But I was talking to her about it for that."
Interviewer,"I see, so she was telling you what she saw. What was it about that that inspired you to look into startups? What was it about the stories that she was collecting?"
Paul,"It wasn't so much the specific stories. She hadn't done a lot of interviews yet, but she was sort of thinking about this book when we were talking about whom she might go and interview. So we were just talking a lot about what startups are really like. And she didn't know what startups were really like. For example, one of the big mistakes that people make about startups, people out in the regular world, and even founders, to some extent, they think it starts because there's some brilliant idea, and success is fore-destined. I told her, ""No, the idea changes a lot. People start out, they're not even sure they want to start a company.""."
Interviewer,"Is that how you met? Well, no, she didn't come to . . . you met her before she even wrote the book."
Paul,"Oh, yeah. I think we'd been dating for over a year before YC got started."
Interviewer,"Okay. I'm going to go to another question from Max Cline. He asks a lot of interesting questions here. Saying, ""If Y-Combinator company becomes a lifestyle company, can you guys still profit from the business, or do you need a ?"
Paul,"No. I mean, there's got to be an exit for equity holders to get any money. I mean, maybe in the future there's some model where companies pay dividends instead of an exit, but we've never tried to get anybody to do that. We don't have any real hopes about it, so no."
Interviewer,"Okay. So you're thinking when you're investing, you'd like to be able to sell out the company, you're personally invested  or go public."
Paul,"There's got to be some sort of liquidity and getting bought and going public are the two big forms of liquidity now. Although, there's evolution in this world. Look at Facebook. Facebook stock is now liquid. And they've neither been bought or got public. So who knows what will happen in the future. In that effect, there's no difference from us and anybody else doing venture investing. The only way to get any money out of this startup is some form of liquidity."
Interviewer,I see. Why the name Y-Combinator?
Paul,"It's a trick in the lambda calculus. It's a programming trick. I realized later that it was related to what we do, that the Y-Combinator is sort of self-referential in the way that Y-Combinator is. But, initially, I wanted to call it Y-Combinator just because I thought the Y-Combinator was a really cool thing. So it would be the perfect name for picking out the kind of people that we wanted. Hackers would look at this and think, ""That's so cool. They're named after the Y-Combinator. There must be something going on here."" And suits would look at it and think, ""Y-Combinator, what's that?"" That was what we wanted. We wanted hackers to notice us, and suits, we didn't care."
Interviewer,"I see. And apparently it's working. Well, I noticed you guys, but I didn't know what the meaning was. Actually, I got to be honest. I still don't understand it. I even saw it in Wikipedia before I did this interview. I probably would be the wrong person for you guys to back, then. I'm sure of that."
Paul,"No, the Y-Combinator is notoriously one of the most contorted ideas in computer science. It's the kind of thing you wouldn't even think that something like this would be possible. I, myself, I can't sit down and write out the Y-Combinator for you in lambda calculus. I have to look it up too. It's not the kind of thing you actually use day to day in programming very much. It's more of mathematical interest than practical interest."
Interviewer,"Okay. All right, what about this? All the companies that you guys back, within three months you're able to get this beautiful user experience. I always know instantly what they're about. I always can navigate them quickly, and they look beautiful, so beautiful that I'd be proud to show them as my own website if I own them. Within three months, you're able to do that. How do you do that? How do you get that user experience?"
Paul,"I mean, I nag them. Some of them are great already. But the ones that aren't great, I nag. I say, ""Look, people showing up at some website, they don't care about it as much as you, the founders, care about it. What you care about with most web apps is the person who shows up randomly. You don't care about the person who's already signed up for your service. They're already sold. All they need is a little login button up in the right-hand corner. So what you care about is the person who randomly clicks on your website and has their finger poised over the back button."" Just think how many websites you visit every day, and most of them are no good. You just click on back, and you go on with your life."
Interviewer,"But there's the curse of knowledge, as I think they said in the book ""Made to Stick"" that you've worked so hard on the site, you understand everything about it. To try to simplify it for somebody who's brand-new is really hard there. And then to do it all in such a short period of time, to figure out design, is tough."
Paul,"No. It's just like writing an essay. You have this big, complicated situation. You need to boil it down to its essentials. So I just look at the startup, and I think if I were writing something about it, how would I describe it. This is the essential thing. This is what they should say. We don't have a graphic designer on staff, although we've been thinking of it. We have a lawyer now. We have a lawyer on retainer, who fixes the startup's ordinary, everyday legal problems. That turns out to be huge. That is great. That has saved so much money and trouble. So we're thinking of getting a graphic designer on retainer too, but we just haven't got around to it yet."
Interviewer,"I notice that you have legal documents and you have had for a long time available to entrepreneurs documents that they can use for investors, and documents, I guess, that they use along that process. What about a set of documents for entrepreneurs who are just starting to team up, where they can help spread the ownership of the company properly, where they can ensure that they each own the IP."
Paul,We have that.
Interviewer,You do have that.
Paul," paperwork online. I mean, maybe it isn't. But I thought it was, I think it is. Yeah, I think it is."
Interviewer,Okay. So .
Paul," for starting a company, in the Series AA documents."
Interviewer,"I'm sorry. We just lost the connection for a little bit. So if I and this guy Wallflower on Hacker News decided to partner up because we like the way we've exchanged ideas here in the comments, we can go to Y-Combinator, get a legal document that we can use to split up ownership of the business, and then start working?"
Paul,I think so. I think so.
Interviewer,"I'll have to look, and if somebody in the chatroom knows, I'd love to see what you guys think of that. I'd love to see if you can find it, and maybe link us to it."
Paul,Go to Google and search for Series AA Y-Combinator. That's what it's called. Series AA.
Interviewer,"How do you find a partner? If you're just working on your own, and you're looking for somebody to team up with, how do you find that person?"
Paul,"You should work together with them. The two biggest ways people find co-founders is to go to school with them or to work with them at the same company because you don't really know what someone's going to be like until you've worked with them on stuff. They might seem smart, but they'll turn out to be flakes or something like that. So what I would tell people, I think having a co-founder is very important. We've seen tons of evidence of this. We do fund some number of single-founder startups and they do worse than startups in multiple founders."
Interviewer,"I see. So find somebody who you can maybe work with on a small project, maybe on Hacker News, maybe at a bar camp or some other event."
Paul,"The project you work with does not have to be the startup. It's just as well if it isn't because then you don't have to figure out how who's in charge of what, and how to split the intellectual property, and what to work on. Just work together with them on some open source projects for a couple months and then you'll know if they're good."
Interviewer,All right. Let's talk about Hacker News. Why did you launch Hacker News?
Paul,"Well, originally, I just wanted some kind of application to test this new programming language, Arc, on. If you're going to write a programming language, you ought to write some kind of application in it to make sure it's actually good for writing programs. So I wanted to write some kind of program in it and I had tried to convince the Reddits to create a sub-Reddit for startups. They were taking forever to make up their mind about what was the right way to implement sub-Reddits. They took a long time to figure out how to do sub-Reddits. They had  sub-Reddit first and that was a one-off. But general purpose sub-Reddits, where you could create about any topic, was much later."
Interviewer,"Was it to find news stories for yourself, or did you have a vision for what this community would do?"
Paul,"Well, we already had a whole bunch of YC founders at that point. We probably had 150, 200 founders. So we had this community of people who were interested in the same stories and they were the original users of startup news. It was like a news aggregator for those 200 people."
Interviewer,I see. Okay. And who's managing it now? Who's deciding what stories get killed? Who's the person behind . . .
Paul,"Me, me. There are a bunch of editors, but I spend . . . it's shocking. Probably one of the biggest surprises in my life is how much time gets sucked up by Hacker News. There's just so much crap. There's enormous amounts of spam, there's like 1001 varieties of semi-trolls, some of them well-meaning, some of them just crazy. God, they suck up a lot of time. The whole site just sucks up a lot of time. I try to automate as much as I can, but it's not that automatable."
Interviewer,"Is there a payoff in that, I mean in all the work that you're spending there?"
Paul,"Well, it's a great source of people applying to Y-Combinator, I think. I never tried to track it. But it means huge numbers of hackers spend every day looking at this little orange Y in the left-hand corner. That can't be bad. At least they know about us. At least people know about us. So I think it's good, but I've never actually tried to measure whether it's good. It's more like it just got started, and I got stuck into working on it, and now I spend too much time on it, but what am I going to do, shut it down? I don't really make any conscious decisions about it."
Interviewer,Who are the other editors?
Paul,"YC founders. I think there are around 30 of them. They're all people I know and trust, and they have good judgment and care about the site. But I'm not even sure, actually, who they are. I'm not sure which people are editors. There's something I can go and look at and see who the editors are, but I don't know."
Interviewer,"Okay. And if there's somebody who's stories automatically get killed, or specific sites that are automatically killed, that's probably you saying, ""No, I don't want this as part of my community.""."
Paul,"Sites getting killed, anyone can do. Actually, anyone can ban a user too. But usually most of the people who get banned, unless they're obvious spammers or trolls, like really egregious trolls who are obviously just think of themselves as trolls. Editors will ban them."
Interviewer,"Okay, okay. Can you say why certain sites get banned, even if they are in the hacker space, or in the news space? Are there certain things that you just don't want, certain kinds of stories that don't fit?"
Paul,"Well, most of the sites, the huge majority of the sites that are banned are just spammers. I don't think there are an awful lot of sites that are banned that are related to the stuff that gets talked about on Hacker News. We wouldn't ban a site unless it was . . . I think cracked.com was banned, for example because it's crap. It's deliberately created with fluff. I just doubt there's anything interesting on there that would engage some intellectual curiosity. But that's the kind of site that's not a spammer site that's actually banned. I'm not sure, though. It might not be banned. I'm not sure."
Interviewer,"Okay. All right. Finally, let me start asking you a little bit about my work, here. I love the community that you built there, that you built on Hacker News and around Y-Combinator and the influence it's had on this whole space. I feel like who do I want to reach, who do I really . . . I don't want to get a huge audience, I want to get the right audience. I'm looking at the people who care about your work and I'm saying, ""They, to me, are the right audience."" How can I serve that audience well, Paul, with my interviews?"
Paul,"Well, it seems like you are. Hacker news, from what you say, it sounds like Hacker News is identical with your audience. And you seem to be pretty popular on Hacker News so it seems like you're doing fine. I don't think there's anything you have to change dramatically."
Interviewer,"I have your kind of curiosity, though, about what it takes to build a successful company, and what the entrepreneurs are thinking of, and who they are. Do you have a sense of what you'd like to see, or how to bring that out of entrepreneurs?"
Paul,"Well, you want to ask different questions than news reporters generally ask. There are all these traditions in the news business that people now take for granted of asking sort of shallow questions that create controversy. For example, a sort of classic, old-fashioned, dumb-ass reporter, if they were interviewing Larry and Sergey, they would say, ""So, Larry. What about China?"" Right? I'm like, who gives a fuck about China? It's just some political controversy. There's nothing intellectually deep about it."
Interviewer,I'm trying. I do feel like those other stories get more attention.
Paul,"In the short-term, yeah, sure. But this is a different audience."
Interviewer,I see. Okay.
Paul,Ask the questions that would be helpful to someone starting a startup.
Interviewer,"Do you see somebody who does that well now, who brings out those key moments in entrepreneurs?"
Paul,You mean an interviewer who asks.
Interviewer,"Yeah, an interviewer or a writer."
Paul,"Yeah, I do see someone like that fairly frequently, in fact."
Interviewer,"You know what? Does she blog? I'd like to see a chapter of the next ""Founders at Work"" every week on her site. I could read that all day long. I know she doesn't have the time for it anymore."
Paul,Do one of these interviews. It takes her more than a week to do one of these interviews.
Interviewer,I see. I get that. I wish she had more time to be able to do that. Would you please give her the space to go do that?
Paul,"You know, that is her deepest wish. If she is watching this, she'll be laughing so much at this point because that's what she would like the most too, to be able to spend more time on the new version of ""Founders at Work."" She's working on a new edition, with a bunch of new interviews."
Interviewer,"Oh, wow."
Paul,"Yeah, the big problem in her life is that she has to spend all her time on random crap and doesn't get to spend enough time on the book."
Interviewer,I'm going to have to ask her.
Paul,"That's the problem that everyone writing a book has, incidentally."
Interviewer,That there just isn't enough time to do it while you're doing everything else.
Paul,"Yeah, that they end up having to . . . because the book doesn't have deadlines and other things. Do you have deadlines?"
Interviewer,Yeah.
Paul,"Like this interview, it happens at a particular time. The crap work has evolved this protective mechanism to not get ignored, called deadlines. So if you look at what most people do, instead of their great vision for their life, they spend their time doing things that have deadlines."
Interviewer,"Yeah, like email. Answer it."
Paul,"Yeah, yeah. So one of the secrets to getting stuff done is to be able to blow off stuff, even stuff that seems important."
Interviewer,Let's see. Piss off some people who have imposed a deadline on you just so you can get the stuff that you really care about.
Paul,"Yeah, you probably have to piss people off to get really hard work done."
Interviewer,"All right. Well, thank you for doing this interview with me. I'm so glad to finally get to meet you and I hope I get to meet you at some point in person too."
Paul,"Yeah, you should drop by dinner. Send me an email."
Interviewer,"I'm still in Buenos Aires, but when I'm back in the US, I'd love to come ."
Paul,You're in Buenos Aires?
Interviewer,Yeah.
Paul,That is the Internet for you.
Interviewer,"Yeah. All right. Well, thank you. If you're ever down here, we'll have you over for a steak and a malbec. If not, I'll wait till I get back to the US."
Paul,All right. Thank you very much. Nice to talk to you.
Interviewer,"All right, and thank you all for watching. If you have any feedback or comments, how can I become a better interviewer? Who else should I be interviewing? Please, bring it on. I always love to hear that stuff. Bye."
Paul,Bye.
Interviewer,What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
Paul,That the axiomatic approach John McCarthy used when defining Lisp is the optimal way to design general-purpose programming languages.
Interviewer,"You seem to have a pretty strong and clear philosophy and vision for the future of our society, but did you have one when you were 20? If so, how has that vision evolved or changed?"
Paul,"All I had when I was 20 was a collection of hunches. That software was going to take over everything, for example. This collection of hunches has now grown so much that it looks like a complete vision, but it really isn't. And indeed, I wouldn't want it to be. Ideology is constraining. I'd rather have a patchwork model of the world based on experience."
Interviewer,What trait do you look for in founders and/or partners that is undervalued by most others?
Paul,"Earnestness. This seems a rather Victorian quality to care about, but the founders who end up doing the best are all earnest. They're not starting a startup because it's the cool thing to do, or to make a quick buck, but because it's how they want to work."
Interviewer,"In your essays, you are critical of philosophy, but what do you make of the fact that you, Peter Thiel, and Reid Hoffman all studied philosophy? Do you think this suggests something valuable about the study of philosophy that might be hard to identify, or merely something about the type of person that decides to study philosophy?"
Paul,I studied philosophy because of what it seemed to be. It seemed to promise a direct route to the most general truths. You can imagine how that might lure in an ambitious but naive high school student. Maybe that's what happened to Peter and Reid too.
Interviewer,When in your life have you felt the most lost? How did you deal with that?
Paul,"Probably in high school. I went to a random high school in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. It was the sort of school you see in movies about high schools, where the administration cares mostly about discipline and the students mostly about sports and popularity and partying."
Interviewer,What is your media diet?
Paul,"Twitter and Hacker News are my main sources of news. I see interesting articles when people post links to them. But the best articles tend to be written by individuals, not journalists."
Interviewer,What publications do you read regularly?
Paul,"There's no publication I read regularly in the sense of starting at their site. If I see a newspaper or magazine I'll pick it up and read it (and unless it's The Economist, usually be disappointed), but there's nothing I subscribe to. I assume that if I try to subscribe to something, I'll have to fill out a form with 20 fields, that there will be no option to subscribe in a way that doesn't auto-renew, and that to make it difficult to cancel, I'll be made to call someone on the phone if I want to. So I just skip that whole mess."
Interviewer,How much time do you spend on Twitter? Do you feel like you're being productive when you're using Twitter?
Paul,"Way too much. Twitter is basically the junk food of essay writing, which is particularly dangerous for an essayist. Have an idea you want to express? Why not just tweet it? It's less work, and you get instant results. It's like being hungry and eating a candy bar instead of making bean soup."
Interviewer,What does your daily routine look like?
Paul,"Wake up, take kids to school, work, with exercise and lunch in there somewhere, pick up kids from school, play with kids or do errands, maybe work a bit more if I'm lucky, make dinner (I do the cooking for adults), maybe watch an old TV episode, put kids to bed (a long and varied process, involving everything from philosophy lessons to violent games), read, go to bed."
Interviewer,How was it different before you had children?
Paul,"It was totally different before I had kids. Much more flexible, and much more time to work. I didn't have to have any kind of schedule. I would just work all day, taking breaks whenever I wanted, often till 3 in the morning."
Interviewer,Why did you study painting?
Paul,"I wanted to make something that would last, and that I could make a living doing. (I could make a much better living writing software of course, but it was demoralizing to think that it would all be discarded within a decade or two at the most.) And I really like looking at paintings, so I was doing what I always advise people to do, and making something I myself wanted."
Interviewer,Was that a hard decision?
Paul,"It wasn't a hard decision at the time. I was only 25, and at that age it was easy for me to make a complete left turn. Especially since I had programming to fall back on if the left turn failed."
Interviewer,What are your hobbies? Do you still paint?
Paul,"I have enough money now to work on what I want, and when that happens your work and hobbies tend to converge, because whatever you want to do, you can do as much as you want. I spend most of my time writing essays and software, and with my kids. I haven't painted for years."
Interviewer,What is the most promising startup idea you've heard that didn't succeed?
Paul,"Maybe Pebble. It could have been the next Apple. But hardware startups are a bitch. External factors can kill you in a way that doesn't happen with software, and you can't do things as gradually as you can with software."
Interviewer,What is the least promising startup idea you've heard that did succeed?
Paul,"Airbnb. It was hard for me at first to believe that this idea would work at all, let alone work at the scale it has. But the founders had inside information about its appeal, because they'd been the first hosts."
Interviewer,What do you think drives the variance in innovation between different countries? Why does it seem like Europe is worse at startups than America is? What do you think and/or know about the culture of startups in China?
Paul,"I've been thinking about this a lot, because we've been living in England since 2016. I don't know about other countries, but I think the reasons startups are bigger in the US than in England are mostly cultural. In England, the worst social mistake is to brag. You can't say anything that could even be interpreted as bragging. But being ambitious is perilously close to bragging, and it's hard to start a startup without seeming ambitious."
Interviewer,Do you plan to ever start another startup?
Paul,Not if I can help it. I didn't even mean Y Combinator to become as big as it did. I want to write.
Interviewer,How much can you tell from your first impression of a founder?
Paul,Jessica and I can tell quite a lot from talking to founders for 10 minutes. Empirically we can narrow a pool of applicants down to about 3%. That's the limit of our precision though. We can't tell which within the 3% are going to be the big winners.
Interviewer,"Do you think that you have a special eye, or do you think that there's something discernibly different about the best founders that anyone could identify given a few minutes of exposure?"
Paul,"We do have a special eye now in the sense that we've met so many founders and watched how they turned out. But we had some advantages in the beginning too. I could recognize potential founders because I'd been a founder myself, and Jessica is a famously good judge of character."
Interviewer,Do you think we will ever be able to create psychometric tests or use AI algorithms that process video/speech interview data to do a better job identifying founder talent?
Paul,"I would never say never about technology, but you couldn't pick founders now using just software."
Interviewer,Why do you have a picture of a pedestrian signal in front of a Greek statue on the home page of your website?
Paul,"I thought that picture was interesting because those are the two extremes of representing the human body. I should swap out the picture though. I didn't mean that one to be on the front page forever, but it's been there so long now that I've stopped noticing it."
Interviewer,"We are chatting with Paul Graham. He's a memoirist and a book writer whose recent In Memory of Breadwas released earlier this year. As a bonus for tuning into the webcast, you will have the opportunity to win a prize pack which you'll be able to read about down below so please enter. I want to note before we begin that Beyond Celiac receives generous support from sponsors to make programs like this and all our work possible."
Paul,"Thanks for having me, Claire. What should you know about me? Just as a quick introduction, I spend most of my time on the campus and in the classrooms of St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York where I am an English professor and I focus on creative writing, both fiction and creative nonfiction writing, and also recently American literature. I started out as a fiction writer and I published quite a bit of short fiction over the last couple of years (first decade of my career). And then I began to slowly focus on food and that dovetailed with my celiac disease diagnosis and all of that came together in this book that I published in June called, In Memory of Bread."
Interviewer,You mentioned to me when we spoke earlier that you really didn't want your first book to be about your celiac story. Why was that?
Paul,"Well, I just didn't want to write a traditional memoir. What I really wanted to be able to do was range through several topics at the same time to get a better understanding of celiac disease and to help my readers get a better understanding of celiac disease and what the diagnosis means. So I wanted to cover history and science and immunology and agriculture and gastronomy, and, at least at first, I didn't see a way that I could do that and tell my own story."
Interviewer,"One bit of honesty that I noted right away was that even after you got the diagnosis you, I think you went on a little cheating binge, is that right?"
Paul,"I don't know if it's a cheating binge; I would call it a little more of like a kamikaze valediction to my gluten life. There is a scene in the book where, and everybody is talking about this scene with me, they want to talk about it; but it turns out that it's not that irregular for people who have been diagnosed with celiac disease to go and have, like, one last bite, one last meal. And I write about the time that I went to the local hotel and got a reuben and downed it without my wife knowing and I remember how I felt really stupid, also pretty bad. So yeah, that's part of the honesty, that's part of owning it, I guess. I had to admit that to my family."
Interviewer,"I have celiac disease also and one thing that really resonated for me was being able to remember my last gluten-filled meal. I was right on the verge of diagnosis; I didn't have a diagnosis yet, but it was coming. The biopsy was done, I was just waiting for the results to come in. So I went to a restaurant with friends and had a, I'm vegetarian so I had a vegetarian Philly cheesesteak which is just wheat gluten on wheat gluten so that was my last one. I had been eating gluten up until then so I didn't feel particularly worse than I had before that I just didn't know how much better I was going to feel later. Anyway, that was my little kamikaze, was the gluten-filled Philly cheesesteak. We have a debate in the office, but before we go there I want to ask what your path of diagnosis was like, it was actually fairly alarming. Will you tell us about it?"
Paul,"Sure. I think it was alarming, but now that I've done the research, I don't think it was all that unusual for people with celiac disease. The simple version of the story is that in 2012, and I write about this, right around the holidays I came down with what I thought was a stomach bug and you know the typical G.I. symptoms associated with celiac disease, but my doctor instead of putting me on elimination diet put me on antibiotics Cepharol. And I took that for a week and felt awful and continued to feel bad and when that didn't work he put me on Bactrim and when that didn't work he put me on Flagyl, which I was finally allergic to."
Interviewer,"toast, pasta -things that I thought would be gentle on my gut and I was actually poisoning myself."
Paul,"I'm going to say yes, because some of the things that I write about in the book. For one thing, switching out gluten when I was diagnosed with celiac disease forced me to become a better cook. I had always loved cooking. I write about it a lot in the book. I brewed my own beer, I made my own bread, I made my own pasta, I made my own gnocchi those kinds of things. And when I discovered I couldn't eat those things and I discovered the substitutions were okay but not what I was looking for, I searched out other food traditions. For instance, Thai food, Indian food, Vietnamese food and these are things that I would've gotten around to eventually, but celiac disease really forced me to think about other ways to cook. Because my wife went gluten-free with me (I write about that a lot in the book) it definitely made us closer and we had some good laughs and some really frustrating moments as we went on that journey together."
Interviewer,"Most of our community that follow us Facebook are women. Probably 90% are women. So in your experience in talking to people since you've written the book, my guess is you probably hear more from women than men, but what kind of reaction have you gotten from men; both those with celiac disease and those out in the world that are like, ""Hey, dude you just talked about your business in a book. What's that about?""."
Paul,"Well, that's part of the honesty that I had to get in touch with in order to write the book. I have heard from women more than from men. My hope in writing the book is that I will be able to reach more men because I think the men are in that population of people who have celiac disease who are either undiagnosed or underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. I hope that writing about some of the substitutions and lifestyle changes and the way that you ultimately really do feel better will perhaps inspire more men to get tested, will inspire more men to adhere to the gluten-free diet."
Interviewer,So by writing this book you put yourself squarely in the crosshairs of critics who think that people with celiac disease are a bunch of privileged whiners who aren't really that sick and we see that all the time. I imagine that you're hearing that. Does it bounce off of you? How does it make you feel and what do you do to kind of stay in the light?
Paul,"Well, I got so sick so fast and I got so much better so fast that a lot of people that are around me never doubted me and never said, ""Hey, you're a whiner."" And because I know that gluten is poison for me, I always have that to fall back on. But you're absolutely right, it is frustrating when people say, ""Oh, you're just doing the trend diet"" or ""you are just a whiner"" and ""you're just a hipster,"" or something like that."
Interviewer,A lot of people have a lot of food challenges; I want to give a little love to our sponsor Schär. These are the graham crackers and it's summer during the time of our taping and I've been doing some s'mores and these are pretty awesome but Paul you were telling me you have a different favorite Schär product.
Paul,"I'm a big fan of table water crackers, especially since the recipe has been revamped. They are perfect with just about everything or by themselves. I always have a bag or two of those in my pantry."
Interviewer,Did they replace something that used to be a staple in your diet or is it a new... ?
Paul,"Oh, yeah. Remember the Carr's Table Water Crackers, the little round white ones? You're supposed to have them with cheese or fruit or something like that, but they were good all by themselves. So this is what I nosh on instead of them, the Schär crackers."
Interviewer,"That's fun. Schär recently reformulated their sandwich bread which is shelf stable which is great, because then I don't have to wait for it to thaw. It tastes really good so I'm glad they've been working on their formulas and making it better and they probably got more practice than anybody. They're big in Europe and now they're big here and getting bigger, but they've been doing it for 30 years, so experience counts, I think. Well, thanks, Schär, for sponsoring this program and for your ongoing support of Beyond Celiac."
Paul,"I think my first piece of advice, I'm going to make a sports metaphor since we're coming up on pennant races, that season in baseball; and the metaphor that I think I learned from my mistakes and would offer people is that when you're first starting out after that diagnosis try to play as many home games as you can, and by that I mean eat at home. Eat in a space that's safe, eat in a space where you have some control over your food where you don't have to worry about things like cross contamination or hidden forms of gluten, that sort of thing. I would say, learn to cook. If you don't cook so much, get a good cook book and get the best fresh ingredients that you can afford comfortably and get into the kitchen and get comfortable there and learn to love food again because it is a huge shift."
Interviewer,"And what about the veterans, those who have been diagnosed for 10 or 15 years, what would share with them?"
Paul,"Well, I remember reading a while back that the average person in the United States eats only about 10 to 15 different foods in a week, which is a curious distinction and probably a dubious one for a species that's been the called omnivorous. And I know there is vegetarians and vegans and, you know, people that observe other special dietary restrictions in addition to celiac disease; but my feeling is that the best things happen at the table and then after a while you can be on autopilot and you don't necessarily want to be on autopilot. So I would say keep exploring, get good cookbooks, learn new culinary traditions and try to figure out ways to expand and deepen the pleasures of the table and cooking for other people."
Interviewer,"It's a very concrete way to help and that's a, sometimes you just got to have that thing to do not just to... great advice, great advice. So this might be the final question, if it's not you'll pretend to have fun, I guess. If you could bring back one gluten-y food to your diet, what would it be?"
Paul,"Well, I think the obvious one, the easy one is bread and I'm going to edge a little bit here and say that beer has been called liquid bread because it's the same ingredients just different proportions minus the salt. So if I can expand it all to say bread in all its forms (liquid and solid) that's what I would definitely bring back. Even more than that and I write about this in the book what I miss most is, what I think a lot of people with celiac disease who've been diagnosed years ago will probably agree, I miss the experience of being able to walk into a restaurant look at the list of 10, 15 items and know that I can have anyone of them that happens to sound good to me that day as opposed to just like the one or two down at the bottom which you know are probably safe. That's something else too that I would add back into my diet, but that sounds like it's getting greedy because you only asked me for one."
Interviewer,"No, it's an interview all's fair. Being able to order off the restaurant menu and not just look at the salads, that would be great. Well, I have your book here; here is your book. The light in here is pretty bright; you might not be able to see it, but tell us where we can find it. Give us details; your websites, all kinds of stuff."
Paul,"Well, the details are that it's a hybrid memoir and I use my own story to bookend or frame or contain a lot of things about, first of all, celiac disease, the history, the epidemiology of it, some of the debates and causation, you know, like, is it the wheat? Is it the so-called hygiene hypothesis? Is it something else?"
Interviewer,"And if you sign up for a giveaway you can also, perhaps, win a copy. Is that true?"
Paul,Absolutely.
Interviewer,"Thanks Paul. That concludes the planned questions. Paul, anything to add before we conclude?"
Paul,"No, thank you very much for listening. Stay healthy, stay sane."
Interviewer,"One of the dilemmas that some startups face is that VCs only want to make large investments and small startups aren't always interested in that Digg most famously. Some people believe that's changing though. Do you think that small investments in very early stage startups represent a growing trend, and if so why?"
Paul,"There's definitely a trend toward smaller investments, because it costs so much less to start a startup now. And if you take less money initially, you keep more options open. Once you've taken a VC-scale investment of two or three million dollars, you give up the option of an early acquisition."
Interviewer,You've said that having a good business model is not important for startups because the good ones are liable to change models several times anyway. Yet many people believe that the absence of viable business models is one of the primary indications that we're in a bubble. Do you disagree with that?
Paul,"What I tell founders is not to sweat the business model too much at first. The most important task at first is to build something people want. If you don't do that, it won't matter how clever your business model is."
Interviewer,What kinds of companies or particular technologies are you most excited about right now?
Paul,"There are so many. I especially like things that take advantage of the power of networks. As Sun used to say, the network is the computer. Except now it's the Internet plus the phone network, not just your local LAN, and that changes everything."
Interviewer,"You were an investor in online calendar startup Kiko, whose founders recently sold the company on eBay. When the company was initially put up for auction you said that the release of Google Calendar and its integration with GMail was what nailed Kiko. You wrote that the best lesson for startups was probably to stay out of Google's way and that the best way to do that was to not start something that Google employees would use at work have I got that summarized right? I know I've given some more consideration to my initial statement that Google killed Kiko in light of the things made possible by the Google Calendar API. Do you think the game is over for startups making online productivity apps?"
Paul,"Yes, that's a pretty accurate summary. I wouldn't advise competing with Google in things they're good at. So what is Google good at? As a first approximation, making things their own developers use at work. So they'll do a better job on an online calendar than a video sharing site, for example, because their employees are probably not supposed to be sitting watching videos at work."
Interviewer,What's the new startup you funded from the Kiko team?
Paul,"I can't say yet, but it is certainly the most entertaining idea we've ever funded. In fact, insane might be a better word. But it's what they wanted to do."
Interviewer,"What's your take on the question of whether most Web 2.0 technologies only appeal to a relatively small niche? If you could share any of your thoughts on what you think helps a technology stick and gain a viable foothold in the market, I'm sure that would be much appreciated by our readers."
Paul,"To me ""web 2.0"" translates to ""web."" And web technologies don't appeal only to a small niche. Web-based email services have hundreds of millions of users. The network (in the broader sense of the Internet plus the phone networks) pervades everything now."
