you already be history all right there

we go we're out of here all right go

that's it sway so before we get started

will you please sign this damn baby bro

craziness our teenage years I didn't

know I had bars once once upon a time

huh let me say Marshall you want me to

say yes please okay that's em pay rs80

mmm-hmm and I signed a vinyl for him

yeah look at that man look at incredible

yo yeah man your signatures so much

better than mine thanks man yeah no

problem man

oh man you threw me off with that

up your whole not really this

impressed that you dug that deep in the

creeks man I didn't know you I'm always

digging the crates uh that's good to

know man that's good to know do you want

to use any lyrics from any of those

songs on that vinyl but I doubt what I

was gonna ask you where where cameras

are off there's a couple bars and I wish

I could have yeah that's cool man go

ahead man

what's mine is yours man if it make your
 tighter you know to speak on

Barstow and we are kamikaze came out you

know you shocked the world the way you

did it what made you do it I mean a

revival came out December 2017 I wasn't

there long ago it's less than a year

what made you just drop it on the world

the way you did because I feel like I

feel like the way the climate is right

now if you give people if you give

people enough time to I got an I'm

coming out in two months you give people

time to say man you better have a song

like this all right with it if

you don't have a song like this I ain't
 with it yeah he better not be

rapping like this he better not be

rapping about this or I'm not gonna

with it and when you go into an album

you're going to anything with the

mindset of this is gonna suck and then

even if even if you kind of don't feel

that way you're already kind of formed

your opinion in front of all your

friends and you know I'm saying late

so I feel like I feel like giving them

no warning was the best thing to do just

because it doesn't give people enough

time to you know when the revival

tractors came down the pipe yeah I

remember that it was like overwhelmingly

this is gonna be trash yeah

and that was me nobody really wanted to

be wrong about it yeah they had already

formed I'm not saying everybody but a

lot of people had already you know form

their opinions so yeah that was

interesting like revival really got ran

through the wringer so to speak before

it even got off the ground but you know

it this is that day and age you know oh

yeah you know how but you just it to

that like before which is what I find

interesting about you before you spent

your whole career being critiqued and

criticized by organizations like LGBTQ

community or college campuses or police

departments you know but hip-hop always

stood by you so that was you know that's

what you found your refuge but now it

came from inside of hip-hop you know how

did that affect you me sitting back and

seeing things that I saw it was kind of

like I felt like I felt a bunch of

different ways I felt like okay maybe

because it doesn't sound like everything

else in there in and what what most

people are doing mm-hmm maybe that was

what tainted their here because I

remember a time in hip-hop where you had

to be so different from the next person

or you were trash there's a shift

somewhere that happened that if it

doesn't sound like everything else then

it's trash automatically yeah and I just

said back like okay all right I can take

that it's not like I can't take

constructive criticism but I feel like

it kind of went beyond constructive

criticism so I had to go back to it and

look

I have made albums that definitely

probably would not be my the top of my

list

mm-hmm what encore okay relapse which I

believe encores are better album and

relapse relapse is something that I

looked at a couple of years went back to

and cringed at oh Jesus Christ I even

realized I was doing that many accidents

I don't I just studied for whatever

reason I just got into it and was just

like started on this weird serial killer

vibe kind of thing and started wanting

to talk crazy and start bending words

more than only way you could bend them

bend them is with this accent trying to

use this one like and a couple years

later I you know in making recovery and

slipping out of that getting out of the

accents and Beyond it made recovery yeah

and I always say that if it wasn't for

relapse I wouldn't have been able to

make recovery and if it wasn't with if

it wasn't for revival

I wouldn't been able to make this out so

I'm good with it it just you know some

people more than others went a little

weird little far with it a little far

what I want to get into that too and I

almost you know when I listen to

kamikaze and I hear some people say man

that's the vintage em we want it you

know we want it shady back right and

when I listen to it man I have to admit

man I hear something in you on this

album that kind of made me rejoice

anyway I've done in the past I like the

fact that you're not running from the

criticism I like the fact that in this

digital age you're not you know cowering

and in reforming to what people think

you should sound like how people think

you should act and you're calling it out

and I actually like some of these review

shows that you see on YouTube and they

take people's music and they have fun

with it I look at these kids and I and I

see us when we were young myself when I

was younger I've seen you too but we'll

go to a G Rap Album and oh this was dope

that was dope farside album this was

dope yeah they just kind of doing that

right and you

dress them so you're that in tuned like

in the beginning a ring ring when you

talk about if you could teach fatigue me

you know you can make millions if I

could teach you there's nothing I would

be yeah it gets into the territory where

it's like it's like you got okay so

since the Internet has become what the

Internet's be coming here since YouTube

and all that you've got so many how can

I say this it's it's almost like not

enough Indians too many chiefs so it's

like somebody everybody on the internet

and in hip-hop especially is it seemed

like either a rapper DJ a writer

producer does something has something to

do with it and it's in and I love the

fact I love the fact that so many people

now have been able to get on easier than

it was for me or you back in the day cuz

we didn't have that we didn't have this

platform so I appreciate the platform

it's just that now you've got now you've

got people that not only are doing the

same thing and they can do it better but

you've got people who don't do anything

and are just critiquing it so I sat back

and I'm like okay that's fine people can

talk crazy about me that's fine they

should they should express themselves

and they have a right to but I also get

to say whatever the I want about

you know mmm I'm like I said I'm good

with revival it

mm-hmm because I couldn't have made this

album without that yeah and there is

something I'm not gonna lie there is

something inside me that is a little

more happy when I'm angry it's like as

much as I as bad as it feels you know to

be there there's also something about it

there's a rush of it that I like because

it inspires me to say something back

you getting that weird area to where

it's like oh it's just he doesn't care

about what anybody thinks about him but

now he cares about what everybody thinks

about him

no he's just saying he don't care he'll

say anything he wants about you if you

say about him because he doesn't care

like there's so many different levels to

not caring about you know I'm

saying but it was interesting it was

definitely interesting because I'm like

how off his mic here yeah Jesus

Christ like and then and then it was

interesting to watch the reaction of the

Chloraseptic remix verse that I did you

know with 2 Chainz and get out in

January you kind of you touched on you

guys form to opinion just from a track

that's where I was at yeah at that point

in time that is definitely where I was

at but I watch people going oh why

wasn't this only viable honestly I

probably what if I said it was on

revival you won't know because you

didn't listen probably yeah but I kind

of felt like okay I guess this is what

people might want cuz I'm always stuck

in that what the do people want

like like you were saying that the OM is

back and he's too old to be dough and he

can't do like no matter what when Isaac

I should have zagged no matter what you

got half and half every single

time you kind of say that you allude to

it and one of the songs well you said

you set the bar so high that you know at

this point you know everything is

considered a failure like you almost

competing with yourself that you touch

on it a lot in every song well not every

song but majority of songs you touch on

it I appreciate but I have to like the

Joe Button thing is it's a really

interesting because that along with MGK

of course it's making a lot of noise out

there and it throws a lot of folks off

when Joe first started commenting it was

mixed reaction some people said it was

disloyal some people said man he's

entitled to his opinion well I would

assume that obviously it got under your

skin considering relationship you've had

with him with slaughterhouse

yes how do you how did how do you

describe your relationship with Joe but

how do you describe

shop with Joe button I mean listen me

and Joe button aren't you know we're not

friends like that we're not like we

didn't go to the same high

school or something I'm saying so I get

that part but when I'm out here flying

around to different places and doing

interviews and trying to use my platform

to pump up slaughterhouse every chance I

get and you're using your platform to
 trash me and I'm one of the

things that keeps this ship moving do

you know I'm saying so you're doing

something you've got a voice in hip-hop

so you actually could be affecting this

ship a little bit you know saying

because you don't owe me nothing but

I've never gotten a interview

and been like Joe Budden is

trash that last album he put out is
 trash so that's that's kind of

the attitude I took to this whole album

kamikaze is like alright what if I give

everybody my opinion about them but I

want to talk about slaughterhouse

because there's a lot of including

myself people that really feel like this

slaughterhouse saga was unfinished you

know I know there's a glass house album

that was pretty much completed but never

release right

where we had left it about two years ago

was everybody came in and different some

of some of the guys in the group picked

certain beats so many guys didn't feel

those beats are they like the other

beats and there was like there was

definitely enough songs to put an album

out but for the most part it wasn't a

complete picture because everybody

wasn't on the same page of what their

favorite songs were so I thought they

were gonna go back go back home regroup

and try to make a few more songs I

didn't hear anything from that and then

at that point I started getting really

deep into revival you know I was

recording every day so a couple months

go by and from what I understand it to

be what I was told

I didn't hear this firsthand like Joe

said slaughterhouse ain't hot right now

we don't have a buzz we need to put out

next table from that point everybody

started branching out Royce went and did

his album crime like everybody started

doing their own kind of song oh

so I thought they were just happy with

that you know I'm saying like they just

wanted to maybe work on their own

projects for a while and we would come

back and visit this or whatever when we

made the first other house album the

welcome to our welcome to our house that

was another album that I felt like holy
 people who literally just trashed

this they trashed this out and there was

a huge backlash of oh man you

say what we want to hear it sounds too

polished and elicits like you're not

listen you're critiquing these guys who

are wordsmiths jr. I'm saying

like so you're there's look there's a

certain type of person that man I like I

only like two beats a certain type of

person that would lean towards lyrics

mortars certain type of person that was

leaning towards a voice more they like

better you know I'm saying like

everybody leans towards towards their

own thing but I was just like holy

cuz to me the beats were crazy on that

album and only thing I did was added my

little touch of like sprinkle in music

in these tracks and mixing them to try

to bring out you know the production a

little bit which I don't even know if I

did any actual beats on there on the

first album but but all I heard was the

backlash that it was too polished yeah

so we said okay let's do another album

and then you guys do what you want to do

with it which is kind of we left the

ball in their Court

kind of thing so I didn't want to touch

it in a sense of like other than give my

opinions on songs I didn't want to touch

it I didn't with my production because I

felt like if what if that is the reason

yeah that they didn't sell albums I

don't want to hinder that you know

saying so we gave him another album and

next thing I know I hear Joe talking

about who got that money who got what

money

mm-hmm like he did say I saw a clip that

he put up interview with him a crooked

that he felt like that maybe perhaps

like he alluded there you and Paul got

joy the money there but but the album I

hate to say this because I think the

guys are super talented but the

album didn't do much to even recoup the

first budget then we spent hundreds of

thousands of dollars on the second album

that never came out what money

didn't you get I don't know if I made a
 dime off slaughterhouse I don't

care if I made nothing I believed in

them so I you know I wanted them to I

wanted them to be huge man I really did

I wanted a group that lyrical to

just must do everything you know I'm

saying and it definitely hurt my

feelings a lot when the album didn't do

good the first album it was just like
 man like when we got ceiling on the

hook of the my life song I was like yo

this is this might be out of here what

was the meaning behind the line when you

said the last hit you I'm paraphrasing

the last hit you got was what your ex

chicken that was what that was was that

that was a tap just a tap it was a tap

but he was also saying that his his

alleged domestic abuse things or

whatever which I'm not gonna get into

butt but I feel like I feel like the

reason I had to do that is because like

I said there's a there's a there's a

fine line between saying you know what

this guy's really been cool to me he's

helped me out and tried to help out on

many occasion so I'm not gonna go in on

untouchable like that I'm gonna say it

ain't for me not crazy about it whatever

whatever but to be the worst song you've

ever heard in your life have you

listened to your own do you not

listen back cuz if that's the worst
 song you've ever heard in your

life I don't know

yes it's interesting so we'll never see

that glass house album probably as far

as you know I don't know III don't have

the answer to that I uh I I want to just

make it clear though that aside from the

drill I think that slaughterhouse

is one of the best rap groups ever to

ever happen but that being said I I wish

their first album would have connected

yeah two more people that I did I don't

to this day I still don't mean Paul it

was like haha what the happened

you know I'm saying like but look man

everybody's not gonna like everything

you put out all the time so that was a

dream team of emcees though and I think

a lot to what you're saying in regards

to why aren't people reacting to these

words Smith is that's how we came up you

know and honestly what people may not

realize is that's what really separated

hip-hop from R&B rock and roll and other

genres was our ability to bend words to

create patterns I made it unique to our

genre specifically which it seems like

it's something that doesn't get any

credibility or people don't put a hole

not everybody put a whole lot into that

now they don't give a lot of credence to

that you know which is probably

slaughterhouse could have been a victim

of that that kind of ideology you also

in this album you went in on MGK you

guys had a discrepancy he mentioned it

in his response song rap devil you know

that

let's call sway and ask him why I can't

get on shade four or five that was in

response so I've seen him on the street

once and I didn't know he couldn't come

up to shade at that time four or five

and I said man come on up man and then I

had to see him again and say hey man I

don't know what the is yeah but

until that gets cleared up there's no

way I can have you on there

yeah what's the with that what

happened whoa the is just for the

record the the thing that was going on

and he was saying about my daughter I

didn't even know about that

and so like literally like a year and a

half later

I wasn't it just it never hit my radar

and then one day you know you'd go down

the wormhole the YouTube and

whatever right so I see Machine Gun

Kelly talks about Eminem's daughter

whatever right so the click on it

like yo why is he then he starts doing a

press run basically about Haley I'm like

what the yo my man better yeah

chill right so that's not why I dis them

the reason that distant is actually a

lot more petty than that okay the reason

that our distant is because he got on

first he said first at first when he

said I'm the greatest rapper alive since

my favorite rapper ban me from shade 45

or whatever he said right like I'm

trying to hinder his career cycle

about your career you think I actually
 think about you you know how

many rappers that are are better

than you you're not even in the

conversation I don't care if you

blower if you don't blow doesn't matter

to me but then when you get on tech

minds album and you start sending shots

and people start hitting me up yo

machine gun just Yui just dissed you

reduced you I'm like I listen to it I'm

like did he really diss me no I keep

listening to it y'all just rap you're

not gods and then somebody sends me a

screenshot of his Twitter and it says

had some to get off my chest

you just rapped you not God some

like that and I was like a reference for

the rap god phone yeah so I'm like on

the song he said y'all just rap you not

gods and on Twitter he said you just rap

you not God had some to get off my

chest and I'm seen and by the way this

was on the heels of the freestyle here

just did about shade 45s like shut the
 up shut the up now now I mean

this weird thing because I'm

like I gotta answer this

and every time I do that

it makes that person is as irrelevant as

people say I am em in hip-hop i make

them bigger by getting into this thing

where i'm like i want to destroy him but

i also don't want to make him bigger do

you know what I'm saying because now

you're a enemy so I'll leave it

at that I'm not sure exactly what I'm

gonna do at this point right now because

I'm still kind of waiting to see what

you haven't heard his rap devil response

not heard it what are you thinking it's

it's not bad for him

mm-hmm he has some good lines in it did

John really call Interscope to try to

shell this
 no I I had never made a cop

we made a call to Diddy

really I got did his number just hit him

up yo did he went up never happened it

didn't feel like a distant me it just

felt like pitiful mmm oh my god now

I'm feeling bad for so I might even have

to do with so that's how that happened

so he made it reply to my reply so

regardless of what the he wants to

say who was from six years ago
 shut the up

shut the up wait I'm telling you

the reason that dis do now yeah I'm

telling you and I'm gonna sit back and

I'm gonna wait for a second just to see

it because if people start firing off

and not trying to answer every

body that I diss them kamikaze or had

words about I'm gonna be going the next

five years make it this song

after dis song you know I'm saying so

yeah like you're gonna get hit though

Jesse Reyes is featured on this project

mm-hmm young up-and-coming star she's on

two songs how did you find Jesse Reyes I

was coming home I got home one night

from a video shoot actually and she was

on TV was a Seth Meyers show mm-hmm and

she was doing that song gatekeeper that

was like

is this cuz her voice to me was so crazy

so I rewound it I was like oh I

gotta check her out so I went down the

wormhole of looking up and I was

like oh I really want to with this

chick cuz she right now I'm my personal

opinion I think she's gonna really blow

up mm-hmm that's my personal opinion

I've seen people very talented people

not do that but I think that I would put

my money on her that she will absolutely

be huge but I don't even know if like it

necessarily in the pop world or anything

like that I don't feel like she does pop

music I feel like she she just cuz she

comes from a real place and she writes

her own first time I got in a

studio with her I played her a couple

beats and she just started right into

one right there

laid a hook good guy I was like oh

so she runs away to a good guy a good

guy yeah

the one she's singing at the end yeah

there's a nice guy good guy and the

reason that that happened is because

oddly enough she had already had a song

called nice guy

she had that song right so I think that

was the last day I was in LA I came back

home and wrote sat at one and then I was

like I'm gonna write - the other one -

but they're both saying nice guy good

guy I was like I'll make it like

his kind of one song Dre's all over this

project Trey's input was all over it for

sure he felt like me and him had a

couple discussions about the last album

and one of the things that he said to me

was like he was like he he hit me up on

Dave's like yo I don't like how
 are talking about your

album and he had heard revival right

yeah him and Jimmy Iovine has sat in

there and listened to most of the songs

I had done at Rick Rubin studio and

based off that reaction I think Dre was

a little confused too

when that happen probably not more so

than me but but we had a conversation

earlier in the year and I think I had

only had one song by that time it this

was like January yeah I had the one song

and was thinking about releasing it and

then another song got when I got back to

Detroit recorded it like okay now I got

two songs I might as well do a

album and that's kind of how that came

about but Drake also there's a couple

songs that he kind of dated him just

because he didn't have a good reaction

to him and he also felt like one of

them's going a little far what does that

mean like how far did it go it's it it

definitely went too far when you say go

too far I feel like kamikaze was the

place where if you were ever gonna go so

called too far this is where it would be

you did the B et verse for the rap

cypher and in it you covered a lot of

content that was relevant to the world

we live in today that some folks want to

sweep under the rug and this is my own

personal opinion conversations we have

every day on che for five months weigh

in the morning we talked about you know

then justice policies prejudice we

talked about discrimination all of these

different things whether or not we're in

the middle of a race war that is trying

to be perpetrated by people in power not

a war in a sense where people don't pick

up guns and shoot it well maybe

Brad but in terms of psychologically the

whole nine so when you did that verse on

the BT cipher what I thought why it was

necessary King crooked had a song called

I can't breathe

where he talks about man we can't just

beat only one sameness white rappers

shouldn't stay quiet white rappers

shouldn't stay quiet I can't tell you

how hard that one hit me it was to the

point where I'm like this is how strong

I feel about something

I gotta put it in the right words you

know and I saw where it was like oh

these are these are not new subjects

they're new to M&M and you know that

kind of

how did you respond to that reaction you

did you got back last for that you know

I got backlash for the Trump cypher and

and yeah you know it is what it is at

least at least when this is all

said and done maybe I can just be on the

right side of history but you got people

dissecting the bars and going all the
 is trash it's not even that good

and that's not what it's about

you're missing the whole point do you

know I'm saying I'm trying to like I'm

trying to say this also to my fanbase

who might have voted for him a lot of

people in my family did and at the time

I did the cypher I realized after it was

all said and done that maybe maybe I

should have just attacked him when you

said a drunk he drew a line and a sane

man should have not done that you should

have reworded it and showed empathy -

well that's what I realized after I was

done that's kind of how I felt because

it's like okay this is this is like this

is backfiring on me and I don't care I

don't give a if if that's what

happened and hurt my sales I don't care

about that yeah I care about the message

I'm trying to convey why you felt a need

to stand up though what was that for you

have Marshall what majors because

because I was just watching it every

single day I watched a lot of news right

yeah the thing that pissed me off the

most that really set me off to when I

started going crazy with the pen because

I'm like the Kapernick thing and when

that happen and how he kept

changing the narrative and kept changing

the narrative you ah I I can't I

can't um I'm gonna get into this whole

trunk anymore but whoa you mentioned at

the end of the wringer asian orange

sending a secret service to your house

that the Secret Service really come to

your house after that they came to my

studio yeah

and they asked they had they were just

basically asking me questions about my

lyrics to see if what the intent was

behind him and if I was making a actual

threat or just expressing myself so so

that really happened wow that's crazy

right now what we're seeing too cuz

Colin Kapernick was named the face of

Nikes 30th anniversary let's do it you

saw that right and then you got a whole

slew of people that are now burning Nike

shoes and Nike I saw that product it's

infuriating yeah when you think yeah

like really dude Nike supports people

who need for the anthem at this

point come on seriously seriously you

got to be a

to think that that's just what it's

about and it's that cut and dry

yeah you know what I'm saying like

there's a meaning behind this and

there's real pain behind this and

you're burning a pair of shoes

when you go about your day and

you got your job and you're doing

thinking about all this other

that's what really bothers you

people ain't gonna stop watching

football

they're just not yeah football to me is

the best sport there is

and what draws you to the game should

not be if that's how you feel about your

country and you feel like you should

stand for the anthem stand for the

anthem

that's fine but you also need to realize

that this is America and people have

died for these rights to be able to

protest and to be able to take a knee

stop making it personal about

yourself you have nothing to do with

this I agree we got to get back to Tyler

to create a man I'm a I'm a big fan of

Tyler's you know and I recently saw him

perform I know that Tyler was a big fan

of yours growing up right and then uh I

recall you even reading about you saying

some good things about our future are

they pushing boundaries years ago

yeah for sure and you said some great

things about them about them as a talent

and pushing boundaries as a group future

as a whole

yeah what happened what she died you

know I really did like him I I thought

like I thought their movement was really

cool too

good job make music we didn't make music

but you know I just felt like okay

there's a mutual expect you respect you

know and a lot of this did that

ended up happening after that like the

Tweety put out with talking about shady

15 and why can't people a little close

to him tell him that his sucks and

it's trash and like okay listen man you

don't have to like it and it could

really suck but being that somebody

really was cool to you you would expect

some kind of reciprocation and just

don't we go public with it and publicly

express your opinion and how much my
 is trash okay so I talk I chalk it

up to them being young and just kids you

know I'm saying so it was like all right

I've been there when I'm saying like I

was dick when I first came out I'm

saying like yeah man it worked

I don't yeah I feel bad about it I'm

sorry if I ever was a dick to you but I

don't think I ever was was I you know

one time man but hey oh yeah yeah that's

true all talk about that okay so I liked

them in and then Earl Sweatshirt gets in

an interview after after Tyler trashes

me and then Earl Sweatshirt

everybody listens everything's drinking

too much Mountain Dew and I'm just like

really like what the like you know

I'm saying like you guys were just on

tour with us we hung out like we kicked

it make jokes like you know I'm saying

like so the last straw like look I know

a lot of this

I could I I could come across being very

petty yeah but at a certain point in

time someone has their breaking point

you know I'm saying

so when Tyler tweeted out the thing

about walk on water this song is

horrible

I was like all right I need to say

something now because this is

stupid mm-hmm

you know but at the same time I'm not

gonna let everybody just keep

I'm not gonna be America's punching bag

and just won't think is

cool and safe just say whatever the

they want about me thinking shocks

people um because for all your career

you was the I just don't give a

that can work both ways how so because

you don't give a you will fire back

at somebody who says something about you

I picked and chose who to that I wanted

to say my piece with yeah because a lot

of those things were personal but then

there's a lot of things that aren't

personal and kamikaze you know it's just

the game in competition you know

training spirit of m3 spirit of an MC

yeah but um you know with the Tyler the

Creator thing and I I realized now and I

realized when I when I when I said it

but I wasn't like in the mind frame of I

was angry when I said the about

Tyler the fact of like every time I saw

this kid like I'm always so cool you

know I'm saying like I I I loved his

energy like everything you know saying

like he was a funny dude like he's super

charismatic and but I'm sitting

back like man

at what point at what point do I have to

say something just to defend myself and

I think that the word that I called him

on the album was on that song was one of

the things where I felt like this might

be too far because it might in my the

homophobe in my quest yeah in my quest

to hurt him I realized that I was

hurting a lot of other people by saying

and at the time I was so mad it was just

whatever look

in the midst of everything else that was

going on on this album and the things

that it took to pull this album together

and all that kind of it was one of

the things that I kept going back to

going I don't feel right with this

before the album came out I had the

conversation with Paul and we spun the

word back

but now I realize people can hear what

I'm saying anyways in the case of this

man I feel like just man I wish you and

Tyler could sit down and hash that one

out now that to fire Joe shot back and

he said what he said because I think

that's a special young man and he could

probably use your mentorship and you

could probably feed off of what he has

to offer as well I could tell this

different from Joe or some of the other

yeah it's definitely different it's not

it's not it is it's not as personal it's

one of them things like I do

you-you-you you deserve a tap now

because I think you thought it was cool

too just because you slid with the other

things and I didn't say because

like I said I was talking it up to them

being young and just kids man I'm like

but at the same time at what point do I

just got to switch topics because

something I see I keep hearing this

reoccurring theme about how important

writing is you know one of my favorite

tracks on the album is featuring an

up-and-coming star that I think he along

with others that you mentioned on the

album like shine or trigger Jay Cole

yeah

joining of Lucas powerful real powerful

artist I like y'all together on this

track you know I think it's a good mesh

between a veteran and somebody who's on

the rise he's so good - what is it about

him that you like the first time my song

was like five years ago with the it

wanted to be et Cypress and I peeped how

he was like he was saying a lot of lines

that I saw some of me and that but at

the same time I it was different because

it was like early on in my career

whenever I get to do a BT cypher I want

to try to

right til my stands out you know

I'm saying and he stood out so much to

me I was like yo easy which was talking

about Miley Cyrus and I'm not mistaken

I'm pretty sure it was something like

that but he was talking about pop stars

and he was doing this kind of thing but

I'm like yo people are gonna remember

that I remembered it and then I kind of

started when he made it the Ross

capiccioni yeah the way he did it from

the two perspectives it was genius and

it was like stood out wasn't it out so

much to me like not only that though

like the rhymes become listening to the

rhondettes

when I'm listening to a rapper I'm

listening to what you bringing to the

table as far as a skill set right that's

the first thing I'm a honing on but the

fact that like I said like he's not

compromising bars to tell his story he

still got complexity in there ya know

Sam and he he but he's the water I went

like he's taking you on his journey and

I never snapped out of that journey till

he was over you know saying like I was

like yo this kid is incredible

y'all got a summer and I'm paraphrasing

I can't remember the lyrics exactly but

you come in with a verse where you say I

got a couple of mansions but I still

don't have any manners

you got a couple of golf writers but to

these kids that don't actually matter

what the happened the hip-hop was

going on with hip-hop people took that

line and thought you were indirectly

talking about Drake no see here's the

thing I saw and I saw that too yeah

Drake is always gonna be in my good

graces because he did something for for

one of my daughters that I will never

forget and he will always be in my

graces with that and I like Drake what

I'm telling you with these lines is I

don't know what's real and what's not it

at this point

you know I'm saying because you hear
 about this rapper that rap or

whatever I'm telling you that I don't do

it never have and never will if I ever

need a ghostwriter

I need to just put the mic down

you know saying huh so that's my

personal belief as far as anybody out

here too

that does use ghostwriters that's fine

that's if that's what you do that's fine

but I'm telling you I don't do it

hip-hop was the most important thing

that empowered me as a kid it made me

feel I have a line where I say it made

me feel tough when I wasn't yeah when I

was a scrawny little kid growing up on

eight mile walking up the block

put headphones on and it made me feel

powerful

hip-hop probably was I I mean it was it

was it was like my dad mmm

hip-hop you know I'm saying and it was

the only thing that made me empowered it

made me feel good about myself and when

I started being able to write rhymes and

figured out I could do it that's where

the feeling comes from to me because the

excitement is being able to come up with

the you know I'm saying it taught

me how to throw my first punch gave me

the confidence okay be able to throw my

first punch and to realize not only that

the fact that proof used to beat my ass

all the time in the backyard boxing and

one time he beat me like literally to

the ground

what and he was just like em let's just

stop cuz I kept getting up coming at him

but I'm like but I just kept getting

beat up he was fast man he's very quick

and he's but it made me realize like

okay taking a punch is nothing you know

I'm saying like it's not your fear when

you're a kid is like oh my God if I get

hit what's it gonna work to hit me in

the nose in it jazz my nose in my brain

and I died like kind of you think

about but nah man hip-hop hip-hop like

since its beginning I was always under

the impression that every rapper wrote

their rhymes and when you heard about ku

Modi battling busy B mm-hmm

it was who's bringing the best rhymes to

the table you know saying who's gonna be

able to say the best who's the

cleverest in the wittiest and then years

later fast forward you hear eazy-e

saying Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I

say mmm-hmm

and I remember being a kid like hearing

the line but it never really I I just

didn't really care no you know I'm

saying it didn't really affect the way I

felt about eazy-e or the way I felt

about in waa I think in all fairness

though I think Drake there's a superior

writer to be able to sustain the level

of success he has yeah I mean he makes

great music there's not really even much

you can say about it you know on this

kamikaze album I feel like I was pretty

directed whoo yeah I was kind of taking

shots at going that and who I wasn't you

know saying I wouldn't send subliminals

to Drake for there'd be no reason for me

to do that but I am expressing to you

that regardless of what any of these

other dudes do I have never not even a

line not even anything I wouldn't be

able to have fun with it if I couldn't

write it that makes sense you go in

really hard about the Grammys in a way

man you kind of you drag the Grammys in

the mud and you talk about you have a

few Grammys but you feel like you had to

sell your soul to get on and you didn't

know if you wanted it for the

recognition or the trophies but it was

the difference you know and that Grammys

pretty much sucked the blood of artists

and nominate them have them come to the

shows and which they do theirs every
 year yeah and I got I'm just

tired of seeing it and for whatever

reason it's like they're always pitching

this hint that you might win album of

the year which is a used to be a big

deal I don't think it's a big deal now

you know sat at home this year for the

Grammys and watched J and Kendrick not

get it and I felt like one of them

should have got it

I felt like joining the lucra should

have won a Grammy for I'm not racist you

know absolutely should have won a

Grammy every year we we we wit it was I

would be up for album of the year and

then

the winner is Norah Jones who and I I

don't I'm not even trying to say

anything bad about her music I just at

that point I had never heard of her yeah

and none of my friends did either you

know I'm saying so we okay whatever and

then Steely Dan

okay I know Steely Dan is you know

Steely Dan back in the day you know I'm

saying but more than the Marshall

Mathers LP impact like okay fine I

watched 50 same 50 did not win best

you were new artists at the Grammys

there was nothing bigger than nothing

bigger and nobody nobody since maybe

like Snoop came out the gate like that

my first album didn't do it I never saw

someone's first album and the wave

happened like he had and then he doesn't

get it and then I get up there another

year and what was it the Eminem show and

it was like whatever I'm fine if I lose

to Kanye or someone that I'm

like okay I respect that I know who that

is and Kanye has a huge following and

he's made a massive impact on music fine

I'm good with that

but don't get us all here to use

your selling point for your show

and stiff everybody every single

time and I said after that point in time

I was like don't ever ask me to

come here again please do not ask me my

answer is no for a hundred million years

never again will I go to the

grave well well now you know I know the

Jimmy Jam and and and some of the

members of the board they are reaching

out Just Blaze and different folks are

now trying to make it better would you

ever consider you know joining the board

and maybe you have a vote in it first of

all that vote is fake as that's not

a real vote that's not a real vote they

give it to who they want to give it to

they give it to their darlings the
 oh this got critical acclaim but

it sold two records like it ain't no

about always what you sell I get that

vanilla ice I understand you know I'm

saying like but there comes a point

where when an overwhelming something

comes along

that has this wave and impact on music

and you give it to a lotta
 Dottie who lot of Dottie

something Lottie Dottie but you know

what I'm saying like it's like man I

don't know who won over Kendrick and J

Bruno Mars is incredible Bruno

Mars is great but I remember Beyonce

they went for the album lemonade yeah

yeah it's like what the hell you know

it's like they're so tone-deaf to

what is actually going on but they're

not in a sense of oh we're gonna give B

hunter here we're gonna get J here we're

gonna get we can say all these names are

gonna be here we'll make them play I

guarantee you I guarantee you that the

people from the Grammys was on the phone

with Beyonce's people or jay-z's people

saying every year that they're up for

something hinting they're gonna win to

get them to come there nobody

guarantee you over there I guess I won't

see you at the Grammys this year yeah

probably not

I mean I oh yeah what if you nominated

first of all I won't be okay because

they know that I don't like them and if

I was I wouldn't win because they know

that I don't like one final question I

want to ask you about a song that to me

man it was probably one of the most

heart wrenching songs on the project was

stepping stone you know and it you tell

the history of d12 how it started you

know and what happened through the

duration and at the end of it you said

it's over that's it

what of members aware of that song they

were they were they were they got they

got a heads up and you know I explained

I honestly I have not talked to Swifton

and conniver yet about the song they

just knew it was coming down the pike

but uh the way I explained it is this

proof was the glue they binded us all

together right he did so much

the scenes that I didn't even realize

and did things to keep us a group and

then motivate us mentioned that you guys

knew all this stuff was happening but

y'all never talked about it you know you

were man you know I'm paraphrasing in

the verses but everybody was doing their

solo projects and you know y'all was

drifting further apart well that's what

ended up happening was everybody was

kind of doing their solo things made

solar projects mixtapes and things like

that and did we're doing shows and I

think the conversation now going forward

is to see if there's anything we can do

to help their solo careers you know and

we'll always be friends man we always

been friends

smooth kids yeah I'm saying so we'll

always be good on that aspect you know

and I want to help them do whatever

whatever it is that their next thing is

on the agenda you know I'm saying

mixtape album shopping whatever it is

when I listen to these stories and I've

known you since the 90s and I've known

you through these ups and downs and even

if I wasn't there on your side I was

there on your team so to speak you know

I'm sitting there thinking man this man

must have went through some great

therapy because right now where you out

you seem like you're in a comfortable

place you know who you are you know what

you want and even though you got these

people coming at you get strong enough

to respond in the way that you wouldn't

naturally do it how did you get to this

place though the did you do therapy was

it no I just my music is therapy you

know so I just I don't know man I've

been coasting through and I feel like I

just always I write all the time

mm-hmm whether I use it or not you know

I write all the time and that's my best

therapy is to be able to get stuff out

just like the d12 song it was like one

of those things were like I know that

they have things they want to say to me

and I have things I want to say to them

so this is kind of how I wanted to tell

them like you know I love you guys like

forever they come here it's just the one

day g12 album just doesn't seem

in this climate right now dear I don't

know how that would even work

you don't say yeah yeah you're going

through enough with this climate right

so imagine d12 let me ask you this

moving forward this will be my final

question you have always to the public

seemed like an elusive introverted

person that they don't always have

access to the less I think that's

hilarious

okay by the way you know I'm not going

to clubs anymore I don't do that

you know saying I'm sober I don't but I

do a lot more and go a lot more places

than people actually think I do I just

do it under the radar man that's all we

don't you know in Detroit we don't have

paparazzi like LA or New York you know

saying so I'm out a lot it's just that

people don't really see me don't you out

and about

yeah that's interesting to know like I

said you're not gonna catch me in a club
 throwing money or you know I'm

saying like I've been through all those

days and all that like as far as

you know I've done the old club scene

you know I did it for a long time too

long now but congratulations man I like

the Kamikaze project thank you um I

think the majority of folks who listen

to it cannot deny that you an elite

group of lyricist okay and I'm a dude

who's been in this for multiple decades

and you at the top of my list and I like

to see you keep flying for regardless

sort of you know whatever the critics

have to say they've been craving you

back critics since your first album you

know so that that's what it's gonna be

but I think people and appreciate the

fact that you fire back

that you ain't gonna stand for it and

that you still are making you still

making great music so congratulations

brother

absolutely thank you mhm and listen I'm

glad I could sign that vinyl for you man

oh yeah you know if you want to I like I

said I'm gonna take it home check out

some bars okay here let me see that

children's silver distance you see

that's why in text shout out the King

tectus my brother partner in crime since
