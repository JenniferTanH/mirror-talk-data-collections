connor i'll give you credit where credit

is due first things first you're the

first

athlete i've ever interviewed that is

dressed better than me i just want that

i just want that on the record okay

so congratulations on that but i got to

ask you this question

as we sit here right now just days

removed from your third year trilogy

with dustin poirier

why are you here why are you here

considering all that you've accomplished

in your life and in your career

why are you here for this fight i love

the trail of it stephen i love it all i

love the fight

i love the business about it i love

everything about it people ask me that

all the time why am i here i'm

you know am i too accomplished to be

here you know but

it's what i love to do it's all i do but

if people are asking you that question

they obviously feel that looking at you

they believe

that you may have lost something forget

skill for a second i'm talking about

passion you've got people questioning

whether or not the passion to do this

is still there for you where do you

think they get that from you know am i

the hungry lion i once was

you know maybe not it's certainly

different but i'm i'm i'm now the fat

cat you know what i mean i'm the fat cat

pulling all the strings around here

that's an

even more dangerous individual so you

know

and i'm also you know cutting weight so

i am hungry so i'm eager to get in there

and prove all

all the people uh you know all my

doubters wrong and all my support is

correct you know i do a lot of this for

fans i love to

i love to get in and get in and show my

appreciation for the fans

some people don't believe some people

believe however that you're not as

dangerous

as you used to be yeah well they don't

feel that way okay

because because you know you every time

i sit in in an interview it's oh

why are you here you have too much money

you're too successful you're doing it

all

blah blah blah you know when the last

fight i kind of bought into that you

know i was in the press conference and a

guy was reading out

a quote of mine from many years ago

where i was like

you know talking about i can't wait i'm

gonna i'm gonna put my mother in a

mansion i'm gonna you know my

girlfriend's gonna have a car for

every day of the week and you know i was

feeding into that wow i did all this you

know i i'm not even

i'm where i am i'm grateful i'm proud of

where i am and what i've achieved but

there's a lot more left in me i'm still

very young i'm very fresh in the game

and i'm a dangerous man steve and i'm

the most dangerous of them all you know

i mean this i have 19 knockouts in my

mixed martial arts career

saturday night i will get my 20th it'll

be my 12th ufc main event

only 22 years of age fresh fresh is

anything i'm ready to go

so i'm gonna prove how dangerous i am

because trust me in the mindset i'm in

i'm really

really dangerous this man is not it's

not gonna be pretty what's gonna happen

to this man in here

let's rewind the clock to the press

conferences leading

up to the sequel between you

and dustin poirier people looked at you

and said you were incredibly nice

you were nicer than anybody had ever

seen conor mcgregor be yes towards an

opponent why was that

you know i feel almost pity for some of

them some people in the game to be

honest i had a little bit of pity for

dustin you know he's

he's been around many years and i was

it's not a pretty game for a lot of

people in this business and i just came

back and you know

wanted to be respectful and you know

give it give the jews and

you know that this time you know it

wasn't it wasn't reciprocated it was

it was shady it's not that i didn't know

about it it's not that i didn't know the

intentions but now

now the intentions are clear and i'm

going to punish him for that how was it

shady

what did he do that major just a few

things you know just a few things

on national television tell us how what

are those people throughout the build up

with certain things

certain discussions we've had and just

just shady behavior i'm not in the

business of explaining

any of it but no the mana is going to

pay for it when they look at you

and they saw a guy that's that's the

excuse in terms of dustin poirier

nice guy you felt bad for him et cetera

et cetera but you

they're looking at you and they're

saying maybe you were a nice guy because

again you're thinking about all that you

stephen i am a nice guy okay you know i

am a nice guy you know what i mean it's

just about not translating it into the

game you can't be nice in this business

that's for sure no matter what you know

what i mean you've got to be ruthless in

it i've got to stay ruthless that's

that's what i've been saying you know in

in the most rootless business of all i

am the most ruthless and that's that's

what it is and that's where

where i am what happened in the octagon

in general you know there was a lot of

free

there was a lot of freebies given there

was a lot of free things given there was

there was

there was weight on the scales given

there were shots in the octagon given

there was plugs and support given

there's nothing free given this time

everything is getting took and that's

that's the mindset here

is that why you lost yeah i would say so

there's a

i mean there's a few things a tactical

you know i wasn't like i said i pitied

the man to be honest which i wasn't

i was looking past him i had a manny

pacquiao camp in place

and that was three quarters of the camp

so you know i've dialed it back in i've

focused on the skills and the tactical

errors

and things like that and here we are you

know it's been full uh focus on mixed

martial arts

practice and i'm ready to go they look

at conor mcgregor right now

the novices not the avid followers who

know the sport

i'm talking about fans i'm talking about

fans i'm not talking about the fight but

just the fan

watching you fight they've seen you lose

to the mega metal they saw him wrestle

and maul and grapple

they saw you lose to dustin pourie and

they said those calf kicks really hit

you i know what i peeled from it was

that

excuse me that that that that leg that

front leg of yours was ready don't

forget he also shuffled his legs 20

seconds in

you know almost as fast as the tiger

standing did that the dagestani shot for

the legs for the takedown 15 seconds

into the first round

dustin was 20 seconds you know they know

what's what they can say what they want

they know the danger that they that they

face

now it's you know i understand

they fight they fight they fight me

afraid they die for the legs they try

and stall

positions they share look they look to

kick the legs there's

there's things i'm aware of now and i've

made adjustments and i look forward to

you know correcting it i became a fan of

this sport

in large part for watching somebody like

you knock people out

you know that my record in mixed martial

arts competition is 19 wins

and one loss i only count knockouts

i only count knockouts dustin's win

justine's dustin's record is 13 wins

two losses the only thing that's final

in this business is a knockout

all the other the decisions the tabs all

that means nothing to me uncommon to

take a man's head off

and that's it you know what i mean i was

i was aiming to put a few holes in his

head the last time now i'm going to put

a few holes in his head and

send it into the bleachers what about

somebody that looks at conor mcgregor

and said excuse me sir that just

happened to you

what do you say to them about that yeah

well here we go again i'm back

you know what i mean so let's go i look

at it and i say to myself

right now conor mcgregor you don't want

to stand straight up with him still

because he'll put you to sleep he'll

knock you out

but if you grapple him if you calf kick

him excuse me

you you you mess with his lower

extremities that's hard for him to take

that's not the fight that conor mcgregor

wants to

because before he fought floyd

mayweather he was talking about fighting

manny pacquiao

he's addicted to the knockout addicted

to striking

if you go away from that that's how you

beat conor mcgregor to that you say what

yeah try it now try it now you know what

i mean this is i'm opening up the

up the targets i'm opening up the

toolbox you know what i mean it's just

about going into my toolbox it's

it's vast you know i mean my stances my

approaches my attacks my shots

so i'm gonna whip out all the weapons

here and i'm aware of what

you know that panic shot the panic in

his body it's

i see it all written all over him i saw

it in the first fight when i sparked him

you know what even started in the in the

second foot i just was you know

i just wanted to pat him on the head

almost you know that's kind of the way i

felt with it but that's gone now he's

gonna it's

it's on now i'm interjecting because he

actually admitted it was almost like a

flash ko you hit him you caught him

he sent an electric bolts through his

body and he said you know but you didn't

follow up why not

because here's another thing because i

was trying to get the rounds i wanted to

get rounds here but then i realized i'm

not paid for the hour here

there's none of that going on this time

trust me on that i send electric bolts

to his entire body

from his head to his toes you can see

him rattled in the octagon

in the first round and in the second

round he was out on his feet

so he knows it as well as i know it and

that's it's going to be

it's going to be a butchering let me

rewind back and get a little personal

with you here about something i did a

little research doing a little reading

and

i heard that conor mcgregor was once a

plumber's apprentice

that's right i'm back on the building

sites now stephen i'm back on the

building

that's my mindset yeah i'm i'm forbes

the highest paid athlete on the forbes

list this year but now in my mind i'm

back on the sites

going back on the building so it's what

a hoavey isn't a hard hat and a

hammering in me hand

i'm asking this question because in

doing that research

i read that your parents didn't want you

to get into this game

you even got into a fight with your dad

until you want until you told him one

day

you're going to see i'm going to be a

millionaire and you told him that and

you obviously excuse me

when that conversation was going on with

my parents you were in the same boat as

my parents there was no game it wasn't i

was getting into a game there was

no game i made this game i built it up

my father said to me who like at the

time i think it was chuck liddell and

tito and those guys that were kind of

you know what

and i was like how much do they make can

you make a living out of it and you

couldn't so i'm just trying to

convince i'm going to make a living now

this i'm going to make it

a business where you can make it a

living and that's that was basically

it so you know they didn't know what it

was

you know but that's where i'm going

because you accomplished those goals

obviously making your family proud you

got a proud you're

proud papa for connor jr all of the

stuff that you've accomplished all the

great things

that you've achieved in your career is

it possible

that no matter what you say that you're

sitting back

knowing that everything's going to be

all right no matter what

that's the fire that people is

questioning whether or not they're still

there with conor mcgregor

because of that yeah what do you say

today i mean i'm coming in to kill this

man

i'm coming in with with vicious intent

here murder shots

so you know what else can i say that's

that's the way it is i don't care about

nothing here i'm coming to take this man

out cold and if you don't do it

it's doing it's dawn it's already done

okay so if you do

do it it's done what does that mean for

your future in the ufc

on to the next one on to the next one i

i flew in on the ghost now we saw the

allegiant stadium which is a phenomenal

looking

stadium i'd like to fight that at the

end of the year this is what i love to

do

born and bred to do this like i said you

can go back way in time my name my

family name are bred on the battlefield

swinging pickaxes on the back of a horse

you know what i mean that's where the

mcgregor name comes from we come from

the scottish highlands

we're warriors it's all i know it's all

we know so

i'm going to be doing it for a long long

time yet

when you say a long long time like you

said you're 32 years of age how long are

we talking 332 that's

you know what i mean i'm doing this

until the day i go out right you know i

mean if

you look at tyson tyson came back at a

phenomenal performance against roy jones

jr

and i was you know it was great to see

tyson come back like that great to see

roy as well

i thought i was very impressed with the

with the performance people walk away

from the sport

it's not like your physical body lets

you down it's just a mental fatigue of

it all

you know what i mean tyson said a quote

that uh

i was interested in he said what would

cuss say to you if

uh if he was to cut the model custom

customer

said you now know that you're coming

back he said what took you so long

and i agree with that you know what i

mean i'm going to keep going and that's

it you'll never get rid of me this game

this game is mine this city las vegas is

a mine

this world is mine saturday night i'm

gonna show that

and i asked this question because i also

read about and people

talk about things like this where okay

it's the fame and people think about

okay so i've got fame and i'm

comfortable and that might be the reason

where in fact the reason might be the

people that you got to ward off because

everybody wants a piece of you

once you're that champion kamaru's mom

spoke about being a champion at home

he is a bomb of a thing don't even don't

mind him

you know there's no celebrity there's no

fantasy

that thing is nada nothing not even on

the radar of anything

fame and celebrity there's pitfalls for

it but i am no celebrity people mistake

me for a celebrity

i break people's faces from money and

bounce that's what i do

so saturday night i'm gonna do it again

who's next assuming you beat dustin i i

i would go for that lightweight belt

the lightweight belt of course okay

oliveira the the brazilian

okay then we'll look to replicate we'll

go back up weight divisions and whatnot

what about nate diaz the trilogy of

course that's all that has to happen

that must take place that fight will

take place of course i

uh yeah about five times i'm thinking

about that because again

i go back to you connor the mega medal

off loss

that's temporary where's he gumbo

where's he now he's retired yeah

boy he went splendan he's gone his

jocks

fat and roid and i've been doing nothing

in the sport

all he done in the sport yeah oh

brilliant

he was totally in the know fighting goes

with three wins and six losses

it was as far as shows his father had

the shows set up

and he was pointing blatant guys with

like two wins and eight losses and all

that's his record up until he's 20 you

know he has three fights on the trot in

the ufc before that

that that done him well and then before

that it's nothing it's pull outs

couldn't make way you know that's that's

that's

not the last time and now he's gone okay

the last time we spoke you said

stephen it's hard to get fights people

are not giving me fights people are

running from me so i haven't been able

to been act to be active

and that has a lot to do with some of

the struggles that i've had

in recent memory do you still hold that

position that that's the reason why

you've been struggling

of course yeah i'm on a nice little path

right now with it's more it's not

so much to the opponents there is a bit

of that with the opponent of course

it's more the behind the scenes the

business aspects and things like that

you know that's kind of what's

halted it a little bit but like i said

i'm on a great path now we've got this

trilogy

we've got big things planned for after

and i'm excited about it do you feel the

ufc is in a good place or does the ufc

need you

you know the uc is in a great place i'm

very proud to have assisted in that in a

major major way

you know what i mean long you know i'm

here for it you know i may continue with

a lot of love for the company

i've been here since the fertitta days

and i'm here in the new age and you know

i'm very

very honored to be associated with with

the company of course

you know yourself stephen you're sitting

here in front of me you know i mean

don't get stephen a out here unless it's

unless it's me you know what i mean

you know it's it's be it's big style and

i'm very proud and honored to be

to be to be doing it i appreciate that

answer but i did ask a direct question

does the ufc in the year 2021

need conor mcgregor yeah foreign

but i am forever i am forever my

accomplishments are forever my

my knockouts are forever my rune is

forever you know my domination of two

divisions is forever

and you know what's what's to come is

going to be more forever

what if the ufc says that's true but we

need you to win

yeah well we need you to win that's what

i'm not so sad tonight

saturday night you're going to see a

dominant performance have you ever felt

pressure

no in your career the way are you

feeling pressure no not at all no no not

at all you think you think

the way the last one went i should be

feeling less i should be less confident

i'm actually more confident to be honest

with you how it went

so i don't feel pressure why are you

more confident just the way the last

fight went

you know the way i was the way the way

you know it's it's funny watching the

way the man thinks and the way the team

the opposite team things like it's it's

going to be nasty in here stephen it's

going to be nasty in here on saturday

night what's the difference between

conor mcgregor that one in 2014

to dustin and conor mcgregor lost in

2021

you know relishing in i'm accomplished

i've done it all i'm you know

i i i've got rid of that you know what i

mean how did you get rid of it

i'm up here just told myself just went

back went back in time you know what i

mean not even back in time just

just i sure should i lost it happened

you know what i mean i'm about to lose

and so that's what that says that

happening naturally you know what i mean

sometimes that's sometimes the defeat is

what you needed the feet is the secret

ingredient to success

you know what i mean so it's not that

it's not that taking it out it's after

taking those accomplishments on my belly

and i'm hungry to get back

you know what i mean i'm a fat cat

that's hungry and that's a dangerous

dangerous man when you lost to nate diaz

you disappeared for a little while you

didn't want to do press tours or

anything like that you were focused on

avenging the loss to him yeah is that

the similar feeling to what you have

yeah we're dusting right now or is it

worse

yeah it's more venomous there's more

yeah it's more venomous for sure

why is that yeah just the way things

have have went i don't know

just you know another thing i've not

brought my family with me this time

you know and that has definitely there's

it's hard to juggle

it's hard to go face to face and want to

tear through a man

and then hold your your son or your

daughter and give them a bottle

you know and feed them and this type of

thing so i've stayed away from that

for this one and i've actually i feel i

feel great i've not

i've not switched roles almost i've

stayed in the in

in in that mode that i need to be in and

you know even

if i would say like rest days you know

like on a rest day when i would have

rest day around my family it's not

really a rest day i'm playing with the

kids i'm busy it's

my rest days have been true rest day so

then when i go again for my next round

of work

i'm energized i'm refreshed and it's you

know shown in the

in the practice room was that your idea

or was it a loved one someone close to

you that suggested that's what you know

yeah it's my idea you know it's not an

idea it's just it's what i'm it's what

i'm doing and that's that's the way it

is

so saturday night when this fight is

over

what will we walk away saying about

conor mcgregor

the greatest of all time what a

dangerous man shouldn't have doubted him

the usual you feel that you've been

doubted

of course do you feel that's been fair

yes i don't really care about it i'm

just

it's fuel to me it's fuel to me are you

gonna be

in the ufc for a long time to come or

we're gonna see you boxing as well

you know for sure i'll box again

like i'm back on the sights the boxing

is

it's not even on the radar at the minute

you know what i mean but i will do of

course

do you feel obviously fighting floyd

money mayweather and making the

exorbitant amount of dollars that you

made and well deserved

nobody can knock you for making that

decision steve reflected even floyd

didn't make me anything

oh he was on the forbes this before

floyd that's great oh i brought floyd i

already got that with it you know

explode he had the andro andre berto

fight before

i'm not going to knock you for that

because floyd mayweather said that he

said i mean it was morning

he was more grateful to you he told me

that person he was more than great for

you but my last question to you

because he has a picture of me in the

gaffe in his house he has fallen a deal

he does i have no problem with floyd i

was in

it wasn't a good look for him to to uh

face against that man

in the in his life logan paul yeah it

didn't it didn't it didn't feel right

even his eye didn't he didn't even feel

like he could see it in him

we can go again if he wants you know

what i mean i feel that's going to

happen at some stage down the line last

question when by ko

or just to win saturday night sk oh out

on a stretcher this man is gone

stephen good to meet you my man all

right thank you
