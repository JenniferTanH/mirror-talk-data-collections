grimes thanks very much for being with

us today yeah thank you so much for

having me

um so uh and i seem to start every one

of these interviews since

the middle of march talking about

quarantine

um and i know you have a young son um

um how are you doing uh i'm doing

i guess like as good as anyone can be

doing i feel like everyone's kind of

doing

the worst but also i don't know i

also it's like it's like pretty good i

having a baby is fun i'm making a lot of

music i don't know

well you know i spoke to i spoke to an

artist not too long ago who told me

that songwriters tend to be isolators

and i'm wondering if that resonates for

you yeah for sure i mean i don't the

isolation isn't my

is it my beef with the world right now

um the isolation is kind of

good like uh

yeah i don't know i i'm usually

isolating in general like

um yeah it's good for art

um let's talk about let's talk about the

album

but to do that i want to go back to the

period after

art angels um as you were thinking about

making the next album did you feel you

kind of had a

choice you know you needed to make a

decision about the path you were going

to follow

you know pop music versus versus

something more underground or

avant-garde or whatever you want to

however you want to describe it was that

in your thinking

yeah so i really just wanted to see if i

could do it like challenge myself and

then with um missing throttle scene i

just like

i was like it i'm just gonna make

oh i'm out of sweater sorry you're

you're fine

okay i was like i just wanted to make

what i want um

and uh you know pursue kind of

more a more aggressive sound and more

experimental psychedelic stuff

um you know especially like

yeah i don't know well you've called

you've called you've called the material

on the new album

ethereal new metal um

and i'm wondering if you which which is

a

fascinating term in and of itself but

i'm wondering if you had somewhat of a

kind of a sonic template in mind or a

direction

that you wanted to take the sound

um i think i just like

have always been like i wish you could

get sort of like

nine inch nails but more ethereal you

know like um

especially the songs look like my name

is dark like i was like i just want

something like

really heavy like in a metal way but

that's like really kind of got like enya

undertones

like i've just been like sitting like

waiting for that

uh from someone else so i it just seemed

like something that

needed to be done um i guess like i

you know i was sort of like looking for

sonic holes in the musical landscape

that i felt like i wanted

to be filled well i mean there's a ton

there's a ton of sonic information on

this

on this album there's layers of

instrumentation and

and and vocals um and it feels

you know to a listener it feels very

much like your painting

with sound um are you are you

are you restless when it comes to

experimenting in the studio

i wouldn't say restless i would say i

definitely like

um like the first song i made on the

album was 4am and i definitely like sit

down and i'm like i need to make

something that doesn't sound like

anything else and

i just kind of like i can't like start

the album until i get a song that just

doesn't

sound like another song um

and so i i'm just sort of like that's

like what i'm looking for i'm just sort

of like

like like just like kind of like

throwing at a wall trying to like

get something that just sounds totally

unique um

well when you when when you're when

you're when you're talking about

finding something that doesn't sound

like something else are you referring to

your own catalog

or just anything you happen to hear

currently any and you know my goal is to

make music that is new

you know yeah so that's kind of my

i mean like i would say the thing that

excites me the thing that kind of gets

me going

is like when i can make something that

um you know i'm like it doesn't exist

or whatever like that's sort of my

generally what i'm

that's like the game i'm playing with

myself yeah um and one

you know one of the things especially

with technology

today in in the studio there there are

literally

endless amounts of

ways to tweak songs and change and

and and i asked this in all seriousness

how do you know when a track is finished

i mean frankly with

all my albums like my team eventually is

just like you have to

it's not like you're not allowed to go

anymore because i feel like i would just

go

forever um yeah like i have a lot of

issues like when i hear my old music i'm

like

like i just like want to fix it um so

it's pretty hard um although that said

though um i do

the realm of plug-ins and whatnot is

super sick um and i think

sort of an underappreciated art form

like the people actually making

plugins and stuff um so

i don't know i i'm like super fascinated

with that whole

world and yeah that that sounds like

that sounds like a rabbit hole you would

be happy to go down

creating that kind of

it's not my scene to make that first of

all i feel like i'm not

um like i'm not on the level

technically to be making plug-ins i

actually have made i made sort of a

synth

for rolly before but um

it's it that's not like my brain style

um which is in like why i

respect it so much because i find it

pretty hard to make things like that

um uh and

i just think those tools are just like

so sick and like a lot of them are

pretty cheap i don't know i just i just

love their music's heading where it's

just getting like cheaper and cheaper

and

um uh there's just more at your

fingertips

and more sort of like not hardware

although i love hardware

a lot but you know um yeah but the i

mean

what's what's out there now i mean i

play guitar i have a little knowledge

about this stuff

um um it's it it really is remarkable

the

things you can do literally on your own

and for not a lot of money

yeah no it's like just like magic it's

just like literal

magic like yeah yeah you know let

and i want to talk about sort of the

thematic

kind of thread of the album and a lot

has been written and said about it

um so so tell me your

thinking about kind of the the concept

for these songs the thematic thread

um was crazy because it's such a

different time

than when i started making this record

like when i started making the record i

was just like having such bad anxiety

about the environment and it just did

not seem like it was

the topic of the day yet whereas now it

seems like it's like quite the topic so

it's like

i i don't know it just seems less wow

but like

in general like um

you know i'm just thinking a lot about

existential risks to humanity in general

like i feel like we

feel safer than we are you know

it's like we're in a weird time where we

kind of have the capacity to

destroy our own species um

technologically and i feel like we're in

sort of like a technological

like moment whereas you know it's just

like

can we survive it or not um and i just

kind of

you know i was like why do people i was

really like turning off the news i was

like i

i you know like 2018-ish like 2017. i

was like i just can't

 take the news anymore and i was

like oh this is bad i was like if i'm

turning off the news it's just like not

a good situation like

how could i make this more um digestible

i guess

you know um and you know i was like well

i like the joker like i can handle like

a villain in a comic book or something

um and i was like maybe it's just a bit

more um digestible and a bit less like

painful to anthropomorphize things

like climate change that are

you know sort of existentially

distressing um and also maybe it's a bit

easier to

pay attention to them i was like you

know how could i get someone to like why

is everyone going to see a marvel movie

but

like doesn't just don't want to engage

with climate change or

other things and um you know then i kind

of started getting into this idea of the

new gods and i was like man it would be

so sick like if there's like

the goddess of plastic and the goddess

of like

you know like opium or opiates like it's

just like

like aesthetically that that kind of

concept just started really kind of

consuming my brain um well and and all

of this

you know given where we are with the

pandemic

i mean it's eerily kind of prescient in

a way

yeah it's really weird see i wouldn't

make this album now because now it just

feels mean

like it's like because just got so

 up in the meantime

that's i mean that's really interesting

in and of itself

yeah i'm just like like now just me like

this album it even kind of hurts my

sensibilities at this point it just like

feels so aggressive and i'm like

everything is just so up right

now i don't want to be like

like hey guys there's a comic book

version of everything

that's like brutalizing us but um

uh yeah i don't know it's like um

i wouldn't make it now i feel like

especially like postcode and everything

it's like

i mean the thing i always say about

social media is it's like

kind of creating the collective

unconscious or the collective

consciousness or whatever like it's like

humanity like is actually getting linked

psychologically

like in a tangible way and so like

everyone is sort of confronting

everyone's suffering all at the same

time like it's like literally

you just it's just like like you just

like you cannot escape from like the

suffering

the sort of like mass suffering of

humanity as a species

which i think is a good thing because i

think ultimately the only way to get

through this is to like

actually start having like better

solutions to things but it's just

there's a short-term mental health

crisis for sure because it just really

is

super painful like um so

it's just like now miss anthropocene

just see like i don't want to like add

to the pain so i'm like

i'm like oh god this album is so like

kind of like conceptually violent

but like like it just feels mean but

um you know but you do you do you do

cover

i mean yes there's there's the global

climate

crisis and you kind of go there

obviously but you do cover a lot of kind

of intimate space

as well um and there's there's a

vulnerability

in that um

do you feel bad yeah for sure for sure i

mean i think all this stuff i feel like

we

people have a lot of personal grief

about things like

whatever like climate change or pandemic

or racism or whatever like it's like

there is just an actual cost um like

personally um and i was you know like a

lot of things obviously affect me

personally like

i grew up in vancouver and there's a lot

of just heroin use and stuff in

vancouver and like

you know i have lost like a lot of

friends to heroin

related death or whatever so it's like

you know like that's like pretty

front of mind for me

so even though we're talking about this

current record are you already on to the

next thing

are you already yes i don't talk about

it too much because i don't want to

that'll

be a whole thing but i think we're

almost done

all right all right well i still have a

few more questions about this album and

then

you know we'll we'll set we'll set

another time to talk about the next one

um so so previously and and on this

record you've done

you know 99 or more of your own

production

and on on this album though you do have

some collaborators some folks who helped

with mixing or

how you know what it might be i i'm

wondering if even

even those collaborations have in some

way

changed your approach or your thinking

about

making music i mean i'm definitely done

with the sitting alone in a tower

making an album by myself thing i think

like i think myself robertson

i was like as long as i'm on an

independent label like as long as i'm on

4d i was like

why would i spend money working with

other people like it's just really

expensive and um

you know

it's just like what's the point um kind

of thing especially if you can make it

yourself

and you know you just like i kind of had

something to prove like i just kind of

wanted to like fully defeat

um any notion you know like people

saying like oh she doesn't really do it

so you know but i feel like five records

is a good amount of records to make on

your own

um at this point like i actually do

really just want to work with more

people and

because you can learn more like it's

like every time i get in the room with

somebody

might i get like significantly better at

producing um anyway so are

you are you a good collaborator i think

so i think i'm gonna

with the right people i feel like

okay like i don't do a lot of sessions

it doesn't always but like if it's if i

like choose someone who i think is like

really

great at what they do then it's going to

be a good session

yeah what would you what would you look

for in a collaborator what

what what does a collaborator kind of

have to have

for you to want to work with them um

just they've made some of my favorite

songs like i usually just

like the record i'm working on now is

like a collaborative record

and like the few i have like another

collaboration coming out later this year

that i made like i just like i'm like

okay who's made my favorite songs

usually like left of center like i'm

trying to find people who are like not

but yeah yeah like and then i just hit

them up i'm like you know if you

make great music we'll probably make

great music together wait

i don't know i do a lot of cold emailing

not a lot but like

if i think someone's sick how does that

work out

it's pretty good yeah um

i don't know no yeah people usually

respond

people respond yeah yeah uh you know you

use um and particularly on this album um

fantasy and villains and pop culture

references

um um tell me about the work because i

was interested to learn that that you're

you're a fan of jack kirby's um

tell me tell me about his work and i

know i know it's

influenced your visual art but i'm

wondering if in any way it influences

the music

um i mean he's just one of my favorite

illustrators i mean he's obviously

i feel like jack kirby doesn't get

enough kind of appreciations i guess he

sort of died and then like stanley

was sort of like but stanley also like

i'm not trying to discredit stanley but

it's like jack kirby just

died before like um the comic book stuff

got more mainstream so i feel like

he's less in people's minds um

i just like when i look at his art i'm

just like what the

like it's just so satisfying to me

especially the way it's kind of like

like i in my art i do a lot of um

like hard sort of like science fiction

looking stuff with like strong light and

like a lot of like reflection

i guess not to like but i i would say

that's pretty inspired by

jack kirby like he's definitely i guess

a big inspiration for me

like oh and heavy line like he does i

mean it's a comic so it's like gonna be

super line work oriented but that's sort

of like

how i draw two as opposed to like

painting or something

um uh but yeah in general i just i love

modern mythologies and i sort of think

um i think there's a lot of modern

mythologies that are like more important

to us than we think

you know like like all the marvel stuff

and i i think is sort of like

modern homer or like you know sort of

controversial savings

but like harry potter like game of

thrones or whatever

like it's you know obviously these

things like

like chadwick has been dying people like

couldn't take it it was like a

you know a hero dying so i feel like

that's like

it it's our it's our it's our homer uh

or our

whatever you know um tell me i'm

interested in the track idoru

um um well i mean you know

i'm not sure how how much william

gibson's novel

influenced influence that or not as as

the case may be

but as you're talking about all of this

mythology that's an interesting place to

go

well it was crazy okay this sounds bad i

haven't actually read that

novel i love william gibson um and i was

like reading a lot of william gibson

while he's making this album

um but uh uh specifically

every other track like a weird name and

just the one song adore you

i was like this is a boring name i'm

sitting with my friends and i was like

this is like the

i'm like i need a better name for this

song but like i feel like it should be

the title of the song because the hook

is adore you so it's like

i don't want to like lose the title and

then my friend was like oh like

there's like a william gibson novel

called adore you about

um like a digital pop star or something

and i was like what

like this seems like too perfect and

then i like

um ordered the book and then when i got

it it

literally says for claire i opened it

and said for claire and i was like what

the

my birth name is claire that's not my

name anymore but i

can't i actually hate that name but like

it was just which is his daughter i

guess

but i was like this is really weird um

it was like a trippy moment it felt like

a simulation like sending me a sign so

yeah yeah um sidebar

not not a related question but i i read

that

um your most streamed artists last year

were dojicat

and vangelis yes oh both amazing

um so tell me tell me what it is about

those artists that that kept you going

back to that music

i mean i just think dojo cat is like a

genius like

which i think more and more people are

realizing i've been like really obsessed

with dojo cat since

literally like 2012 or something like

whenever she put out so high i remember

just being like

this artist is like better than people

are

giving her credit for like um

you know uh so i've been like a pretty

big fan

like i even like yeah um i just find it

like

i find her voice very addictive i feel

like you can just hear her intellect

like through the music i know that's

like a weird thing to say but

like and now that she's sort of doing

her weird comedy thing it's like pretty

obvious that she's pretty smart so like

i feel like

i'm not crazy for like hearing that um

and her voice is just really i don't

know it's just an addictive thing ben

jealous it's just the same i mean

jealous i just think he's the coolest

music in the world like i just

think you can just put on vangelis all

the time

like i like the blade runner soundtrack

is arguably like my favorite album like

period in all of history

and and um thing i love about angelus is

it's like in this weird moment in time

where it both sounds really old and

really new and very little stuff

sounds like it because it's like early

synth music and stuff so it sounds it's

got this kind of janky like early synth

energy but it also just sounds so

futuristic for the time that it's just

like this

i don't know it's just like this perfect

thing evangelist

he was way he was way ahead of the curve

yeah so i had

it still sounds futuristic like it

literally still sounds futuristic like i

just listened to it

like i i listened to vangelis like

like an absurd amount like possibly too

much

um yeah jealous overdose

um uh so so you

you've talked about and you've covered

ai

in your music um you've talked about it

quite a bit

yet the interesting thing is the

algorithms

that drive streaming recommendations

generally don't know what to do

with your music yeah better

but is it getting better

i think it's more the algorithms

like people think we're not dealing with

ai and people like aren't worried about

ai

and then they're like and then it's kind

of like all these artists

not getting stream but only these

artists are getting streamed and i'm

like

or you know you look at social media and

like

people getting so upset at each other

and everything and i'm like this is like

baby ai going wrong you know like we're

dealing with ai like lit

literally all the time and it's actually

super impacting our culture and the way

we listen to music and the way we

communicate with each other and the

election

like it's super impacting everything and

everyone's just kind of like

it's not a you know people always get

really mad at me when i talk about it

but i'm like

just to be clear like we

should probably be paying attention to

the state of ai

and the state of the algorithms um

because

yeah it's a yeah

it's a it's a sketchy situation in my

opinion yeah

yeah agreed agreed so um uh in

the time in the time we have left um um

can you can you hint at all about this

about this new album

um sonic direction what what

what can you say about it uh

i would say it's definitely by far my

favorite thing i've ever made

uh i don't want to say too much because

i feel like

i want to like think carefully about the

first thing i say about it and i don't

want to just like

say something offhand that ends up being

like with some prophecy i just said a

bunch of before i was done

um and then like i changed some things

but everyone was like super attached to

the i said at the beginning so

then

like i you know um

so i i want to be like careful um

but uh

yeah i feel like i shouldn't i feel like

i shouldn't say too much about it

because

um so so last question um yeah i

i think you've referenced a couple of

times uh that that

grimes as a musical project was

was very youthful was was you you know

in a perhaps more youthful

stage so so how have you

evolved as an artist

very immature it's a widely uh

accepted reality um

i don't know i feel like it's growing up

i i feel like it's getting a lot more

like

like it feels very i feel like when i

listen to visions

it feels like i can feel my lastness

um and i feel like with each increase

with each subsequent album

it seems a lot less lost and a lot more

powerful or something so i don't know i

it's sort of intangible

but um and lyrics like when i made well

i mean

when i was young like this is definitely

something like weird

neurological problem i had but i didn't

realize music had lyrics like i thought

all music had fake lyrics like i

literally

listened to music and it was like blah

blah blah like i thought like it was

just

fake words for some reason so my first

three albums are like

mostly don't have words because i just

like didn't think

people were saying a lot of words

because i i

literally don't know how that happened

to me um

but i think sort of like discovering

poetry in my

more recent work is like really has been

really good for my brain

although i do kind of want to make more

music without lyrics again in the future

but

um uh yeah i feel like

i feel like the the adding the kind of

intellectual or like the

sort of more cerebral part because

before music when i would make music it

was just emotions like i was just like

emotions emotions motions like

and i feel like there's this sort of

more cerebral element kind of like

growing with each

time i like go for it uh which i think i

personally think is making it better i

know some people

have qualms with it and i will make more

glossolalic

kind of like non-verbal music or fake

alien languages in the future

um because i do i actually think i like

that kind of thing but

yeah well we certainly look forward to

whatever

comes next um for now the current album

is called miss

anthropocene grimes thank you so much

for being with us today

yeah thank you so much for having me and

um taking the time and i hope you have a

great afternoon you too
