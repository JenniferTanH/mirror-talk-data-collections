this when this goes online or whatever

it is it really matters and it like

really doesn't matter what matters is

you know the people who are sparked by

it and the people who are like offended

by it it doesn't matter
 you you know like because it's

about motivating the doers and anyone

that wants to sit around and talk

you're doing too much time it taken too

much time talking about it instead

of getting up off their ass and

following their dreams because I'm here

to follow my dreams you know and help

other people follow their dreams and

inspire people who are dreamers Konya

got the type of arrogance and ego that

and point out flaws in your

if you uncomfortable about yourself

you're gonna be mad at Kanye if you

uncomfortable within yourself and not

comfortable with the type of person you

are when you see him

I want a it's gonna make you mad

cuz it makes you feel bad about yourself

cuz you wish that you could be that

passionate about anything in your life

you see that you like I wish I could be

that passionate but I can't cuz I'm just

a sucker I always felt like I could do

anything that's the main thing people

are controlled by thoughts their

perception of themselves they're slowed

down by their perception of themselves

if you're taught you can't do anything

you won't do anything I was taught I

could do everything and I'm Calle West

at age 36 so just watch the next 10

years one thing I want express to people

also people think a lot of my motivation

is very like megalomaniac and self

oriented to the contrary completely I

just want to help from day one I just

wanted to help it's crazy that we live

in a world that if you're super positive

and super creative that it's scary so

what does that tell you about the

mentality of most people if you're

scared of like positivity and creativity

like there's I have no intent to do

anything negative to any way to anyone I

won't only want

you know more positive things to have

the codes of that go listen to all my

music it's the code to self-esteem

it's the codes of who you are if you're

a Kanye West fan you're not a fan of me

you're a fan of yourself you will

believe in yourself

I'm just the Express oh I'm just a shot

in the morning to get you going they say

people don't stand up and protect their

dreams people are too scared of getting

you know spoofed in a way and the irony

of it is so many people that are

creatives think about a creative person

in school when you picture them you're

probably picturing them all the way in

the back of class sketching or maybe

getting beat up and I'm the one creative

and this is the reason why I went on

stage this the reason why I did this cuz

creatives have got beat up my entire

life and there's moments where I stood

up to drug dealers in Chicago and said

you can't have my publishing come and

kill me

do whatever you're gonna do but you're

not going to bully me you're not gonna

to stop me because my mother made me

believe in myself no matter how many

people tell me stop believing in

yourself stop seeing what you can do

stop affirming what you're gonna do and

then and then completing that in real

life

that's the improper way to do it I

refuse to follow those rules that

society is set up and the way that they

control people with low self-esteem with

improper information with branding with

marketing I refuse to follow those rules

it's about truth it's about information

it's about awesomeness and the only

luxury is time the time you spend with

your family that's the only luxury to

this concept of luxury is is improper to

me hello I'm not in a competition how

you doing with anyone none of us will be

remembered you know our existence as a

race humanity period is a blip a

millisecond of our life in the entire

scope of the universe all these walls

that keep us from loving each other as

like one family as one race you know

racism religion

you know where we grew up you know

whatever it is class social networking

options we know all this

what makes this like be so selfish

prideful what makes us not want to help

the next man what makes us you know be

so focused on a personal legacy as

opposed to an entire legacy of a race

you know like the dinosaurs don't

remember for much more than their bones

you know so for when Humanity is going

you know what do we give to even this

little planet you know that we're on and

what could we do collectively like

removing the pride it is

the glass shattering of the class system

which is the new racism class is the new

way to discriminate against people to

hold people down to hold people in a

place based on where the kids go to

school how much money they make but they

drive where they live and what type of

clothes they have and how much you know

how much they have in their account for

you know retirement to somehow say that

this person right here means more than

this person like I know we you know I

don't treat it you know black lives

matter but you know all lives matter

like my doorman is more important to me

than any head of any company he keeps us

safe my driver keeps us safe and goes to

work every day the guy painting the

windows you know at the house no when we

change them from white to chocolate

brown you know what the architect

suggested he is just as important as

anyone else that walks in the house and

grabs a glass of champagne it's no more

of this separation of what you came from

your race financial finance background

education talent level beauty

whatever it is that people use to

separate so Fusion is the future period

the mixing of ideas the mixing of the

you know the to lunch tables working

together you know humanity period man

we're one we're one for one people

exclusivity is a new N word not

exclusivity am I saying a word right

yeah yeah that is the new N word because

nothing should be exclusive everyone

should have an opportunity to drink from

the same fountain the idea of

exclusivity is a new color people

fountain concept and saying we're gonna

overcharge sneaker culture guys to you

know drink at the right fountain you

know we have to reboot our mentality

period of a generation you know it

wouldn't even matter if I saw one

sweatshirt you know as long as his

interview gets done and kids hear this

and know this and someone in a position

of power or someone else be in a

position of power in the future has a

chance to make a difference and that

they saw that someone who was at their

lowest point grabbing at straws express

themselves freely and overcame it

through all adversary' our adversity

means that they can do the same thing

you know I could be vilified or

misunderstood and you know like I said

it I didn't I didn't come here to be

liked I came here to make a difference

you know

not particularly just the sin of young

timeout life life here's some people's

job they're very extremely likeable and

you know I think I could figure that out

I think I'm way nicer to people just in

general everyone that meet I'm extremely

nice but as soon as people start playing

games I stop I stop playing games and at

any moment I could hit that yay button

uh-huh

and we can go right back to day one cuz

we forget enough and I'm Zen he's

getting real quick you know so

but it's all it's all love and great

energy and positive image I got scared

at the idea you know someone call you

crazy so many times you start to believe

it and I and I almost got scared of the

idea of like going crazy in some way but

I wasn't going crazy I was like the only

person that wasn't crazy you know I'm

saying like the I stand that I just look

like it is anyone else here seeing what

I'm seeing

none of you guys are seeing what I'm

seeing or it's just like your Maybach in

your house is like that important that

you won't move at all

it's distractions that you won't say

anything at all in risk of losing

something right you won't say anything

on anyone's we have at this point you

know so if you have that ability to do

that to see that you know that Walt

Disney ability in some way you have to

apply it none of this was about me

having like a bigger house a faster

Lamborghini hey like it wasn't about

that it was about these kids having a

moment to be themselves to be a stronger

version you know of themselves I made I

make this stuff to empower people I feel

like it's so many things that are made

to you know to where the people as

opposed to the people wearing it and I

asked my assistant one time I was like

how did these clothes make you feel she

said I feel powerful and that's our

that's our main goes the song says no

one man should have all that power no

one man should have it everyone should

have us as a people we can't do it on

our own that's true we have to we have

to understand that we're not each

other's enemy we have to stop

discriminating against each other due to

class and due to race and due to

location of financial you know position

we have to say wow that is the best

version let's use it let's bring it

let's bring it to light let's move

forward let's push forward as a civil

civilization because we're so jacked up

on our

own egos and so misguided by mainstream

you know marketing we don't know what

the is real we'd be apt to get into

a fight this quick for the dumbest

reason definitely something that's like

racially you know this agenda set you

know it's like you know we it's like

repeated against each other we're

mentally not in a place to be accepting

to not be jealous in that part of that

jealousy and that frustration that that

that that goes up across an entire globe

is due to some of these other high

corporation level limitations everybody

is being served a nasty lunch food and

like you know you heard the word

minimalism a lot on this project even

this it's like oh you give us what you

need may not be what you want give us

what we need to proceed no I don't

expect to be understood at all okay but

like I don't expect to be I think that

there's people who are wired by their

parents to understand what I'm saying

sure and there's people who are wired by

their parents to reject what I'm saying

you know so many people are just so
 obvious they're you realize that

when they box me in or try to verbally

put me in some type of box of Redonda in

a box that they're really showing their

level of ignorance they're putting

themselves in a box and you know people

can write write write all they want but

what are people doing and if there's

anybody that's out there doing they know

how hard it is to actually do and I'm

like a motivation of the doers if if

everything I did failed which it doesn't

it actually succeeds but if everything I

did

failed just the fact that I'm willing to

fail is an inspiration people are so

scared to lose that they don't even try

like one thing that people can't say is

they can't say I'm not trying I'm not

trying my hardest and I'm not trying to

do it the best way that I know how with

what little information I get I take you

know things that people look at as a

negative as an inspiration to

you something better I think there's

school teachers that are the the exact

same mission as as me

I think there's police officers with the

exact same mission as me just help just

do everything you got give everything

you got and you know our focus needs to

be less about what I like to see is

going to be or how we're going to

control each other but or how can we can

give to each other every time I say

something that's extremely truthful out

loud it literally breaks the internet so

what are we getting all of the rest of

the time

I speak to me I don't care about having

a legacy I don't care about me and

remember it's the most important thing

to me is like while I'm here while we're

having fun while we're going to sleep

and breathe in oxygen and live in life

and falling in love and having pain and

having joy it's like what can I do what

can I do with my voice what can we do

for each other to make life easier to

make like dope before our kids you know

as they grow you know we born into a

broken world we're like the cleanup crew

people who dedicate their entire life to

making something better for the world is

that me let me explain what anybody that

knows are artists and you know someone

that's giving that if you know artists

there's only one thing you can say give

or ask them when you see them there are

two words thank you

there's no why don't you do this you're

what that what stop no we dedicate our

entire life to making our current time

and civilization better to adding

something to the culture and there is

only two words that you can say thank

you

the one thing I want to say people say

I'm a hypocrite right these people say

that right so yes I am 100 percent I'm a

human being I'm super hypocritical I can

feel something one time yeah and

completely a different way

another time I do it in the design

office I do it in the studio I'm super

happy I really love this I do when I get

dressed I love this I hate this man I

like saying that sounds wrong

anyway because you know wrong is okay

you know okay yeah oh yeah that we have

the right to be wrong sometimes

have a toast first

everyone and I know trapped open circles

got a never take work out baby I got a

plan

runaway fastest you
