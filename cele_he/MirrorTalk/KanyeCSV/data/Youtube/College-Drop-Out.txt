hey guys i'm carly woods and welcome to

watchmojo.com today we are bringing you

a classic clip from the much vault where

a popped collar sporting Kanye West is

promoting the college dropout he shares

some serious opinions on Good Charlotte

and biker shorts and he's struggling

with being too honest I guess some

things never change

[Applause]

Shelly I'll tell her

[Applause]

so everyone's screaming back there are

you used to getting this kind of

reaction yet well ever since the album

came out my life has changed a lot so I

definitely wasn't used to getting that

back when I was at college so inside

you've got all those yearbook photos and

and pictures of you the poetry contest

what were you like in school just really

creative and I want to spend a lot of my

time doing an artistic stuff it you know

working on music drawing just figure out

ways to change the world other than just

keeping my head in the books at doing

what I said I was supposed to do nice

well working so much behind the scenes

now you've got all these people here

screaming for you could anything I mean

you had to kind of imagine what it would

be like but can anything really prepare

you for what it's like to have your face

on a cover of a magazine and and to have

people react like that

nothing could prepare you I guess if

someone had sat down and mentored me or

something before I came out but no one

really sat me down so that's the reason

why I went to a lot of interviews and

accidentally said how I really feel

about stuff and I didn't know you

weren't supposed to do that you can do

that here I don't know you're supposed

to like speak from nothing you weren't

supposed to speak from the heart when

you got an interview so I've made that

mistake and I actually spoke from the

heart and a lot of people say he seems

kind of cocky it seems kind of arrogant

because I'll be back as so many people

diss me and then like I sold all these

records so I was just like a sore winner

so you know I just apologize to

everybody for you know keeping it so

real I think we can forgive you for

keeping it so real what do you guys

think

[Applause]

well going on with you know doing things

differently your videos are so

refreshingly different from all the

other hip-hop videos we've been seeing

these now all of Outkast has good videos

you're right you're right my bad I'm

sorry but what about how involved are

you in the process of thinking up

concepts for your video I come up with

the whole concept yeah yeah and then

like I know like on this all falls down

video it was directed by Chris milk I

came up with the concept of Veeam first

person in and then he went in and

thought of extra things on the treatment

like going through the x-ray machine to

just bring the video to the next level

so we me and Chris milk collaborated on

that and right now i'm working on jesus

walks and i got a concept right but i go

up to all these directors and nobody

wants to do my concept so like i don't

want to give it away but i'm just trying

to figure out what I'm gonna do for this

jesus walks video I'm going through this

problem right now like I went to about 7

of my favorite directors they say how

about you do this and I'm like no how

about I do what I want to do like so I'm

gonna figure out something does that

have to do with the song jesus walks

it's a great song but like you said in

it that you said you know if you talk

about Jesus as your song I'm gonna get

played on the radio just does it work

that way with videos as well

yeah videos is a lot of stuff you got to

take you out like I wanted to have the

scene where he accidentally knocks over

a stray and burns down the church and

they're like you can't burn down a

church I'm like but it's an accident no

you just can't burn out after Jerry

Texas you can't burn anything oh my god

yeah definitely because I'm trying to

get this point across so actually what I

think we're gonna do for Jesus walk says

pay for five different videos and just

do a DVD because everybody has their own

take on it and I don't want to take away

from that idea and I'm gonna do like two

of my my own ideas we're gonna try to

get hype Williams Spike Jonze Michelle

Gauri Kristen milk Michael House may

need to take a bout video from Madonna

Sanji that everything is everything for

Loren and just put together my own DVD

for jesus walks because I feel like that

video that song has to just come across

and we're doing it and also I'm doing

workout plan for this

I'm gonna do family business and you

know you got you got everything laid out

ahead of you you got the plans going on

yes yeah basically but we'll get to a

video for it all falls down right now

and we'll come back and chat some more

with you oh yeah

honey West all falls down we're hanging

out with Kanye and um that video right

there a lot of familiar faces in that in

that video right there yes sir you got

Stacey dance from clueless yeah and the

finest all time right there oh you're

good at least I agree with that

who else isn't that one me yeah of

course

damn - common my new artist John Legend

GLC consequences are coming out on my

label very good so yeah great

Lena Johnson great video great video by

the way British one of our colleagues

here at the end of that video he would

have liked to have seen you and the limo

with another girl oh wow you know I'm

saying on the way back to wherever

you're going I don't think the girls

would like that right that I've been

wrong but see that's the way Bruce is

though he's all about the girls okay

you're um you're big in the fashion as

we see right here the Louie Vuitton Don

is what you call yourself yeah sometimes

which of the following articles of

clothing would we not find in your

wardrobe sport jackets yeah you find out

you find that everything you got one on

right there spandex shorts no how come

thong swimsuit come on everyone has a

thong swimsuit yeah we're gonna be

my la you know you're on the beach there

with the gear they would be on my

clothes I think my girl might have left

today moving on moving on you rank these

rappers in terms of their style the

first being the one you love and then

down from there okay we got four Andre

3000 common Eminem and Slick Rick Slick

Rick then Andre 3000 then common there

Eminem we saying like the one you like

the best at the top why send everyone I

like the bottom okay cool

why that order Slick Rick is just he

said a lot of trends you know the big

Gucci robes he had the blazes back in

the days and not like try to use a lot

of his style and then Andre you know who

has a lot of polos just like me and he

you know he made a lot of mistakes you

know and finding his style but now that

he found it they common you know I ever

sitting them down in the studio yeah

it's just getting his act together so

that he could dress pretty good there

and whenever he just wear jogging suits

every day but I'm not gonna say none

edition because he's not gonna make a

song about me and in my career finally

in the fashion quiz I'll give you the

clothing line you give me the artist you

think this is gonna be easy but it's not

well sir we'll start easy it'll get

tougher fetish Eve that's right how

about made bleak this name is out no

that's Atticus blink way to meet is Good

Charlotte Good Charlotte oh I don't like

the Charlotte duh yeah no but look they

said no I'm gonna show you something

tell me say something that's Wednesday

on TV they said this is the anthem throw

your hands up

I don't want to be them wait shake it

did my man jay-z make this home.this

anthem don't want to be like mom and

then they had a song talking about

lifestyles of the rich and famous and

said but everybody talking about was

black people the first one was OJ

Simpson and second was Marion Barry

I'm seeing now as well producing

producing back in the 90s who'd you have

the most fun with producing but of all

the artists that you've worked with Jay

do the song I knew after it came out I

would just be way richer which other

artists have you worked with and you had

fun with um

Brandi Brandi is one yeah I did Brandis

first single and that was crazy
