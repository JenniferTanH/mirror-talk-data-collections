I'm excited to have my good

friend Mark Cuban let's do it okay he

doesn't waste any time walking in right

again today I'm excited to have my good

friend and fellow shark billionaire Mark

Cuban gotta say that I love the word

billionaire what does that do oh that's

mean I hate you already but he's here

with me at a barber and if you're alive

you know mark if you just started

breathing you know mark and so he

doesn't need an introduction as they say

but today we're talking not just to Mark

Cuban the guy we all know we're talking

to Mark Cuban the man behind the money

that's how we want to get to the other

day and how Mark spends his fortune what

he's like as a dad and a husband

although I've had a peak at that myself

and of course we'll end by getting out

of him who his favorite shark is and

might better be the right answer course

okay I've already told Kevin not Kevin

no way okay so I'm gonna set you up on

this stuff okay okay you started your

first business micro solutions after

getting fired from a sales job right at

the computer store and I know the story

there if you want to care to repeat it I

think it's famous now but why didn't you

just go out and look for another job

certainly you're capable of getting a

good interview another job I just got

fired too many times left too many jobs

and realized I was allows the employee

and recognizing that knowing I wanted to

start a business on my own at some point

you know I had nothing to lose I just

lost my job I was living six guys in a

three-bedroom apartment sleeping on the

floor my car was a piece of junk that

literally I've never told you the story

how I got my car so I had one car that

was falling apart and we were driving

down the road and you there was a car

that you could tell would have been

abandoned and so I was a Trans Am

like where this is going yeah I was like

okay and I forget exactly how it led to

it but um

we stopped open the door and I was like

this car is abandoned you could just and

so I found some paperwork like you know

an envelope that was like a note from

the bank you're overdue and all that

kind of stuff so I called the bank and

said look I can't get credit all my

credit cards have been cut up and

everything but I found this car there's

no way but somebody had been making this

 would you let me take over the

payments yeah kidding and then let me

take over the payments just like that

just like that because otherwise they

were you know they were lost the money

on it oh my god I can't even think to do

that yeah well when you're when you're

struggling and you're broken you don't

have a car that's gonna last more than

another 10 miles I mean you know one of

those beaters that you had to have oil

in it the car I drove to Dallas in had a

hole in the floorboard so literally I'd

see like the white lines going

underneath my feet and I had to stop for

oil you know every 60 miles it was awful

not good for dating here's what I find

fault in your story which I don't quite

get you said you had nothing to lose so

you lose a job you get fired you've been

fired a few times before I get that but

I would think with the situation where

you were living with you roommates

behind in your bills needing a car I

would think it would be quite the

contrary I would think the first thing I

would think of is let me get a decent

job where I get some bucks under my belt

until I could regroup and then maybe go

out so here's my business because here's

what leads my firing um you know I just

closed a deal that was gonna lead to a

fifteen hundred dollar commission and I

what I I was supposed to clunk come in

and open up the store and I said I'm

making that executive decision to go out

there and collect the check thinking the

guys get my boss is going to love me

when I bring back the check you forgot

you were an executive yeah exactly right

and so he fired me but I knew I can sell

and I developed relationships with some

people so I went to a company called

architectural lighting and they wanted

this time and billing saw forth and I

said look I got no money but if you

fought me the $500 and this which is

what I would sell it to you for in the

car and me the car the software cost me

$250 to buy you know I'll make it work

and if it doesn't work then I'll find

some way to get your money back I'll

wash your car sweep before whatever and

they said yes and so that kind of led to

me going that's right so I'm picturing

this is a guy that walks into the store

that you met in the store and the guy

looked at he a smart savvy guy and

probably figured there's kids on the

ball skids is that

that's who you approach you met him at

the store and found that is your first

customers

well that was an opportunity most people

would incite you grabbed it rid of the

flagpole turned out okay very okay I

would say way way way beyond okay so

what's it with you and these surprises

you like to buy yourself okay I think

it's a little strange right but

obviously you're rich enough to talk

about justify it okay but you had for

your very first business that you sold

micro solutions you went out and you

bought yourself and you only sold I

should say only I guess it's all

relative you're sold and I should say

for six million dollars yeah the first

thing you do is you run right out and

you buy $250,000 ticket so you can fly

around the world first-class okay wasn't

the ticket it was a lifetime pass also

anyway you walk up to the rest of my

site yeah for the rest of my life Wow

yeah so we went out and got just torched

me my friends um count like you folks do

and anyway you're not torched come on

they're all working high they all work

hard and so we went to these bunnies old

school steak houses that had you know

how they have the phones you know where

you just plug them in yeah and so I mean

I could barely talk and they're like

what are you going to get on my mind in

two cars I have a place to live you know

and I'd fly a lot and I flew so much I

remembered the American Airlines number

it was one eight hundred four three

three six four six four right yeah and

so I'm like I call him pick it up and

like and I'm like you guys that I'm

stumbling do you guys sell lifetime

passes what you mean you never heard of

a lifetime passenger so I want to set

myself up for life yeah yeah and I

called him and they were like yeah let

us but let us put you to the life to the

air pass Department and so I bought one

and it was me and anybody wanted to take

to go anywhere in the world on an

American Airlines flight for the rest of

my life for two people yes do you mind

if I ask you where that pass is now use

Jason as it Jason so you have to give it

to someone else to use oh I you can give

it to one person but I'd give it to my

dad but my dad passed then we were like

okay you know I'll give it to Jason

because he works for me in fly's life

yeah you have to picture Jason if you

would Jason could probably do anything

his life he cares to do I would say

would be a fair description Jason but

instead of doing everything in life that

he might do he

around the doors Mark Cuban you got a

seat this young Jason and the way he

looks at mark is a love affair of a

lifetime it is yeah well he got paid off

he got this ticket yep and I want to ask

you do you think he would take me with

him wherever he's going to go every day

one row not cooking well you know what I

think I'll hold out I think what I'm

gonna hold out is for what you did with

your money when you went on to sell your

new business or your second business and

what did you buy with that you didn't

just settle for a lifetime pass was that

my fourth business but yeah it was um

about the Mavericks with me the plane

the plane the jet yeah the jet yeah

online so that was like you know to me

you know one of the things my dad taught

me the one most valuable asset you don't

own is your time right and so you know I

always wanted my motivation a lot of

respects was to just retire so my first

company always wanted to retire by the

time I was 35 I did it when I was 29 and

then when I started back up again um and

really went back at it with Todd at

broadcast comm then we sold that and it

was like okay I can afford a plane

what's cooler than that and so I said

you know you know I'm an internet guy so

I got to practice what I preach and so I

bought it online 40 million dollars it's

not the first plane that was actually

bought online

yeah first and only if the biggest

purchase ever made online ever to this

day and why the plane and why such a

big-ass plane it wasn't like you got

yourself a little tiny there was a very

specific reason because I could that's

really though just because you put it so

you get enough seats to bring anybody

you happy because okay so I'll give you

another story when I was 16 my dad would

get me these beater cars right just the

nastiest ugliest 50 dollar cars he could

find and back then like a sporty car

would be like a Mazda rx-7 um and he

found that just old nasty one but he

also found a station wagon and I wanted

the station wagon because I could take

all my buddies to go play basketball

that's just you know that's that whole

thing where some biggest banner yeah

it's not even bigger as better it's just

like okay what can I have the most fun

with yeah yeah and you don't have fun

because I'm an at your birthday if I met

so many of your friends that you grew up

with and for me personally that was by

far the most enjoyable part of the party

not how spec

tackle it was not even that Stevie

Wonder was singing to you like did you

ever just where it was no I didn't know

but the kids told me elevator I learned

before I left that was cool I saw Stevie

Wonder wasn't enough no it's because you

know I love Stevie Stevie Wonder

but yeah I'm friends with the

chainsmokers and juice world was like

okay let's do something a little

different you know I met one guy at the

party and I should shame myself for not

remembering his name but he told me the

story about you offering for him - he's

in the airline business now I'm not

gonna give the punchline

okay what's the name of that guy your

childhood friend you went to college

with you you or so he said he said you

offered him a share your first company

that you sold he didn't trust and you

punched him in the face high school

buddy or college but I think a college

buddy yeah tall guy thought it was a

basketball player oh oh that's Eric

yeah that's there yeah yeah was that a

true story yeah yeah we told me that

story because I heard his version and I

totally believed every word

yeah just basically we're out drinking

you know all these these stories I heard

on the street and we just got into it

about what I was doing and he was a

traditional TV guy who really didn't

believe he worked for DISH Network I

think at the time and if we were just

yakking up like you're screwing up

you're screwing up you're screwing up

and then I don't remember the punch part

but yeah I remember offering well you

know what he told me he said you said

and I want you to be part of my business

that's our million dollars you say I'm

gonna make a million dollars in this

computer business and he left in your

face you punched him and put him on the

floor is that true

okay no so too different for people yeah

too different

yeah different but that's the real pump

itself yeah it sounds like me either way

okay you know what I said to this guy

went all through cuz he said he refused

you twice I said would you look like a

happy guy

what are you do for a living he said I'm

an airline Stewart he didn't say I own

an airline he said I'm an airline

steward oh no no no that's mark I know

this marks called blonde hair like oh

that's Mark's dog no marks tall has more

stories to tell than any human he had a

chance to work for me and he was a

flight attendant who just had a blast

just flying Southwest Airlines

he still flies for Southwest Airlines he

likes it likes it yeah I mean and you

know but he was fun because you I would

we would go places all the time he and I

went to the UM to the Olympics like on

last minutes like mark let's go to the

Olympics it's like okay let's go

Olympics let's go to Moscow okay but he

didn't take the ticket that he should

take but he wasn't bitter at all no no

cuz he has fun yeah he's a fun guy he

said I love mark I love everything about

him he hasn't changed a bit and that's

the messaging I heard from every single

one of your childhood high school

college friends from that party to your

great credit I never thought I would I

would meet a billionaire when everybody

said he hasn't changed one bit I was an

idiot then and that's what they said

he's an idiot now but why basketball

team I'm a girl so I don't get it I

would buy Saks Fifth Avenue Bergdorf

Goodman's and have all the clothes in

the world I've just been a basketball

junkie my entire life my team just I

think I'll get a team you woke up

windows I was a fan right I lived in

Dallas and the team was horrible and

when it came up for sale I was a season

ticket holder and you know everybody's

IOU gotta buy it you couldn't do any

worse you couldn't do any worse and I

was like okay you know it sounds fun um

you know I once we sold to Yahoo and

they I wasn't gonna stay around it was

like okay this sounds like something fun

to do and you know it turned out to be

not just fun but but worked out really

well and like to this day when we have a

home game I'll go out there 3:30 4

o'clock before a game and just shoot

buckets you know just shoot baskets on

the court and to me that's you know that

keeps me young and that's me being a kid

for the rest of my life did you think

you were gonna do that

hold it for a long time become a

businessman who knows basketball he's on

a this will fill in the blank between

our know I thought I'd hold it for a

long time yeah you know way more than a

love affair how about your wife Tiffany

I met her at the party I met her only

one time before at the shark tank said a

number of years ago she strikes me and

personalities opposite to you yeah yeah

she's laid-back she's releasing

notoriety

we kind of just stick to where we go all

the time you know we stick to our

friends and you know we know if I go

someplace like an award show what's

going to happen if I go someplace

different what's going to happen well it

goes with you for those things obsession

she's not yes she's not big into that

stuff

really big into kids oh yeah yeah now

that my kids are older is it's a lot

more fun to take them everywhere too so

I could take Jake who's 10 or Alyssa

will go with me still she's 13 my 16

year old doesn't know I exist anymore

the minute she turned 16 I got really

stupid but yeah but it's still the best

thing that ever happened to me

yeah why'd you wait so long to get

married I know you're a player you

played the field you had the most

gorgeous woman on your arms your whole

entire look not really yes that's true

I've seen photos now because I was so

into business you know I I dated some

women for an extended period of time and

it multiple times it came down to you

know me or your business and I gave him

the standard answer what was your name

you know looks like that yeah just like

that because you know if you knew me if

you dated me you knew me and you knew

where my my motivation my focus was and

why was Tiffany able to settle in on

that say that's okay because we didn't

get married till after I sold all the

companies and everything and so she had

to believe you're gonna jump out and do

something what you know what stay busy

right night then I do things but yeah I

mean it was just she was the right

complement to me at the right time at

the right time at hey all right let's

talk money and I'm not talking about

money and I hope you don't mind me

asking but when I sold my business for

66 million dollars to everyone I knew

from my birth to that moment in time

everyone thought I was on easy street

and I must be in a different universe

and like I had not a care in the world

like amazing what does that feel like

everybody said what does it feel like

what does it feel like and for me it was

so frightening I just locked up my money

for two years I didn't spend a dime I

don't go out and buy a plane or a ticket

or and I should have in hindsight but

what does it feel like not to be a

million millionaires have problems they

buy too big a house they have a bad

downturn in the market they still have

worries but what does it feel like to be

a billionaire I don't even know how

what's that a million million or a

thousand million I'm really a thousand

million that wasn't million what does it

just feel like you wake up in the

morning do you think I can't believe it

I think that all the time you wake up

and you think that yeah all the time not

just wake up but you just look around

and just go how did this happen um like

you can't believe it like it was popped

like oh the Ranger often partial luck

shushing yeah all the above right no one

gets to be this rich without a lot of

luck you know it wasn't my plan that the

internet stock market took off when it

did you know Shaq gave me one time

about oh you're lucky you're lucky I

like Shaq did you plan to grow to be

seven foot two you know he'll say yeah

you know you you've got to recognize

when you're lucky and I was lucky now

you know they say luck is when

preparation opportunity meets

preparation and so no question I busted

my ass and had I not worked as hard it

would not have happened and you also

have to be smart too because you know

when we sold broadcast Todd nine we

sorted for stock and when we sold it the

stock was way up there and it went up

even higher and I was like how much

money do I need I mean I just don't need

any more money so I did something called

a collar where I sold calls and bought

puts which protected me in case there

was a downturn because I'd seen this

this game before we're kinda like

creating your insurance policy are you

sure you got you state wealthy exactly

right and so I've seen it before with

with companies when I traded a lot of

stocks um and so you know I hedged my I

hedged all of it and when the internet

stocks crashed I still had all my money

and I even made a little bit and that

protected me and they called it one the

top ten trades in the history of Wall

Street but that wasn't luck that was no

that was yeah that was planning yeah

that was planning and not being greedy

but you know back to your question if it

was crazy I mean it's still

inconceivable and it's just you know I

just money money buys you comfort money

buys you sanity in some respects money

takes away a lot of the stress of paying

the bills then I that we've all been

through it at certain points but but it

doesn't make you happy if you know it's

like why not you remove all that from

the plate why wouldn't you be happy

what's left to be unhappy about well

yeah I mean look I was happy when I was

broke you know and it's like I tell you

know people whenever there's a big

lottery jackpot of a billion dollars

people always call me so I would you

know what do you like if you if you were

miserable when you were broke money's

not gonna change that you know if you

were happy living your life when when

you know you were living paycheck to

paycheck and all of a sudden you make it

big you know it's you're smart you're

gonna love your life even more and I

think that's what happened to me I just

try not to take it for granted I try to

enjoy it

no I really the biggest benefit of it

other than this the lack of stress in

terms of paying bills is I can do things

that buy me time you know I for example

yeah I like the plane or you know people

will I think I can make things happen

more quickly by paying a little bit more

and that's important because times the

one asset you can't own buy or get back

i remind me when you say buy time you

put some time for one of the friends I

don't know from which chapter of your

life but from one of the younger

chapters I met also at your party I

could write a book on my huge just based

on the conversations and I'm hoping

they're all true but this is a story

this guy said he said he was sick in a

hospital outside of Dallas some of the

city a long distance away he was very

sick and had some weird-ass disease that

they couldn't put their finger on your

own age your own peer and he said you

heard about him he never reached out to

you but you heard about him through

someone and you sent your jet to pick

him up out of that hospital you didn't

know what was happening

fly over to Dallas and put him in the

best hospital with the best care and he

was cured same true story I don't know

no you gotta back me up say of course I

know you don't remember a day like that

yeah the guy credited you right there on

the floor of your party was there at the

bar if he was there at the party then

it's probably true but yeah I don't

remember it unbelievable yeah well that

day before I remember but if there was

one thing you wake up in the morning and

you pinch yourself and you say hey you

know I can't billionaire what's the

thought that you associate with that

thought right after a billionaire and

and and what how am I gonna enjoy it you

know and how does it impact my family

and how can i impact the world

you know um those are three vastly

different things yeah one's protective

one's giving one's just about yourself

and what about your family how do you

protect them how do you protect them

from the notoriety I think it's a bigger

issue than anything else yeah I mean

it's not even so much the notoriety

because you know when people stop and

ask for things whatever they kind of

know just to wait a second and I'll deal

with it and I just kind of explain to

them it's I'm just gonna be nice and if

I'm nice it goes by very quickly and

everybody's happy your kids don't mind

standing by the sidelines and you're

you're being gracious to this know that

yeah and I try to use it as a point look

if I can be

nice to strangers you could be nice to

anybody you know anybody that you deal

with and you know I had this thing with

my daughter not long ago where she made

a comment I didn't appreciate to

somebody else that I didn't think was

right and I had to go through the whole

talk of look we're very fortunate but

you have to treat people with respect

period end of story

sorry you know my biggest fear for them

is that they're gonna end up being

entitled jerks and you know this is an

example of potentially being an entitled

jerk is that how you want to be in that

how you want to be perceived you know in

high school in college and you know is

that who do you want to be and she got

all upset I go upset but you know that

that's my biggest fear after their

health but you stopped it right then and

there when you saw it yeah tolerate it

know you know and how did they deal with

being Mark Cuban's daughter Mark Cuban's

son they must have that in their face

all the time yeah and they really don't

talk to me about it now I really don't

ask him about it I'm a whole lot because

you know and they have it in common with

each other yeah and it's not like I want

to say hey I'm famous what do you think

house affecting you and you know then it

comes up from various points on but I

think my wife really has dealt with that

better you know in terms of dealing with

the kids because she has to deal with it

the same way well so I think the long

ways and so much more on the kids no

matter what the dad does yeah I mean I

think particularly with my daughter's

not maybe not as much of my son even

though he's a mama's boy a certain level

but yeah I mean we I could spend time

with all of them and but there are I

think there's certain things they give

like I have to deal with the tough

subjects you know talking to my daughter

about you know drinking and you know

boys and my wife's like you deal with

that and I think my wife deals with the

school in the day to day stuff so that

good partnership isn't a pair of minimum

right okay so you invest in a lot of

businesses I see or in Shark Tank

anything I say you want Shark Tank to

ICU and yes amazing all that work yeah

but the businesses you invest in our

across the board I can't honestly say

well what is Mark like best I could do

that with all the other sharks I cannot

say that I would have to probably if I

was guessing I would say I think he

likes the people best that's about it

and I'm not sure I'm right on that and

I've sat across to you for what nine

years yeah you think I have the mo down

but what what is it so sometimes you so

first you have to ask why do i do Shark

Tank you know and I do sorry tank to

send a message that

the American Dream is alive and well

that you can be anywhere in the country

and start a company and make it to the

carpet in front of us and potentially

get a deal or not even need to come and

see us and and so that's why I do the

show and that kind of drives what I

invest in and so we're you know you guys

might only do a deal because of the

economic benefit I might do a deal

because of the social benefit as well or

because I like the entrepreneur and you

know I want to help that person so it's

not charity but because I think I can

make I'm arrogant enough to think I can

make all those businesses work yes yes

but I hear you don't what no no the

course they don't I tell everybody all

mine agree yeah of course yeah then I

hear you talk about well this one but ya

know you're the first one to say this

one was yeah you know and some of the

entrepreneurs are just idiots and and

you try your best and sometimes they

listen sometimes they don't cuz you're a

telltale sign when you get involved in

the deal for those of people who don't

know you know we make the deal on shark

tank it's a handshake deal that we do

the due diligence right let's say you go

down and do diligence to the first week

or two they're telltale sign that you

know a you're either gonna be used by

the entrepreneur or B these people are

never going to make you money and then

what's your out of that like what do you

say hey forget it let's close this deal

down well if they're lying about the

numbers obviously a lot right away my

mom's mistake a lot of the guys I work

with make honest mistake yeah I mean

there's one as well you know we didn't

ask about the credit card debt you know

you know it's a deal for $100,000 for

10% million dollar valuation and you

know you look at it and then they have

50,000 and sales okay I expected that

that's what you said but there's a

hundred thousand dollars in credit card

debt pretty scary yeah and it did it

didn't come up at all and it wasn't

their fault that we didn't ask that

question it just didn't come up it's

like the sin of omission yeah so you're

out right away you won't reconsider

though I'll still consider it but then I

just really business you know I really

try to stick to the terms that you know

you and eyes have done deals together so

we we both try to stick to the terms

that we agree to but you know what but

what really for me or turn-offs when

immediately they try to raise their

salaries you know if they're trying to

use that money immediately to put it in

their sign your contract I've always

meant to ask you can't forget you school

your other contract no none of the money

is used for salaries yeah we try to say

that right but someone will still come

back yeah and there's things they'll

come back so we try to be protective in

the

Trek so that you can't just immediately

raise money two days later you you know

you can't immediately delude us in other

ways and just you know and sometimes now

you know because now that the people

that come on Shark Tank they all talk to

each other you know so they know all the

deals that have been done and all the

legal issues and everything and so if if

all of a sudden they have a lawyer

that's done 30 shark tank deals Avery

you really run into that yeah Wow and so

then I know they don't really want to

deal you know because they got a lawyer

who typically didn't even deal

what about the guy that you feel like is

using you since it on the show or you

don't and then you're getting involved

in the deal and you realize they're just

using you they don't want to close so

that kind of you oh yeah yeah yeah any

times a year would you say we'll do

chores like if I you know if I do 1516

deals in a year you know probably five

or six yeah well I do a lot less deals

and humans I have a hell of a lot less

money but I can tell you I get one a

year first it's a game here we bet on

them I wonder which one ya know it for

sure because you know you you you get

the people that are there just for the

commercial and they don't really want

the deal or they want to be able to say

like I had to at least to this year

where the deal didn't close and for

little things that they introduced and

they were out there doing all the media

oh yeah Marc's a great investor and this

than that I don't like I don't even talk

to your ass right yeah so yeah you don't

like yeah for sure okay so I've known

you for a long time and I would have to

say when people say what's more Cuban

like are the only people that people ask

me about I have to say what's Kevin like

because before you notice everybody

thinks he's a bastard right here that

too

the next question is what's more Cuban

like and I just have the same ol ants I

go he has an entire zest for living and

what you see is what you get I want to

come up with something more exciting but

that's what comes not boring at all but

that's all I can say what just see is

what you get and he has such a zest for

living why this is that's believing come

by my dad you know my dad did upholstery

on cars um he was just he's just a good

guy and he died last year at 92 and

lived every minute like he was 21

you know my dad was in his 70s 80s 1990

before he started to go downhill

and he was out drinking wine every

single night I wish I married him

Yeah right and you know his name is

nordia old old name and I would hear all

the time yeah I was out drinking with

your dad I was out drinking with your

dad I was out my dad's 85 years old I'm

out drinking what but your dad you know

my dad 87 years old we're taking him to

Vegas and he's sitting at the blackjack

table just staring at every girl that

walks by I mean would your mom okay with

it

yeah my mom did care I mean it's like I

told my wife when I'm 92 I'm marrying a

29 year old whether you like it or not

I've seen you at parties at bars after

shark tank at different events we're

obligated to attend somehow and I am

watched women flock to you like you're a

piece of chocolate candies

why don't I notice that you know that

mark but here's what's wonderful let me

clear my throat second that's unclear my

purse yeah hope you don't here's

what is really amazing to me I've

watched them come like spiders attacking

a prey and you're the prey I've watched

him on a ballroom floor making their way

to you and you sit there and you just

smile and rock with the music or

something and totally ignore them you're

so loyal it's like no no this guy's got

to have a crack there's gotta be

something wrong with this guy he's

cracks in the system but that's not one

how do you do that and how do you not as

a powerful man a rich man a guy that

every woman good-looking gorgeous is

hitting on how do you resist I think men

should have separate marriage license

they're allowed to double okay got all

those qualifications I really think that

would be realistic but how do you resist

I don't see what you see behind your

back oh you do I know but let's say you

don't even see that action I'm telling

you I'm seeing it makes Daymond look

like a in that field and that's a

chick magnet you know but how do you

resist how do you resist the allure of

being able to do whatever you want and

have that kind of power to be who you

want and whatever you want to grab it's

not worth it not where is it yeah yeah

you're just not gonna give up anything

that is the consequences yeah yeah okay

so I guess this means no I don't have a

chance with you ever you know I you know

every marriage

there's always room for one exception

where you agree with your spouse that

you can have one exception mm-hmm

is it really G let me talk to Bill wait

you're going

he can't hear I actually started

thinking that was a rule I'm saying I

never heard of that okay so your dad

when I was at your party I'm sorry to

keep returning to it I heard as many

people say that your dad was the

favorite guy in his neighborhood yeah

that the shear forces personality has

described yeah he just he's a great guy

no no dad now what about you youth what

are you doing Gemma facelift everybody

on the set last year was like yeah

everybody on the set last year behind

your back

who same our kind of face look how I

live no come on I can like what no I'm

clean with me all I swear to God no the

only thing I ever did like three seasons

ago someone convinced me to try Botox

and it up my smile big time so

yeah I can look at the pictures and and

tell which season it was so no yeah no

facelifts I just walk around like this

ya know what's my last a lot of weight

if you think that's really good how to

fix your face yeah absolutely and I went

vegetarian too I mean literally after I

went vegetarian people that all your

skin so much better but let me I will

say this so back in my 20s I dated a

girl who worked for Neiman Marcus and um

you don't want me to stop running I know

it's more they maintain the quality of

this story back in my 20s I dated a girl

who worked for Neiman Marcus who was

always big on you wear sunglasses so you

don't crinkle your eyes and she gave me

this moisturizer and she gave me these

scrubs and so I always started scrubbing

and scrubbing and scrubbing my face and

if you saw my dad I have good genetics

my dad at 92 looked a lot younger

um and so I would always just take care

of my skin and then I started going to a

dermatologist you know which real men

generally don't do yeah and so she would

do the oh I call it pebbles where they

zap you with all these pebbles and all

this stuff

Michael dermabrasion is right right so I

do that city's really ring yeah but you

know for two hours right and so yeah and

so I would do that you know once every

few months and so I've been doing that

for a while and so it's helped and then

losing a

like yeah I just needed to lose weight

so go and vegetarian really help there

and you know picking up my workouts do

you think your vein would you you do oh

yeah I see that yeah yeah I can't watch

myself on Shark Tank

I literally have probably missed a third

or more of the episodes because I can't

watch myself well I watched Shark Tank

you look good but guess what I do on my

side of the page I've covered the screen

I don't look at myself see that's the

way I think about it yeah I think you

look great yeah well you look great well

see why don't why not what's with the

t-shirts everybody who says why does he

always wear t-shirts why does Morgan

always wear t-shirt why would i well why

would you have moisture that rests up

why would I do that let me tell you you

could buy a really cool cut shirt that

really shows you physique stretches

across the chest a little tight on the

upper arms the kind of shirts that make

a guy really look like a hunk yeah no I

just like to be comfortable yeah so you

better dress up for anything shark tank

is pretty much it you know go to church

synagogue nothing don't bother to dress

up unless you know I have a really good

reason to know and I think that's part

of being a billionaire is how it is you

know know that way always t-shirts

aren't even fashion shirts they're kind

of just whatever's in the class I mean

that's okay but it's not designer money

no I mean do I have know if I have any

design of t-shirts you don't I used to

buy Versace like right after I sold my

first company I was like for saachi's

cool and I put out of Miami and I'd have

these bizarre oh there's a picture of me

I'll show you with Marc the guy's the

flight attendant where I've got nothing

but a vest on and these prasat jeans and

yeah it was just that was a phase when

you're finding yourself I think you

found yourself an era I guess we're

never gonna see anything other than a

cheap t-shirt you're right yeah I mean

yeah maybe I'll wear the the I don't

know we'll see maybe I just won't wear

shirt at all I get a good enough shape

that's what let me tell you what these

sharks say behind your back that

fascinates us what was none of us are

able to pull it out which is your

ability to answer a text the minute you

get it emails emails emails text phone

calls how is it that we don't hear from

your assistant who's an assistant to an

assistant and that you are on your game

and write on everything it sounds

it just strikes us like this is the

weirdest thing you put three days behind

in text for example and thinking I'm

pretty good because I'm keeping up I'm

the only one who sees them yeah and I do

the quantity you get everybody wants to

catch you like going back in my business

career it's always been easier for me

just to do it then to explain to

somebody what I want and then for them

to go look at it then then bring it to

me and says you know do you want to take

a look at this because you might be

interested in this you know it's just

easier for me because I've always done

email I mean I have emails going back 25

years you know and it's just like delete

delete delete delete you know I can just

read the first paragraph and know as

opposed to somebody not knowing sitting

down reviewing everything explaining it

to them you know trying to adjust and

figure out what to do next it's just

easier for me to do it faster you can

kind of get in a business deal because

it's more effective it's faster and you

know your best judgment is your own

judgment but I don't get it with all

this stuff you do I don't get why you

don't have a barrier between you and the

world

why would I because it saves time now I

know it's the exact opposite no I think

it does save time the number of hours in

the day so far as people getting at you

don't you want a barrier between you and

all the people who want to get out

should they're not a little business to

you no no no that's the fun part of life

unbelievable I think I'll be frightened

to death I do that for a day know the

cooks I get at you that way makes it

even more fun oh my god what we're

finding out today is Mark Cuban is not

who I always thought he was he is a nut

job

I do yeah yeah for sure these are not

the right answers so have another plug

mark you're online texting you're on the

email you're constantly on on on on on

have you pull out the plug or is it not

necessary is out of fallacy yeah I don't

need to unplug for the most part I mean

I'll play with my kids you know you know

chase around my daughter take him to

school pick him up go play basketball

work out just the normal stuff you know

constant flow so there's not a category

for your family a category for your work

anything like no it's just you know just

trying to do the right thing try to

connect with my family and be available

to them do fun stuff with them and I

mean look you know with the kids the

kids I'm my kids ages it's more about

them than their parents right and so

it's more I have to work harder to

interject myself where I can and you

know try to get their time and you know

kidnap them to go to lunch or my son's

attend is still fun like you know we

will go get a hotel room he ice cream

and tell fart jokes all night you know

for him to stay up until 2:00 in the

morning right you know and do stupid

stuff and so yeah but yeah with my 13

and 16 year old it's like everything's a

one-word answer so Alyssa Howard tryouts

cuz she has basketball size oh okay

what'd you do play basketball keep

making his shots it's basketball

she missed any shots we played

basketball dad what do you think get off

my back you know whereas in my 16 year

old daughter is more hyper and

everything's like I'm more of an ordeal

so but she's like I'm study dad leave me

alone leave me alone and so what you

wake me up dang it you know or she

thinks she's cool right so she'll say

freakin all the time right or instead of

giving me the finger she'll give me a

pinky right you know she's got her own

little ways around it then so and I just

laugh at it but yeah they're good kids

and so it's fun to spend as much time as

I can one thing I didn't see in the

children that I met the night of your

party is no arrogance I didn't see an

ounce of arrogance and you can usually

see that from across oh yeah yeah and I

mean then the reason to be arrogant I

mean they're good kids they really

really are and I'm proud of them

you think they're gonna talk about you

the way you talk about your father

I hope so yeah I hope so really they're

gonna have that similar relationship I

think you know they're gonna call me

stupid and silly and goofy and they're

right you know but that's hopefully what

makes it fun okay so let me ask you it's

just one last question maybe - no - more

or less

I'm here for you barb whatever you need

okay what are you working on now that no

one knows about why don't give me a

secret so I can say I know something

about mark that no one else knows what

he's working on right now so I'm working

on a lot of health care stuff and

balance you think that's a growing

industry no don't even a lucky break or

what happens no more because I think

what's happening with health care in

this country is back-ass half words that

nothing we're doing really works as well

as it should and it started when the

Republicans we're looking to do a repeal

and replace and get rid of Obamacare

what

has its own problems but I just started

saying okay if I was going to solve this

as a business person how would I

approach it so I just started you know

working with some economist and working

with a lot of healthcare people both

from the publicans and Democrats side

and so we're making some progress

there's a lot of good thing you're doing

is pro bono work it's not with an I

Twitter no no I don't care if I make any

money at all look I don't I stopped

trying to just make as much money as I

could a long time ago I've got enough

money right it's more I value my time a

lot more than I do my next dollar I

don't have to worry about money but you

know I just want to you know try to look

back at some point and say okay I didn't

 it up what do you think is wrong

with the health care system nobody seem

to have solved that at all really yeah

he's critical the fundamental problem is

not everybody can get the care they need

it the cost they can afford I think

people understand that concept though

nobody seems to agree on how to skin

that cat yeah and there's a lot of

ideologies and I'm trying to you know

balance the two together and bringing

them together but fundamentally we have

to make people healthier and to do you

know if people are healthier they

consume less health care until they're

older right and for long-term care um

and there's ways to approach that

there's ways to the the drug system is

such a mess right now and so I started a

company there because there's so many in

efficiencies people will start companies

in the pharmacy industry and then the

big guys will just buy em out and those

just starts companies know when they're

going to get bought out as opposed to

trying to change the game so we're

starting companies that aren't looking

to get bought even though we've already

had offers to sell the company and then

do it right you're gonna get blood yes I

won't do it right yeah I won't I won't

sell it I'd rather turn them upside down

and disrupt the industry and then in

terms of healthcare programs I think

there's a you know I'm modeling I'm

working with the RAND Corporation to

model a hybrid of single-payer so if

your makeup - let's just say $40,000

your healthcare should be free if you

make between 40 to a million dollars a

year then you should pay some percentage

of your income in total yeah yeah and

that's the whole point right so you know

nobody

the average person is gonna pay 8% of

their health care 8% of their income for

health care total all in no exceptions

but how are you going to let's assume

you come up with a premise

that you really believe you can pull out

that won't really work without being a

politician without having that power

behind you what are you gonna do is it

so I've been I've been everywhere with

it I've been in front of Republican and

Democratic senators candidates you name

it I've sat in front of them and to make

a suggestion no just a second on their

own well no because they everybody knows

it's a problem yes the good news is I

don't give money to any political

candidates so I can be independent and

so they know that there needs to be a

solution and you know they're listening

to me so where I'm at right now is you

know I've learned from everybody I've

taken input over the last two and a half

years from everybody with a different

opinion and put it together into a plan

and now it's getting modeled by a bunch

of economists at the RAND Corporation is

like the biggest thank you yeah exactly

and so you know that the numbers come

out the way I think they will then I'll

have a I'll have something to say look

here's what you think here's what the

numbers say here's what how you would

approach it here's how I to provide it's

still an option you got to get them to

listen to you unless you run that's my

job yeah that's my job then for anything

no I mean the family I ordered the town

really yeah you know when I met Tiffany

at your home the first thing I said is

mark gonna run what you say you know and

after that everybody said is Mark gonna

run I said no no I believe Tiffany yeah

because yeah we have family vote and

they said no well you're dodged a bullet

is you like your enemy on the shark

tanks it's always dodged a bullet when I

get past ok back to shark tank good

what's what's your complaint with Robert

ICU it's a truth you're in your seat

when Robert does something it's oh it's

Robert he's the nicest guy in the world

he's a nice guy I like rocks you what

yes you know it's me uh Robert give me

the list

it must be more than one no it's just

you know everybody's got the type of

person really you know that annoys them

and just Robert screaming at the top of

his lungs all the time Robert screaming

at the top ok wait I'll do my Robert

surely you want to get down sorry do my

Robert recitation you do I you know it's

funny I never thought of a picture of

Robert screaming at the time that's true

yes oh you're gonna do it I don't have

to do it you're gonna do it oh okay well

that's cute what's wrong with that

it was cute the first 327 times God you

just can't tolerate it okay what's wrong

with Lori Eileen the Lord doesn't look

that Norma except when she's going to

look we all know you're mumbling my yeah

and so we're all long-winded at some

level when we go on right because that's

the hardest part of the show is going

out and not sounding stupid it's only

that two people is saying why is

figuring out why are you gonna go out

when you know why you want to go out why

is that the hardest part of show

business on Shark Tank because you want

to sound smart and you want to

contribute something to the entrepreneur

you want them to know you want to leave

them with something of value that makes

them a little bit smarter about their

business and you want to do it in a way

that sounds like you care and sometimes

you do and sometimes you don't and you

know you want to get you want to get it

over with

and that literally if somebody walks on

I'm guessing you do the same thing that

I know there's just no chance that I'm

gonna do it absolutely no when you're

out right away yeah and I'm already

thinking okay what am I going to say

yeah we take endless notes that all outs

no one can use that when that's been

used not bad but it's so hard to come up

with an out that hasn't been done five

hundred sizable so there's an old old

episode where the guy called me cubes

right and I said yeah juice is for

calling me cubes I'm out yeah and wasn't

cause he called me cubes it was just an

opportunity to go out what she bother

back you know I don't care everybody

calls me cubes I don't care but I needed

a way to go out and that's so funny oh

my god who's your favorite shark yeah I

know it no now what'd I tell you but I

tell you all the time why do I tell you

you're my favorite shark oh I don't like

to what do I tell you that you're really

really good at better than all the other

sharks I know exactly what it is but I

want everybody here

what is it no fool barbers get the best

people skills yeah yeah she's her

ability to recognize begin bad in

somebody and what they'll be like as an

entrepreneur what would be like as a

person are they kind compassionate

willing to work I have they had their

backs up against the wall

Barbara picks up on that stuff in a

minute it's funny enough mark you but I

think you pick up on that better than I

do

no there's no way I mean because I look

at the numbers I look at the business

and I try to drill down to see okay good

and then the arrogant part of me says

well I can fix that you know where is

that where you in your case you look

that's a character flaw you see it all

the time you know this this this but

your character flaw is this and I just

don't trust that so I can't do business

with you why didn't I see that

yeah and so what do you think on the

opposite side of the equation when

you're excited about an entrepreneur or

a business partner or a life partner

what do you think is the one thing that

you think makes a person a winner and I

hate these questions one thing I know

but I'll rephrase it what do you think

is one of the most important things that

you use as your measuring stick to say

that person where that person is

worthwhile having them as a purpose of

my life whatever P says are they

learners are they workers will they

admit they're wrong and adjust you know

you've got to be very agile in business

you've got to be very adaptive in

business it's not just all one way to

the highway and I think if somebody is

willing to adjust willing to work hard

and is always learning and always

selling then good things will happen if

I find on the flip side if someone's

always looking for an ounce you know if

only I raise more money if only we

marketed more if only you know our

advertising was better if only I had the

right person if only this if only that

and everything's an excuse then it never

works and you consider that a character

flaw yeah

it repeats itself yeah be good because

I'm sure you see a - it was the best

idea was the best this but we just

didn't raise enough money if only we had

more money why didn't you know you knew

that going in you know if only i iron

lots of times someone will try to come

up in and say well this isn't working we

need to hire the right person

and then they'll say well I think I've

got the best marketing person in the

world like that person was so great as a

marketing person they weren't leaving

where they were before because they want

to let them go or they'd be doing their

own thing but they'll try to hire that

one person that saves the company and

when you do that

that typically means it's over and you

know when I hear any of that

I don't really internalize the stories a

lot about it yeah go ahead oh yeah

tranquil ready yeah leave a little bit

for me okay I want to say I got I got to

drink out of the same bottle as you it's

my diseases yeah yeah but um my reaction

to that is always like a southern

feeling of hopelessness I just I don't

know where that comes from I feel

hopeless about the business I can't even

quantify yeah when somebody just has an

excuse for everything you feel like

you're gonna hear the next one the next

one okay so what about the character

flaw in a friendship or what turns you

on about a friend why do you choose

other than the old friends who with you

I don't really care I haven't I haven't

gone looking for new friends but people

find you and you make friendships easily

yeah so what is it that attracts you to

something yeah I'll let them be my

friend or forget it I mean there's

running buddies and there's friends

friend you know becoming a friend

happens over years you know it's not

something that oh we're besties right

you're my new BFF you know it takes time

it wears running buddies oh yeah let's

go to the game let's let's go hang out

and get a drink or let's all go out to

dinner you know that those people come

and go and it's it's no big deal

how many close friends would you

consider you have um I mean I have a lot

of close friends but

yeah you know from when I first moved to

Dallas they're still the same friends

people have worked with people I grew up

with people I went to college with I

don't know there's you know probably 15

20 but you know I think the greatness of

my friends is we don't have to talk

every day and if we don't see each other

for a year or two like we just did a

boy's trip that was we hadn't done in 10

years and we all got together and did

stupid stuff in Vegas um a little bit

not as stupid as we used to do but I'm

sure but yeah but it was like we'd been

doing it every year you know and so like

it got together some last year

exactly and so they're all they'll

always be my friends and will always be

close but you know you know what like

you know when you have a family you have

kids

that's your friendship those your

friends right and so you don't have as

much time like when I was single and it

was like what are we doing tonight you

have a hard time trusting all those

people you cited it was all prior to

college or during college old friends

before you were a billionaire do you

have a hard time trusting people's

motivations no because I don't need

anything from them

well said Wow you know it's not like

okay you know a lot of times with

friendships particular when you're

younger it's like alright I need that

emotional support I want somebody in my

life that's gonna be there for me I

don't need that from anybody so it's

like if you're my friend you're my

friend and if not okay whatever yeah

Kuban as usual 150% of r-cubed thanks

bud thank you so much no fun really

thank you so much

I love you up there but you'd have to

replace them with somebody else which

would be hard cuz you're so goddamn

loyal yeah he's good guy good guy oh you

got a great Krueger yeah everybody's

good come on

I don't hire any luck good people I mean

I've got a workout buddy I've got me

everything yeah I kind of borrow all

your people here you know when I come to

New York

yeah that's shopping there you're

working out with her dad's body what's

even more shocking is I never found out

about it until I heard from somebody

from your own family why you didn't tell

me you did too bad you're in the back

row that's never a good sign no cuz I

they knew the routine like I got there

they've been doing the routine for

months

yeah and I said okay and then I want to

get another time you know yeah like I

saw what she said okay okay she said you

- out right before the ending which I

thought that's no I didn't don't know

but that that the budget but stuff

destroyed me destroyed me like one cheek

was like ruined for her a month but it's

so joyful is it no

yeah the dance party fun but yeah the

police don't have any mention there's

like a bar workout part was easy I mean

that was fine but the the the bar part

work on your cheeks and me yeah I just

don't have that flexibility right you're

like it's like a dog beam and you know

you're like yeah yeah give me the hip

flexibility right yeah let me show you my wall Shamy
