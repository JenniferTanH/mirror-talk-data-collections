mrs obama as a little girl would you

have imagined yourself as first lady of

the united states or

the star of your own kids tv show

absolutely not

i mean when i was very young i wanted to

be a mommy like my mommy

and then when i got a little older i

thought i wanted to be a pediatrician

and then i got a little older and i

realized there was math involved and i

wasn't good at that

and then i decided on law because i

talked a lot so you know i could only

imagine for my life what was before me

and

this wasn't it so no

is the short answer well now you are

the star of your own kids show waffles

and mochi

what has that been like has it been a

lot of fun oh it it's my favorite

project i mean you know

you have followed us and supported a lot

of the work that we've done

and i love it all but this project

you know it just sort of it brings it

all full circle

um because it brings me back to kids and

nutrition

it's fun um the creative the co-creators

erica thornlin and jeremy connor or are

funny they bring the education but they

bring the funny

um and it's something that all families

can enjoy this isn't just a kids show

it's a family show

and that's what drew me to it because i

i was like i i'd watch this without my

kids because i don't have little kids

anymore so

i am so excited about this it is a

quality uh program for sure and i'm glad

to be a part of it

and you guys are uh partnering up with

partnership for a healthier america

in a year where we've all witnessed

these heartbreaking images

of people lined up for miles at food

banks

why is it so important particularly this

year

well this has been a hard year for

millions i mean

so many of us have complained about

being cooped up and

isolated and it's just hard it's

it's a strain but the truth is there are

a lot of people who have lost

work they're people who are struggling

to keep food on their table there are

families in this country today that are

going hungry

and so uh we're partnering with a

partnership for a healthier america

to create the pass the love campaign um

where our goal is to feed a million

families

in need right here in this country and

folks can go on to the website

wafflesmochie.org and they can uh

find out how to be a part of that effort

as well as

uh use the website to interact with the

show

um the kids can get on in their recipes

that they can

practice and um they can win their own

badges because waffles and mochi

always earn a badge from mrs oh when

they complete an assignment

um so it's a it's it's the site is for

a little bit of everything but you can

learn more about the pass the love

campaign

there too well as you said this show is

for moms too

we know that you know we're all watching

the shows our kids watch

and this has been a really trying year

for mothers mothers who are

working from home and teaching our kids

two million women

have left the work force this year

what do you say to all of of those that

are struggling

you know mothers were all always

already hard on ourselves and this is a

time where we have to give ourselves a

break

um this is not the year to try to do it

all

and to beat yourself up when you can't

this has been stressful so we have to

give ourselves a break as mothers

do the best that we can and remember in

the end that what's most

important for our kids is that they know

we love them

and that we try to be as consistent as

we can but we can't get everything right

the other thing i would encourage

mothers to do is to find

some time just to get a moment by

yourself

even if it means going into the bathroom

lock a door and if you don't have a lock

barricade yourself in

and just get a moment to take a deep

breath

because we can't be there for our

families if we're not there for

ourselves first

i've hidden in the pantry i have to

admit

maybe while eating my kids string cheese

i can only

imagine i mean my girls are young adults

they're running from us now

i remember those years they are

barricading themselves in their rooms

because they're tired of talking us

but you but you've said that one of the

most beautiful parts of this year was

the unexpected

uninterrupted time with your girls i

mean you thought they were off

and go gone to college and now all of a

sudden they're back what's it been like

it's been great for us i i feel for them

because

you know malia is a senior this year

this was her last year in college

and sasha has essentially missed her

second year in college so i feel for

them but for barack and i we

have cherished this time i mean you

don't get that time back again where you

see

your children in their adult life

you know uh having a different set of

conversations

cherishing a different kind of

relationship i'm no longer

just parenting i i'm guiding i'm

counseling

and it's just fun seeing how their minds

work

what they're afraid of it's even fun

just peeking in and hearing them

in their online classrooms it's like oh

you

actually did your reading you have an

opinion

i like that like probably astounded by

them

and and i i read that um your husband

was shocked by how much one of their

boyfriends ate

oh yeah we're speaking of food yes we

had uh

the the pleasure of having malia's

boyfriend with us for part of the time

last year because he was graduating and

was afraid to go home and miss an

internship so we housed him

we didn't grow up we did we didn't raise

boys

and so they eat a lot

and sometimes we forget that he'd need

to eat he'd need to eat often

so we had to really adjust our shopping

and our eating schedule the poor boy

would be sitting around waiting for the

next meal it's like

we we weren't thinking about lunch so

yeah it's a whole different ball

game and we just got a little taste of

it

one of the things that i think people

have found comfort in

is your honesty and you posted a

photograph and and you wrote an open

message really to everybody that's in

which you said

i hope you all are allowing yourself to

feel

whatever it is you're feeling so i

wonder at the

darkest points of your last year what

what were you feeling

you know the darkest points were you

know when we

we when we felt bombarded by everything

you know a virus that felt out of

control with no

real clear solution uh before us the

country

shut down racial un unrest

visualizing the kind of injustice that

can happen

on the streets seeing young people

despair

at where this country was going i mean

it was a it was a lot and it continues

to be a lot

because we still haven't solved those

problems so

you know i i shared that because it was

the truth of how i was feeling it's hard

to say oh i'm great i'm fine when deep

down

you know that's a lot to struggle with

and i know that as an adult at least i

have some perspective and context to

bring

to life most young people don't um

and you want young people to stay

encouraged to feel

okay about their down times but know

that life is long

you want them to realize that there's a

a brighter light

at the end of the tunnel and to just

stay stay

fast steadfast in your pursuit of

coming out of that darkness you know so

if we don't share

those emotions with our kids then they

think those feelings that they have

are abnormal so we have to kind of learn

to be

open and honest about our down times

as well yeah talk about our lowest times

yeah absolutely

um as you mentioned in this last year we

watched

george floyd call out for his mom we

watched rihanna taylor's

mom grieve her baby as a mom yourself

how do you like how do you come to terms

with all of that

yeah you you you don't come to terms

with it

but you do have to talk about it you

have to you you have to

sit down with your children and

acknowledge the truth

of the world we live in um and

we what i know is that you can't shy

away from those discussions

even if they're uncomfortable um or

painful

uh and i don't think if there's a

there's an age where it's too soon to

have those

conversations now the conversation you

have with a seven-year-old is very

different

with the conversation that you're going

to have with a teenager

but finding ways to help

young people know that what they see and

feel is real

that they're not crazy that that

that we still do struggle with race in

this country

um and that they can't take that in they

have to know that that's not their

problem to own uh so how i come to

grips with it is to talk about it and to

talk about it

often and to be ready to take on my kids

pain and their questions and their

concerns

and do it with as much truth and honesty

as i can muster

like i can't imagine how many moms and

their kids were sitting around

kitchen tables having those

conversations well and the truth is

jenna

this isn't new for minority families i

mean these are the conversations that we

always have to have because you know

when you're sending your child out into

a world

where people might fear them simply

because of the color of their skin

you have to prepare them early we don't

we we've never had the luxury

of not talking about these issues and

now hopefully

the rest of the country the rest of the

world understands that it's not enough

for

us in minority communities to have those

conversations

if we're all not having them with our

children

yeah so this time maybe it feels like

there's

real progress well we have to hold

hold that that that hope up high because

uh

you know we we have to continue to make

progress you know you've got little ones

growing up and i know you have a vision

for the kind of world that you want your

your children to walk into

and it is one of fairness and justice

and equality

and unity and we have to work for that

it won't just happen

uh just because we want it now you know

we have to sacrifice for it we have to

use our voices to speak on and i think

that more people

after this year uh are ready to do work

yeah i think so too um i

remember talking with you i wonder if

you'll remember this and talked about

life in the white house although you

didn't take a single moment for granted

that there were moments of real

loneliness

and so i wonder when you watched meghan

markle

speak out the other night if what went

through your mind um

public service in uh is a it's a

it's it's a bright sharp hot spotlight

and most people don't understand it

and nor should they um

but you know there are ways to uh steal

yourself

and protect yourself but the thing that

i always keep in mind

is that none of this is about us

public service it's about the people

that we serve

um and especially in times like this you

know i want the country to be focused on

the the big issues that we face you know

creating jobs for people who don't have

jobs you know

feeding people who are going hungry

making sure that people

actually take the vaccine and understand

the importance of continuing to protect

ourselves because

we are not out of the woods on

this issue yet so you know

i always try to push the light back out

uh and focus it on the folks

that we're actually here to serve

you but what about when she talked about

the fact that she experienced racism

i mean i feel like that was

heartbreaking to hear that she felt like

she

was in her own family

you know her own family thought

differently of her

as i said before race isn't a new

construct

in this world for people of color you

know um

so it wasn't a complete surprise to

sort of hear her her feelings and to

have them articulated i think

the thing that i hope for and the thing

i think about is that

this first and foremost is a family and

i pray for forgiveness and healing for

them

uh so that they can use this as a

teachable moment for us

all you know living in a world where

there are

there's a lot of interracial uh families

and we've got to learn to live together

and support each other and value each

other

i think we still have work to do uh to

understand

where we all are coming from and that's

gonna take time

uh but it's it's got it's it's it

requires effort and honesty

to make that happen you

all um the ex-president's club just got

back together y'all all got vaccinated

yeah albeit virtually and it seemed like

y'all were all in the same clinic

but you weren't uh do you feel like

there's hope on the horizon

yes yes it's it is here we have a

vaccine

uh i have taken it and i would encourage

everyone to take it when they have the

the chance to take it

um i believe in science i take the flu

shot

every year and knock on wood i don't get

sick

that often so i don't want people to be

afraid of it

um you know this is you know we are

blessed to have

people uh who are chemists and

scientists and doctors

who are doing the right thing but we

have to do our part

and if we do we are we will come out of

this thing

uh it has happened before there have

been pandemics

in this world before and we've come out

on the other side

with cooperation and consistency in our

our behavior our

willingness to sacrifice for each other

uh

and and and getting the vaccine so

yes i think we will come out on the

other side of this thing whole

uh and we'll be able to the country will

open back up

and we will be able to sit in concerts

together and

have meals and restaurants i think we'll

always be

uh impacted by this time i don't think

this

this is something that we'll forget so

there may be some changes afoot

as a result of this past year but we'll

we'll learn from those changes we'll

grow from them and will continue

to build this great nation

well now that you're vaccinated is there

anything you're looking forward to or

have you been able to

hug your mom yet or do any of these

things that i know you've been dreaming

about

she's first on the list but my mom is no

joke about this she's still sort of like

i'm not sure if i'm ready to see you yet

i was like

okay ma all right so when when she's

ready

that will be an epic hug yeah yeah but i

understand she is

a senior citizen and she doesn't play

she's not going to put herself in harm's

way

so but she's at the top of my list

getting back to chicago our hometown and

uh

and and giving my mom a hug or at least

getting her out here if she'll come

so so there's a lot to look forward to

there sure

is uh it's no secret that dr biden is a

good friend of yours

or what can you expect when y'all can

get back together

maybe a reunion at the white house

you know buddy again yeah i stand ready

and willing to support this first lady

in any way that she needs um

you know this is a small club as as you

very well know

and few people know what this is like

and i have told her that if there's

anything i can do

to help ease her transition or support

her work i'm i'm ready to do that and

i know that when they're ready for it

they'll reach out and

you know i'm looking forward to doing

continuing the work of joining forces

i know she's expressed interest in doing

more work with our military families and

i hope to be able to support her in that

but whatever she needs i'll be there for

you recently said that you're on the way

towards retirement which shocked me

because i've traveled with you

and the amount of energy you have but

that you couldn't wait to make fun of

your husband's golf game and

was that is that serious i can't imagine

that well

you know it's sort of sort of serious

but as you know i mean we

we are we've got a lot on our plate

right now but you know we're we're at

that age

you know we're moving into our 60s my

husband is 60 this year so

we're we will retire one day and

if we're gonna do that in the way that

we want to which is to have

a legacy that we can pass on to the next

generation

then we've got to spend these next years

really being thoughtful about that exit

strategy because if you don't have an

exit strategy

sometimes you just don't exit and they

work forever

i i don't want that um so

it's not imminent but it's it's we're

closer

to that than we are not and what do you

imagine

you know i always see us continuing to

work

and be supportive particularly of young

people i mean that's

gonna be at the core of the work of the

presidential

uh foundation um you know there there

will always be young people who

will need some guidance and support and

we stand

ready to to help those young people

make their way towards their goals so i

look forward to that so

our our future involves young people

always heard knitting but that that can

right knitting do whatever you start

you're later

i became it's it's now known i mean

probably because people are like

michelle obama is knitting right

well now i at the beginning of

quarantine

i thought okay we don't know how long

we're going to be locked down let's get

some paints and some

puzzles and i just stocked up on stuff

and then i was like

ah i should order some knitting needles

i never knitted before

so i got this basic kit and i made

i learned the stitches then i made a

scarf

then i made a blanket then i just got

hooked and then i got

cats i just finished a sweater for

barack i mean

wow really i really

find it very meditative uh so

let me not go on i'll sound a little

crazy after no i think that's

so cool right now so forgive me

i like it i've seen a i've talked to

have a father that's an artist too which

i came out of nowhere so i get it

um i got to sit down with you to talk

about your book becoming which

now is out for young adults which must

have been

fun to to rewrite it

well we didn't really um i worked with

the publishers and their young adult

editors

and we i i didn't want to rewrite it

and and we had sort of looked at

versions that sort of

fundamentally changed chapters and i was

like no that's not what the book is and

that's not what the story is and it's

hard to say what would you leave out

so the book is basically

the same it's a little shorter we

condense some paragraphs to make them

more accessible we change words out that

we're a little too

you know an adult um but the core of the

book

is essentially the same we added an

introduction that's especially

structured for our my young readers um

added some more pictures that

were a little more kid-friendly um kind

of the fun times in the white house

and uh more my interactions with young

people

and online there's actually a a study

guide

that um parents or book clubs or

teachers can use to help sort of walk

young readers

uh through the content because what i

realize is that the young

adults version of a book isn't just for

kids it's yeah

people who are where english is a second

language or adult readers who are just

learning so i didn't want to change the

story fundamentally i wanted to be as

honest and as real

with this version of the book as we were

with the original

so well i think it's

i feel like it's really appropriate too

because you're going to be speaking

you know writing directly to young women

and men who are

becoming who are trying to figure out

what it is they want to be

exactly exact i mean the story truly my

journey

was told with young people in mind um

you know sharing so much of my early

years my childhood was was really

me tapping into the experiences that all

kids are facing you know those

insecurities those first

failures and embarrassments the you know

the

you know the the first time you got into

an argument with a friend your first

kiss

all of that you know um those are

important things to hold on to

and i want kids to understand that now

that those small moments that you think

are nothing well those are the kernels

um

in your story uh and i want young kids

to start valuing that

um because they're gonna they're gonna

be able to look

back and point to some of those uh

those small moments to say aha that's

that explains

my feelings today or that gives me

clarity

on why i approach problem solving in

this way you just

never know it's the sights and the

sounds and the smells

of your childhood that stay with you i

mean those are the things i draw on

those

messages those images i still drawn

at 57 years old um some of those

memories are the memories that guide me

they they

they whisper in my ear as i approach the

work that i do even today um

so yes i'm excited to hear what young

people think about it what they're

learning from it

um i'm starting to have conversations

with young people

uh and it's just you know it's just

fascinating to hear how they

see the world and i love to hear their

voices and to encourage them to use them

to get comfortable hearing their voices

in in the out there in the world

so uh i'm excited about it

you know what speaking of i um

i got a somebody emailed me and said

this happened 12 years ago this was in

um maybe early december november

somebody said this happened 12 years ago

on this day and it was me

as a young person showing your and my

sister

showing your really young people how to

slide down the banister and i just

thought like

wow that those are little memories that

felt like

even 12 years later something important

to me and they remember

malia and sasha remember that time more

than a lot of things that i would have

thought of because they saw those

pictures too

and we sat and had an entire dinner

about those first days and uh how

they just cherished you know these two

young beautiful women who had done what

they were doing who had taken time out

of their lives

because it was very clear you guys were

excited to do it

you can't you came in from where

wherever you were especially

to meet with them and they knew that and

it made a difference

in in their entire experience so

you should do you feel like that

that america that small gesture but you

know

people may be from different political

parties girl you know girls showing

girls like that we're getting closer

back to that america how our leaders act

in the world

sets the tone um you you know that

i know that we all know that i mean

people follow the lead

um and i i think that we

as a country are going to look for

different kind of leadership

because it just feels better it's just a

better way to

live in the world um it's it's it's

better when we're kind and we're

generous

to one another it feels good inside i am

praying

that we are going to get back to that

um but again it's going to take all of

us telling ourselves

this is really what we want uh because

it's not just how we vote but it's how

we act every day towards each other and

those are the choices that we make

every day in the gas station line at the

bus stop

at work um as we're picking up our kids

at school we are modeling for our young

people

what kind of america we want to live in

so

i know i'm going to do my part putting

out the light

shedding hope and getting people

reminding people what we can be
