most humans who could ever exist never

will think I've heard you say if there's

been more humans that have not come into

existence than do exist by far and so

the fact that you exist at all

is against stupefying odds of who gets

born and who does not any moment you

spend squandering those moments you are

alive does disrespect to all those who

will never even be born

I believe that each and every one of us

has the power within ourselves to create

the life that we really want and I want

to help give you the tools to make that

happen

I'm Danica Patrick and I'm pretty

intense

[Music]

welcome to the pretty intense podcast

today's guest is someone that is about a

million times more intelligent than me

and I'm not gonna lie it was a little

intimidating Neil deGrasse Tyson

astrophysicist not even sure what that

means but look he is amazing and his

depth of knowledge is not only about

stars and space and where did we come

from and you know Adams and nucleuses

and subatomic particles and a whole

bunch of other words I can't think of

because they're too big for me but we

talked about religion and you know that

was something that really surprised me

because look he's a scientist and

scientists and science and religion

don't really go together but he he knows

a lot about it and we talked about that

we talked about why he knows a lot about

it

we we talked about another interesting

topic that was fascinating and that's

just the trajectory of being 1% more

intelligent so chimpanzees are 1% less

intelligent than humans

so what's 1% warm what's 1% more of that

and then of course I asked the ultimate

question do you believe in aliens so I

hope you have an amazing time listening

to this and learn because I sure did

well I became a huge fan with cosmos Oh

excellent why are you like a few years

ago okay I put that on I was like that

looks interesting and I've always been

blown away if you're not something's

wrong I mean I used to I used to

remember I used to sit there as a kid

nice to look up and I said I was like it

goes on forever yeah that just gives me

a headache at the pure thought of it and

it still gives me a headache to think

that montt that idea of like it just

keeps going and there's no one but there

has been and if there isn't and what's

the end I mean so here's the thing our

senses are five traditional senses were

forged sort of in the plains of Africa

where there is no need to think about

know or understand infinity we have no

capacity for that it's our mathematics

that shows us that it's real it's our

observations of the universe that show

the infinitude of it all and you just

got a deal we want answers but you can't

be a scientist this is the interesting

paradox scientists want answers to but

we are completely content steeped in

ignorance because it's the ignorance

that attracts us not the answers to fit

to figure it out to figure it out

journey it's the journey to that

frontier I tweeted recently just cuz it

came upon me very funny oh thank you

that as the area of our knowledge grows

so too does the perimeter of our

ignorance hmm and so right so with the

scientific you're saying a bigger center

gets the bigger the outside outside

outside the perimeter you know why it's

like age it makes me feel like a

gigantic Fortin you because you know

more you know more of what you don't

know that's what it is and here's the

problem here's a prevailing problem in

society it's knowing enough to think

you're right but not enough to know that

you're wrong

I have to do this with you a lot of tea

that's insightful okay I'm saying okay

yep

you learned a little bit about something

and you say I got this yeah I got this

well maybe you don't but you don't know

enough to know that you don't write you

have to learn more to realize you

actually didn't know so the great

challenge for us all to repeat the

phrase is knowing enough to think you're

right but not knowing enough to know

that you're wrong and that gets a lot of

people in trouble because they rise up

thinking they got the answers and so as

a scientist there are answers we have we

know a lot about how the world works but

our job is to hack our way a cutting

through the brush and ramble to the

frontier that boundary between what is

known and unknown in the universe and

when you stand there and look out into

the abyss you can't fear that that has

to attract you right and and so we we

celebrate not knowing I have a whole

video see what do you mean celebrate we

don't know it's like hey where's the

next place where we don't know it I got

over there oh my gosh or someone makes

an observation or discovery that we

don't understand we don't understand it

let's have a party let's have a

conference and let's have bring all our

best ideas to the table and we'll talk

about it it'll get excited about it yeah

that's that's that is it so so if you

have to have answers yeah I think that's

in white that a religion kind of does

that religion gives you answers to all

manner of things what happens after you

die what happens you know your spirit

your this and people read it they got

the answer and it gives them certain

comfort I think I hear here's how one of

these conversations has played out

before so a religious person might ask

me so how the universe get here looking

at the Big Bang and that describes

everything like from that first moment

and then and then they'll say

but what was around before the Big Bang

and I'll say I don't know that's what we

got top people working on it well they

have to be something is there we're

blind

thank you yes yes

we got singularity people working on

that they call string theorists hmm so

you were right on the button there but

they'll say there had to be something I

said I don't know maybe there was

nothing I don't know we're working up

they had to be something that's God

right so they got the answer yeah

so we want to answer they insist they

say God and then they go home and they

can sleep well at night

whereas a scientist on the frontier

hardly ever gets a good night's know if

it was distracted by the unknown you

said that the thing that scares you most

is not knowing the right question to ask

it's not that I don't wanna say it

scares me but it it it intrigues me

so it feels to me like this edge of the

frontier that you're talking about is

scary because you don't know what to ask

next but it's exciting and so if

something excites you right

you should dive in it's like how I felt

about like for me last year I hosted the

ESPYs and I was scared shitless like I

was like I'm not funny

I'm not presentable you don't see it I

can't do this and I was like but I

really want to but I was scared but I

was excited and I had to finally fight

off the scared enough to say yes because

I feel like if something scares you and

excites you somewhat the same you should

go with it

you should dive in I think there's deep

wisdom there and often you respect the

thing you fear the most and you'll you

will delicately navigate let which you

fear the most so you might be giving

that the most attention the most care

the most concern so yeah so for me

people ask that that point about the

question I don't yet know to ask is a

follow-on to the question what is the

question you want to see most answered

and the

I've got through something we don't know

what dark matter is and dark energy and

how you go from organic molecules to

self-replicating life that happens

sometime in the early Earth under plenty

I got I got a list of questions but

that's not what keeps me awake at night

mm-hmm

it's the question I don't yet know to

ask because we don't yet stand in the

Vista that allows me to see that

question in the first place and it's

discoveries that continue the continuum

it's the continual parade of discoveries

that don't simply move forward but they

ascend to give you higher and higher

ground to see farther into the universe

and recognize things that you didn't

even know to ask that that I'd lay awake

an iPad and so one of my regrets the day

I die I'll say to myself I wonder what

questions we don't even know to ask yet

and I would have died before I find out

have you answered some life do you feel

like you've kind of know so I had a

predictions a few decades ago I gave and

watch you in Indianapolis upon here when

your speaking engagement whenever one of

yours one of your tours yeah yeah yeah

news clippings from what was the title

of your tour called a mighty Biff is it

reason that's it excellent yep my sister

and I wouldn't watched you that's a

little thank you thank you

so the so was I saying be what have you

learned like what it what do you feel

like are there some questions that

you're like some decades ago in a

research paper I made a prediction that

there ten times as many galaxies in the

universe as our catalogs then record it

and it was some little bit controversial

not deeply controversial but just know

that we don't think so this sort of

telescope show decades later we found

ten times as many galaxies how many

galaxies do we think there are in the

universe

this is silicon so you're so what's a

bazillion what's bazillion times 10 10

bazillions bajillion so the numbers are

fluctuating right but anywhere between a

hundred billion and a half a trillion

galaxies or really of all different

sizes are in the universe and you might

say well how come you don't know it more

precisely not that you ask that but you

might be thinking it between 100 billion

and 500 billion which is a half a

trillion that sounds like you don't

really know the answer however here's

something that hardly anyone appreciates

about astrophysics the range of things

in size temperature pressure is so huge

that if you get something and you're off

by a factor of two you're doing good

yeah yeah because you could have been

off by a factor of a thousand in either

direction some would say okay I'm taller

than you

alright someone said well he brought you

a lot or she thought not compared to

this building out there not appeared to

a Paramecium so to the building and the

Paramecium we're the same size as far as

they're concerned because they're so far

in that range from that size difference

so in the universe there's such a big

range in everything we're content if we

get some within a fact or two then we

move on you know what size thing you

just made me think of that I think is

like blows my mind is that please

clarify all those you know I'm generally

going on but if you took and condensed

all of the atoms down to actual matter

like all the people on earth that's the

size of an apple or something like yeah

yeah so it's kind of blows my math okay

let me let me complete the mind-blowing

please dimension of this okay there's a

guy named first Rutherford he was a New

Zealand physicist and he wondered how

much

there's a nucleus an electron so he took

gold and hammered it very thin gold has

this you this unique property that you

can hammer it's so thin it's almost just

a few atoms thick across that so that's

why this gold flower on there in ancient

times because they can stay together not

only hands together but you can you can

form it you can form it and you don't

have to use very much of it okay and you

can cover things and the whole thing's

very shiny gold you've used real gold

okay so that you can make it Sophia it's

not that expensive okay so that's why

gold is good for it's usually made of

what's holds like for I'm gold-plated

came from exactly exactly exactly

so you he made a gold foil and just sort

of dangled it there and then he fired

particles mm-hmm into this go forth and

he wanted to see how many of them would

get stopped or ricocheted off her will

pass through he expected most to be just

ricocheted up this is you can't see

through the gold one right it is solid

as far as your concern right and 99.99%

of all particles went through as though

nothing was there god I love science

okay well I'm not even done yet mom and

he he freaked out what's going on here

maybe did the particle go in and then

get stopped and in a step another one

come out maybe it's just a transfer

thing know it matter was mostly empty

and he concluded that the space between

the nucleus of an atom and the electrons

is this vast chasm of nothingness and it

is rumored that the next morning when he

woke up he alone knew how empty matter

was he was afraid to step onto the floor

sure to be up in a high-rise ending on

earth lest he fall through the atoms

down to the basement because science

once you know you know you can't know

can't unknow you can't unknow so now if

you want to compress

everything if you want to compress yeah

all the people in the world can press us

down and and fill in all those gaps yeah

yeah I have to do the calculation but

Apple so maybe a maybe a plum yeah we

all just fit into that little ball of

the human race would fit into that

volume so what the hell are we what are

we well I so I think you're over valuing

the the matter part yet matter matters

but the space you occupy includes space

nothing wrong with that

so we're just Stardust we've always been

Stardust and I think the fact that we

have this empty space it's what allows

atoms to do their thing if all that

everything were collapsed into the dense

matter of a nucleus you wouldn't have

atoms its atoms that make molecules and

its molecules that make life so we

should be glad that atoms simply here's

what happens I have one atom here a

nucleus Anna and the electrons flitting

about have another atom in electrons and

the electrons intersect and bind the two

atoms together and you get a molecule if

I get h2o is it because we're like it

being energy cooped up in an atom yeah

there's energy everywhere everywhere

that's why not to make another kind of

leap here in this conversation but we're

going everywhere I think it's

legitimately gotta leap into this so you

can calculate how much chemical energy

is in your body calculate that and that

energy came from the fact that you made

food your whole life food has energy it

also tastes good but it has energy and

you absorb that energy so that you can

build your when you're growing you can

build your body from childhood to

adulthood you in addition you use the

energy just to live to maintain your

body temperature right now the air is

like 73 degrees in this room okay

your body temperature if you're human is

98 and

after green you are sustaining a 36 the

26 degree temperature difference between

your body in this air because of burning

energy in this instant because the

moment you stop burning energy the

moment you die actually this reminds me

of a story about my dog a long time ago

might my dog couldn't maintain his body

temperature anymore and that was a sign

that we knew Wow well so that means your

your your physiology is breaking down

and you can maintain your body's normal

functions and that's a very important

function for a warm-blooded creature to

maintain that body temperature but I can

tell you this if you died then all that

metabolism stops the metabolism is the

converting the the chemical energy into

kinetic energy because you move then

into thermal energy to keep your body

warm so no watch what happens that

instant your body begins to cool cools

down to what temperature what's on its

way towards air temperature that's why

if you go in a funeral parlor if there's

an open casket and you have any people

who actually touches the dead body

what's the first thing everybody says

about it's cold yeah it's actually not

cold it's the same temperatures the

table as the chair as the floor it's the

same campus is that you're not

accustomed to touching skin at table

temperature because skin is 98 point but

well it's usually a degree or so a

little cooler than your inner

temperature but high 90s so the energy

of your body is there and it's working

and it's maintaining your body

temperature against this and so so all

I'm saying is when you die so this is

why I have told people when I die I

don't want to be cremated oh do you know

what happens when you cream in you break

apart the molecules of your body and

release the energy that's what burning

is that's what that is

there's energy in these molecules you

burn it you break it apart your releases

heat so now

your body is ash hmm with no source of

heat left in it and it it it when it

heated the atmosphere and the atmosphere

radiated to space nothing wrong with

that so your body's energy has now

escaped escaped to space so wait a

minute if you bury me however hmm that

same molecular energy it breaks apart by

action of microbes they dine upon my

body I have an energy source available

to it's how you can eat a steak and have

the steak give you energy that's the

future we're dead I mean you want to

still give after your death thank you

that's so kind of you that's spent my

life dining upon flora and fauna right

that is have given their lives for my

sustenance the least I could do on death

is to return the favor to a next

generation of flora and fauna so that

they can thrive in their own lives

through it I have mine so it leads to

this question where do we go when we die

well so I can answer that question as a

so I guess who what are we is the first

question right we have to answer what

are we and then we have to answer where

do we go there that fertile topic but

before I get there I just want to say

scientifically I know I can but like I

said your body has a energy that you've

accumulated your whole life nope all

these molecules you go in the dirt all

that energy is recovered and it goes

back to all the other life-forms far as

science is concerned you're done you're

done so now you're asking but how about

me my spirit energy my soul my

everything that I am yeah well we could

turn to neuroscience okay they're parts

of your brain that are you they're parts

of your brain that if I tickle it or if

I damage it we don't do this you people

come in from head injuries this is this

is the full set of data we have on well

not the

full set now because we have probes and

things but historically how do you know

what part of the brain controls what

it's from head injuries that people had

hmm you got hit over here you got hit

back here you got hit over here there's

a Language Center who's a facial

recognition Center there's the part of

you that is your understanding of self

if those parts of your brain gets

damaged you lose your language you lose

your facial recognition you lose

memories either short-term or long-term

we know these parts of your brain so to

say I am me and that's some special

spiritual entity as far as I can tell

it's electro chemical synapses firing in

your brain got it so it's giving you

this belief that you are something other

than just the chemistry and biophysics

of a brain matter what is making it fire

like what what is the what is the what

is asking it to do things what makes me

think to ask you a question so this is

consciousness and this is a huge

frontier now here's something I would

tell you no one else is gonna tell you

you ready I'm sure everybody's writing

books on a subject

it means we know nothing about it and

the more the literature there is make

sense the less we know about it that's

why people keep writing it go go to the

books if there's still bookstores go to

the bookstore look at the shelf on the

human mind oh the shelf after shelf now

look at this shelf of physics

there's no who does the gravity boom

because what because it is what it is

what is with it we're on to the next

thing we got this so the fact that

everyone and their cousin is writing a

book on consciousness yes evidence of

what we do not yet know I'm just saying

so are you saying that this is the

exciting little frontier spot where

we're at yes conscious what do you think

about consciousness I think about it all

the time and here's how I think about

its why do I wake up every morning as me

and not you

or someone else if we're just

consciousness you're saying if if if I

don't know I'm just saying why is it

that every day I wake up I mean what

makes that that and consider that

identical twins with identical DNA have

separate consciousness consciousness

they're separate they're not the same

people they have different thoughts they

might have similar desires or you know

their twin separated and they will draw

the same color car or whatever with as

they later discover that happens a fine

but I'm talking about

are you hungry in this moment that's

your consciousness telling you this act

in your twin just ate an hour ago your

twin is not having that same thought

this is the big challenge with the with

the transporter and Star Trek if I

disassemble your molecules and

reassemble them over there is your

consciousness part of that if you're

conscious it is even a transferable

entity right I don't know so and let me

ask a more blunt question is

consciousness even the right question to

ask we think it's the right question if

I posed the question what kind of cheese

is the moon made out of and you say yes

be cheese I think it's pretty so so you

don't you start posing and creating

experiments that are designed to test

for cheese but the moon is not made out

of cheese so you asked the wrong

question in the first place not every

question is a legitimate question and

when you're on the frontier you don't

even know what that question is you got

a nice you got a ticket on drum you've

got a tiptoe and ask in little bits is

the moon made of anything is it made of

atoms is it made of rocks what is it

made of how do I test that you got an

inch your way there

otherwise you'll bust out of the doorway

with a question you think it needs an

answer like what is the sound of one

hand clapping well just because you

assembled nouns and verbs

the right sequence to make a legitimate

sentence in the English language does

not make it an authentic sentence worthy

of scientific attention the same when I

think about consciousness I think about

like Neil are you your arms I control my

arms but if you lost them might still be

me that's right what about your heart

well Aristotle thought all emotion was

in the heart here's what I think about

often and that stayed with us through

like the Renaissance until we had some

understanding of brain it was like what

does your heart tell you your heart is

just pumping doesn't know anything about

anything it's left over from a time when

we thought all that our emotional center

was located in our heart that Aristotle

has a big have a lot to do with that

misinformation that misunderstanding so

so I was wondered if Aristotle said your

emotions are in your pancreas then I

wonder if on Valentine's Day images of

the pancreas or some other organ you

know it's just it's just by happenstance

that the heart stayed with us so then

there's there's another sort of you know

so if you if you didn't know from

someone has a pancreas just give it a

chance so it makes me think of chakras

it makes me think of energy centers when

you go into more of the you know Eastern

philosophies of you know the energy

centers of our you know root chakra

you know solar plex crown chakra all the

seven chakras like maybe the heart

operates with those thoughts so it's

that energy center giving you a feeling

do you believe in that so I'm not

convinced I mean I've seen the chakra

charts and other sort of Eastern ways of

observing and thinking about life and

the universe and I let me answer that

two ways I could I could first say

there's no way any bit of science has

ever found a way to justify that that's

too blunt let me be a little more a

little softer and that is it is possible

to have a philosophy about how something

works that's wrong yet there's still

benefit to be obtained from it so what

would be an example of that

what I what's a good example so let's

take the chiropractic for example okay

if you read the foundations of

chiropractic it's like got that right

but I'm writing that down don't ever go

to a chiropractor go look at the charts

that say everything about your body

emanates from spinal column vertebrate

okay you catch a cold there's a blind

into your vertebrae so manipulate the

vertebrae and everything everything is

to look at early writings about the

chiropractic arts okay so what happens

you go to a chiropractor

they you know they pop your back and

they manipulate it and it feels good

whether or not it cured your common cold

let's say about well there are not a

cured your cancer whether or not

anything else happened people still

derive some curative elements from it so

in science what we try to do is extract

what it is they're the essence of what

it is they're doing and only apply that

mm-hmm that's what we try to do it's

very reductionist but that's what it's

how we got civilization reductionist is

there's this whole thing the

reductionist if you're chewing on this

bark and your pain goes away well is it

the bark or is it some chemical in the

bark let me find out oh here's this

chemical it's Alaska it's it's it's it's

a seed of salicylic acid oh my gosh

that's aspirin

aspirin so here his appear is a lump of

bark and here's a pill what are you

gonna do you chew on them are gonna take

the bill I think because I found what's

in the bark that does it but you might

have had a whole philosophy about bark

that the tree has a spirit energy and

the tree that per tree in particular is

touched by the gods and you and it the

gods want you to feel better and to

relieve your pain so the gods put this

special magic potion in the bark and you

chew the bark and you're all better

I found the aspirin here it is go buy it

in the grocery store for two dollars and

so is it sad that I bypass the entire

cultural spiritual rituals of it I don't

think I don't think it's sad I'll tell

you why

look at how many rituals we still

participate in oh yeah and and they're

beautiful and they're sensitive and

they're reflective look at what Jews do

in in Passover there's a seder and in

the seder they leave an empty seat for

Elijah in Casey and had to unlock the

front door in case Elijah shows up at

your seder do they really think that's

gonna happen I don't think they really

think Elijah's coming I'm pretty sure

they're not let that person in but but

the ritual of it can be very communal

and there's so much of what binds us

socially that derives from ritual be it

religious ritual or some other cultural

ritual do you we play the national

anthem at the beginning of games that

kind of binds us all at the beginning of

sporting events if the Canadiens are

there we also play the Canadian national

anthem we you take off your hat you

salute you you hug on certain holidays

you Thanksgiving we have Turkey yes I'm

not here to judge the value of those

rituals scientifically I'm here to

celebrate the value

those rituals culturally I don't have a

problem this kind of gets me into the

fields oh by the way there's some sorry

so to interrupt no go for it oh don't

lose I thought there's some rituals that

might be hurtful to you

sure okay and ice why withdraw the wine

I say if my region let's do that if it's

hurtful to you or to myself I want

someone to step in

I'd want someone to theirs in Catholic

there's some Catholic and traditions

particularly in central South America

where an Easter people will go on their

knees in the way that Jesus was carrying

the cross to suffer and like Jesus

suffered and I thought Jesus suffer so

we don't have to suffer i man no meat on

Friday was enough right yeah so no it's

not just no meat on Friday fish on

Friday because they were in that place

when that rule came in it was the

fishermen were not getting as much

business as the rest of the food

producers and the Pope got his message

from God that one day we can have to eat

fish so it's not a no meat day it's a

fish day so you are still eating dead

animals but it kept the fisherman yeah

so that's how you get messages god man I

thought it was because meat was a luxury

it's like so like pulling back from the

luxury it's always been a luxury for

sure it's very expensive to produce meat

right so then what the hell did Moses

what what's the deal with Moses well

knowing that take a man who says thou

shalt not eat meat on Friday maybe

that's in the 11th through the 15th

commandment that have lost all typically

where did his information come from for

the Ten Commandments well so what's

interesting to me is you know people

people need rules

yeah without rules you know it's sad

that we need rules but it's not that we

need rules well of course we need rules

but we need threat of punishment for not

following rules and for some people I

think prison isn't enough right and so

if

there's a higher power above us all that

could damn you to hell for eternity that

might keep you in line okay my issue

with the Ten Commandments was that like

why is that shalt not kill like number

six I'm thinking that should have been a

little higher big of a deal is killing

or or graven images or one God first you

know I'm thinking this up that a little

if I were dead if I had my druthers plus

depending on which version of the Bible

you use thee the commandments are not

exactly in the same order as each other

so there's some various but in none of

them is that's what I kill number one

yet that is the highest level

transgression we have in modern

societies so we have made a judgment on

the rest of the command saying no we

don't really care about the graven image

no don't bear false witness that's a bad

thing but we're not gonna punish shoot

and damned you forever for that so human

element humans decided marijuana was

illegal until recently till it was not

it's just a human decision right so

morality is actually this moving target

I want to claim that it's a bounced it

back and forth target but morality if

you look over time has evolved to be

sort of not in every place of course but

we're always evolved to be more

inclusive and more forgiving and more

accommodating and so so more Allium it's

a huge philosophical frontier where do

you get morality from and many people

will say like it we get it from my

religion no you actually don't you

actually don't

what you've done is cherry-picked your

religion and pick the things that make

most sense in modern society and they

say I get my morality from religion well

you did you use secular reasoning to

filter out so many of the statements

that are made in the Bible especially

the Old Testament for example where you

know it's if your children disobey you

you should stone them well no we're not

doing that

we're not i'm sovereignty

the jail threat okay by the way mom and

dad that's the gym okay we would we are

not going to stone our children yeah

before disobeying us we will now they

say no one happened let's go to the next

one

okay if by the way this section of the

Bible is in Leviticus also contains the

one where you shouldn't be homosexual

okay this is the same section of the

Bible that says you know you should

stone your children if they disobey okay

so we are you a cherry-picking right and

so what's happened and plus the Bible

was used to justify slavery why because

nowhere in the Bible older New Testament

is slavery objected to it is passive or

supportive in its attitudes towards

slavery so what so most of what

justified slavery over so many years

came from people's readings of Scripture

there are some other readings of

Scripture where you got to go to the New

Testament for this and you got to go to

Jesus and it's do you want to others

there's doing you know there's this sort

of the Golden Rule kind of thing and

other ways to think about the Quakers

were totally anti ed Quakers are

Christian totally anti-slavery from the

get-go

mmm-hmm from the get-go and they were

driven by religious means and you have

the whole civil rights movement which

had a secular atheistic dimension to it

but that was not talked up in the press

a philip Randolph and others they were

atheists someone who even like communist

atheist communists who were there for

the worker and workers rights and this

not the not the capitalist right so that

the workers right Martin Luther King was

the one that the press focused on

because we were there's still a cold war

and you can't have heroes who are

sympathizers with the Communist Party so

so Martin Luther King gets the the

positive attention from the press but

but he gets his roots from the Bible and

and this so so you you're cherry-picking

to suit what your needs are at the top

you know a lot about the Bible what a

transmat new tests kind of blowing my

being a scientist so you're gonna have

to explain to me how you know so much

I tell you why yeah please I was minding

my own business

just doing my astrophysics okay really

I was just I was just mind my own

business in the corner I got my calculus

books and bikes all right and people

would come up to me and say calculus I

want you to make sure you know that okay

do you be a little more comfortable with

infinity if you took calculus okay see

there you go can I afford a private

tutor big calculate a private calculus

tutor and you'll come out of that saying

I'm good with infinity so people started

asking me as you study the universe have

you found God does studying the universe

make you closer to God I think any dude

out there or so no just spiritually

philosophically are you yes some might

wonder if it's literal behind the moon

so so I would have answers but I

realized if I'm an educator I can't just

give any answer off-the-cuff it needs to

be informed it needs to be researched

knowledge is power it needs to be I need

to do my homework before I start

speaking on this topic and respect so I

started buying the books like but you

know the Torah and so that's just purely

the Old Testament I translated of course

does I can't beat Hebrew and then I got

the you know King James Newton you know

New Testament and then I got modern

translations of the New Testament that

use modern language and then I got a now

assist of the Bible's and then I got yes

well I mean I mean I said I know what's

in and I went to some yeah passages that

are more I mean they're places you don't

this there's the whole section of the

Bible where's who begat who that's not

scintillating reading so you skip over

that I'm sorry it's okay

okay I'm forgiving you producer for

giving me away with your information

about the Bibles okay so you find places

a place in the Bible for example where

the value of pi equals three point zero

what do they got it wrong yeah yeah they

got it wrong

yeah they tell you why I have to in in 1

Kings 7 that part of the Bible they're

describing King Solomon's property the

castle and the his palace and the

surrounding grounds and there's a pond

there and here's the statement you ready

the pond is round on all sides 30 cubits

around 10 cubits across the value of pi

is the ratio of the circumference of a

circle to its diameter so 30 divided by

10 goes 3.0 now had they said 31 cubits

around because fractions and decimals

weren't a big thing but and 10 cubits

across they would be much better they've

got 3.1 and it's a hey they got a fig

they got an understanding there and the

best estimates of PI of the day what's

not much different but there was a

better estimate of Pi than 3.0 the

Babylonians have 3.14 and that preceded

the writing of that section of the Bible

so my only place so I've learned all of

this and so now when people start asking

me do I see God do I know God well how

do I know the science is long and the

Bible is right which is which I can

engage that conversation in an informed

and I'd like to even declare respectful

way I'm not here to bash people I'm here

to just share pic with people what is

objectively true in the world are you

spiritual so that's good cuz right was

religious yes I would I use versus like

the Mart is like the fastest growing

community to community I'm a cult leader

so these are people who these are people

who spiritual people

I wouldn't call them spiritualists

because those in a day were people who

talk to dead talk to the dead

so our spirits of spiritual mediums they

would talk so if you are spiritual today

that means you feel there's something

out there beyond what we know could be a

god but you're not affiliated with any

organized religion that is the

fastest-growing

oh but so let me back that up people not

affiliated with any religion would

include atheists that's the fastest

growing community

I saw a religion called um nism is omnes

'm which is the belief that there is

that none of the no religions are true

but there's truth within all of them

mmm-hmm I would say that's me I kind of

I've always been very skeptical okay but

now you have to go you have to visit

each religion and find out what is true

- and then staple all that together to

get your organism and that's hard let me

back up I can tell you certain things

that are objectively false the earth is

not 6,000 years old I got this one okay

why do people have denial about like the

science of the age of the earth or age

of the you know how long humans have

been around and there's I have thought a

lot about this and I've concluded there

are three truths

yes I'm ready yeah three truths okay are

you ready yes all right sorry the three

kinds of truths not three answers okay

hmm one time truth is an objective truth

this is what is researched and

established by the methods and tools of

science this is what is true whether or

not you believe in it it's how we make

electricity work

it's how the physics of your cars you

drive works

it's how earth moves around the Sun it's

how energy from the Sun powers the

ecosystem and the biosphere those are

objective truths you

you can argue it but it won't matter if

you argue it it's true whether or not

you argue it's it's your it's your you

know okay so in the bookstore correct

second kind of truth it's a personal

truth these are truths that are true to

you they are true down in your bones

Jesus is your Savior Muhammad is your

prophet these you know this is true no

matter what and no one is going to take

it from you at least not in a free

society no one is going to take that

from our religion and our religious or

faiths and our our beliefs in our faiths

are constitutionally protected conduct

of American citizens it's what attracted

so many immigrants over the decades

where they were the religion was

persecuted where they were and they come

here they knew they wouldn't be

persecuted okay hence the religious

melting pot that we actually are okay

so that's your truth but watch what

happens the only way you can get me to

share that truth is by some intense bout

of persuasion or by threat of force

violence or death I have a different

personal truth than you do you require

that I share your personal truth we will

go to war over that you know why because

my personal truth tells me that your

personal truth is false mm-hmm most

religions its most monotheistic really

the great monotheistic religions have as

part of their tenant that other

religions are false right

so each one says the other one is false

and curiously our country protects that

it allows you to say that your belief is

true and everyone else is false and it

allows me to say the same damn thing

about you so you live in a community

where your folks are and you go to your

worst place of worship on Saturday or

Sunday and I go to

I pray five times a day to Mecca I do

that with my community and by the way we

both work together in the same office

okay historically you didn't have places

like the United States and whole legions

would fight the Crusades the just look

at what people did to each other because

their personal truths were not shared by

others yes yes but yes yes it used to be

a daily thing now we have wars over you

know access to resources and things well

yeah well and some other Dogma that

might have arisen like Nazism or you

know that you can have Dogma oh but

Dogma is equally as bad yes sorry

dogma can drive you to war just as

readily as strongly held religious

beliefs because Dogma is this is true no

matter what you tell me yeah and that

doesn't have to involve God that you'd

involve any other strong beliefs strong

belief

okay it means you're not susceptible to

conversation and a new idea that could

put you in a new place you are sealed

off from arguments of reason so that's a

personal truth there's a third kind of

truth it's a political truth this is

what you think is true because someone

repeated it to you often enough

programming program it's correct

what's finally watched the program for

the programming what is Hillary's first

name crooked Hillary told me the TV

totally so what I will say about these

three truths is in a pluralistic country

the pluralistic land if you are going to

make laws that apply to everyone it

seems to me you should base them on what

is objectively true and not is on any

one person's personal truth which would

then affect everybody else who doesn't

share

personal booty hmm and if you put it on

a political quote truth mm-hmm then that

will blow like the breeze some other

power rises up and they don't have

something else and now that person who

used to be your friend is now your enemy

let me tell political truths can evolve

the Republicans are not historically I

mean in in recent decades not known for

being cuddly with minority groups okay

if you look at how minority groups vote

generally it's not Republican yeah you

could say why well the policies are

might conflict with ideas Dada Dada not

fine do you know the first Republican

president was no oh he knows Abraham

Lincoln yeah Abraham Lincoln friend of

the slaves hmm Abraham Lincoln's the

first Republican president the

Republicans were the anti-slavery party

while the Democrats were perfectly fine

keeping slaves yeah lovely way to go no

wait a minute so what happens the South

had all the slaves so the slot the South

is not going to be Republican the South

with Democrats and they were Democrats

from the Civil War for a hundred years a

hundred years in the South they had Jim

Crow they had segregation they had all

of that and they were just fine with it

and from the 1960 through basically

President Reagan in the 1980s that

flipped the Republicans saw that they

can get a stronghold in the south by

altering their policies and saying yeah

we don't really wanna the Equality here

or whatever it was and keep this going

and they one-by-one they absorbed the

the Dixiecrats the Dixie Democrats

became Republicans

so I'm saying if you're gonna base your

life on political truths know that

someone else is defining for you what it

is you think is right and wrong and what

is true or not and as a academic and

especially as a scientist I don't want

anybody else doing my thinking for me

and political truths are someone else

telling you what to think and how to

think do you think I'm screaming at you

here I'm so yeah no it's good you know

it's some passion I love it just is so

anybody you think we need to think more

for ourselves I feel like I feel like

there's this is a wave of coming it's

kind of it's it's it's spirituality it's

hot buttons it's like think for

ourselves a little bit more do you feel

this do you think this is a good thing

I'd rather I agree but I'd rather say it

differently okay yeah you'd rather than

say think for yourself because sometimes

there's an expert who knows more about

something than you

okay and if you have reason to trust

that person you trust them okay if this

building is on fire and what was with 14

flights up and I say there's a sheet

over there and we can strap it to the

thing we could jump out the window and

glide to that thing

I bet you'll believe me because I'm

trained in physics and I know something

about eridan up you don't say oh no I

don't believe I don't okay goodbye

how'd you work out my race card for all

the physics that you know and so there's

the points where yes you'll trust

someone without having to question it

but I those extreme that's obviously a

contrived example but what you should do

is when someone is speaking to you a

pundit you should not just believe

everything they say you should wonder if

everything they say is true and use it

as an excuse to go back and do a google

search or go check on that statement or

go check on all of these things mm-hmm

and the act of checking you end up

learning yeah why is it that we live in

a world where no matter what grade

you're in

the last day of school in May or in June

you run down I'm stereotyping here you

run down the steps

toss your books in the air and say

school's out yeah you're glad I did that

very thing that school is out yeah you

are you what did we do to you in school

so that when school is out you glad

you're not in school

something is wrong what I want to have

happen is what we do in school is such

that on the last day school you say

school's out makes me I can't have to go

three months without learning anything

it's the only job in school is to learn

knowledge is power I believe that and

this reminds me of how I feel about food

when people like oh gosh I'm on a diet I

have to eat this healthy food all I want

is the pancakes in my cheat meal it's

like how about you change your psyche a

little bit and go man this is delicious

I'm gonna put a little of this seasoning

on it we have like the wrong thought

process for some things that we have now

culturally convinced ourselves that

certain things are good certain things

are bad when all we need to do is change

our point of perception that is true for

so many things and let me tell you my

thoughts about food I'm disturbed that's

too heavy a word I'm concerned that in

America we view food that has high

calories as bad when most of this world

does not even get their minimum calories

in a day we are so wealthy yes we have

so much access to food that a high

calorie food is considered bad and I

cringe every time I see that in here

because I think of empowerment is

millions what the number I forgot the

number

but it's millions nothing children

starve to death either big out of them

because not enough food or because of

malnutrition that comes from having not

having enough food like you can die just

because your your body eats its own

calorie content and they just drop dead

or you can be malnourished and then

you're susceptible to diseases that are

opportunistic under those situations I'm

telling you the United States might be

the only country in the world that has

overweight homeless people but they're

getting plenty of calories okay the

donuts are doing them just fine yeah and

so I is another thing I sensitive to

people who can't help themselves for

whatever reason whatever they got the

wrong hand dealt or they they need

motivation the people that step over

homeless person to go help a stray dog

there's a homeless human being that's

your species sitting right here that you

just ignored what are you doing now

don't get me wrong I love me some dogs

okay but if I have to rank how I'm going

to invest my time and energy and

resources it's gonna be to help people

and in there sure I'll help a couple of

dogs I don't have a problem with that so

what I'm gonna saying oh there's a dog

in trouble they're not even see the

homeless person oh my gosh

so it's an Outlook thing and I'll only

give here's what I do it just as a

matter of policy if I go to a restaurant

I eat well at a restaurant and I have a

doggie bag

mm-hm if I pass a homeless person they

get in a doggie bag yeah no matter how

expensive that food was were like

leftovers I can't wait for tomorrow

morning stakes knowing your ass exactly

exactly know it goes in the lap of the

homeless person but if I have my choice

of homeless person who's going to the

fittest person I see who's in the most

need right so yes outlook I think is

everything what are some other things

that you're passionate about make it be

they could be passions like that that

you you know it's not necessarily about

stars in the dark matter but you know

what other things

I guess I'm seeking what sounds like

it's passion but it's really just an

interest a deep interest yeah maybe this

passion

I'd like you know I like old books No

okay like okay get that get that digital

book reader out of here oh me too yeah

all the way you know do you realise a

physical book never runs out of

batteries did you know that ever it's

still there it even smells unique and

cool people ride unum it's fun I I have

books I I collect books they go back in

time that that capture a moment in our

collective thinking where we that pivot

in a moment in our collective thinking

where we have a new understanding of the

universe or our our place within the

universe and this allows me it's

humbling because you see the struggle

that's that people went through to get

something that we today just take for

granted yeah as though the knowledge on

wiki pages is handed down from on high

no somebody figured that out and it's

staying around here's the thing that

scares me about digital it's a click

away from being gone I think about my

bank account I'm like oh sure I don't

know what was the last book you read

uh-oh

so I I dip into a lot of books in

different ways but I think the last book

I read so I have several going right now

but the last book I finished was a book

I'd actually read long ago but I read it

again and it's Barry Goldwater's the

conscious of her conservative look at

you did she go into the conscious step

no but it's just it's just the brought

to mind uh because that's really what it

should have the conservative yeah yes so

Barry Goldwater was you know a very well

known and popular conservative

politician in the United States who

actually ran and lost four grand for

president and lost and this is during

the Cold War so in this book he's trying

to say what that conservative thinking

is better than liberal thinking and it's

better than communism I just I'd like

knowing how other people think sure I

would classify myself as

liberal in most ways that matters

socially

yeah probably fiscally centrist I would

say I'd like learning how conservative

people think and how they make decisions

and what's interesting people say tell

me all the books on your shelf and

they're expecting books to be all the

stuff that I already agree with that's

very smart of you what's always on the

other side I read it all the time that's

why I have a shelf of Bibles I have a

shelf of UFO sightings

I have a shelf of all don't worry I

won't ask universe

oh nice no nice of you I saw it and I

have I haven't read it yes yes a guy

from up at MIT I think wrote that or is

or is there another author do you

remember the author of this one um I

can't remember oh yeah so holographic

universe that's very freaky it's freaky

stuff that we might just be a

two-dimensional hologram like some other

reality I think the universe has told us

that anything that is possible may just

be likely and yeah we could just be

information contained in a membrane

surrounding some other volume and we

it's the illusion of a reality but in

fact we're just this holographic

projection of information yeah it's deep

it's very I mean like it took me a while

to read completely deep it's very

interesting and it makes you think it

makes you think in new ways about the

mind it makes you think about the power

of the mind really which is something

that's very intriguing to watch so let

me let me just this but really the power

of the mind let me disavow of that if I

may yeah okay yeah we figured out a lot

of stuff we've got art and music and

poetry in the Hubble telescope beeping

we've walked on the moon the human mind

is something else okay

do you know our closest genetic

relatives

yes you do yeah just say it yeah chimps

chimpanzees okay chimpanzees 99 and a

half percent identical DNA done yeah

yeah so why do they have every muscle

and every bone in the same place that we

do and they're comfortable you cross

your legs they're comfortable crossing

their legs sitting there and mean

another thing they have an itch they

scratch it you want to call it they call

okay

except they like termites and weird

stuff too okay I'm gonna ask you what

you going out of there so so the urge

and this is our ego doing this the urge

is to say what a difference that one and

a half percent makes it may be as low as

1% but it's small I don't remember the

exact number but it's what a difference

that one person it makes we have

civilization and the smartest chimpanzee

can stack boxes to reach a banana our

toddlers can figure that out I've seen

young children stack things well okay so

maybe allow me to pose you this question

maybe the difference between the human

and the chimpanzee at the 1% DNA is the

same small difference as between

stacking boxes to reach a banana and the

Hubble Space Telescope you're saying no

come on how could what do you say

obviously the telescope is much more

advanced than a monkey chimp figuring

out to stack box up you tell me you're

tend to say that okay now here's the

thought experiment imagine an oak

now here here's a simple sentence ready

okay Danika here you're flying back to

LA tomorrow you catch up a plane you fly

United out of Newark or wherever you

land five hours later and you have a

dinner engagement with friends at your

favorite restaurant okay use nothing in

that scent

that would make sense to a chimpanzee

what is an airplane what is you know 10

o'clock in the morning

what is it restaurant what the food just

comes to you what what is that where did

it come from what oh you have a whole

supply chain from farms and then the

chip would have no idea and that is the

simplest sentence you would other in the

day yeah okay

now imagine a life form and ambien even

I don't care some life form that is one

percent beyond us in DNA then we are

beyond the chimp the smartest of us

would be brought forth by this species

and they'll say but the role Stephen

Hawking forward and say this one is

slightly smarter than all the other

humans because he can do astrophysics

calculations in his head like little

Timmy over here who just came home from

alien preschool Oh Timmy isn't that key

you just derive principles of calculus

put it on the refrigerator Oh their

simplest thoughts would be in yeah

conceivable yeah to the most brilliant

human beings at only 1% difference in

DNA suppose were 5% 10% 50% a hundred

percent so I will not walk forward and

say look how smart we are I will not do

that

I rather wallow in how smart were not

relative to how smart we could be now we

have an advantage because we communicate

you can benefit from calculations done

by engineers and physicists who came

before you to drive a car fast you don't

have to invent that yourself there are

books

hmm Kindles today and they pass that

information forward Isaac Newton

invented calculus basically on a dare

and he did it before he turned 26 just

by the way by the way by the way so

we get to bankroll his his advances and

then they think of his rungs on a ladder

he built that with that rung right there

now I can climb up step on that and put

in the next ladder rung on the ladder

and then someone after me and someone

after them so our our species

collectively may be able to transcend

itself transcend the individual so do

you so if we can let's go let's go down

let's go down the alien path here okay

it's time so you talked about the 1% and

what if there was another species that

was 1% beyond and let's call that

another 1% do you believe that the

there's two parts of this that the human

body becomes something different a

different form as it evolves into DIF on

different to the 1% more 1% more 1% more

and then the second part of is do you

think that we're looking for the wrong

damn thing in space we're looking for us

but we live in this perfect environment

right this ecosystem that is used to

striving the cosmos like one little

thing changes and then something else

nothing exists here and it's all about

the air quality I mean a call of that

stuff matters critically to the life on

Earth so are we looking for the wrong

thing alright so our body is pretty

irrelevant to our brain when you're just

figuring stuff out mm-hmm I mean the

best evidence of that is Stephen Hawking

okay yeah these clothes yep yeah I win

that argument we got it so so so the

evolution of the body I don't think is

even relevant it's the evolution of the

mind that would get you to these new

places this extra 1% or 1% beyond that

or 1% beyond that you'd be nice if we

had eight limbs but we don't be nice if

we could regenerate limbs by the way

we're not some model of evolution news

can regenerate limbs noose if they if

they wrote The Tree of Life look they

put themselves at the top say we can

reach all those poor humans they lose a

limb they stuck that for the rest of

their lives

if we

owls we said we can fly in those poor

humans those suckers they canvas and

there did such crappy visions since they

need to wear these things on their eyes

just a sad thing what 10th as well as we

do you don't have sonar out of the box

bats or like you know sonar exactly so

so the mind is what would have to evolve

it now are we looking for the wrong

thing I don't think so

we are made with carbon-based life mmm

carbon on the periodic table of elements

which you may remember from chemistry

class periodic table carbon is the

stickiest of all the elements it can

make more kinds of molecules than all

other kinds of atoms combined Wow so if

you were to pick one atom off of that

table and base the diversity of life on

it it would be Cardinal it gives you the

most variation the most options the most

experiments are we looking for carbon

another planet well turns out carbon is

one of the most abundant elements in the

universe where the hell are all the

people not only that we've got oxygen in

us and nitrogen we are made out of the

most common ingredients there's a graph

I have that I saw that it shows the

percentage of what we have of each each

thing like my words thing this much

percent oxygen this much percent carbon

this percent yep phosphorus and that's

the most common ingredients in the

universe mm-hmm which is why we Stardust

it's know we start us not only that's an

aspect of why we're Stardust we're

Stardust because those elements the

heavy elements in particular the carbon

the nitrogen the oxygen the iron are

made in the cores of stars that explode

scatter that enrichment across the

galaxy allowing the next generation of

stars to have those elements that can

make planets and life so it's not simply

that we are in this universe the

universe is in us

yes we are not it's not just poetically

true it is literally true that we are

Stardust and so when we look for life in

the universe it's not unrealistic to

look for carbon-based life it's just not

it's and plus we have an example of it

here so how many of other ways might

there be to be alive there could be many

but if you have a limited budget and can

design only one experiment are you gonna

pluck at random one of these hundred

ways that life might be alive that

you've never tested before that you'll

have any evidence on are we gonna try

the one way we know that life does exist

so we wish self-aware of that limitation

but it's not a crazy limitation to to

operate on it's not so are aliens real

probably there's no reason we life

started on earth pretty quickly with

almost as quickly as the environment

allowed we have self-replicating life I

love about to about a hundred million

years I love the in the cosmos how you

go to the calendar

well the cosmic calendar I think that

traces back to the original cosmos with

Carl Sagan yeah yeah you know I know you

know Carl Sagan you have a good store

what's uh how did you tell me the story

about Carl Sagan because there's a

cosmos - coming out - right yeah yeah

we're still looking for a date for that

actually technically cosmos three that's

one's three Testament New Testament

cosmos - well get biblical about it fine

okay so yeah I was in high school I was

a geeky kid I knew you know I knew my

high school you're an astrophysicist

it's okay okay just be frank about it

okay ABB's oh you're very funny my high

school counts eight Nobel laureates

among its graduates what would you want

some of the water

which is the same as the country of

Spain so jump to saying so this is a

this is a fertile environment all right

it's not because the teachers

necessarily it's because realize how

much how much down time you spend doing

nothing between classes you know chasing

a love interest or you know throwing

high school now hormones are raging your

you know what else your study hall but

you're not really studying it's

lunchtime you're talking about at that

school we're talking about who might

have an equation named after them in the

downtime that's uh that's obviously that

doesn't make any sense that's just like

not even in the spectrum of thought it's

great it's great officially all of

humanity it's crazy and not only that is

how old I am I was uh the youngest

person who was formally trained in a

slide rule in us what is it slide rule

so this is this thing that helps you

calculate before calculators oh god

before calculators there was this device

somebody there before calculus yes there

was a beast BC before calculators no ecc

so there's a device that has the sliding

sliders in it and and they're it's

highly the numbers all throughout this

isn't an abacus isn't no no no it's way

better than a NAPA hey Cathy but not as

good as a calculator and so you slide

these AC I want to multiply 387 by 28

and you'd slide these things and you you

can get the answer okay it's called a

sliding one the bigger the slide rule

the more nuance your numbers can be

because you can then read between the

tick marks okay so in my high school Wow

you walk down the car door you know if

you had the biggest slide rule you a

badass okay because you put have it in a

holster can't carry anything else I came

in leather holsters I attach it to your

belt oh my god

you're not Brad to be the coolest gig

ever wait a minute

so so I'm in high school

and I apply to colleges and so I'm

admitted to this set of colleges which

includes Cornell and I've known since I

was nine through eleven that I'd like

that the universe in fact the universe

was calling me I had nothing to do with

it now high side note I had no choice

thank you so I'm there and I get a

letter in the mail from Carl Sagan he

was already famous he had been on The

Tonight Show he didn't get done cosmos

but he was already famous mm-hmm and I

got a letter from Crossout he didn't

know I don't know this man what is this

what it's cool I'll write some paper a

theory

Lotso Lotso Lotso I did write a paper

and published in the journal my senior

and ice of the Bronx High School of

Science

I was energy of a physical sideshow but

that's not relevant to this there's just

more geeky stuff that one does in high

school okay oh by the way just so you

know in that high school is is it's

actually a regular high school just

shifted towards the geek end of the

spectrum sounds really regular so we had

we had jocks but they were geek jocks

that we had geeky people but they were

really really geeky people so and we had

bullies but they would geek bullies you

know where'd you fall in

I was geek jock good job yeah what'd you

play I wrestled I was undefeated I'm

captain of the team dang well that's

that high school got to college not so

much get to college wrestle these boys

from Nebraska oh yeah

okay we've got another situation so I

say call that farm strong farm strong

very good very good so I knew when when

I was not in the right what they're

asking in calm but no I still wrestle

because I didn't care that I want I just

enjoy the sport and I joined knowing

that if you lost it's because they were

better than you and you can know what to

do you can't blame it on anybody is what

it is you okay so why did I take that

hold diverse oh so I'm there in high

school I get the ladder from Carl site

opened up it says dear Neil the

admissions office showed me your

application to college and knowing that

they admitted you I want to help you

decide whether you want to come to

Cornell would you like to come visit my

labs when you said you'd come to the

interview with me I'm like so I'd love I

did double-check Mike he's known his way

right so I I'd like doing people's

podcasts in their early days I love

doing it okay just to just to help earth

more places where people can learn and

hear intelligent conversation held by

curious talented people so I just like

helping to birth people's podcasts so I

Carl took you on as a young

that's what us so here's what oh by the

way I only now learned that you came to

one of my public talks and so just so

you know it's authentic that this

interest is real it's not just okay well

she was a fan I guess I guess I'd better

know it was pure just want you to know

okay so I so I wrote him back as he yeah

but yeah so I visited him he met me

outside there was a weekend and it was a

look like who's gonna snow this is ethic

in New York or it snows all the time

most think 11 months of the year 11 11

and a half months of the year snowing

and cloudy so I'm very taking up to the

to my app shows me the lab shows in the

department I'm

in his office and this was the coolest

thing oh my gosh he doesn't even look

back

he's behind his desk and he reaches

behind him and pulls out a book and as

one of the books he wrote I said that's

badass

I'm sorry that's just badass you know

you have to look and a book you pick out

is and he signed it to me says dear

near-future astronomer I still have that

book and at the end he's taking me back

to the bus station it actually began to

snow and he says look if the bus doesn't

come through here's my home phone you

come spend the night with my family and

leave in the morning could the bus no

said that the bus didn't come first

people told me but no I was more honest

than that then my lesson from that was

that because I said to myself if I'm

ever as remotely famous as Carl Sagan I

will treat students the way he has

treated me and I could be on the phone

you know Barack okay I got to call you

back I got a student you know at the

door and and eventually I'd written

enough books so that and so when I'm in

the presence of students it's a sense of

duty and obligation I don't like that

word cuz it sounds like it's a chore but

it's a sense of duty is a better word

where the torch of science has to be

carried forward lest it become

extinguished and we live in the darkness

so then I know I've taken a lot of your

time and I think this is a good lead-in

to like the final thought final kind of

question although I have more like never

mind but that's for part two but what is

the point of all this

you know what is the point you say

you're you you want to give back to

students and that's important to you

what is the point of life are you really

asking what is the meaning of life or is

your question what difference to you

what are we here to do yeah you feel

called to help people you feel oh no I

can't I feel called to to discover the

universe but in there if someone wants

to also do that yeah I feel compelled

but if no one else wanted to do it I

don't I'm not gonna force anyone to like

the universe no but if you like it or if

because I said something you do want to

do science yeah I feel some duty I feel

some some sense of accountability for

someone's interests if they saw cosmos

and then they want to assign things I so

I feel some responsibility there well

then maybe the first question is how do

we how do we take science and how do we

make sure that that stays relevant

relevant and expanding so what we need

is a reality show where you get someone

who's in denial of science then

overnight you take everything out of

their life it's a space program and

thermal physics and electric electrical

engineering and so there it is you I

think earth is flat okay so you don't

get to fly in an airplane because you

might fly off the edge of the earth okay

so you will travel nowhere don't get me

started so I think we need a reality

show where we take science away from

science deniers and what you do is you

have to put a limit to that because

there's a level at which you can take

away science would they would just be

dead they would have died in childbirth

they would have died of some curable

disease so you say I'm gonna be nice to

you and not take away so much science

that you'd be six feet under right now

so I don't I just made that up on the

spot mm-hmm but yeah it's a problem what

you need is

people who are in charge because in a

free country

it's your right should not be

scientifically literate at all just

don't control anything that can affect

the health wealth and security of other

people because innovations in science

technology engineering and math will be

the roots of the future of our health

wealth and security if you don't know

that you might as well just move back to

the cave because that's where we're

gonna be anyway

now why are we alive why we here what's

the point here's some motivation for you

okay got my pen back huh all right the

human genome can combine in trillions of

ways to make a human what that means is

well so now put a pin in that how many

humans have ever been born latest

estimates it's about 80 billion

trillions is a way bigger number than 80

billion mm-hmm okay

taking a cue from a passage in a book

written by Richard Dawkins the biologist

evolutionary biologist one day we're all

gonna die

in this sad when someone dies however

not enough of us spend time celebrating

the fact that we were alive at all we as

individuals are collectively at all

individually you are lucky that you get

to die because ktml active most humans

who could ever exist never will

there's been more i think i've heard you

say it there's been more humans that

have not come into existence than do

exist

by far and so the fact that you existed

all is against stupefying odds of who

gets born and who does not realizing

this you are you I am me we are alive we

get to die and to get to die means you

get to live any moment you spend

squandering those moments you are alive

does disrespect to all those who will

never even be born so every day I wake

up I've got I want to make the world a

better place today for my having been in

this world than it was yesterday I want

to learn something new which empowers me

to make decisions that are more nuanced

deeper more informed than I could have

made yesterday and I want to celebrate

being alive even if you are sick even if

you are terminal you still got to live

when trillions of people will never even

be born so live every one of those

moments

tell me now what would be your greatest

celebration of being alive tell me what

your celebration would look like what's

your best day like give me like

fireworks of like no no here I'm alive

here it is you ready me that assumes

it's what that's captured in one moment

yeah but if that no but it's the sum of

it all the sum of it all so here's gonna

be my happiest moment and I won't even

be alive to see it but they chisel my

tombstone

my sister has written in her notes what

I wanna let you my tombstone and it's a

quote from the great educator Horace

Mann and it is be ashamed to die until

you have scored some victory for you

you very inspirational now now the

universe is inspirational I'm just

channeling that fact well it's been

something that's been always intriguing

to me and overwhelmingly amazing I'm

honored and flattered that you came to

one of my talks thank you

oh and I mean the cosmos was like a mind

expansion education on where we came

from the simplicity down to the

subatomic level all the way there and I

loved it and I can't wait for cosmos

three thank you like to meet you thank

you so much that's not gonna save our

life those swinging to say that again

now be ready for it

there you go okay thanks thanks Neil

thanks everybody for listening to the

pretty intense podcast today I hope you

enjoyed it and also thank you so much
